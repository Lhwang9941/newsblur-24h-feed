LA Mayor calls on Olympic Games chairman to step down over Ghislaine Maxwell links
Wasserman has denied having a personal or business relationship with Epstein

Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass on Monday said Casey Wasserman should step down as chairman of the committee organizing the 2028 Olympic Games following revelations of his interactions with convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell.
Files published by the U.S. Justice Department late last month included flirty email exchanges from more than two decades ago between Wasserman and Maxwell, the former girlfriend of the late Jeffrey Epstein, a convicted sex offender.
Wasserman has denied having a personal or business relationship with Epstein. He has previously apologized for his association with Maxwell, saying their relationship came before her or Epstein's crimes were revealed.
The board of LA28 last week said Wasserman would stay on as chairman after a review found his relationship with Epstein and Maxwell did not go beyond what had already been publicly documented.
"My opinion is that he should step down," Bass said in an interview with CNN.
"That's not the opinion of the board."
The board determined that 23 years ago, before Wasserman or the public knew of Epstein and Maxwell's crimes, Wasserman and his then-wife flew on a humanitarian mission to Africa on Epstein's plane at the invitation of the Clinton Foundation.
LA28 said this was his single interaction with Epstein and shortly after, he exchanged the emails with Maxwell.
The board praised Wasserman's "strong leadership" in running LA28 over the past decade.
Bass said she does not have the power to fire Wasserman and her focus is on preparing the city to host the Games.
"The board made a decision," she said. "I think that decision was unfortunate, I don't support the decision. I do think that we need to look at the leadership."
"However, my job as mayor of Los Angeles is to make sure that our city is completely prepared to have the best Olympics that has ever happened in Olympic history," she said.
"So my focus is a little different, but the behavior of Maxwell, what they were involved in is abhorrent, and it's an issue that I've worked on for a long time."
Last week, The Wall Street Journal reported that Wasserman was putting his talent and marketing agency up for sale, telling employees that he felt he had "become a distraction" to its work and had begun the process of selling the company.

D66 loses junior finance minister over misleading CV
One of the candidate junior ministers in the new Dutch government has withdrawn, following claims in the Volkskrant newspaper that she had exaggerated her LinkedIn CV.
Nathalie van Berkel, currently an MP on behalf of D66, had been nominated as junior finance minister but, the Volkskrant reported on Monday, her cv contains several major errors.
Van Berkel claims to have studied for a master’s degree in business administration at Leiden University but in fact she only did a pre-masters course and failed to complete that. She also claimed to have studied law at Erasmus University but again failed to complete her first year.
Commentators said the situation is a major blow to D66 leader Rob Jetten, who had said Van Berkel was always honest about not having completed her degrees in interviews.
However, they said, he was left without a choice after opposition parties began to make an issue out of Van Berkel’s position, given that his new administration does not control a majority of parliamentary seats.
That, Jetten said later “could be in the way” of her doing an effective job.

Lunar New Year prayers, robots and festivities usher in the Year of the Horse
Lunar New Year prayers, robots and festivities usher in the Year of the Horse
BEIJING (AP) — People are marking the Lunar New Year on Tuesday with prayers, fireworks and festivities.
The activities ushered in the Year of the Horse, one of 12 animals in the Chinese zodiac, succeeding the Year of the Snake.
The Lunar New Year is the most important annual holiday in China and some other East Asian nations and is celebrated outside the region, too.
Robots take the stage of an annual TV show in China
As every year, China celebrated the Lunar New Year with a TV show and once again the humanoid robots were a central part of the performance Monday night.
One of the highlights of the CCTV Spring Festival gala was a martial arts performance by children and robots. For several minutes, humanoids from Unitree Robotics showed different sequences and even brandished swords.
The performance shows China’s push to develop more advanced robots powered by improved AI capabilities.
Temple crowds at midnight
in Hong Kong
Incense smoke wafted into the air at a temple in Hong Kong where people line up every year to make wishes for the new year at midnight.
Holding up a cluster of incense sticks, many bowed their heads several times before planting the sticks in containers placed in front of a temple hall.
Fireworks light up skies in Vietnam
Entertainers in Vietnam sang at an outdoor countdown event before multiple fireworks shows at several cities in the Southeast Asian nation, where the festival is called Tet.
Light shows lit up bridges and skyscrapers as the fireworks went off and crowds clapped in rhythm to live pop music performances.
Chinese street fairs in Moscow
People sampled Chinese cuisine from stalls and strolled along snowy streets decorated with red lanterns and dragons as two weeks of events got underway Monday at various venues in the Russian capital.
The third annual Lunar New Year celebration comes at at time of warming relations between China and Russia — ties that have frustrated many European governments because of the war in Ukraine.
A temple bell rings 108 times in Taiwan
The solemn peal of a temple bell rang out 108 times — an auspicious number — as people flocked to the Baoan Temple in Taipei on Tuesday morning.
They lit incense sticks, bowed their heads and left offerings of colorful flower bouquets on outdoor tables on the temple grounds in Taiwan’s capital city.
Argentines join celebrations in Buenos Aires
Thousands of Argentines gathered in Buenos Aires’ Chinatown to celebrate the Lunar New Year and enjoyed dragon and lion dances on the main stage, alongside martial arts demonstrations.
The Chinese immigrant community is among Argentina’s most dynamic, accounting for more than 180,000 people in the South American country.

Trump administration ordered to restore George Washington slavery exhibit it removed in Philadelphia
Trump administration ordered to restore George Washington slavery exhibit it removed in Philadelphia
An exhibit about nine people enslaved by George Washington must be restored at his former home in Philadelphia after President Donald Trump’s administration took it down last month, a federal judge ruled on Presidents Day, the federal holiday honoring Washington’s legacy.
The city of Philadelphia sued in January after the National Park Service removed the explanatory panels from Independence National Historical Park, the site where George and Martha Washington lived with nine of their slaves in the 1790s, when Philadelphia was briefly the nation’s capital.
The removal came in response to a Trump executive order “restoring truth and sanity to American history” at the nation’s museums, parks and landmarks. It directed the Interior Department to ensure those sites do not display elements that “inappropriately disparage Americans past or living.”
U.S. District Judge Cynthia Rufe ruled Monday that all materials must be restored in their original condition while a lawsuit challenging the removal’s legality plays out. She prohibited Trump officials from installing replacements that explain the history differently.
Rufe, an appointee of Republican President George W. Bush, began her written order with a quote from George Orwell’s dystopian novel “1984” and compared the Trump administration to the book’s totalitarian regime called the Ministry of Truth, which revised historical records to align with its own narrative.
“As if the Ministry of Truth in George Orwell’s 1984 now existed, with its motto ‘Ignorance is Strength,’ this Court is now asked to determine whether the federal government has the power it claims — to dissemble and disassemble historical truths when it has some domain over historical facts,” Rufe wrote. “It does not.”
She had warned Justice Department lawyers during a January hearing that they were making “dangerous” and “horrifying” statements when they said Trump officials can choose which parts of U.S. history to display at National Park Service sites.
The Interior Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the ruling, which came while government offices were closed for the federal holiday.
The judge did not provide a timeline for when the exhibit must be restored. Federal officials can appeal the ruling.
The historical site is among several where the administration has quietly removed content about the history of enslaved people, LGBTQ+ people and Native Americans.
Signage that has disappeared from Grand Canyon National Park said settlers pushed Native American tribes “off their land” for the park to be established and “exploited” the landscape for mining and grazing.
Last week, a rainbow flag was taken down at the Stonewall National Monument, where bar patrons rebelled against a police raid and catalyzed the modern LGBTQ+ rights movement. The administration has also removed references to transgender people from its webpage about the monument, despite several trans women of color being key figures in the uprising.
The Philadelphia exhibit, created two decades ago in a partnership between the city and federal officials, included biographical details about each of the nine people enslaved by the Washingtons at the home, including two who escaped.
Among them was Oney Judge, who was born into slavery at the family’s plantation in Mount Vernon, Virginia, and later escaped from their Philadelphia house in 1796. Judge fled north to New Hampshire, a free state, while Washington had her declared a fugitive and published advertisements seeking her return.
Because Judge had escaped from the Philadelphia house, the National Park Service in 2022 added it to a national network of Underground Railroad sites where the agency pledged to “honor, preserve and promote the history of resistance to enslavement through escape and flight.”
Rufe said the removal of materials about Judge “conceals crucial information linking the site” to the network.
Only the names of Judge and the other eight enslaved people — Austin, Paris, Hercules, Richmond, Giles, Moll and Joe, who each had a single name, and Christopher Sheels — remained engraved in a cement wall after federal employees took a crowbar to the plaques on Jan. 22.
Hercules also escaped in 1797 after he was brought to Mount Vernon, where the Washingtons had many other slaves. He reached New York City despite being declared a fugitive slave and lived under the name Hercules Posey.
Several local politicians and Black community leaders celebrated the ruling, which came while many were out rallying at the site for its restoration.
State Rep. Malcolm Kenyatta, a Philadelphia Democrat, said the community prevailed against an attempt by the Trump administration to “whitewash our history.”
“Philadelphians fought back, and I could not be more proud of how we stood together,” he said.

Where in Britain you can now find a Jobcentre on Wheels
- Mobile Jobcentre vans, known as "Jobcentre on Wheels", are being launched across the UK to help people find work by "meeting people where they are".
- Work and Pensions Secretary Pat McFadden announced the expansion of the service, which aims to break down barriers to employment by bringing support into communities.
- Following successful trials in areas like the Scottish Highlands and Greater Manchester, more vehicles will be deployed in six new regions, including Blackpool and Wakefield.
- Data from the Department for Work and Pensions indicates that over half of the visitors to the pilot Jobcentre on Wheels service were not receiving benefits.
- The initiative comes amidst a rising national unemployment rate, which reached 5.1 per cent between September and November last year, and warnings from Tesco's UK chief about a potential "epidemic" of joblessness.

Erdogan sparks alarm in UAE with statement on Emir's health

A statement from Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's office briefly triggered a wave of concern in the United Arab Emirates after it suggested that a planned meeting in Abu Dhabi had been canceled due to the health of UAE President Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan.
In a short announcement released Tuesday evening, Erdogan's office said his visit to Abu Dhabi had been called off because of President Al Nahyan's illness. Several hours later, Greece also announced that Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis would not be meeting the Emirati president.
It remains unclear what prompted the cancellations. The Turkish statement was deleted shortly after publication, apparently because it explicitly referred to the Emirati president as being ill. In many Middle Eastern countries, a ruler's medical condition is closely guarded, and even minor concerns about a leader's health can fuel internal tensions and power struggles.
Following the back-to-back cancellations, unverified claims began circulating on social media alleging that Al Nahyan was facing serious health issues, including suggestions that he may have suffered a significant medical event. None of these claims were confirmed by UAE authorities or any official source, and Abu Dhabi did not directly address the reports.
The UAE's state news agency, WAM, made no mention of any health concerns in its coverage of Mitsotakis' call, describing the conversation as focused on strengthening bilateral ties and reviewing regional developments.
Al Nahyan, 66, who also serves as Ruler of Abu Dhabi, spoke by phone on Wednesday with Erdogan and with the Greek prime minister. Several statements published on his official website stressed that the Emir's medical condition was stable. He is not known to suffer from any serious health problems and maintains an active schedule that includes foreign visits and meetings with senior officials from around the world.

Death of Melbourne Grammar rower caused by rare disease, not overtraining: coroner
The death of a Melbourne Grammar School student who collapsed after rowing training last year was caused by a rare vascular disease, a coroner’s report has found.
Edward Millear, 17, suffered a cardiac arrest at the school’s boat shed on the banks of the Yarra on the afternoon of February 18, 2025, and died in the early hours of the following morning.
The death of the much-loved schoolboy sent shockwaves through the close-knit community of the city’s private schools and led to speculation that the hyper-competitive nature of schools’ rowing teams was resulting in young people over-training in a dangerous manner.
But Coroner David Ryan has found that Eddy, as he was known by family and friends, died as a result of undiagnosed fibro-muscular dysplasia (FMD), a rare disease that thickens arteries and causes damage to blood vessel walls, potentially impeding blood flow.
Staff contacted emergency services and began CPR before Fire Rescue Victoria and Ambulance Victoria arrived and took over. Eddy was given a shock with a defibrillator and received adrenaline. Emergency services staff intubated the boy to support the functioning of his heart and lungs before taking him to the intensive care unit at The Alfred hospital, where he underwent surgery.
But his condition deteriorated, and he was transitioned to comfort care and died at 3.10am the next morning.
“In the circumstances, I am satisfied that Edward’s tragic death was caused by a rare vascular disease which resulted in him experiencing a cardiac arrest after participating in vigorous exercise,” Ryan wrote in his report.
The disease was detected by forensic pathologist Dr Daniel Hussey of the Victorian Institute of Forensic Medicine, who examined the thoracic cavity in Eddy’s heart after the young rower’s death.
The coroner offered his condolences to the Millear family, noting that Eddy was “warmly remembered as a beautiful young man and is deeply mourned by his family and friends”.
Ryan also described him as a diligent student who “enthusiastically participated in sporting activities including rugby and rowing” and was known by his family to be fit, healthy and athletic.
At Millear’s funeral in March last year, his father, Spencer, described Edward as “a good mate, and he was a good son”.
“He was inquisitive. He was smart about what was going on around him. He just knew stuff … Ed had wisdom and kindness beyond his years and a way with people that endeared him to them. Everyone loved Eddy.”
Melbourne Grammar School declined to comment on Tuesday evening.

Slovakia Revamps Bunkers With Ukraine War Uncomfortably Close

The war in neighbouring Ukraine feels distant to many in the Slovak city of Nitra but the local council is preparing for the worst and revamping its Cold War-era nuclear fallout shelters.
Which says much about how the frontline Central European nation -- which has so far been spared the Russian drones that sparked air raid alerts in Poland and Moldova -- sees the war just over its eastern border.
JOIN US ON TELEGRAM
Follow our coverage of the war on the @Kyivpost_official.
Prime Minister Robert Fico, who is close to Russian President Vladimir Putin and opposes sending military aid to Ukraine, insists Slovaks have nothing to fear from Russia.
But with the war uncomfortably close to home, his government has vowed to double the capacity of the shelters.
Like many in Nitra, a five-hour drive from the Ukrainian border, businessman Mario Papek doesn’t think there is much to worry about.
“The war is in Ukraine, not here,” the 51-year-old told AFP, echoing Fico’s reassuring pro-Kremlin rhetoric.
However, every year since Ukraine was invaded in 2022, the city council has been repairing and refurbishing its 17 shelters, with the city planning to spend 40,000 euros ($47,500) this year.
The money so far spent is a drop in the bucket compared to sums needed to make the shelters fully operational.
- Worry over war in Ukraine –
It “wasn’t a priority” before, city hall spokesman Tomas Holubek said.
But “after the conflict started there was a bit of panic and people started thinking about what they would do” if the war came to Slovakia.
ISW Russian Offensive Campaign Assessment, February 16, 2026
Designed as airtight retreats able to withstand chemical and biological attacks, many of Nitra shelters have “obsolete ventilation and electrical wiring”, civil protection officer Dalibor Bubinak told AFP.
The water supply is also below par, he said, speaking from a dilapidated shelter in the basement of a retirement home.
“None is in a technical condition fit to protect residents from hazardous substances,” Bubinak said.
Slovakia has around 1,500 such shelters that could take 250,000 people, according to the interior ministry.
A quarter of them are in the capital, Bratislava, in the far west of the country on the border with Austria.
After the fall of Communism in the former Czechoslovakia in 1989, the state gradually handed some of the shelters over to municipalities, businesses or homeowners.
Some were converted into bars or cultural venues, others were abandoned.
- ‘Mouldy walls’ –
“No one knew if they would ever be used again... They were a dead investment,” said Tomas Sliacan, head of a group monitoring the state of the shelters.
But last month the government pledged to “increase the current shelter capacity by 100 percent” as part of its new security strategy and to “raise public awareness and preparedness levels”.
Interior Minister Matus Sutaj Estok criticised the terrible state of the shelters with their “mouldy walls, broken doors and obsolete ventilation” when he announced an audit in May 2025.
He said at least 30 percent of Slovaks -- some 1.7 million people -- should have access to shelters by 2040 and suggested the European Union could help pay.
Slovakia, which joined the EU and NATO in 2004, has spent two percent of its GDP on defence since the invasion -- in line with NATO guidelines.
But the central bank expects that to fall below the target this year, with many blaming austerity and rifts within Fico’s ruling coalition over defence spending and aid to Ukraine.
- ‘Protect the family’ –
With government funds lacking, some Slovaks are building their own shelters “to protect their families”.
Peter Bako -- whose NSA SR company supplies safety rooms for about 7,900 euros to underground reinforced-concrete shelters for 45,000 euros -- told AFP that demand had “increased by around 75 percent annually since 2022”.
“If civil protection in Slovakia were at the level of the Scandinavian countries or Switzerland, private companies like ours wouldn’t have much room in the market,” he added.The private shelters are not registered as there is “no duty to report” them, the interior ministry told AFP.
Most people AFP talked to in Nitra had no idea where the nearest shelter was.
“I haven’t really looked into it,” said retired doctor Zuzana Nurgasova, while retired university professor Vladimir Popelka said he never felt threatened enough “to look for a place to hide”.

Trump: Iran does not want the consequences of no deal

Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One late Monday night, President Donald Trump addressed the ongoing talks between the US and the Islamic Republic of Iran and said he expected to be involved indirectly in the negotiations.
"I will be involved in these talks in an indirect way, in Geneva. They are very important. We will see what happens," Trump said. "Iran typically negotiates tough. They are good negotiators, or bad negotiators, because we could have had a deal instead of sending the B-2s in to knock out their nuclear potential. And we had to send the B-2s."
Asked whether the chances of reaching an agreement were close to impossible, Trump replied: "No. I think they want to make a deal. I do not think they want the consequences of not making a deal."
His remarks come ahead of another round of indirect US-Iran talks in Geneva on Tuesday, mediated by Oman, aimed at reaching understandings on Iran's nuclear program and the removal of economic sanctions imposed on the ayatollah regime.
US envoys Jared Kushner and Steve Witkoff are expected to attend the meeting, alongside Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi. Preliminary contacts were previously held in Muscat earlier this month.
Tehran has made clear that any agreement would require "give and take" and relief from economic sanctions, while Washington is demanding guarantees that Iran will be prevented from obtaining the capability to develop nuclear weapons.
The diplomatic push comes amid heightened military tensions in the region. Over the past 24 hours, Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps held live-fire drills in the Strait of Hormuz to test operational readiness and rehearse confrontation scenarios.
At the same time, the US military continues to deploy forces to the area, including the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln and additional naval reinforcements. Trump has stressed that the buildup is necessary in case a deal is not reached.
The apparent strategy is to increase diplomatic pressure while keeping a military option on the table, as Iran has warned that any attack would be met with a response of its own.
On the eve of the talks, both sides are publicly signaling a willingness to negotiate, even as they prepare for the possibility that diplomacy could fail.

Putin ally warns European powers over seizure of Russian vessels
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
MOSCOW, Feb 17 - Russia could deploy its navy to prevent European powers from seizing its vessels and may retaliate against European shipping if Russian ships are seized, Nikolai Patrushev, a close ally of President Vladimir Putin, was quoted as saying on Tuesday.
Western states have sought to cut off Russia from global trade and cripple its finances by imposing more than 30,000 sanctions over its war in Ukraine.
They have also tried to block oil tankers suspected of involvement in Russian oil shipments. In January the United States seized a Russian-flagged oil tanker as part of efforts to curb Venezuelan oil exports.
Russian President Vladimir Putin has described such actions as piracy.
"If we don't give them a tough rebuff, then soon the British, French and even the Balts (Baltic nations) will become arrogant to such an extent that they will try to block our country's access to the seas at least in the Atlantic basin," Patrushev, a Kremlin aide and chairman of Russia's Maritime Board, told the Russian media outlet Argumenty i Fakty.
"We believe that, as always, the best guarantee of the safety of navigation is the navy. In the main maritime areas, including regions far from Russia, substantial forces must be permanently deployed - forces capable of cooling the ardour of Western pirates," Patrushev said. REUTERS

BAE Systems has entered into an agreement to acquire Aston Harald Mekaniska Verkstad, a Sweden-based manufacturer specialising in precision-machined, large and complex structures for aerospace, defence and commercial customers, the company stated.
BAE Systems said its Bofors business has signed a share purchase agreement to pursue the acquisition of the firm, which is headquartered in Kristinehamn and employs around 100 people. Aston Harald Mekaniska Verkstad has been a long-standing supplier to BAE Systems Bofors and also supports other defence and commercial clients.
According to the company, the proposed acquisition is intended to expand BAE Systems’ industrial capacity in the European defence market and strengthen supply chain resilience. BAE Systems said the move would support delivery of systems including the Bofors ARCHER artillery system, TRIDON air defence system, and the 40 Mk4 and 57 Mk3 naval gun systems.
BAE Systems added that the two firms share cultural alignment through their Swedish heritage and mission focus, and said the acquisition would improve efficiency in delivering equipment for Sweden and other NATO allies, as well as supporting complex fabrication requirements for commercial customers across Europe.
The company said completion of the transaction remains subject to regulatory approvals and other customary pre-closing conditions, with the acquisition expected to close during the first half of the year.

“London just felt too big for me; Amsterdam is just right”

“London just felt too big for me; Amsterdam is just right”
Steve Green is a breath coach and translator, who has lived in the Netherlands since the 1980s. A dual British and Dutch citizen, he’s a fan of the Dutch sense of fairness, would like to meet writer Safae el Khannoussi and says tourists should spend more time criss-crossing Amsterdam on foot.
How did you end up in the Netherlands?
In the early 80s, soon after leaving school in London, an adventurous friend suggested going over to Amsterdam together. So we hopped on the Magic Bus with a couple of hundred guilders each and very little idea of what was going to happen next.
We got lucky. We made friends, got a bike, and a roof over our head. I only stayed a few months that first time, but by then I felt really connected to the city and our new friends. So I came back, and I’ve (almost) never regretted it. London just felt too big for me; Amsterdam is just right.
How do you describe yourself – an expat, lovepat, immigrant, international?
Lost soul? Accidental tourist? The Netherlands just happens to be a different country from the one I was born in – some of my friends in the UK live further away from their original home than I do.
That said, there’s something that suits me about being somewhere I’ll never be completely at home. Even though I’m very comfortable with the Dutch language, people and culture, there’s somehow still a bit of a distance from what’s going on around me, and I kind of like that for some reason.
I’m lucky enough to have dual citizenship – I was thinking I might have to choose after Brexit, but things worked out. I’m surprised at how important it feels to have the right to be in both countries that mean so much to me.
How long do you plan to stay?
I’m in for the long haul. My family is here, lots of my friends are here and I live in one of the most beautiful and liveable cities in the world. What’s not to like?!
I also think the lower pressure here has made it easier for me to shift careers when I wanted to – I’ve been a DJ, translator and other things in between. Becoming a breath coach a few years ago is the best move I ever made – it’s so interesting and rewarding. It’s also a very in-person kind of occupation, which keeps my focus on Amsterdam and the surrounding area.
Do you speak Dutch and how did you learn?
I’m pretty fluent – I do most of my breath coaching work in Dutch, for example. The first few years here I barely learned a word, though, I must admit. When I arrived, people were even more Anglophile than they are now, which made life easy for this lazy Brit. But family gatherings, chatting to other parents outside my son’s primary school, then working with a Dutch theatre company eventually worked wonders.
What’s your favourite Dutch thing?
The imperfect but culturally deep-rooted sense of fairness, or at least the expectation among many people that life should be fair. I shouldn’t romanticise it too much, but there are still lots of things here that compare well with other countries.
More concretely, in Amsterdam and elsewhere there’s still a healthy legacy of the squatting culture. Here in town there’s a smattering of inventive, creative and reasonably priced venues like De Nieuwe Anita and OT301. And then there’s Ruigoord of course.
It’s not that I spend all my time in these places, but it’s wonderful just knowing they exist in a world that’s becoming increasingly commercialised and normalised. Generally I think the quality of life here is pretty good – I’m an optimist, I guess.
How Dutch have you become?
Noticeably, I think. I realise it most when I visit Britain and discover I’m a bit more plain-speaking than I used to be. I’ve got a pretty balanced mix of Dutch and non-Dutch family and friends here.
There was a time I mostly socialised with non-Dutch people who had settled here long term – not so much your classic corporate expats as people who had carved out their own path here. That’s a shared culture too.
There’s still something so easy-going and fun about being with like-minded English-speaking folk with shared experience of living in Amsterdam and leaving their past lives behind – until they have to go back to look after their parents, of course.
Which three Dutch people (dead or alive) would you most like to meet?
Wim de Bie: He and his comedy partner Kees van Kooten were two of the first people on Dutch television I could understand a bit and connect with. It felt like a treasured secret to have someone make me laugh so much in a different language. I hear he was a gentle, thoughtful and funny soul, and I’m guessing it would be nice to spend some time with him.
Hans Teeuwen: Yes, I’m English, so comedy is important to me. He can be transcendently funny as well as contrarian and confrontational. Seeing him for the first time on video was a revelation – gut-bustlingly hilarious and strange. He’s probably a bit more of a challenge to have a chat with than Wim de Bie, but it would be a real thrill if he was on form.
Safae el Khannoussi: All I know about her is her novel Oroppa, which was a big hit last year – and deservedly so. She captures so much I can relate to about what the Netherlands is like, and what it’s like to be an outsider here and elsewhere, in a kind of magical-realist way. I’m just in awe of her imagination and writing, and hope we’d get on.
What’s your top tourist tip?
Spend half a day or so doing a cross-section walk of Amsterdam – or whatever city you want to explore, really. Meandering from north to south or east to west is a great way of putting the tourist zones and other areas in perspective, with people just getting on with their lives. Amsterdam is so much more than canal views – undeniably beautiful as they are.
Tell us something surprising you’ve found out about the Netherlands
Maybe it’s just how westward-looking people seem to be here. Right from the start I was surprised at how welcoming people were – when I first arrived in Amsterdam you got seven points just for being English.
But when you look at the surrounding countries it’s striking that Germany, Belgium and France aren’t really part of the national consciousness, apart from as holiday destinations. I guess the war has something to do with it, but it’s more than that. The Dutch seafaring spirit perhaps? The internet? Who knows?
If you had just 24 hours left in the Netherlands, what would you do?
Go stand in a TikTok queue, ha-ha. No, I’d see if I could rustle up a quick party, get together with family and friends for dinner, have a walk through town one last time – probably in a reflective frame of mind.

President Erdogan heads to Ethiopia in first visit in more than 10 years

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s upcoming visit to Ethiopia has received wide coverage in local media, highlighting its diplomatic significance as the two countries mark 100 years since the opening of Türkiye’s embassy in the capital Addis Ababa, a milestone in relations that date back as far as the 16th century.
Both state-owned and private media outlets have broadly portrayed the visit positively, emphasising longstanding ties, growing economic engagement and Ankara’s diplomatic role in the region.
The trip, scheduled for Tuesday at the invitation of Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, will be Erdogan’s first to Ethiopia in more than a decade.
State-run Fana Broadcasting Corporation has framed the visit as a level up in bilateral relations. In one article about the Turkish president, the headline portrayed him as “the architect of the new Türkiye.”
Private media outlet Addis Standard also reported on the visit, linking it to tensions in the Horn of Africa and Türkiye’s diplomatic engagement in the region. Its coverage said the two countries are expected to sign various cooperation agreements that have already been reached at the official level.
In another report, Pulse of Africa, a pan-African digital media platform launched last October by Abiy, underscored that Türkiye is strengthening its presence in the Red Sea and Horn of Africa as President Erdogan visits Addis Ababa to expand trade, infrastructure and security ties.
Speaking at an event marking the century-old bilateral relations, Türkiye’s ambassador to Ethiopia, Berk Baran, said Erdogan’s visit marks “the elevation of already strong ties.”
“Türkiye and Ethiopia already enjoy a strategic relationship in various aspects, including political, economic and social relations,” he said.
Consistent political ties and dialogue
"In this ambivalent global order, Türkiye and Ethiopia have built a very consistent open relationship without third-party mediation. This should be kept and strengthened,” Emre Yasin Kekec, an independent researcher based in Türkiye, told Anadolu.
Analysts say the relationship has been shaped by mutual political understanding, even when national interests differed.
"I believe Türkiye understands Ethiopia’s positions; we’ve seen this during the Nile dispute, we have seen this during its quest for sea access, and this stems from similarities of geographical context and statehood history," said Ibrahim Mulushewa, a researcher and head of a think-tank based in Addis Ababa, speaking at a panel marking the centennial of ties.
He said this shared perspective has enabled direct engagement between the two countries.
"Turkish understanding sometimes might not be on the same page, but at least both countries see the perspectives, and that very reason created dialogic and direct relations, which also made Türkiye succeed in mediating very sensitive regional matters like that of the Ethiopia-Somalia dispute, which was resolved through the historic Ankara declaration," he said.
Speaking at a panel discussion on the occasion of the centennial of official bilateral relations, Baran said “the century-old people-to-people diplomacy has been the core character of bilateral relations between Türkiye and Ethiopia,” noting that President Erdogan’s visit “marks a new level of bilateral ties."
Analysts also say the partnership has been sustained as much by societal connections as by formal diplomacy.
“Mostly talks revolve around political diplomacy, while the real bridge is people-to-people relations,” Kekec said.
Scholars also highlighted the role of cultural diplomacy in shaping public perceptions.
“The cultural, social and artistic diplomacy is mostly overlooked, as it is mostly overshadowed by political diplomacy. However, in the Ethiopian context, Turkish TV shows, students like myself who studied in Türkiye, and cultural resonance have made the country positively portrayed across the country,” said Abdulaziz Dino, a lecturer at Addis Ababa University who holds a PhD from Ankara University.
“In this ever-changing global order, traditional diplomacy, though it plays a vital role, would have much less impact unless it is supported by media, cultural and social capital,” he added.
According to the scholars, Erdogan’s visit reflects both the symbolism of a centennial milestone and an effort by both countries to reinforce ties rooted in historical familiarity, diplomatic dialogue and longstanding societal connections.

US, Iran hold high-level talks on Tehran's nuclear program

US, Iran hold high-level talks on Tehran's nuclear program
February 17, 2026Iranian and US representatives are scheduled to attend a second set of indirect negotiations mediated by Oman on Tuesday in Geneva to address Iran's nuclear program.
"I am in Geneva with real ideas to achieve a fair and equitable deal," Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi wrote on X. "What is not on the table: submission before threats."
For the US side, presidential envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, US President Donald Trump's son-in-law, were due to attend the Tuesday talks.
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who was in Europe on Monday, said Washington hopes to reach an agreement with Tehran, despite the difficulties.
"I'm not going to prejudge these talks," Rubio said. "The president always prefers peaceful outcomes and negotiated outcomes to things."
What does the US want from negotiations?
The US has said it wants to limit Iran's nuclear program and ensure Tehran cannot develop nuclear weapons.
Trump, who said he would be "indirectly" involved in the Geneva talks, has threatened to take military action against Iran over a crackdown on anti-government protests. The US president added that he believed Tehran wanted to make a deal.
"I don't think they want the consequences of not making a deal," Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One on Monday. "We could have had a deal instead of sending the B-2s in to knock out their nuclear potential. And we had to send the B-2s."
Trump has said he believes a change of government in Iran would be the "best thing that could happen."
Washington has also sought to expand the talks to include Iran's missile stockpile.
What does Iran want from negotiations?
Iran has consistently said its nuclear program serves exclusively civilian, energy-production purposes and has refused to limit its enrichment of uranium. Tehran has, however, enriched uranium up to 60% purity, a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels and far beyond the level needed for energy production.
For its part, Iran has said that any agreement with the US needs to include easing of economic sanctions.
Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Majid Takht-Ravanchi said Tehran could be open to compromise on the nuclear issue, but is looking for an easing of international sanctions led by the United States.
"The ball is in America's court. They have to prove they want to have a deal with us," Takht-Ravanchi told the BBC on Sunday. "If we see a sincerity on their part, I am sure that we will be on a road to have an agreement."
The Iranian government has been weakened in recent months by large street protests in which thousands of people were killed during a government crackdown.
Talks amid increasing military presence
Iran said that its paramilitary Revolutionary Guard started drills on Monday in the Strait of Hormuz, the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman, the waterways through which 20% of the world's oil passes. Other live-fire Iranian military exercises are planned in the Strait of Hormuz on Tuesday, according to EOS Risk Group.
Last week, Trump said the USS Gerald R. Ford, the world's largest aircraft carrier, was being sent from the Caribbean Sea to the Mideast to join other US military assets in the region, including the USS Abraham Lincoln and its accompanying guided-missile destroyers.
Gulf Arab nations have warned that any attack could spiral into another regional conflict in a Mideast still reeling from the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip.
Previous talks halted by Israel-Iran war
The first round of indirect talks was held on February 6 in Oman. During those negotiations, it appeared that vehicles displaying the US flag entered the venue only after Iranian officials had left.
Months of previous negotiations between the US and Iran came to a halt in June when Israel launched a 12-day war against Iran. The US bombed Iranian nuclear facilities during that war.

- The launch will feature 130 of Topshop's "most in-demand pieces," including its signature denim, with Topman also available in seven John Lewis stores.
- Both Michelle Wilson of Topshop and Peter Ruis of John Lewis highlighted the partnership as a key step in making the brand more accessible and accelerating John Lewis's fashion ambition.

Tuesday's papers: The cost of convenience, unvisited America, and fossil fans

With Foodora exiting Finland and Uber Eats entering the market, Helsingin Sanomat explores the platform delivery business from a restaurant's perspective.
Restaurants' mounting distress is being driven by a slump in consumer spending and the growing popularity of home delivery services, according to Jon Niklas Knut Engblom, a co-owner of the now-bankrupt Guido's Pizza in Kauniainen and Tapiola.
HS reports that delivery platforms such as Wolt charge commissions of around a third of the price of each order, a burden for smaller operators, according to entrepreneurs.
At the same time, restaurateurs are reluctant to abandon these types of platforms, as they have become an indispensable source of revenue.
Engblom told the paper the fundamental problem with relying on Wolt is that it is "incredibly expensive" for restaurants.
Guido's restaurants paid the platform commissions amounting to roughly a third of each order's price. These are sums that, Engblom said, ran into tens of thousands of euros annually.
The land of fewer visitors
Hufvudstadsbladet explores Finns' cooling appetite for travel to the United States.
The number of Finnish travellers fell by nearly nine percent in 2025 compared with the previous year.
Tourism researcher Antti Honkanen suggested that, in light of tensions involving Greenland, the decline may deepen further this year, particularly among Danes.
Tighter scrutiny by American border officials, including checks of travellers' social media activity, is also unlikely to improve sentiment.
"Some say it is still merely a threat. Others claim it has begun in earnest. Personally, I would be reluctant to hand over my accounts, even though I have nothing to hide," he told HBL.
Still running on diesel
A story about diesel-powered cars' appeal is Kauppalehti's most popular story on Tuesday morning.
Car manufacturing giant Stellantis is bringing diesel models back into its lineup, arguing that demand for the fuel has not disappeared. Its brands include Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep and Ram.
According to Stellantis, there is a persistent market for diesel-powered vehicles, despite the industry's broader shift towards electric ones.
The European-American carmaker had previously set itself a target of selling only fully electric vehicles in Europe by 2030, with electric models accounting for half of its sales in the US.
According to the business daily, the shift is due to Chinese manufacturers not really competing in the diesel segment. In many European markets, diesel vehicles also remain cheaper than their fully electric counterparts.

Imran Khan’s sister rejects Pakistan gov’t claim jailed ex-PM’s vision fine

Imran Khan’s sister rejects Pakistan gov’t claim jailed ex-PM’s vision fine
Government board says jailed ex-leader's eyesight has improved since he lost most vision in one eye. But his family rejects the claim.
Islamabad, Pakistan – The sister of former Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan has told Al Jazeera that the family has rejected a government board’s claims that the cricketer-turned-politician’s eyesight has improved since a court report last week said he had lost most vision in one eye.
A government-appointed medical board examining the jailed ex-leader reported a significant improvement in his eyesight after weeks of controversy over his deteriorating vision. Its medical report, seen by Al Jazeera, claims that Khan’s vision in his right eye has improved from 6/36 to 6/9. His left eye remains at 6/6 vision with the use of glasses.

In ophthalmic terms, 6/6 vision means the person’s eyesight is fine. A 6/9 reading means the person can see at 6 metres (20 feet) what someone with normal vision sees at 9 metres (30 ft).
The assessment was carried out on Sunday by a two-member board comprising doctors Nadeem Qureshi and Muhammad Arif Khan. The specialists conducted a detailed examination at Adiala jail in Rawalpindi, where the 73-year-old founder of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party has been imprisoned since August 2023.
But Khan’s family said it had “no trust” in the authorities.
His sister, Aleema Khan, described it as “extremely concerning and unacceptable” that the government had resisted allowing Khan’s personal doctor and a family representative to be present during the examination and treatment.
“Without the physical presence of both his personal doctor and family representative, we categorically reject any claims made by the government regarding his examination, treatment or medical condition,” Aleema told Al Jazeera.
Aasim Yusuf, chief medical officer of the Imran Khan-founded Shaukat Khanum Memorial Hospital and one of Khan’s personal physicians, said in a video message that he had held a 40-minute conversation with the two doctors who examined Khan on February 15.
In the video, shared by the PTI on social media, Yusuf said the visiting doctors briefed him on the treatment and future plan of care, adding that according to their latest assessment, “Khan had shown significant improvement as a result of treatment and his vision had improved significantly as well”.
“I would be extremely happy if I was able to confirm that this was the case. Unfortunately, because I have not seen him myself and have not been able to participate in his care or to talk to him, I am unable to either confirm or deny the veracity of what we have been told,” Yusuf said.
Disputed diagnosis
The latest examination comes after reports last month that authorities had taken Khan late at night to a government facility for a medical procedure without informing his family. Following the outcry, Pakistan’s Supreme Court appointed Barrister Salman Safdar as amicus curiae to meet Khan and assess his condition.
In a seven-page report filed last week, Safdar painted a troubling picture. He wrote that Khan had suffered rapid and substantial vision loss over the past three months and that despite repeated complaints of persistent blurred and hazy vision, “no action was taken by the jail authorities to address these complaints”.
Safdar quoted Khan as saying that “only 15 percent” vision remained in his right eye.
PTI General Secretary Salman Akram Raja told reporters in Islamabad on Monday that the two doctors, one of whom was recommended after consultations with Yusuf, confirmed that Khan’s vision had improved.
“The two doctors who met him in jail said that Khan confirmed to them that he was unable to see the clock on the wall for a few weeks, [but] can now not only see that, but also the clock hands. According to doctors, this was an incredible improvement in his vision,” Raja said.
Aleema, however, insisted that the family could not accept any medical report until Khan’s physician examined him in person. She renewed the demand that he be transferred to Shifa International Hospital in Islamabad.
She accused the government of repeatedly misleading the family about Khan’s health.
“After our protest and Salman Safdar’s report, we were told that he would be taken to Shifa International Hospital, along with [the] presence of his physician as well as a family member, but then, abruptly, they [the government] changed the plan. How can we be suddenly denied?” she asked.
Aleema said authorities had asked the family to provide the names of doctors and relatives who could accompany Khan, only to reject each proposal.
“There have been repeated back-and-forth phone calls. We gave them the names of his personal doctors, including Dr Aasim. Another name we gave was our sister, Uzma Khan, to represent the family. But the response from the government was that no sister will be allowed to meet him,” she claimed.
She added that her brother had no underlying medical conditions, such as diabetes or high blood pressure, and described him as a political prisoner.
“Our hearts are breaking, and we are so frustrated. This is deliberate. When Salman Safdar went there and came back, he told us the story, and we cried hearing about Khan’s current situation. This is not just criminal negligence, this is outright criminal and deliberate,” she said.
Standoff over medical access
The PTI and its allies, who are holding a sit-in outside parliament, have promised to continue their protest until their demands are met, including access to Khan and his transfer to Shifa International Hospital.
Sheikh Waqas Akram, the party’s central information secretary, said the demand was straightforward and focused on securing “specialised treatment” for Khan.
“When you deny the family access, or the physicians recommended by the family, and when you break promises, how can we trust? We don’t even know what they have done with him. We believe the government is certainly hiding something,” he told Al Jazeera.
Aleema said she would hold a news conference on Tuesday outside Adiala jail and added that the family had not sought any concessions from authorities beyond medical access.
“Imran’s sons have been trying to visit Pakistan since last year and have applied several times, but their visa has not been processed. It is in limbo, they do not get a denial, nor an approval,” she said, referring to Kasim and Suleman, Khan’s two sons, who are nationals of the United Kingdom.
The sons were born during Khan’s first marriage to Jemima Goldsmith. The couple divorced in 2004 after nine years of marriage. Both sons are based in London.
Government rejects negligence claims
The government, meanwhile, has defended the medical board’s work. Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar said the treatment provided to Khan had led to improvement and that the specialist team had expressed satisfaction with his progress.
Speaking at a public event on Monday, Tarar said opposition leaders and Khan’s personal doctors had been briefed.
Minister for Parliamentary Affairs Tariq Fazal Chaudhry also said the examination inside the jail was conducted “in accordance with government directives and with complete transparency”.
“The government provided every necessary facility on site to ensure no question of any negligence arises,” Chaudhry wrote on social media, adding that Gohar Ali Khan, the PTI chairman in Khan’s absence, had been kept informed.
Imran Khan, a former Pakistan cricket captain who led Pakistan to its 1992 World Cup victory, became prime minister in 2018.
He was removed in 2022 through a parliamentary no-confidence vote, which he said was orchestrated by the military in collusion with Washington and his political rivals. Both the military and the United States have denied the allegations.
Since his ouster, Khan has blamed Army Chief Field Marshal Asim Munir for his legal and political troubles and has repeatedly urged supporters to protest.
In June 2024, a United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention concluded that Khan’s detention “had no legal basis and appears to have been intended to disqualify him from running [for] political office”.

France's Macron in India to boost Rafale deal talks, AI ties
February 17, 2026French President Emmanuel Macron is in India for a three-day visit aimed at shoring up defense and AI ties with the South Asian country.
Macron is scheduled to meet with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi later Tuesday, in Mumbai, where the leaders are set to discuss expanding military partnership between the two countries.
Macron is then set to attend the global AI Impact Summit 2026 in New Delhi in the next days.
"Through this visit, we seek to further strengthen cooperation" with India, and to "diversify" France's economic and trade partnerships, Macron's office said.
Macron visit amid talks on Rafale megadeal
An Indian government panel last week gave its preliminary approval for the purchase of additional Rafale fighter jets and maritime patrol aircraft in deals valued at billions of dollars, India's defense ministry said.
The purchases are worth $40 billion.
India's Ministry of Defence has not yet publically shared the number of jets it intends to order, or their price point. However, ministry sources told AFP that the order will be for 114 jets.
Another ministry source said that "the majority" of them would be manufactured in India under the proposed contract.
Christophe Jaffrelot, an India specialist at Sciences Po Center for International Studies in Paris, described the potential deal as the "contract of the century" and a potential "crowning achievement" for bilateral ties.
Maintaining air power is a strategic priority for India, which faces persistent security challenges along its borders with nuclear-armed rivals Pakistan and China.
Over the last decade, New Delhi has sought to reduce its military dependence on Russia, which is still India's largest defense supplier, and is now looking to boost defense production at home.

‘Living through a nightmare’: Distressed family of kidnapped grandfather speak of ordeal
The family of Chris Baghsarian, the 85-year-old kidnapped from his Sydney home in what police say was clearly a case of mistaken identity, say they are living a nightmare as they wait for some form of closure.
The widower, who lived alone, was taken from the bedroom of his North Ryde property about 5am on Friday, prompting police to issue a direct plea to the abductors, who they believe kidnapped the wrong person.
“Our family is living through a nightmare we never thought possible,” the statement, released by NSW Police on Tuesday, reads.
“Chris’ kidnapping feels surreal, and we are struggling to make sense of the fact that he has been taken and that our family has been caught up in something that has nothing to do with us.”
Baghsarian’s family said he was deeply loved and a devoted father, brother, uncle and grandfather.
“The kindest person we know – someone who would never hurt a fly,” the family said.
“As we wait for some form of closure or resolution, we ask for privacy.
“This is an extraordinarily distressing time, and we need space to support one another and focus on navigating what comes next.”
Police found signs of forced entry at the North Ryde home, and are investigating whether the intended target was a figure linked to the Alameddine organised crime network living nearby.
Video has since emerged of an injured Baghsarian at an unknown location.
Baghsarian is pictured in the video in the grey tracksuit pants and flannelette shirt he was wearing when abducted.
NSW Police Commissioner Mal Lanyon said it was a disgraceful incident, calling on the kidnappers to return Baghsarian to his family.
“This is clearly a case of mistaken identity,” he said on Tuesday.
“It certainly shows the disregard that those involved in organised crime have for individuals.”
“You have the wrong person,” Lanyon said.
Premier Chris Minns has also pleaded for Baghsarian’s return
Cases of mistaken identity have become increasingly common in Sydney’s underworld as contractors are hired to carry out crimes on behalf of larger organised crime networks.

The IDF found a weapons cache belonging to Hamas's Rafah brigade during operational activity in the area of the Yellow Line in southern Gaza on Monday, the IDF announced.
The military said it found "a large amount of guns, an RPG rocket, and an explosive device that were going to be used to harm IDF soldiers operating in the area."
The statement noted that the IDF would continue working to kill terrorists and dismantle terrorist infrastructures in the southern Gaza Strip according to the ceasefire agreement.
IDF demolishes home in West Bank village over permit violation
Additionally, on Tuesday morning, the IDF reportedly began demolishing a home in the village of Qarawat Bani Hassan, west of Salfit, in the West Bank, according to reports from Palestinian media.
According to the Palestinian-run WAFA news agency, the house was demolished by the IDF because it did not have a valid building permit. The IDF has yet to release a statement on the demolition.

Fiscal watchdog slams government's debt-funded spending
The Swedish Fiscal Policy Council, the group tasked with assessing Sweden's fiscal policy, has given the government what it describes as "the most severe criticism it has ever given".
The council described the government's decision to borrow heavily for defence at the same time as slashing income tax and VAT as anmärkningsvärt, which literally means "worthy of note", but which carries connotations of surprise and disapproval.
"Future generations are going to have to pay the interest costs on this when the government pushes it out into the future," the council's chair, the economist and former Riksbank chief Lars Heikensten said at a press conference after delivering the council's annual report.
The council criticised the decision to borrow money outside the fiscal policy framework to fund an urgent increase in defence spending, something all the parties in the parliament agreed to do, without giving any proposals for how increased defence spending would be financed in the long term.
It also criticised the expansive election year budget Finance Minister Elisabeth Svantesson announced in the autumn, saying it was anmärkningsvärt that loan financing was deemed necessary at the same time as income tax was cut by a near identical amount.
"What they're doing is a political choice," Heikensten said, agreeing with Svantesson's statement on Friday that there was no room left for new spending for the entire of the next four-year mandate period.
"There is in principle no spending room left at all," he said.
The council said that the government had been wrong to cut VAT on food and wrong to reduce payroll taxes for young people, arguing that it would be politically difficult for whoever takes power after the next election to return VAT on food to previous levels.
Swedish vocabulary: anmärkningsvärt – noteworthy, remarkable
Parliamentary committee to vote on stopping teen deportations
The Swedish parliament's social insurance committee is due to vote on Tuesday, February 17th, on whether to back a joint proposal from the Green Party and the Left Party to reduce the number of so-called teen deportations.
The proposal would see a return of a ground for those facing deportation to stay in the country if they face "particularly distressing circumstances" and would also allow children of people granted permanent residency the right to permits as dependents up until age 21, rather than 18 at present.
The two parties have won over the Centre Party but so far not the Social Democrats. Even if they did win over the Social Democrats, they would still be one MP short of the majority needed to submit the proposal to parliament for a vote.
This means they would need to win over both the Social Democrats and the Liberal Party, both of which have said they want action to stop teen deportations, to have a majority.
Swedish vocabulary: ömmande – distressing
Swedish Food Agency calls for mobile flour mills for war situations
The Swedish Food Agency (Livsmedelsverket) has called for Sweden to buy mobile grain mills that can travel around northern Sweden to make flour for bread, porridge and pasta from the grains kept in emergency silos.
"Sweden is now building grain storage facilities in the northernmost counties. This also requires solutions for how the grain will become flour - in a region that currently lacks mills," said the agency's project manager Serina Ahlgren in a press release.
The mobile mills would be operated by authorities and would not be used in peacetime. According to the proposal, they would cost 90 million kronor over three years.
Swedish vocabulary: en kvarn – a mill
Swede suspected of helping over 100 men buy sex with his wife
A man in northern Sweden is suspected of helping more than 100 men buy sex with his wife, a prosecutor told AFP on Monday.
Sweden's law on prostitution bans the buying of sex but not the selling.
The man, who is in his 60s, was arrested in late October after his wife reported him to police and has been remanded in custody since then, prosecutor Ida Annerstedt told AFP.
"He is suspected of having facilitated, or profited financially from, the sale of the complainant's sexual services," Annerstedt said.
Annerstedt said the man had been remanded in custody suspected of the crime of "procuring".
She said police were looking into other suspected crimes but declined to give any details, citing the confidentiality of the ongoing investigation.
She also declined to say whether the woman, who is in her 50s, had been forced to sell sex or not.
The suspected crimes were believed to have occurred from January 2022 until the man's arrest last year.
Annerstedt said she expected to press charges on March 13. (AFP)

MOSCOW, February 17. /TASS/. It is necessary for BRICS to acquire a strategic maritime dimension, and in this context, joint naval exercises of member countries are already underway, Nikolay Patrushev, Russian presidential aide and chairman of the Russian Maritime Board, said in an interview with the aif.ru news outlet.
"We will tap into the potential of BRICS, which needs to be given a full-fledged strategic maritime dimension," he said.
Patrushev recalled the exercises held in January and February to protect sea lanes from Western piracy. Russia, China, and Iran participated in the maneuvers. The UAE and South Africa also joined the January exercises.

A Russian court has sentenced a US citizen to four years in jail for trying to take the stocks of Kalashnikov assault rifles out of a Moscow airport, the RIA state news agency reported on Tuesday.
The US citizen, who collects Kalashnikov weapons, bought two Kalashnikov stocks and checked in a suitcase containing the butts at Moscow's Vnukovo airport but made no customs declaration, RIA said.
The man, who was not identified by the news agency, was found guilty under an article in the criminal code dealing with the smuggling of weapons, RIA said.
RIA said the man partially admitted his guilt. Reuters was unable to reach the man while he was in detention.
The US State Department advises against all travel to Russia and has repeatedly told its citizens to leave immediately "due to terrorism, unrest, wrongful detention and other risks."
"Russian officials often question and threaten US citizens without reason," the State Department says in its travel advisory. "Russian security services have arrested US citizens on false charges. They have denied them fair treatment and convicted them without credible evidence."
Russian officials deny the US allegations and say that the state merely enforces Russian law.

The Opposition’s hard line on immigration is just so divisive

The Opposition’s hard line on immigration is just so divisive
It’s quaint that the Liberals only want people who think like them to come here (“Top Liberals disavow contribution to Ley’s hardline migration policy”, February 17). The older of the two Bondi shooters came to Australia in the 1990s, so it would that appear you can come here and then become ideologically brainwashed. Do people really believe that our Labor government does not vet the people who come here? Do you really believe that the government has no control over how many people come here? Does anyone remember COVID and how no migration took place for two years? And that the huge influx of people we experienced after COVID were legitimate migrants unable to come because of COVID? Do you know that there are approximately 50 million refugees in the world? The government has capped the number of migrants coming to Australia and the Liberals know it. I deplore the division they will create with their “bad migration” attack. Claudia Drevikovsky, Croydon
Just when you thought the Liberal Party could not sink lower, we are presented with Sussan Ley’s immigration “solution”. Mobile phone inspection at entry ports and a ban on immigration from “Islamic terrorist-controlled countries”. Brilliant! Donald Trump 2.0. Why would anyone be foolish enough to bring a phone carrying incriminating material? Why would you automatically exclude those seeking escape and freedom from areas governed by lunatic extremists? Massive additional expenditure for no return. This isn’t intelligent policy, it’s dog whistling – but this time the Libs are hoping it’s the ears of PHON supporters that hear the call. How can we even consider the Coalition to be an alternative government when the best they can offer is to out-grub PHON? Coalition government oversaw a massive increase in migrant numbers; the current government is radically reducing those numbers. If this is a foretaste of Liberal policy, the outlook for intelligent opposition at federal level is bleak. George Williams, North Balgowlah
Why do the Liberals insist on pressing ancient primate fear buttons regarding immigrants when so many of our community neighbours have varying levels of skin melanin, have a faith which is not the one true faith of Animism and speak a language which is not one of at least 200 Indigenous Australian languages? Could they be misdirecting to fear and discord because of their complete failures in housing policy, infrastructure and educational assistance for working-class aspirational people? Greg Thompson, Bega
A leaked Liberal Party policy would ban migrants from Gaza, Somalia and the Philippines, deemed “terrorist-controlled”, from entering Australia. Where do our leaders find their advisers? Collective punishment hasn’t worked in Israel or the US. And why target countries such as the Philippines, where many Australians have found love and romance. Why bring more depression to our stranded souls? Mokhles Sidden, South Strathfield
I wonder what Australians would feel if New Zealand decided not to let Australians migrate there because of the mass shooting in 2019, by an Australian, of Muslims in Christchurch at the Al Noor Mosque and 10 minutes later at the Linwood Islamic Centre. Trish Richardson, Paddington
The cost of CGT reform
Shane Wright shows how difficult it would be for any government to cut outlays on health, age pension etc (“Voters want spending cuts – but immunity as well”, February 17). And so we have opposition leader Angus Taylor hitting the ground running with talk of slashing spending. So when the government floats the idea of cutting a tax expenditure – the Capital Gains Tax Discount – he automatically opposes it, even before an actual proposal is put forward. This expenditure is both inefficient and increases inequality, so you would think it would be worth having a look at. You can guess that Taylor will probably oppose any look at tax expenditures (in theory, around $200 billion a year). So his focus when he talks of a spending spree, and the need therefore for cuts, will have to be on outlays in areas such as health, education, welfare, infrastructure; areas that benefit everyday Australians. Tim Field, Red Hill (ACT)
Tax cuts revisited, again
Why is it always tax cuts (“Backing for capital gains, negative gearing shift”, February 17)? This line of political thinking means there is less support for health, education and other community needs. Of course, those who approve want it all privately run, with appropriate profit margins for their investments in areas of health and housing. What about housing investment? Labor should have been prepared, after a year in office, to sort out housing investment taxes when the party was installed again, rather than drag the situation out. Anyone staying at an Airbnb in Australia, as against Britain and Europe, where it is more likely a genuine personal home or property, will often discover that the owner of a unit or flat lives a storey or two up, and owns a couple of rental places in the same building. Australians and visitors are being used to crowd out those who need permanent shelter. There is nothing wrong with investment, but it should not be harming people’s requirement for secure habitation or their health. A glance at the selfish system in the US would confirm this. In Europe (although possibly not France) they have been known to vote for extra taxes when they see a benefit for the whole country. Donald Hawes, Peel
Angus Taylor’s desire to reduce our housing problem to simple economics is laudable – however, price is a function of supply and demand, not supply alone. And reducing investor demand by reducing the CGT discount and negative gearing would materially reduce demand. Michael Britt, MacMasters Beach
Nuclear charged
Peter Hartcher (“US will not save us from nuke attack”, February 17) explodes the myth that Australia is safe under America’s nuclear umbrella, especially as the Trump administration has pledged to give far greater strategic priority to the defence of the American homeland. Central to Hartcher’s argument is the sheer impossibility of expecting the US to launch a retaliatory nuclear strike upon an adversary that has first attacked Australia. The adversary would then launch its own retaliatory strike on the US, killing countless millions of Americans. More concerning is that, unlike during the Cold War, the US now faces two near-peer nuclear competitors, Russia and China, which raises the nuclear stakes to an unprecedented level. Hence, Hartcher suggests the following solution for Australia and all other US allies: “a country at risk needs the deterrent power of nuclear arms even if it has no intention of launching a nuclear war”. But if our survival becomes solely dependent upon a weapon of such highly destructive capacity, how is this not the most damning indictment upon the moral conscience of humanity? Rev Vincent Zankin, Rivett (ACT)
Higher education tested
The university sector is under siege (“Criminal syndicates make millions from uni cheating”, February 17). International students are targeted for contract assignment cheating, and domestic students are drawn into the AI net and used inappropriately for their assessment tasks. And the result is that most get away with it. University management needs to toughen up; make students return to on-site written exams (mid-semester and/or end semester) and where that is not possible, online oral exams. Education is too important to allow this to be an easy cash cow business model. Michael Blissenden, Dural
MacLeod’s journey a time to reflect
Thank you, Andrew MacLeod, for your wonderful article (“What I’ve learnt from all nations”, February 17). Your journey in visiting every country in the world has not been part of a “bucket list” but one of purpose involving humanitarian values and desire to make a difference. People like you have made a huge difference in my life; my childhood started in former Yugoslavia before and during the war, then two different refugee camps from 1944 to 1949 in Austria until settling in Australia. I was fortunate that at age 15, where at Penrith, I had wonderful teachers who saw some potential and spent additional time and effort to help me matriculate in my third language, leading to scholarships and a teaching career. I absolutely admire and support your conclusions. We all want a better future for our children not in terms of wealth, but in the privilege of being able to help others. As for safety and vigilance, I believe our future is enhanced and assured by our multicultural population and trade links rather than belligerence and more powerful weapons. Ferdo Mathews, Robina (Qld)
Andrew MacLeod says one lesson he draws from visiting every country in the world is that “one should never feel guilty about one’s privilege. Only feel guilty if you do nothing with it.” Australia is a privileged country on many measures, such as the Human Development Index, where we rank seventh in the world. Yet, we also read that 53 per cent of Australians polled want to see cuts to our foreign aid in the upcoming budget (“Voters want spending cuts – but immunity as well”, February 17). However, Australia’s official development assistance has already been severely reduced, to just 0.19 per cent of gross national income in 2024 compared to 0.29 per cent in 2015, which has dropped our ranking from 15th to 28th globally. With the US and many other countries slashing their foreign aid, now is the time for Australia to use its privileged position to do more, not less, for the world’s poor. Clay O’Brien, Mosman
What an amazing life Andrew MacLeod has had and how precious are the lessons that he has learned while helping in so many crisis situations around the world. As we strive for a better world, it is important to remember how privileged we are in Australia. We should never take that for granted and should be willing and ready to use the benefits we enjoy to help others – both near and far. Philip Cooney, Wentworth Falls
All those who are influential in deciding the future of both Australia and our planet need to pay attention to what Professor Andrew MacLeod tells us that he has learned from visiting every country on earth, namely, that all families in the world are linked by wanting a better future for their children, the privileged should use their position for the betterment of others, and we need to guard our values of tolerance and multiculturalism. Principles based on these observations should underlie the policy platform of every Australian political party, and those that lack any of them are too narrow and shallow in their thinking and attitudes to warrant having any of their members as representatives in our country’s parliament. Paul Casey, Callala Bay
A timely reminder from Andrew MacLeod that if we want to continue to protect what makes our country such a wonderful place, then tolerance and multiculturalism must be at the heart of our being.Josephine Piper, Miranda
We must indeed be vigilant to protect the tolerance and multiculturalism that make Australia great. Ramadan Mubarak, Happy Ramadan, to all Muslim Australians. Christine McNeil, Ballina
Beware AI tsunami
At last. Some unease about the imminent AI tsunami (Letters, February 17). It signals “the end of human history”, according to historian Yuval Noah Harari. And who could dispute that? No room in a letter to the editor for many details but check out the wave of domestic and industrial humanoid robots about to break over us. A few years and they’ll be like phones and cars; we’ll all want one. And how about algorithmic governance (AI-mediated law and policy, rule by optimisation etc). Sounds like fun. Now combine this with the extraordinary acceleration in bioengineering. Artificial wombs, designer babies etc. And is anyone keeping up with the surge in post-death avatars? It really is time we talked about all this. Millennia of philosophy and religion now face irrelevance. Brian Haisman, Winmalee
I’ve been fearful of AI for several years, since hearing one of the foremost experts in the field describe how it might determine the best solution to tough problems, in a dispassionate and efficient way. If asked what would be the quickest and most effective way to deal with climate change and global warming, the answer could well be to eliminate all human beings. Connect it to automated weapons systems, and The Terminator scenario may not be fantasy after all. Alan Marel, North Curl Curl
Force discounts
If the courts establish that Coles is guilty of creating spurious discounts that in fact result in higher prices for products (“ACCC flags up ‘half-truths’ in prices as Coles hearing begins”, February 17), and the penalty is $50 million per breach, then Coles should be made to pay that by offering $50 million worth of genuine discounts across its stores nationwide for every breach. That would be fair compensation to the public and might go a little way in helping meet the cost of living pressures. Leo Sorbello, Leichhardt
Up in smoke
The trouble with an “independent” retail grocery store calling for the excise on cigarettes (legal tobacco) be cut (“Cut smokes tax to undermine criminals, says retailer”, February 17) to stop illegal sales is that they have a vested interest to sell more cigarettes. The government should just make smoking illegal, but that means losing income and a fight with the tobacco industry. Jenny Greenwood, Hunters Hill
Mogul malaise
I’ve had to make an urgent appointment with my physiotherapist. After watching the mogul skiing at the Olympics, my hips and knees are shot. Michael Deeth, Como West

Israeli firm Autonomous Guard enters Indian defense market with $1.9m deal

Israeli company Autonomous Guard has secured its first foothold in the Indian security market through a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) valued at approximately $1.9 million, the company announced on Monday.
The agreement, signed with an undisclosed Indian security client, covers the gradual supply of advanced surveillance and threat‑detection systems developed by BeeSense Sensor Systems, Autonomous Guard’s wholly owned subsidiary, specializing in sensor‑based observation technologies.
Defense & Tech by The Jerusalem Post understands that the deal is for the company’s Bee 3 dual-channel observation and surveillance system, providing powerful day-and-night performance.
According to the company, it is designed specifically for homeland security and critical infrastructure protection and delivers mid-range detection and identification capabilities through advanced thermal and CMOS technologies. The ruggedized platform is engineered to operate in extreme weather and demanding field conditions, offering dependable situational awareness across a broad spectrum of security applications.
Autonomous Guard CEO Baruch Dillion described the deal as a significant milestone for the company’s expansion strategy.
“The engagement with the Indian security client represents an important milestone for BeeSense Sensor Systems,” he said. “This transaction marks the company’s first entry into the Indian market, which we view as having substantial business potential.”
Under the terms of the MoU, delivery of the systems will begin following a successful demonstration. The first units are expected to be supplied within six months of the demo, with additional deliveries continuing over a nine‑month period.
Autonomous Guard operates through two primary subsidiaries, Skylock and BeeSense Sensor Systems. Skylock specializes in drone detection and neutralization, while BeeSense Sensor Systems is a pioneer in border threat detection across land, air, and sea. Both companies serve military and homeland security customers globally.
BeeSense Sensor Systems has seen growing momentum in recent years, including orders from Israel’s Defense Ministry last year. The company develops systems for ground, aerial, and maritime threat detection, capabilities that are increasingly relevant as militaries worldwide invest in border‑protection and situational‑awareness technologies.
Israeli defense companies expand partnerships with India
The Indian deal aligns with a broader trend of Israeli defense firms deepening ties with India, which has become one of the world’s largest importers of defense technologies.
India has been increasing procurement of advanced surveillance and counter‑threat systems as part of its broader modernization efforts, especially after Operation Sindoor, its response to Pakistan’s deadly attack last year.
Autonomous Guard’s announcement comes a week before Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expected to visit Israel as the two countries work on strengthening bilateral ties in defense, counter-terrorism, and emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence (AI).
According to a report in Forbes India, India and Israel have agreed to arms deals worth $8.6 billion – transforming the Jewish state into the Hindu country’s largest weapons supplier after France.
The package includes Rafael Advanced Defence Systems’ SPICE 1000 guidance kits, Elbit Systems’ Rampage air-to-ground missiles, Ice Breaker naval cruise missiles, and Israel Aerospace Industries’ supersonic Air LORA missiles.
The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) highlights India as the biggest customer of Israel's defense industries. Between 2020 and 2024, India accounted for about 34% of Israel's defense exports. Figures from the Defense Ministry’s International Defense Cooperation Directorate (SIBAT) indicate that total arms sales by Israel to India during this period amounted to about $20.5 billion.
In November, the two countries signed an MoU to expand their “defense, industrial, and technological cooperation.”
An article by the Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD) reported that the MoU addresses joint production of military equipment and increased bilateral collaboration related to training, science, technology, and research and development (R&D), including in areas such as AI and cybersecurity.
Autonomous Guard noted that a successful rollout could pave the way for additional sales to the same client and strengthen the company’s position in India’s rapidly expanding defense‑tech market.

IDF ramping up strikes on Lebanon's Hezbollah in preparation for Iran conflict - report

The IDF has been escalating its strikes on terror targets in Lebanon in recent days in preparation for another round of war with Iran, N12 News reported on Monday evening.
According to the outlet, the military’s ramping up of attacks on these targets, which have seen strikes on Hezbollah’s operatives, rocket launchers, and weapons stores, has been part of an effort to cripple the terrorist organization’s ability to aid Iran in a potential conflict.
According to Maariv, since the start of February, the IDF has killed 12 Hezbollah and Islamic Jihad terrorists in the country.
On Monday, the IDF confirmed that, over the past week, the 91st Division had killed four Hezbollah terrorists who had been operating to reestablish the organization’s infrastructure in Lebanon.
The latest strike on one of the terrorists who had been operating to rehabilitate the terror group’s infrastructure occured earlier that day in the Tallouseh area of southern Lebanon.
“As part of his role, [the terrorist] was responsible for the connection between the organization and the residents of the village on military and economic issues, and worked to seize private properties for terrorist purposes,” the IDF said at the time.
The military’s action marked the second terrorist it had killed in the country within a 12-hour period on Monday, the IDF noted.
IDF action comes amid Hezbollah ceasefire infractions
A ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah went into effect in November of 2024 following an intensive Israeli military campaign triggered by Hezbollah attacks that began the day after the October 7, 2023, massacre in southern Israel.
During the conflict, Israeli military action decimated Hezbollah’s ranks and senior leadership. Since the ceasefire went into effect, the IDF has continued to strike at terrorist operatives who have been engaging in activities that violate the ceasefire conditions.
In November of last year, the IDF said that it had killed Hezbollah had killed over 370 Hezbollah fighters since the ceasefire began. The following month, the military said the terror group had committed some 1,900 ceasefire infractions.

Canavan attacks Hanson over anti-Muslim comments
Nationals senator Matt Canavan has attacked Pauline Hanson for suggesting there are no “good” Muslims, as the Coalition’s new leadership tries to walk the line between wooing back One Nation voters and celebrating Australia’s multiculturalism.
Hanson unleashed during a Sky News appearance late on Monday while discussing the IS brides and children seeking repatriation to Australia, making comments even her star recruit, Barnaby Joyce, would not clearly endorse on Tuesday.
“Their religion concerns me because what it says in the Koran … they hate Westerners,” Hanson said.
“You say, oh, well, there’s good Muslims out there. Well, I’m sorry, how can you tell me there are good Muslims?”
Hanson defended herself against backlash on Tuesday in a post on X, saying media were not used to “hearing a politician tell the truth without worrying about political correctness”.
Hanson’s anti-Muslim rhetoric is consistent: she said during her 2016 maiden speech to the Senate that lives would be destroyed while waiting to distinguish between “good” and “bad” Muslims. But a decade later, the minor party leader has a bigger platform as One Nation surges in the polls and gains traction with its anti-immigration agenda.
Hanson’s attempt to lump all Muslims in with extremists has marked out battle lines on the conservative flank of Australian politics heading into the next election.
Canavan, who will go up against Hanson in the Queensland Senate race at the next election, questioned Hanson’s ability to credibly take on the Coalition and Labor.
“It is these kinds of ill-disciplined comments that make people worry that Pauline just doesn’t have what it takes to lead a major party,” he said on Tuesday. Canavan pointed to Ahmed al Ahmed, the man who tackled one of the Bondi gunmen during the attack in December.
“He is an Australian hero – and Muslim,” the Nationals senator said.
“Our focus must be on rooting out radical Islam, which the vast majority of Australian Muslims do not espouse.”
One Nation MP Barnaby Joyce appeared to equivocate over his leader’s comments on Tuesday morning.
“Well, that’s – I believe that there are people who are of the Islamic faith who obviously I know. So I’m not going to say that I don’t have people who are friends of Islamic faith. I do, but I’m not going to say because of that, I’m going to put so many people at risk,” he told Today.
Joyce went on to say he agreed “100 per cent with Pauline” that people were coming to Australia with values “generationally at odds with what Australia is”.
The former National MP and deputy prime minister has boasted of the credibility he has brought to One Nation since defecting from the Nationals in December.
But he has been forced to distance himself from Hanson’s burqa stunt after she donned the religious garment in the Senate just weeks before he joined her party. Joyce told Four Corners on Monday that behaviour “does not work for me”.
Opposition Leader Angus Taylor, still marking out the party’s direction after ousting Sussan Ley late last week, was on Tuesday trying to toe the line between drawing back disaffected voters drifting to One Nation while celebrating diverse Australians.
In a long and wide-ranging interview on the Kyle and Jackie O Show, Taylor appealed directly to voters fleeing the Coalition, saying the opposition could protect their way of life “the right way”, while also offering a better standard of living.
“Whoever is thinking of voting for One Nation, we respect why. We understand why you’re saying that the Liberal Party has to be better,” Taylor said on Tuesday, having taken a hard line on immigration in his first press conference as Liberal leader on Friday.
“We want you to support us and restore confidence in us because we believe we can offer not only protecting your way of life, [Hanson] makes a big deal of that. I think we can do this the right way, but we can also focus on restoring your standard of living, getting back to home ownership, being part of the Australian dream.”
Taylor, who has said he was confident the Coalition could also appeal to the inner-city seats lost to independents, touted his appreciation for diverse cultures, saying he would visit Melbourne this weekend to celebrate Chinese New Year.
“I actually celebrate the incredible multicultural communities,” Taylor said.
“I find that people who have come to this country, first generation, they love this country more than almost anyone else because they know the change between what they came from and what we are. I find that really exhilarating. I love it.”

Unemployment has unexpectedly risen to its highest level for five years and wage growth has slowed again as the UK jobs market continues to come under pressure, according to official figures.
The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the rate of unemployment lifted to 5.2% in the three months to December, up from 5.1% in the three months to November.
This was the highest since the three months to January 2021 and the highest for over a decade outside of the pandemic era.
Most economists had expected unemployment to remain at 5.1% in the latest quarter.
The ONS added that regular wage growth fell back once again, to 4.2% in the three months to December, against a downwardly-revised 4.4% in the three months to November, and was 0.8% higher after taking Consumer Prices Index inflation into account.
But there was a welcome increase in vacancies, up by 2,000 quarter-on-quarter to 726,000 in the three months to January.
Liz McKeown, ONS director of economic statistics, said the data showed “more people who were out of work are now actively looking for a job”.
She added: “The number of vacancies has remained broadly stable since the middle of last year.
“Alongside rising unemployment this means that the number of unemployed people per vacancy has increased, reaching a new post-pandemic high.
“Meanwhile, redundancies are also showing an upward trend.”

MOSCOW, February 17. /TASS/. State testing of a universal filling truck for Russian military aircraft will be finished in 2026, said Vladimir Demirov, head of the Russian Defense Ministry’s Main Rocket Fuel and Propellant Department.
"Another pressing task in upgrading the fleet of aviation fuel service equipment is the creation of a universal special liquids tanker on the Ural-43206 chassis. Its prototype is built using a 'five-in-one' design, which will replace three obsolete special liquids tankers designed in the Soviet era. It is planned to complete state tests of the new model in 2026," Demirov wrote in a column for the Krasnaya Zvezda newspaper.
According to him, the unique feature of the new technology is that a single chassis combines the functions of a tanker for aviation oils and oil mixtures, alcohol and water-alcohol mixtures, as well as hydraulic fluids. The new universal tanker will make it possible to handle the entire range of aircraft filling tasks with special liquids using just one piece of equipment.

DTEK needs additional EUR 150 mln to restore 4 GW of generation for next winter – CEO
DTEK Group has estimated the cost of restoring its own generation damaged by the Russians at EUR 300 million and, in addition to using its own resources, requires an additional EUR 150 million in external financing to carry out work to prepare for next winter.
DTEK CEO Maksym Tymchenko announced the figures at the "Energy Warfare: How to Unplug Tyranny" roundtable, organized by the Kyiv Security Forum on the sidelines of the 62nd Munich Security Conference.
"For our company, we have defined a restoration budget for damaged assets of EUR 300 million by next year. Half of that amount we have already secured from our own resources. Now we are turning to colleagues and partners with a request to cover the remainder — approximately EUR 150 million — to restore 4,000 megawatts of capacity," he said.
The CEO added that the restored capacity would be sufficient for DTEK to get through the 2026-27 heating season.
Timchenko said restoring thermal power plants and combined heat and power plants is the fastest and least expensive path to preparing for the next winter, requiring lower investment.
"And we know how to do it. But equipment orders need to be placed right now," he said.
The CEO explained that from the moment funding is allocated to the moment equipment is connected, a minimum of 10 months pass, making May of this year a "red line" by which a clear financing and work execution plan must be in place to ensure completion before winter sets in.
"By May, we need full clarity at the government level: here is the list of equipment we need, here is the source of funding, and we are placing manufacturing orders… In the matter of restoring damaged substations and generation capacity, May is the deadline," he stressed.

Russian and Ukrainian delegations are set to meet in Geneva on Tuesday, Feb. 17, for another round of Washington-brokered talks aimed at ending the war.
Ahead of the negotiations, US President Donald Trump urged Kyiv to move quickly toward an agreement.

“Ukraine better come to the table, fast,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One on Monday.
Two previous US-mediated rounds in Abu Dhabi produced no breakthrough. While both sides described the discussions as productive, they remained deeply divided over territory, with Moscow maintaining demands for sweeping political and territorial concessions – terms Kyiv rejects as capitulation.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russia’s continued strikes underscore its attitude toward diplomacy.
“Even on the eve of the trilateral meetings in Geneva, the Russian army has no orders other than to continue striking Ukraine. This speaks volumes about how Russia regards the partners’ diplomatic efforts,” Zelensky wrote on social media.
“Only with sufficient pressure on Russia and clear security guarantees for Ukraine can this war realistically be brought to an end,” he added.
The Kremlin said the Geneva talks will be held behind closed doors with no media present.
Meanwhile, Ukraine has reported recent battlefield gains, recapturing 201 square kilometers (78 square miles) last week, according to an AFP analysis of data from the Institute for the Study of War.
Munich Conference: Rubio’s Message to Partners
ISW said the counterattacks likely exploited Russian communication problems linked to disrupted access to Starlink.
Most of the gains were concentrated about 80 kilometers east of Zaporizhzhia, an area near Europe’s largest nuclear power plant, which remains under Russian control and is expected to feature in negotiations.
For the Geneva talks, Moscow has reinstated nationalist hardliner and former culture minister Vladimir Medinsky as chief negotiator.
“This time, we plan to discuss a broader set of issues, focusing on key ones related to the territories and other demands,” a spokesperson for Vladimir Putin told reporters, explaining the personnel change.
Medinsky is an ideologue close to Vladimir Putin, who has been linked to Kremlin propaganda efforts in Russian-occupied Ukrainian territories. He also heads the Russian Military Historical Society.
Observers have recalled his role in earlier talks, where he cited fabricated quotes attributed to Napoleon Bonaparte and Otto von Bismarck – claims later debunked by Ukrainian officials and historians.
Kyiv’s delegation will be led by former Defense Minister Rustem Umerov, with Presidential Office chief Kyrylo Budanov also taking part. The White House is expected to send Special Envoy Steve Witkoff and President Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner.
Russian media reported that Moscow will dispatch a delegation of at least 15 people, including Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Galuzin.
Umerov said on Telegram Monday evening, Feb. 16, that the Ukrainian delegation had already arrived in Geneva.
According to Umerov, the agenda has been agreed in advance and the team is ready to work. He stressed that Ukrainian officials are prepared for constructive dialogue and substantive discussions on security and humanitarian issues, with the aim of moving toward a dignified and sustainable peace.
Kyiv plans to raise the issue of an “energy truce.”
Russia, meanwhile, has said it intends to discuss territorial questions under the so-called “Anchorage formula,” which envisions freezing the front line and formalizing Russian control over Donbas.
Russian officials arrived in Geneva early Tuesday for talks, a source in the delegation told AFP. The aircraft carrying the Russian team landed at around 8 a.m. Kyiv time (06:00 GMT), the source said.
Russia’s Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said last week that negotiations remain far from complete, dismissing optimistic claims of progress.
Referring to earlier talks in Abu Dhabi, he said there was “still a long way to go,” while earlier accusing Washington of backing away from proposals discussed in Anchorage.
Trump told reporters on Feb. 13 that Zelensky was “going to have to get moving” on peace talks.
“Russia wants to make a deal, and Zelensky’s going to have to get moving, otherwise he’s going to miss a great opportunity. He has to move,” he said as he departed the White House for North Carolina.

Bangladesh's newly elected lawmakers sworn in, Tarique Rahman set to take oath as premier
Rahman elected leader of house, set to take oath as prime minister later Tuesday
DHAKA, Bangladesh
The newly elected 297 lawmakers from the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and the Jamaat-e-Islami-led bloc took oath on Tuesday for the 13th parliament.
The lawmakers were elected last week in historic elections on Thursday, the first since the 2024 July Uprising that ended the 15-year rule of the Awami League party, whose Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina fled to India.
Chief Election Commissioner AMM Nasir Uddin administered the oath to the newly elected lawmakers.
Of the 300-seat parliament, elections on three seats were postponed.
Awami League had held elections in January 2024, which were boycotted by the BNP-Jamaat opposition, and months later, its government was toppled in mass demonstrations, dubbed the July Uprising.
Tarique Rahman elected leader of house
Soon after taking the oath, the BNP held its first parliamentary meeting and elected Tarique Rahman as the leader of the house and nominated him as the prime minister-elect, the party said in a statement on the US social media platform Facebook.
Rahman and his Cabinet of some three dozen members will take the oath later in the day.
BNP, along with allies, won a two-thirds majority with the support of 212 lawmakers.
Notably, the BNP lawmakers did not take a separate oath as members of the Constitutional Reform Council, which was mandated by the referendum held simultaneously with the general election last Thursday.
The Jamaat-led bloc took oath as members of the Constitutional Reform Council but protested the BNP decision.
The Constitutional Reform Council was mandated after all political parties agreed to the July National Charter for reforms in the country, for which a referendum was simultaneously held during the elections last week.
The referendum received an overwhelming “yes” vote.
BNP chairman Tarique, 60, son of former prime minister the late Khaleda Zia and slain President Ziaur Rahman, is set to become prime minister.
Rahman himself returned home last December after 17 years in exile in the United Kingdom.
Besides the 300 elected seats, there are 50 reserved women’s seats in the parliament, which will be nominated by the political parties based on their representation in the parliament once the parliament session begins.
Once Rahman and his Cabinet are sworn in later in the day, the 20-member interim government led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus will hand over power to the new government.
The interim government was formed after Hasina fled to India on Aug. 5, 2024, following the end of his regime during protests, which saw some 1,400 people, mostly youths, killed and thousands of others injured in the uprising.
Yunus and his team took office on Aug. 8 and held elections last week, resulting in Bangladesh’s first elected government in 18 months.

Who are the ISIS brides trying to get home?

Who are the ISIS brides trying to get home?
Eleven family groups – 34 individuals – who have been stuck in Syrian internment camps for years are trying to make their way home. Who are they and what do they say about how they got into Syria?
This is what we know about six of them.
Nesrine Zahab
Nesrine Zahab, from Sydney, was 21 when she claims she was tricked into going into Syria by her cousin Muhammad Zahab – who was at the centre of a network that delivered at least a dozen family members into the so-called caliphate.
She told the ABC she and a female cousin had been in Turkey to help refugees from the civil war on the Turkish side of the Syrian border and had no intention of entering the war-torn country.
“I had a whole thing going on. I was doing uni,” she said on Four Corners in 2019. “Who walks into a war zone? I was going to see Syrians, yes, because of what they’re going through.”
She married IS fighter Ahmed Merhi – a friend of her cousin’s – and gave birth to a son, Abdul Rahman, in the al-Roj camp in northern Syria in 2019. Merhi was convicted and sentenced to death by hanging in Baghdad in 2018.
Zahab is in on the record saying she is willing to help Australian authorities.
Aminah Zahab
The mother of Muhammad Zahab also says she and her husband, Hicham, were also tricked by her son into going to Syria. She told the ABC in 2019: “We’re clueless parents; we had a lot of trust in our children.
“As we raised our children, we just let the children rule our lives … I feel very angry.”
Kirsty Rosse-Emile
Rosse-Emile was the Melbourne-based daughter of two former Christians who converted to Islam when she was nine. She grew up in a close-knit family home in south-east Melbourne and attended the Muslim private school Minaret College.
Her social media posts as a young teen showed a flirtation with the idea of jihad, along with a love of pizza, chocolate and the Fremantle Dockers AFL club.
At 19, in 2014, she travelled to Syria after meeting and marrying a much older Moroccan immigrant, Nabil Kadmiry – a one-time attendee of the infamous al-Furqan prayer room in Melbourne. Kadmiry then became an IS fighter and took Rosse-Emile to Syria.
Her father said in 2019: “I know Kirsty didn’t fight, she was just a housewife.”
Zahra Ahmed
Formerly from Melbourne, Ahmed was the most talkative of the group of women I met at the al-Hawl camp in Syria in 2019. She’s part of the largest single Australian family in the internment camps in the north-east of Syria.
She insisted she and her family, led by patriarch Mohammed, left their home in Melbourne’s outer suburbs to do humanitarian work in the region. She said they were abruptly prevented from leaving Syria when Islamic State closed the borders of its self-proclaimed “caliphate”.
Some male members of her family reportedly joined the IS group, but Ahmed insists the women had no choice but to follow. She said they had suffered under the strictures of IS, and wanted nothing more but to return home, help police as much as they could and raise their children as Australians.
“We’re willing to talk, and we’re willing to tell them and we’re willing to share our stories,” she said. “But they haven’t even tried to come and reach out to us, and when we ask they don’t want to.”
Kawsar Abbas
An older relative of Zahra Ahmed and the wife of the patriarch, Mohammed Ahmed, who told the ABC in 2019 that they had travelled from the headquarters in Turkey of the charity they were working for – Global Humanitarian Aid – to attend the wedding of his son, Omar, in 2014. Then the border closed.
The charity was at one time suspected of directing resources towards Islamic State – a charge the family denies. A number of the male members of the family fought for Islamic State.
Kawsar insisted the women were unwitting victims.
She told us in 2019 she feared the coming winter, and the small children’s health: “One of our tents flooded and then it dried up ... But winter is not going to be like that. It’s not going to dry up,” she said.
Hodan Abby
Abby, from a Somalian family in Sydney, ran away from home with a friend when she was 18 after reportedly telling their parents they were going on a holiday. The pair reportedly entered Syria willingly with hopes of becoming jihadi brides. The parents of her friend believe she was radicalised online.
Abby had a daughter in Syria who suffers from wounds she received when she was a baby, with shrapnel in her head, back and hip making it difficult for her to walk and causing delayed speech and development. Abby also has a piece of shrapnel in her chest.
Abby told this masthead in 2021 she agreed to be under a Terrorism Control Order, which would give the government powers to monitor her.

Jewish Pirates of the Caribbean: the untold story
Unknown
Unknown Publisher

16:25:20 KST

In a cemetery outside Kingston, Jamaica, several weathered tombstones stand apart. Their inscriptions are in Hebrew. Carved above some of the lettering is an unexpected emblem: a skull and crossbones.
The graves belong to some of the earliest European settlers of Jamaica — Spanish and Portuguese Jews who fled persecution in Iberia and rebuilt their lives at the edge of empire. In the upheavals of the 16th and 17th centuries, some of those exiles became merchants, diplomats and, in certain cases, privateers operating in the violent maritime conflicts of the Mediterranean and Atlantic worlds. Their story begins in 1492.
In March of that year, Spain’s Catholic monarchs, Ferdinand and Isabella, issued the Alhambra Decree ordering all Jews in their realms to convert to Christianity or leave within four months. The edict came as the monarchs consolidated political control after completing the Reconquista with the conquest of Granada, the last Muslim-ruled kingdom in Iberia.
For centuries, Jewish communities had lived in Iberia, some tracing their presence to Roman times. By the late Middle Ages, however, anti-Jewish violence had intensified. In 1391, widespread massacres and forced baptisms dramatically reduced Spain’s openly Jewish population and created a large class of conversos — Jews who converted to Christianity, voluntarily or under duress.
Many conversos integrated into Christian society. Others were suspected of secretly maintaining Jewish practices, becoming targets of suspicion. In 1478, Ferdinand and Isabella established the Spanish Inquisition to investigate heresy among New Christians. The institution evolved into a permanent bureaucracy that relied on denunciations, secret testimony and, in some cases, torture. Convicted individuals could face imprisonment, confiscation of property or public execution in ceremonies known as autos-da-fé.
By 1492, religious conformity had become central to the crown’s vision of political unity. Jews who chose exile were required to sell property quickly and were barred from exporting gold, silver or arms, often forcing them to accept goods or promissory notes of uncertain value. Many lost their wealth in the process. Families crowded the roads to port cities, uncertain of where they would land.
That same year, Christopher Columbus departed on his first voyage across the Atlantic. His expedition left just days after the expulsion deadline. The twin events — expulsion and exploration — would soon become intertwined in ways few could have anticipated.
The expelled Jews, later known as Sephardim from the Hebrew word for Spain, scattered across the Mediterranean and beyond. Many found refuge in the Ottoman Empire, whose rulers welcomed skilled migrants. Others settled in North Africa — in cities such as Fez, Tunis and Algiers — where established Jewish communities already existed. Some eventually reached the Netherlands, where the Dutch Republic’s emerging policy of religious tolerance created new opportunities.
A significant number of Sephardic Jews had experience in maritime trade. They were merchants, navigators and cartographers, fluent in multiple languages and familiar with Iberian ports and shipping routes. In their new homes, these skills became valuable assets.
In North Africa, corsairing — state-sanctioned maritime raiding — was already embedded in regional politics. Muslim rulers and Ottoman authorities issued commissions to private captains to attack enemy shipping, particularly Spanish and Portuguese vessels. Some Sephardic Jews participated directly in this world, while others financed voyages, brokered goods or provided intelligence.
One of the earliest figures associated with Jewish involvement in Mediterranean privateering was Sinan Reis, described in European correspondence as “Sinan the Jew.” Though details of his origins remain debated, he is widely believed to have come from a family expelled from Iberia and to have risen within Ottoman naval ranks.
By the early 16th century, the Ottoman Empire and Habsburg Spain were locked in a prolonged struggle for dominance in the Mediterranean. The famed corsair Hayreddin Barbarossa entered Ottoman service and was appointed grand admiral by Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent. Sinan served as one of his close lieutenants.
In 1534, Ottoman forces seized Tunis, seeking to establish a strategic base in North Africa. Spanish forces under Charles V retook the city the following year in a massive expedition. In 1538, at the Battle of Preveza, Barbarossa’s fleet decisively defeated a Holy League navy assembled by the pope and Spain’s allies, cementing Ottoman naval dominance in the eastern Mediterranean for decades.
The corsair world was brutal. Both Christian and Muslim fleets relied heavily on enslaved oarsmen. Raids devastated coastal communities from Italy to Spain and North Africa. While some Jewish exiles saw participation as a form of retaliation against former persecutors or simply as economic opportunity, they operated within a system marked by violence and coercion.
By the early 17th century, attention shifted northward to the Dutch Republic, which had broken from Spanish rule and was fighting a global conflict against Iberian power.
Samuel Pallache, born in Fez around 1550 to a Sephardic family expelled from Spain, became one of the era’s most complex figures. Educated in Jewish law and active in trade, Pallache entered the service of the Moroccan sultan as a diplomat and intermediary.
In 1610, he helped negotiate a treaty of friendship and commerce between Morocco and the Dutch Republic — among the first formal agreements between a North African Muslim state and a European power. Under Moroccan commission, he also engaged in privateering against Spanish vessels.
In 1614, after capturing Spanish ships, Pallache docked in England and was arrested following pressure from the Spanish ambassador, who demanded his execution as a pirate. Dutch officials intervened, asserting that Pallache was a licensed privateer acting on behalf of a sovereign ally. English authorities ultimately released him, treating him as a diplomatic figure rather than a criminal.
Pallache died in 1616 in Amsterdam, where Prince Maurice of Nassau and members of the Jewish community attended his funeral. His life spanned Morocco, Spain, the Netherlands and England — reflecting the fluid loyalties and shifting alliances of the age.
Across the Atlantic, Sephardic Jews and conversos also played roles in the expanding colonial world. Despite Spanish purity-of-blood laws barring Jews and their descendants from settling in the New World, some reached colonies in Mexico, Peru and Brazil through forged documents or by concealing their ancestry. The Inquisition followed them overseas, conducting trials in Mexico City, Lima and beyond.
In Amsterdam, a new generation of Sephardic Jews aligned with Dutch commercial and military ventures. Among them was Moses Cohen Henriquez, whose family had fled Iberian persecution and rebuilt their lives in the Netherlands.
In 1628, Dutch forces captured part of the Spanish treasure fleet in the Bay of Matanzas, Cuba — one of the most lucrative maritime seizures in history. Henriquez is believed to have contributed intelligence that aided the operation. The captured wealth significantly bolstered Dutch war finances.
He later participated in Dutch campaigns in northeastern Brazil, where a period of relative religious tolerance allowed Jews to establish open congregations and synagogues. When Portugal retook Brazil in 1654, some Jewish settlers relocated to New Amsterdam, forming one of North America’s earliest Jewish communities. Others moved to the Caribbean.
Jamaica became a focal point after English forces captured the island from Spain in 1655. Seeking to strengthen the colony and weaken Spanish power, English authorities permitted Jewish settlement. Sephardic merchants, traders and former privateers helped develop Jamaica’s economy, particularly in sugar production and transatlantic trade.
By the late 17th century, Kingston had a visible and prosperous Jewish community. Synagogues were built with sand-covered floors — a Sephardic custom recalling centuries of secret worship under Iberian persecution. Hebrew-inscribed tombstones in Jamaican cemeteries reflect families whose journeys spanned Spain, North Africa, the Netherlands and the Caribbean.
The notion of “Jewish pirates” has often been romanticized, and historians caution that documentation remains uneven. Some figures are clearly attested in naval and diplomatic records; others appear only briefly in hostile European accounts. Not every Sephardic merchant took up arms at sea, and not every corsair labeled “the Jew” in contemporary sources can be firmly identified.
Still, archival records confirm that Sephardic exiles and their descendants were active participants in privateering networks aligned with Ottoman, Moroccan, Dutch and English interests. They appear in treaties, court transcripts, shipping logs and colonial charters.
By the late 1600s, Jewish communities stretched from Amsterdam and London to Recife, New Amsterdam and Kingston, connected by kinship and commerce across oceans shaped by war and empire. Some of those communities traced part of their history not only through synagogues and markets, but through ships, naval battles and captured cargo.
In the cemetery outside Kingston, the Hebrew letters have faded with time. The skull and crossbones carved above them remain.

India’s huge new megaport off Southeast Asia gets green go-ahead
The new port, airport, power plant and township on Great Nicobar island, northwest of Indonesia, will cover an estimated 166 sq km
The infrastructure plan involves building a transshipment port, airport, power plant and a township on the island, located close to the Strait of Malacca, one of the world’s busiest shipping lanes. It aims to transform about 166 sq km (64 square miles), or nearly 18 per cent, of Great Nicobar’s total land area.
India’s environment minister last September called it a project of “strategic, defence and national importance” which would transform Great Nicobar into a major hub of maritime and air connectivity in the Indian Ocean region.
The Andaman and Nicobar archipelago has also long been seen within India as key to countering China’s growing influence in the region.
But activists say the infrastructure drive may adversely impact the ecology of the island, result in the felling of hundreds of thousands of trees and harm the interests of local tribal groups.

The duration of daily fasting during Ramadan for the more than two billion Muslims around the world varies depending on location and time of year.
Countries at southern latitudes will observe the longest daily fasting periods — extending to around 15 hours — while countries at northern latitudes will experience this year’s shortest fasting durations, typically around 12 hours.
The Islamic month of Ramadan — which is set to begin around February 18 in many parts of the globe after the sighting of the New Moon — is considered the holiest month of the year to Muslims, who abstain from eating and drinking from dawn until dusk for 29 to 30 days.
The month of fasting is then followed by the Eid al Fitr celebration.

Philippines rebukes China embassy over ‘coercive’ warning of job losses
Diplomatic dispute escalates as Beijing and Manila present competing narratives in the contested South China Sea.
The Philippines has criticised China’s embassy in Manila, after the diplomatic mission warned that deteriorating bilateral relations between the two countries could cost millions of jobs.
The Department of Foreign Affairs said late on Monday it took “strong exception” to the Chinese embassy’s tone, accusing Beijing’s diplomats of implying that economic cooperation could be weaponised as leverage.

“This framing risks being perceived as coercive and undermines constructive bilateral dialogue,” the department said in a statement.
The Philippines and China have had repeated maritime confrontations in the contested South China Sea, and the latest dispute has its roots in a presentation by Commodore Jay Tarriela, a senior Philippine Coast Guard official, at an academic forum, in which he displayed a caricature of Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Beijing’s embassy in Manila demanded that Tarriela be held “accountable” for what it called “smears and slanders” – a reaction that itself provoked a sharp rebuke from the Philippine Senate.
Lawmakers passed a resolution condemning the embassy’s intervention as “improper”, declaring that Commodore Tarriela had been acting within his duties. Some senators went further, calling for the expulsion of Chinese embassy officials or the recall of Ambassador Jing Quan.
The Chinese embassy’s spokesman Ji Lingpeng subsequently issued a stark warning, saying that “any serious damage to diplomatic relations, including downgrading of those relations, would cost millions of jobs.”
In its statement, the Department of Foreign Affairs urged the Chinese embassy to “adopt a responsible and measured tone in public exchanges”. A separate statement from the department’s maritime affairs spokesman reiterated that Manila remained committed to engaging Beijing diplomatically, even as it accused China of “continued illegal, coercive, aggressive and deceptive activities” in the South China Sea.
“We are committed to managing the situation at sea peacefully,” said Deputy Assistant Secretary Rogelio Villanueva Jr.
There was no immediate comment from Beijing.
Manila-based think tank Stratbase Institute, meanwhile, dismissed the Chinese warning over job losses as “exaggerated and not supported by empirical evidence”, pointing to data suggesting China’s economic footprint in the Philippines is more limited than Beijing’s rhetoric implies.
It said official figures from the Philippine central bank show that Chinese foreign direct investment inflows reached $3.1m in the eleven months to November 2025, a decline of more than 50 percent year on year. China accounted for just 0.55 percent of total net investment inflows into the Philippines in 2024, it said.
While China has been the Philippines’ largest source of imports since 2013, the United States remains its top export market, underscoring the asymmetric nature of the trade relationship.
The latest dispute comes amid broader tensions between the Philippines and China over competing claims in the South China Sea. China has repeatedly been accused of conducting dangerous manoeuvres against Philippine vessels, deploying water cannon and obstructing resupply missions to Filipino-held outposts in disputed areas of the sea.
Beijing, in turn, accuses the Philippines of intruding on what it considers its sovereign territory.
A 2016 ruling by the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague found China’s expansive claims in the South China Sea to have no legal basis under international law. Beijing has refused to recognise the ruling.
The Chinese embassy did not respond to a request for comment. Both countries observed a public holiday on Tuesday for the Lunar New Year.

Robert Duvall, Oscar-winning star of ‘The Godfather’ and ‘Tender Mercies,’ dies at 95
Veteran actor known for quiet intensity had career spanning more than six decades
ANKARA
Robert Duvall, the Oscar-winning actor known for his roles in “The Godfather,” “Apocalypse Now” and “Tender Mercies,” has died at 95, his wife said Monday.
Luciana Duvall said he died peacefully at home, surrounded by love and comfort.
“To the world, he was an Academy Award-winning actor, a director, a storyteller. To me, he was simply everything,” she said in a statement.
Born Jan. 5, 1931, in San Diego, California, Duvall studied acting in New York and was part of a generation that included Al Pacino, Dustin Hoffman and Gene Hackman.
His breakthrough role came in 1972 when he portrayed Tom Hagen, the adopted son and consigliere of the Corleone family, in “The Godfather.”
Over a career spanning more than 60 years, Duvall became known for understated but powerful performances. He won the Academy Award for best actor for “Tender Mercies” and received multiple nominations, including for his roles in “The Godfather” and “Apocalypse Now.”
“For each of his many roles, Bob gave everything to his characters and to the truth of the human spirit they represented,” his wife said.
“In doing so, he leaves something lasting and unforgettable to us all,” she added.
Funeral arrangements were not immediately announced. His wife asked for privacy as the family celebrates his life and legacy.

Arctic is not just shift work,tundra — Arctic and Northern Urban Studies Center director

MOSCOW, February 17. /TASS/. The Arctic gradually changes from being a territory of ice, shift work and exclusively military interests. Over recent 10 years, the North has become more comfortable, however, new challenges have emerged - the aging population, problems with dialogue with indigenous peoples, and transport problems. Director of the Center for Arctic and Northern Urban Studies at the National Research University Higher School of Economics Nadezhda Zamyatina told TASS in an interview about whether it is possible to transform gradually the North's cities back into the tundra.
Civilization at door
- Mrs. Zamyatina, the Arctic nowadays is a most important strategic territory. What is the role of the so-called Decade of Arctic Exploration in its development, and what are main results?
- The main achievement is that people now are talking about the Arctic and are paying attention to it. For example, we now have the Arctic backbone settlements, identified according to criteria different from those used for the rest of the country. This is very important since the Arctic and generally the North have completely different development conditions. Take for example, small towns like Dikson, where 300 people are registered now, or Tiksi. From the point of view of standard criteria for backbone settlements, they would have remained unnoticed, but as for the Arctic, as the president has said, even a small settlement is of great strategic importance.
- How the life of people in the Arctic has changed over the recent decade?
- I communicate a lot with those who live or work in the Arctic. If we compare the North ten years ago and today, many say that it has become more comfortable. People note new shops, roads, and communication is improving as much as possible. That is, civilization is gradually coming to the Arctic.
- There is a widespread opinion that the Arctic is a territory for shift work that is not very suitable for permanent life. Is this perception changing?
- Right on the contrary, there have been more shifts, and, noteworthy, the more various modern technologies are coming to the North, the fewer people living permanently in the North are needed. True, shift work cannot be opposed to the existence of cities: in fact, they complement each other, but generally speaking, I expect the population in northern cities will decrease, at least due to higher labor productivity.
As for the preservation of permanent cities, a certain number of them certainly should be preserved. Here we can see a paradox that remains from the Soviet era. On one hand, there are measures to attract people to the North, at least the so-called northern allowances. On the other hand, there has been the idea that retirees should leave the North after they finish working there.
- Is this approach still valid?
- Both yes and no. The present tendency is towards having retirees stay in the North. Strange as it may seem, the North is getting older. In the past, first of all, the retirement age was earlier, and secondly, people used to leave the North when they were still of working age. Often, for example, when children grew up and chose other regions to study, so the parents traveled with them. Today's typical situation is children leaving to study at a university, but their parents staying in the North to pay off a mortgage, for example.
The bigger is a city, the better urban environment could be there, taking into account profitability. Even Soviet planners believed the northern cities were not suitable for mass settlement, and quite popular was the idea that it was necessary to limit population in the Far North, because living there was not too good for human health and, also, was economically impractical. I am also inclined to believe that the northern cities are primarily for highly qualified specialists, while workers are easily brought in for shifts. But then here is a trap in terms of scales - it is complicated to create in a small town an environment that meets requirements of qualified specialists.
- What needs to be improved in the Arctic to create a comfortable environment?
- First of all, medical care. Some locations are so remote that even an air ambulance can reach them within a few days only. It is necessary to increase transport connectivity, and specifically ground connectivity. These days, the ground transport system in the North is mostly off-road, and this must be taken into account and requires conditions created due to the climate specifics. I would say, the Arctic's main problem is not the cold, but the poor transport connectivity and a lack of stable communications, which could also be a solution to many challenges.
- The Internet and communications are probably a general big problem in the North.
- Absolutely. Including along the Northern Sea Route. For example, presently, navigators have to buy imported satellite images to monitor ice conditions and escort missions. Therefore, when asked what the Arctic needs, I always answer - good satellite coverage, satellite communications, Internet connection, including for making own ice forecasts, satellite monitoring. As for communications, there are different solutions - it can be a cable, or it can be an extended system of high-orbit satellites, or it can be a system of low-orbit satellites like Starlink. Technologies are available, but we need the will and funding to implement at least some of them.
Cities vs the tundra
- A most well-known measure aimed at preserving the population and promotion of the North is a preferential Arctic mortgage at 2% per annum. How much effective and demanded is this tool, in your opinion?
- Housing prices in the Arctic have grown, which means there is demand, so the program is in demand. However, it is not a factor of migration to the North. There are, for example, growing oil and gas cities where good new housing is really in demand, but it may be bought for rent, because in cities of the kind the rental housing market is highly developed. Therefore, the situation is not straightforward.
- From a demographic point of view, is it possible to forecast any changes in the Arctic, taking into account the effect from all support measures?
- The demographic problem is that the population is declining in the entire country. The generation of the 1990s has been entering the active working age, while back in the 1990s were born about twice fewer children than in the 1980s. Therefore, this is a nationwide problem. The North is closely connected with the rest of the country - we can't talk just about development of the North. And migration to the North is often not because it's good in the North, but because something is wrong in the country's other parts. For example, in 2013, I surveyed school students in Norilsk, asking them to say where their grandparents were born. Among 300 responses that I received, there were almost all hot spots of the former Soviet Union, from where had come parents of the children born in the 1990s.
People are looking for a good life in the North, but as soon as conditions are improving somewhere in the "main" settlement area, the northerners are moving there. To say that as we launch a mortgage or any other incentive, everyone will now go the North - this is not entirely correct, there must be an integrated approach.
- Anyway, traditionally, the highest demand for housing is in cities that are located near big enterprises. In this case, how to achieve a balance so that to prevent the "desertification" of other settlements?
- Rather "tundracation". Whatever you may call it, this is a classic problem of urbanization, relevant to the entire world. For example, in Greenland, similar small towns have been getting abandoned in the same way. In particular, sometimes there is an artificial liquidation of sparsely populated areas, from which it is "easier" to re-settle people. Often, however, resettlement is not a solution, but rather a way to put the problem in the shade.
First of all, resettlement of small-numbered indigenous peoples is generally a dubious measure, as their lives are closely linked to the natural environment, specific landscape, and very often they suffer maladaptation in the city. Secondly, quite often people simply return to their villages after resettlement to stay there illegally. For example, about two dozen residents return to the village of Varandey (officially ceased to exist in 2000 - TASS) in the Nenets Autonomous Region in the summer, and some stay there for the winter. "This is where I can feel that I live. What am I going to do in the city?" I heard from a woman, living in that "ghost village." Here, we need a different system of regulations, and, I'm afraid to say, amendments to the law on local self-governance - specifically for the North and the Arctic, because settlements are often liquidated precisely because the local administration is unable to fulfill its obligations stipulated in the law, and not at all because the settlement cannot be technically maintained.
Perhaps it is worth considering a practice, where companies, in exchange for certain incentives, could take over remote cities and towns under their control. It is necessary to provide companies with certain compensation, because otherwise there is a risk of weakening the industry, but generally speaking I am for calling a spade a spade: businesses already de facto maintain many resource cities and towns in the North, while the role of local administrations has been decorative.
- You have mentioned the program for adaptation of the indigenous population. What should it contain?
- To begin with, I would like to emphasize that relocation should be eyed only in cases where a person wants it. Nevertheless, the issue of preserving settlements should remain at the forefront. But if we talk about the program, it must necessarily take into account the fight against alcoholism.
- What measures in fighting alcoholism can be effective? For example, the introduction of prohibition or a time limit on sales?
- In fact, prohibition has been introduced in some Yakut villages for quite a time, and that was an initiative from the bottom. In the Arctic there are also time limits on sales, especially on holidays, such as Reindeer Herder's Day. The thing is, the locals have physiological features - the enzyme deficiency that does not allow the body to break down alcohol. Thus, the introduction of restrictions is an important measure of this fight.
- What social challenges in the Arctic have yet to be solved and how?
- Unfortunately, now remains the problem of suicide among indigenous peoples. Noteworthy, this is a problem of the entire Arctic, not only in Russia. In foreign practice, they are working actively to organize various leisure activities for young people. In Canada, for example, they have introduced a hip-hop training program for the local Inuit youth, and in Greenland a special program trains climbing. That is, classes for switching the focus of attention, a variety of leisure activities. Clearly, this work should be comprehensive, hip-hop alone will not solve the problem - people need leisure, medical rehabilitation programs, and conditions for employment. Unfortunately, the problem does exist, it is relevant and widespread, and it really needs to be addressed.
- To recap: how should be structured communication with the indigenous population not to harm their way of life, but at the same time to continue developing the Arctic?
- Communication should be interactive. We cannot decide for people what is best for them. We know that quite often things are decided in Moscow, while it is necessary first of all to ask the local population. We must understand that modern indigenous people are not what they used to be in the 18th century. It is no longer an issue of non-interference, since Arctic residents often address the center for assistance - for additional diesel fuel, generators, satellite phones. This is not the tundra that used to be 100 years ago.

Casualties reported in bomb blasts, gunfire in Pakistan’s northwest
Two killed as motorcycle explodes outside police station in Bannu district; several reported killed in vehicle blast in Bajaur.
Two bomb attacks and a gun battle between police and rebel fighters in northwest Pakistan have killed at least three people and possibly as many as a dozen, according to reports.
The Associated Press news agency reported that two people were killed on Monday when explosives attached to a parked motorcycle detonated near the entrance of a police station in Bannu, a district in northwest Pakistan’s volatile Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province near the Afghan border.

Later in the day, an explosives-laden vehicle detonated while being driven towards a security checkpoint in the province’s Bajaur district, local police official Zafar Khan told the AP, reporting that a girl was killed when a nearby building collapsed due to the force of the blast.
According to Khan, at least eight members of the Pakistan Taliban group, known by the acronym TTP, were then killed by troops in a gun battle.
Reporting on violence in Bajaur, the AFP news agency said eight people were killed when a suicide bomber drove a vehicle rigged with explosives into the wall of a religious college in the district.
“As a result, eight police and Frontier Corps personnel present inside the seminary were martyred and 10 others injured,” a security official told AFP, speaking on condition of anonymity.
It was not known if the explosions reported at the security checkpoint in Bajaur and the seminary blast in the district were linked or separate attacks.
The official who spoke anonymously to AFP also reported that a child was killed when the roofs of nearby houses collapsed because of the explosion at the seminary.
In another incident reported by the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa police, three police personnel and as many rebel fighters were killed during a search operation in the province’s Shangla district. Police said the deceased fighters were involved in “attacks targeting Chinese nationals”.
Pakistan has seen a surge in unprecedented attacks against its security forces since 2021, coinciding with the Taliban’s return to power in Afghanistan.
More than 2,400 deaths were recorded for the first three quarters of 2025, an increase over the previous year’s death toll of about 2,500 in attacks across Pakistan.
Pakistan has blamed the majority of the attacks on the TTP, whose leaders are now allegedly based in Afghanistan.
TTP members hail largely from the tribal areas of Pakistan, along the Afghan border.

Australia refuses to repatriate its citizens from Syria over alleged Daesh ties

The Australian government will refuse to repatriate its nationals, a group of 34 women and children, from Syria with alleged ties to the Daesh terror group, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said on Tuesday.
The women and children from 11 families were supposed to fly from the Syrian capital Damascus to Australia, but Syrian authorities on Monday turned them back to the Roj camp in northeast Syria because of procedural problems, officials said.
Only two groups of Australians have been repatriated with government help from Syrian camps since the fall of Daesh in 2019. Other Australians have also returned without government assistance.
Albanese would not comment on a report that the latest women and children had Australian passports.
“We’re providing absolutely no support and we are not repatriating people,” Albanese told Australian Broadcasting Corporation in Melbourne.
“We have no sympathy, frankly, for people who travelled overseas in order to participate in what was an attempt to establish a caliphate to undermine, destroy, our way of life. And so, as my mother would say, ‘You make your bed, you lie in it,’” Albanese added.
Moral obligation
Albanese noted that the child welfare-focused international charity Save the Children had failed to establish in Australia’s courts that the Australian government had a responsibility to repatriate citizens from Syrian camps.
After the federal court ruled in the government's favour in 2024, Save the Children Australia chief executive Mat Tinkler argued the government had a moral, if not legal, obligation to repatriate families.
Albanese said if the latest group made their way to Australia without government help, they could be charged.
It was an offence under Australian law to travel to the former Daesh stronghold of Raqqa province without a legitimate reason from 2014 to 2017. The maximum penalty was 10 years in prison.
“It’s unfortunate that children are impacted by this as well, but we are not providing any support. And if anyone does manage to find their way back to Australia, then they’ll face the full force of the law, if any laws have been broken,” Albanese added.
Australians in Roj camp
The last group of Australians to be repatriated from Syrian camps arrived in Sydney in October 2022.
They, reportedly, were four mothers, former partners of Daesh supporters, and 13 children.
Australian officials had assessed the group as the most vulnerable among 60 Australian women and children held in Roj camp, the government said at the time.
Eight offspring of two slain Australian Daesh members were repatriated from Syria in 2019 by the conservative government that preceded Albanese’s centre-left Labor Party administration.

Trump to decide ‘soon’ on sending weapons to Taiwan
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
ABOARD AIR FORCE ONE – US President Donald Trump said on Feb 16 that he would decide soon on whether to send more weapons to Taiwan, after Chinese President Xi Jinping warned him not to do so.
“I’m talking to him about it. We had a good conversation, and we’ll make a determination pretty soon,” Mr Trump said, adding that he has a “good relationship” with the Chinese leader, whose country claims the self-ruled island of Taiwan as its territory.
In a phone call with Mr Trump on Feb 4, Mr Xi called for “mutual respect” in relations with the United States, while warning Washington about arms sales to the democratically run island.
“The Taiwan question is the most important issue in China-US relations... The US must handle arms sales to Taiwan with caution,” Mr Xi said, according to China’s state broadcaster.
The two leaders are due to meet in Beijing in April.
China’s Communist Party has never ruled Taiwan, but Beijing claims the island of 23 million people is part of its territory and has not ruled out the use of force to annex it.
Washington does not officially recognise Taiwan, but is the island territory’s main military backer – although the tone of that support has softened slightly under Mr Trump.
The United States approved US$11 billion (S$13.8 billion) worth of arms to Taiwan in December, Taipei said.
Shortly thereafter, China launched major live-fire drills to simulate a blockade around Taiwan’s key ports.
While Mr Trump has adopted a softer tone on support for Taiwan in his second term, the issue remains a thorn in US-China relations.
On Feb 14, Beijing’s top diplomat Wang Yi warned the United States against “plotting” on Taiwan, saying it could lead to a “confrontation” with China.
Speaking at the Munich Security Conference in Germany, Foreign Minister Wang said that in the future, the United States could adopt a China policy that involves “instigating and plotting to split China through Taiwan, crossing China’s red line”.
Taiwan has spent many billions of dollars upgrading its military in the past decade, but faces growing US pressure to do more to protect itself against China.
Taiwan’s President Lai Ching-te has proposed US$40 billion in extra defence spending by his government over eight years, but the plan has been blocked by the opposition-controlled Parliament 10 times since early December.
On Feb 12, dozens of US lawmakers urged Taiwan’s opposition political parties to end their blocking of the move.
In an exclusive interview with AFP last week, President Lai said he was confident the defence budget would be passed. AFP

Three people injured in Russia’s attack on Odesa
Three Odesa civilians – two men and a woman – were injured in a nighttime attack by Russian invaders on the city, reported Serhiy Lysak, head of Odesa City Military Administration.
"After the night attack, two men, aged 62 and 65, were injured. One is in serious condition, the other is in moderate condition. Both were hospitalized. Another woman received medical treatment at the scene," Lysak wrote on Telegram on Tuesday morning.
According to him, an air raid siren was sounded six times in Odesa last night, and it remains active.
Lysak reported two casualties overnight. "The attack damaged infrastructure and civilian buildings. In one district, a fire broke out on the upper floors of a residential building. In another, a store and a service station were damaged," he wrote.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs reports two casualties in the overnight attack by Russian drones on Odesa.
"Energy and civilian infrastructure was damaged, and several fires occurred. Debris also damaged an apartment on the 22nd floor of a multi-story building," the ministry said on its Telegram channel.

A tiny needle-patch tracked my blood sugar. This is what I learnt
Examine, a free weekly newsletter covering science with a sceptical, evidence-based eye, is sent every Tuesday. You’re reading an excerpt – sign up to get the whole newsletter in your inbox.
Regular readers might remember the problem I devoted a column to trying to solve late last year: why was I so ravenously hungry by 6pm? Could a 3pm chocolate be to blame?
I concluded it probably was, causing a surge in my blood sugar and then sending it nosediving until my brain demanded calories.
That was a guess at my glucose metabolism. Technology now promises to make it possible to know. Many companies will sell you a continuous glucose monitor – a tiny needle-patch that samples your blood sugar every five minutes and transmits data to your phone via Bluetooth.
The monitors are most typically used by diabetics, but more and more wellness companies, such as Vively (which supplied mine) are promoting them as a way of seeing how your body responds to different foods.
I wore it for two weeks, and then took the data to several blood sugar researchers. Here’s what I learnt.
Think about the body as having short (glucose), medium (glycogen) and long-term (fat) energy storage.
When digested, carbohydrates in your food (think oats, bread, fruit, vegetables) produce glucose, your front-line fuel. As glucose enters the blood, the hormone insulin is released in response, which triggers cells to absorb the glucose.
You can see that clearly in my monitor’s data: I eat, my blood glucose rises, insulin rises, and it is quickly cleared.
The muesli, fruit and coffee I had for breakfast produced quite a large increase in my blood glucose. That’s simply because the meal was high in carbohydrates – not because it was unhealthy.
“People may think they need a flat line. Physiologically, you eat a meal that may be perfectly balanced and contains everything you need, your blood glucose level will rise,” says Dr Brooke Devlin, a lecturer in nutrition and dietetics at the University of Queensland. “That’s normal, there’s nothing wrong with that.”
How quickly blood glucose rises is governed by how many carbohydrates were in the meal, how complex they are (simple: bread; complex: vegetables), whether they are liquid or solid, and how much protein, fat and fibre were in the meal; all three macronutrients slow digestion.
Now look at the pre-breakfast hours, when I was sleeping. My glucose is steady. Why? When we eat, our bodies store excess glucose in the liver as glycogen (about 12 to 24 hours’ worth of fuel). This medium-term energy is slowly released overnight to keep blood sugar level.
Processed food really knocks around my blood sugar
On January 27, I was on the road to cover the Otways bushfires. Around midday, we pulled over at a servo and I tried to pick a healthy option … three multigrain sandwiches with tomatoes, egg and ham, and an iced latte (no sugar).
That meal sent my blood sugar on a rollercoaster: three sharp peaks followed by deep valleys.
Then, worrying the sandwiches wouldn’t be enough to keep me full, I went for a chocolate-coated protein bar and another iced coffee in the afternoon.
My blood sugar rose and then fell and fell, down to my lowest reading for the day. At this point, I wrote a note: “ravenously hungry”.
On January 28, I fell for the same trap, selecting a chicken and salad roll for lunch. Seems healthy? I got my highest blood sugar reading for the fortnight, followed by a crash. Again I wrote down “extremely hungry”.
“The mayonnaise probably has sugar in it. As consumers, we don’t always understand what’s in the processed foods we buy,” says Professor Gary Wittert, a leading obesity and appetite researcher at Adelaide University. “You don’t know how much sugar is in the roll or the mayo. You think it’s healthy.”
Do blood sugar spikes matter? I got different answers. Wittert thinks it’s best to minimise spikes from refined carbs as they are pro-inflammatory.
Associate Professor Neale Cohen, director of clinical services at the Baker Heart and Diabetes Institute, is more sceptical. “We don’t like seeing levels that are extremely high, because we think they cause damage. But damage from diabetes (characterised by high glucose levels) is done over months and years. In the short-term there is minimal damage.”
A big night
January 23 was my best day of glucose control. I ate every three hours, going for a chicken curry with potatoes, a chicken salad with noodles, and a couple of protein yoghurts. “Your meals had more of a protein focus and less of a high simple-carb focus,” says Hailey Donnelly, a diabetes dietitian at the University of Newcastle.
And I hit the gym the day before. Our bodies are more sensitive to insulin in the 24 hours after exercise, meaning glucose is absorbed more quickly.
You’ll notice my glucose control is a lot tighter in the morning than at night. That’s normal for healthy people: insulin sensitivity is highest in the morning and falls throughout the day.
That night, I went out dancing far too late, and spent the next day feeling very sore in the head. And my graph was much more spiky all day.
Wittert tells me about running a similar experiment in 2012, deliberately sleep-depriving healthy adults and then monitoring their blood sugar. “After four days of that, they were waking with blood sugars like you. Sleep restriction causes insulin resistance,” he says.
It’s not just sleep. Stress triggers the release of cortisol and adrenaline, which leads to an increase in blood sugar. I saw this when I was giving a talk to a group of science journalists; my sugar raced upwards. Too much stress long-term can drive insulin resistance.
The chocolate experiment
Finally, I wanted to test out my hypothesis: would a 3pm chocolate bar mess with my blood glucose and leave me hungry?
The graph jumps up – not too sharply, as about half a KitKat’s energy comes from fat – and then falls sharply. I ended up with a blood glucose level lower than before I ate the high-sugar snack. And I was hungry.
This, to me, looks like strong support for the sugar-crash hypothesis. But the researchers I put this to are less convinced.
“There are these stories that go around that spike causes hunger. I don’t think there have ever really been studies that show this,” says Cohen. “It’s a very complicated thing, there’s a whole lot of hormones in the gut and the brain that control hunger. Hunger is not a simple sugar-related response at all.”
How much does the data matter?
I personally found the data fascinating, although I’m less convinced it is useful. I already know I should eat less junk food. Vively’s dietitian, Holly Morrison-McBain, tells me I seem to be quite sensitive to carbohydrates and could try reducing how many I eat in the evening, potentially improving my sleep. She and Wittert both argue too much glucose variability is harmful in the long term.
Other researchers I took it to are more sceptical, though several admitted to using the devices themselves.
Part of the problem is the sensor’s accuracy. Cohen suspects there’s likely a large margin for error. And who is most likely to be able to pay $300 for a blood glucose tracker? The worried wealthy are not the people who really need them.
Add that into the questions around whether sugar spikes actually matter, and Cohen says he “hasn’t seen anything so far that really makes me think this is a useful thing to be measuring continuously”.
Vively supplied a continuous glucose monitor for review for two weeks.

UK unemployment rate rises to 5.2%, the highest level in nearly five years

Unemployment in the UK has risen to 5.2%, the highest level in nearly five years, while wage growth continues to slow, raising the prospect of another cut to interest rates in the spring.
The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the rate of unemployment was 5.2% in the three months to the end of December, the highest rate since the quarter to January 2021. This was in line with what economists had been expecting and was up from 5.1% in the three months to November.
Joblessness in the UK has steadily risen since 2022, and businesses have complained that tax rises by Rachel Reeves in her last two budgets have exacerbated this, with rises in national insurance contributions and the minimum wage causing particular issues.
In the three months to December, wages excluding bonuses in Great Britain increased by 4.2%, easing from 4.4% the previous month.
In the private sector, pay rose by 3.4%, the lowest level in five years, while wages in the public sector rose by 7.2%. Once adjusted for inflation, annual pay excluding bonuses rose by just 0.8% in October to December, the lowest rate since August 2023.
The number of people on company payrolls also continued to fall, down 134,000 on a year ago, and by 46,000 over the quarter. On a monthly basis, payrolls fell by 11,000 in January.
However, a sharp monthly decline reported in December compared with November was revised upwards by the ONS, from its original estimate of a fall of 43,000 to a fall of just 6,000.
Liz McKeown, the director of economic statistics at the ONS, said: “The number of workers on payroll fell further in the final quarter of the year, reflecting weak hiring activity, although it is largely unchanged in the latest month.
“Over the same period the unemployment rate increased, with data showing that more people who were out of work are now actively looking for a job.”
Peter Dixon, a senior economist at the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, said: “Below the surface, there are indications that younger workers in particular are being priced out of the market.
“A rise of 33% in the minimum wage over the past two years has pushed up the unemployment rate for 18- to 24-year-olds by more than two percentage points to 14%.”
That is also the highest rate in five years – or nearly 11 years excluding the pandemic – amid concerns that Britain is slipping down global league table for youth employment.
The figures suggest the Bank of England is likely to make another cut to interest rates by the spring, as inflationary pressures, such as higher wage growth, appear to be easing.
The Bank has forecast that the unemployment rate will rise to 5.3% this year and that wage growth will moderate from 3.4% last year to 3.25% by the end of the year as inflation falls. At the its recent meeting earlier this month, the Bank kept rates on hold at 3.75%.
Paul Dales, the chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said: “The lack of green shoots of recovery in the labour market and further fall in wage growth supports the idea that the Bank of England has at least a couple more interest rate cuts in its locker, with the chances of the next cut happening in March rather than April edging higher.”
Inflation – which measures the pace of price rises – hit 3.4% in December, up from 3.2% a month earlier. The ONS will release data for January on Wednesday.
Recent business surveys have suggested the jobs market is improving in January as companies renew their recruitment plans now that uncertainty around the budget in late November has lifted.
A report by KPMG and REC, the recruitment body, reported the smallest drop in permanent staff placements in 18 months, while a survey of chief financial officers by the Bank of England reported that firms expect to raise employment this year for the first time in five months.

OMSK, February 17. /TASS/. The Russian-Brazil circumnavigation expedition onboard the Fraternidade yacht left Rio-de-Janeiro heading for Salvador, leader of the Russian Geographical Society's Omsk Branch Ivan Krott told TASS. It is the final stage of the voyage under flags of BRICS and RGO (Russian Geographical Society).
"The Fraternity-2025 expedition's final stage has started," he said. "The yacht has departed from Rio de Janeiro heading for Salvador - the starting point from where the international voyage started more than ten months ago."
The expedition is due to finish in late February, he added. "Over this time, the expedition under flags of the Russian Geographical Society and of BRICS has played the mission of public diplomacy telling the world about Russia, its history and culture. The team has passed all the challenges - from severe Arctic to Cape Horn, from Chukotka to tropics," he said.
The expedition kicked off on April 12 from Brazil's Salvador. It is dedicated to the 80th anniversary of the Victory and the 180th anniversary of the Russian Geographical Society. The yacht's Captain Aleixo Belov said the voyage's one of main objectives was to sail to Siberia and to sail along the Northern Sea Route, which the expedition did in late summer, 2025. The plan has been the team covers about 45,000 km within ten months.

Russian prosthetics workshops fill up with wounded soldiers

Vsevolozhsk, Russia - After losing his right leg on the battlefield in Ukraine, Mr Dmitry, a former fighter with Russia’s Wagner paramilitary group, is walking again thanks to a new prosthetic limb.
With hundreds of thousands of soldiers coming back from the front wounded, Russia’s prosthetics workshops – like the one outside Saint Petersburg where AFP met Mr Dmitry – have been filling up with former fighters.
Mr Dmitry, 54, had already fought in Syria and for Moscow-backed separatists in Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region before Russia launched its full-scale offensive in February 2022.
He recalled his injury with a faint smile.
His unit was bombed as it tried to cross the Dnipro river.
The next moment, he saw his right leg lying next to him. Torn off.
“It was my first injury,” said Mr Dmitry, who declined to give his last name and goes by the call sign “Barmak”.
“I was surprised that I fought so long and was constantly lucky.”
He also suffered a serious abdominal injury, spending eight months in hospital and a year in a wheelchair.
“The atmosphere is friendly here, almost soothing,” he said of the private prosthetics workshop in Vsevolozhsk, outside Russia’s second-largest city.
In the small studio, workers in ventilation masks were measuring, buffing and painting artificial limbs as Mr Dmitry had his fitting inspected.
Hefty payments
Russia does not say how many of its soldiers have been killed or wounded in Ukraine – but independent reporting and Western intelligence estimates put it in the several hundreds of thousands.
Government data shows Moscow issued 60,000 more prosthetic limbs in 2024 than in 2021, the last full year before the war – a 65-per cent increase.
Even if they do not disclose how they lost a limb, workshop head Mikhail Moskovtsev told AFP it was “obvious” who the former soldiers were among his clients.
“These are specific wounds, for example from mine blasts” – easily distinguishable from the victims of car accidents and extreme sports enthusiasts.
Mr Moskovtsev does not ask questions.
“For me everyone is equal,” he said. “I don’t ask the person where it’s from or the reasons behind it. If they want, they talk on their own.”
His workshop employs around a dozen people.
State-of-the-art prostheses can cost up to five million rubles (S$82,000).
Russian veterans can choose between public and private facilities, and are offered a host of rehabilitation programmes and cash payouts depending on the severity of their wounds.
Mr Dmitry got three million rubles.
“I bought my car with it,” he said, adjusting his prosthetic leg as he climbed into a new black pickup truck outside the centre.
A seasoned soldier, he told AFP he was impressed by the support Moscow offered wounded veterans – contrasting it with a sense of abandonment after the Soviet Union’s war in Afghanistan or the Chechen campaigns of the 1990s and early 2000s.
“I remember very well the return of the veterans of Afghanistan and the famous phrase from the bureaucrats: ‘I’m not the one who sent you there’.
“It was the same with the soldiers of the first and second Chechen wars,” he said.
‘New elite’
The support is just one way Russia has overhauled its economy and geared its entire society to support the offensive on Ukraine.
Lucrative salaries lure men to fight, while President Vladimir Putin wants veterans to take leadership roles, fill up the bureaucracy and form the country’s “new elite”.
Still, there are concerns about social problems linked to the thousands of men coming back from the front.
At the workshop near Saint Petersburg was another former soldier, also called Dmitry, also with a missing leg.
A drone struck the vehicle he was in while fighting in the Ukrainian city of Bakhmut in 2024.
Asked about why he went to fight, the 42-year-old, known as “Torg” on the battlefield, echoed Kremlin talking points – widely debunked and rejected by Ukraine and NATO – about protecting Russia.
“My main motivation was to make sure that what was happening there stayed there, so that the conflict did not spread to our territory,” he said.
He now sports a jet black prosthetic leg with blood-red curves painted around it.
Both Dmitrys said they had no regrets.
Despite his condition, father-of-two “Torg” said his view on the war had not changed.
“I would do the same again,” he said, without hesitation. AFP

MADRID, Feb 17 - Five people have died and four others suffered minor injuries in a fire at an apartment building in Spain's northeastern Catalonia, regional firefighters said late on Monday.
According to Spanish news agency EFE, citing fire department sources, authorities believe all the deceased were young people, and some may have been underage.
The blaze broke out in a storage room of a five-story building in Manlleu, a town of 21,000 in the Osona area north of Barcelona, firefighters said in a statement.
For reasons still unknown, the victims were unable to escape the storage area, they added. The Mossos d'Esquadra - Catalan police - have opened an investigation into the cause of the fire.
The victims' identification will be completed throughout Tuesday morning, as some of the bodies were charred. REUTERS

'Global euro' may have to come with some FX lift: Mike Dolan
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
LONDON, Feb 17 - As American and European policymakers know well, global currency dominance and exchange rate movement are different things. But there's a decent argument that Europe's push to widen euro usage necessarily involves some revaluation of the single currency.
As Transatlantic ties fray and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen warned of lines that "cannot be uncrossed" after President Donald Trump's bid for the U.S. to acquire Greenland, European Union leaders and finance chiefs this past week have launched another push to bolster the bloc's economic clout and reposition its defense.
With the Munich Security Conference as the backdrop, an informal EU summit last week brought renewed impetus to deepen European capital markets integration. Leaders also discussed possibly expanding joint euro debt sales and - led by the European Central Bank on Saturday - widening euro access, liquidity and financing worldwide.
Some of this has been on the table before. But the urgency for action is now evident in a willingness for a two-speed advance with six core countries - Germany, France, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands and Poland - in the vanguard if agreement among the 27 is too cumbersome or slow. An EU6 summit is due early next month.
The plans are likely necessary, even if not yet sufficient, to expand the role of the euro and allow it to absorb some of the nervousness about the world's overexposure to dollars at a time of enormous U.S. political and economic upheaval.
Whether that greater global role brings a less welcome appreciation of the euro's value is another question.
As finance chiefs on both sides of the Atlantic ponder the potential for at least some shift in the scale of dollar dominance in reserves, trade, invoicing and commodity pricing, they have differing takes on any related exchange rate fallout.
Trump's administration sees a "strong dollar" primarily in terms of the currency's reach and pervasive use in cross-border finance - an extension of American power unrelated to the ebbs and flows of the exchange rate itself. The presumption is that the Trump team sees an unwinding of the dollar's overvalued exchange rate as an integral part of its global trade reset.
Currency experts, such as Cornell professor and former IMF official Eswar Prasad, think a gradual weakening of the dollar's exchange rate is possible without damaging its international dominance.
But Prasad, in a new book published this month called The Doom Loop, says this dominance, even though durable for reasons of inertia and scale, may well be at the heart of mounting global economic instability. And if that reaches a crescendo, the search for adequate alternatives inevitably rises, as gold's parabolic recent price gains attest.
"While dollar dominance might prove a saving grace at times of crisis, it is that very dominance which has a destabilizing effect worldwide," he wrote. "It exposes other countries to the mercurial and often undisciplined economic and financial policies of the United States."
SWEET AND SOUR
Europe, on the other hand, clearly wants to lift the euro's role but is far less keen on the exchange-rate appreciation that may follow, mainly because it would hurt export competitiveness at a time of great global trade uncertainty and further dampen inflation in the slower‑growth region.
Much like its U.S. counterparts, it would like the "exorbitant privilege" of being a bigger reserve currency but not the bloated exchange rate valuation that might go with it.
But if the U.S. side were happy with gradual dollar slippage on the exchanges and only a modest reduction in the dollar's usage per se, would the Europeans be happy with the flipside of that scenario?
AXA Group Chief Economist Gilles Moec argued this week that disentangling the exchange rate impact from global usage was theoretically correct, but it would be hard to see any significant one-off shift not affecting the euro's value.
Moec makes the point that during the last transition between dominant reserve currencies over a century ago, between the two world wars, when sterling ceded prominence to the dollar, the dollar appreciated on trend.
Even though the U.S. unsuccessfully tried to resist that rise by devaluing the dollar against gold at the time, he points out, demand from global investors for the new reserve currency mechanically won out.
"Our point here is that the European Central Bank cannot completely disconnect its support for an upgrade in the euro's global role from monetary policy," he concluded.
The plus side is that a "more assertive role" for the euro could be positive for the EU by triggering regular inflows from foreign investors into euro assets at a time when Europe needs it. What's more, a stronger euro could aid a shift from an export-led economy to a domestically led growth mode.
"To ease the transition, though, a flexible monetary policy would be necessary to avoid a too brutal decline in competitiveness," Moec concluded.
If Europe now feels it also needs to cross lines that cannot be uncrossed, then maybe it just has to take all that on the chin.

Exodus of ISIL-linked detainees from Syria camp sparks security concerns

Exodus of ISIL-linked detainees from Syria camp sparks security concerns
The al-Hol camp population is reported to have dropped by thousands after the SDF’s chaotic handover to the Syrian government.
The number of residents at one of Syria’s most notorious camps has dropped rapidly, going from about 24,000 earlier this year to the low thousands at most, humanitarian, diplomatic and local sources from the country’s northeast have told Al Jazeera.
The al-Hol camp, near the Syria-Iraq border, had held mostly internally displaced Syrians and approximately 6,000 third-country nationals with links to ISIL (ISIS). It was managed by the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) before a government offensive in Syria’s northeast in January forced the SDF to withdraw.

Since then, the camp has ostensibly come under government control.
Details and accounts about how families and individuals exited the camp, which at its peak in 2019 held about 73,000 families, are contradictory. What is clear, according to sources on the ground, is that most Syrian nationals left al-Hol for their home towns, while many of the foreigners have travelled west to the government strongholds of Idlib or Aleppo governorates.
The uncertainty and lack of information have left analysts, diplomats and humanitarian workers with security and human rights concerns.
Freed or kidnapped?
In 2019, ISIL was defeated in Syria by a United-States coalition, which included the SDF. Al-Hol, located in the Hasakah governorate, was then established by the SDF after it took control of large parts of northeast Syria, with backing from the US.
It became the largest camp housing people suspected of links to ISIL. Of the total number of people in al-Hol in January, Syrians made up 14,500, and Iraqis made up 4,000. Approximately 6,200 people from other nationalities were also held in a highly securitised section of the camp, with more than 95 percent of them being women and children, according to Save the Children.
The SDF maintained control of al-Hol throughout the last years of Syria’s al-Assad regime, which ultimately fell in December 2024.
The Syrian government’s security forces entered al-Hol on January 21 to take control of the site. But humanitarian organisations were forced to stop working in the camp in recent days due to the conditions that followed the SDF’s abandonment and the government’s attempts to reestablish security.
It is unclear exactly how people housed in the camp left. Some of those held there told aid workers that they were directed – it is unclear by whom – to board buses. Others said that people pushed their way out of the camp and that guards were unable to stop them.
Smugglers are also reported to have transported Syrians and foreigners alike.
Al Jazeera could not confirm any of the reports, but aid workers and diplomatic sources believe the methods of escape described are feasible due to the size of the camp.
“There is still no clear, verified information about how the mass transfers from al-Hol to Idlib, and possibly other parts of Syria, took place after the SDF left the camp,” Beatrice Eriksson, spokesperson of the Swedish branch of Repatriate the Children, told Al Jazeera.
She said the information she was able to gather suggested that the movement of families “did not happen in a controlled or officially coordinated manner”.
“Families who were moved cannot be certain whether they have been liberated or effectively kidnapped,” she said. “That level of uncertainty alone illustrates the acute protection risks facing these families.”
A source with the SDF’s former administrative body told Al Jazeera there had been no “prior coordination between the SDF or the Autonomous Administration and Damascus” over al-Hol.
“Unfortunately, everything happened suddenly,” he said.
Major security and humanitarian concerns
With so many families leaving the camp in unspecified and seemingly uncoordinated methods, analysts and diplomatic sources say they have serious security and humanitarian concerns.
Shortly after news broke of families leaving al-Hol, a video emerged online of a man in the office of former camp director Jihan Hanan. The man, who identified himself as Abu Sleiman al-Haskawi, called Hanan a pig and threatened her.
“Unfortunately, everything has ended, and I have become afraid for myself and my children,” Hanan told Al Jazeera.
The man in the video did not declare an affiliation. Analysts and diplomatic sources worry that some of the people who escaped would join groups seeking to undermine Syria’s stability.
A UN report released last Wednesday found that Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa and two of his senior cabinet ministers were targeted by ISIL in five foiled assassination attempts in the last year alone.
“If radicalised detainees are able to support ISIS attacks, or a resurgence in the next year or two, this could represent a major blow to the Syrian government,” Caroline Rose, director of the Crime-Conflict Nexus and Military Withdrawals portfolios at the New Lines Institute, told Al Jazeera.
“Already, during the transfer of detention centres with the SDF, there was a breakout attempt under the government’s watch. There have been ISIS attacks on both government and civilian targets as well. If this trend severely increases in the next year, I think the Syrian government will have to face mounting… distrust.”
For years, rights groups and international organisations called for the global community to act on the problem of al-Hol. Many people were detained there without ever facing trial. Many could not be repatriated because their countries of origin refused to receive them.
And now that many of the families are no longer there, new humanitarian concerns have emerged.
“While ending arbitrary, indefinite detention in places like al-Hol is important, the way this has unfolded is incredibly risky,” Sarah Sanbar, a researcher at Human Rights Watch, told Al Jazeera.
“When women and children leave in a chaotic, unplanned way, they often just become more vulnerable to trafficking, exploitation, or recruitment by armed groups. So the immediate priority should really be about identifying and protecting them.”
Sanbar added that “countries whose nationals are involved need to step up and repatriate them in a coordinated, safe, and dignified way. Women and kids should not be left to navigate smuggling routes and shifting front lines on their own.”
‘I fall asleep in fear’
Conditions in al-Hol have also been criticised by rights groups and people familiar with the camp.
A 2022 report from Doctors Without Borders, known by its French initials MSF, said that people were not given adequate food or water, phones were banned, and medical care was insufficient. People interviewed by MSF for the report described the camp as a prison.
A little more than 40km (25 miles) away from al-Hol is the Roj camp, which also houses ISIL-linked people. Like al-Hol, it is based in Hasakah province, but Roj is still under SDF control. And following the recent developments at al-Hol, residents at Roj wonder what is next for them.
A European woman at the camp told Al Jazeera that detainees fear the camp may be dismantled and they will have to leave.
“I’m with my children,” she said. “Honestly, at night, there’s a lot of raids by the SDF. Sometimes they even hit the women… To be honest, I often fall asleep in fear.”
The woman in Roj said she wanted to be repatriated, but feared she would be sent to Idlib and get stuck in Syria. Her compatriots who were in al-Hol are now in Idlib, she said. “They’re being held captive and have not yet been registered. They want deportation; they don’t want to stay in Syria.”
“Our [home country] authorities are not responding. We’re asking them for guidance on this situation, but they’re not commenting,” she said. “We’ve been begging them to deport us for years.”

UK unemployment rate hits five-year high of 5.2% as wage growth slows – business live

Introduction: UK unemployment hits highest since early 2021
Good morning. Unemployment across the UK has hit a near five-year high, and wage growth has slowed.
The latest labour market data, just released this morning, shows that the UK jobless rate rose to 5.2% in the October-December quarter.
That’s up from 5.1% in September-November, and the highest rate since the first quarter of 2021.
The number of workers on company payrolls fell too – down by 130,000 over the year and by 46,000 over the quarter.
This follows many months of complaints from businesses that chancellor Rachel Reeves has pushed up employment costs, through increases in national insurance contributions and the minimum wage.
Earnings growth cooled in the quarter too. Basic pay (excluding bonuses) rose by 4.2% in the October-December quarter, down from 4.4% a month ago.
Total earnings (including bonuses) growth also slowed to 4.2%, down from 4.6% in September to November 2025.
ONS Director of Economic Statistics Liz McKeown said:
“The number of workers on payroll fell further in the final quarter of the year, reflecting weak hiring activity, although it is largely unchanged in the latest month. Over the same period the unemployment rate increased, with data showing that more people who were out of work are now actively looking for a job.
“The number of vacancies has remained broadly stable since the middle of last year. Alongside rising unemployment this means that the number of unemployed people per vacancy has increased, reaching a new post-pandemic high. Meanwhile, redundancies are also showing an upward trend.
“Private sector wage growth continues to slow and is at its lowest rate in five years. Public sector pay growth also slowed in the latest period but remains elevated, still affected by some pay awards being implemented earlier in 2025 than 2024, although this effect has now started to diminish.”
The pound is weakening, as traders anticipate the Bank of England could cut interest rates next month.
Sterling has fallen by two-thirds of a cent against the US dollar, to $1.355, its lowest rate since 6 February.
Kathleen Brooks,research director at XTB, says the pound is the weakest major currency on the foreign exchanges this morning:
The market reaction has been swift. The pound has sunk on this news, GBP/USD is down by 70 points and it has lost the $1.36 handle. It is the weakest currency in the G10 FX space on Tuesday, and the pound is now trailing behind the dollar, and is the weakest currency in the G10 so far this month.
As the UK economy softens, the bias is to the downside for sterling.
The City money markets now indicate there’s a near-75% chance that the Bank of England lowers interest rates to 3.5% at its next meeting, in March, up from 69% last night.
Investors now fully expect two rate cuts by Christmas, which would bring Bank Rate down to 3.25%.
James Smith, developed markets economist at ING, says today’s UK jobs report keeps the Bank of England “firmly on track” for a March rate cut.
Smith says:
Unemployment is up and hiring surveys are still getting worse. That said, the weakness is still heavily concentrated in consumer-facing industries – a legacy of last year’s sizable payroll tax (National Insurance) and National Living Wage increases. Hospitality payrolled employment may be down almost 3% since the start of 2025, but it is still 2% higher than pre-Covid levels. Yet economic output is still 6% below – suggesting the loss of jobs may have further to run.
Outside of these consumer-centric industries, the story looks more benign. Employment is still trending down across the wider private sector on a three-month average of payrolls growth, but only slightly. We’re also not seeing a particularly noticeable pick-up in redundancies across the economy. Vacancy numbers have stopped falling, too.
Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG UK, says thefall in pay growth to 4.2% strengthens the case for a March interest rate cut:
“Today’s data raises the prospect of the Bank of England resuming cutting interest rates in March. The MPC will be reassured by further evidence of pay pressures easing, and the labour market continuing to soften. The Bank may also want to minimise downside risks to the labour market and lower rates ahead of the next forecast meeting in April.
“Headline pay growth eased in December, falling from 4.4% to 4.2%. The fall in headline pay was partly driven by an easing in public sector wage settlements, which fell for the first time since July 2025. Demand for labour remains weak which has curtailed workers’ bargaining power, meanwhile falling costs for households should also temper pay demand amongst workers. We expect pay growth to fall to 3% by the end of 2026.
Here’s some snap reaction to the rise in UK unemployment:
Jonathan Raymond, investment manager at Quilter Cheviot, says there are signs that the UK labour market is ‘creaking’:
“Following a November where hiring plans were put on hold due to the budget, things are yet to get going again, potentially highlighting the longer-term impacts of increases costs that businesses have faced.
Increased minimum wage costs, national insurance contributions, business rates and concerns around the impact of the Employment Rights Act continues to show up in the data and appears to be putting a weight on the economy. Economic indicators were beginning to shine some positivity but that has arguably been wiped by this latest data.
Patrick Milnes, Head of People and Work Policy at the British Chambers of Commerce, blames those rising employment costs:
“There are strong signs that the labour market is continuing to loosen as wage growth including bonuses has eased to 4.2% and the rate of unemployment has risen to 5.2%.
“Wage growth is being propped up by the public sector and the number of unemployed people per vacancy now sits at 2.6, the highest in more than 10 years if the pandemic period is excluded.
“Last year, businesses were hit hard by the increase in National Insurance contributions, and many are now facing further rises in the National Living Wage alongside higher business rates. Our research shows that labour costs remain the biggest cost pressure for businesses, cited by 72% of businesses.
“Against this background it is unsurprising they are holding off hiring. Especially as the imminent introduction of new Employment Rights legislation adds additional complexity to the picture.
“While the Spring Statement will provide a fuller update on the economic outlook, businesses are clear they want to see concrete action to reduce costs, boost exports and encourage investment.”
Ben Harrison, Director of the Work Foundation at Lancaster University, says today’s figures show a weakening and uneven labour market, with more people looking for work and with young people particularly hit:
“While overall employment appears broadly stable and the rise in redundancies has slowed, the pain is not evenly spread. Young people, disabled people and men are bearing the brunt of the rise.
“Youth unemployment is now at 14.0%, the highest rate for five years. This is particularly concerning as the number of 18-24 year olds out of work has jumped by 80,000 on the quarter to 575,000. More young people are actively seeking work, but too many are struggling to secure it.
“Vacancies remain subdued at 726,000, despite a slight uptick on the quarter. The Government clearly recognises the need to provide more support to help people back into work but many initiatives – such as jobs on wheels and youth guarantees – remain in pilot phases.
“To Get Britain Working, Ministers must prioritise a twin focus on rapidly expanding tailored employment support and ensuring those returning to work are able to access secure, and well-paid jobs across the country.”
Unemployment rate among 18-24 year olds rises to 14%
Peter Dixon, senior economist at the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, has spotted that the number of young people out of work has risen:
At 14%, the unemployment rate among 18-24 year olds has hit its highest level since July-September 2020, more than five years ago
Dixon says:
Below the surface, there are indications that younger workers in particular are being priced out of the market.
A rise of 33 per cent in the minimum wage over the past two years has pushed up the unemployment rate for 18-24 year olds by more than two percentage points to 14 per cent.
With a further inflation-plus rise in the minimum wage for 18-20 year olds scheduled for April, young workers will continue to struggle to gain a foothold in the labour market in the near-term.”
The ONS also estimate that firms kept cutting workers in January.
Its early, provisional, estimate of payrolled employees for January 2026 shows a decrease of 11,000 within the month, meaning payrolls were 134,000 lower than a year ago.
The rise in unemployment means competition for vacancies is intensifying.
There were 2.6 unemployed people per vacancy in October to December 2025, up from 2.5 in the previous quarter (July to September 2025) and up from 1.9 in October to December 2024.
Pay rose faster in the public sector than at private companies in the last quarter of 2025, today’s labour market report shows.
Annual average regular earnings growth was 7.2% for the public sector, more than twice as fast as the 3.4% increase in the private sector, the ONS reports.
That’s quite a difference… but if you dig into the jobs report, you can see that the public sector annual growth rate is affected by some public sector pay rises being paid earlier in 2025 than in 2024.
That causes a base effect, which should phase out over the next few months.
UK pay growth was particularly weak in the last quarter of 2025 once you account for inflation.
Today’s labour market data shows that annual real regular pay (ex-bonuses) rose by just 0.8% in October to December 2025 – that’s using the Consumer Prices Index measure of inflation.
Real pay was last lower than 0.8% in June to August 2023, when it was 0.7%, the ONS reports.
Introduction: UK unemployment hits highest since early 2021
Good morning. Unemployment across the UK has hit a near five-year high, and wage growth has slowed.
The latest labour market data, just released this morning, shows that the UK jobless rate rose to 5.2% in the October-December quarter.
That’s up from 5.1% in September-November, and the highest rate since the first quarter of 2021.
The number of workers on company payrolls fell too – down by 130,000 over the year and by 46,000 over the quarter.
This follows many months of complaints from businesses that chancellor Rachel Reeves has pushed up employment costs, through increases in national insurance contributions and the minimum wage.
Earnings growth cooled in the quarter too. Basic pay (excluding bonuses) rose by 4.2% in the October-December quarter, down from 4.4% a month ago.
Total earnings (including bonuses) growth also slowed to 4.2%, down from 4.6% in September to November 2025.

Unemployment has unexpectedly risen to its highest level for five years and wage growth has slowed again as the UK jobs market continues to come under pressure, according to official figures.
The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the rate of unemployment lifted to 5.2% in the three months to December, up from 5.1% in the three months to November.
This was the highest since the three months to January 2021 and the highest for over a decade outside of the pandemic era.
Most economists had expected unemployment to remain at 5.1% in the latest quarter.
The ONS added that regular wage growth fell back once again, to 4.2% in the three months to December, against a downwardly-revised 4.4% in the three months to November, and was 0.8% higher after taking Consumer Prices Index inflation into account.
But there was a welcome increase in vacancies, up by 2,000 quarter-on-quarter to 726,000 in the three months to January.
Liz McKeown, ONS director of economic statistics, said the data showed “more people who were out of work are now actively looking for a job”.
She added: “The number of vacancies has remained broadly stable since the middle of last year.
“Alongside rising unemployment this means that the number of unemployed people per vacancy has increased, reaching a new post-pandemic high.
“Meanwhile, redundancies are also showing an upward trend.”

Shmyhal discusses compensation for damages caused to Ukraine with CoE Secretary General
First Deputy Prime Minister of Energy Denys Shmyhal met with Council of Europe Secretary General Alain Berset in Kyiv on Monday. Shmyhal announced this on his Telegram channel.
According to him, the key subject of the meeting was the need to hold Russia accountable for war crimes, particularly its daily attacks on energy production. The parties also discussed compensation for damages to Ukraine.
"I thanked the Secretary General of the Council of Europe for his clear support of Ukraine and the creation of the Register of losses as part of the International Compensation Mechanism. Ukraine continues to suffer enormous energy losses due to Russian attacks. Restoring energy infrastructure is critical to restoring normal life in the country. The enemy must compensate for everything it has destroyed," Shmyhal wrote on Telegram.

Do migrants feel they belong in Australia? The answer is complicated

While most migrants feel a growing sense of belonging in Australia, particularly within local communities, many who have recently moved to Australia still experience discrimination at a higher level, according to a new study.
The Scanlon Foundation Research Institute interviewed more than 8,000 migrants from the fastest-growing communities — China, India, Pakistan, Nepal, the Philippines and Iraq — to examine how migrants experience belonging in Australia.
Over half of the women surveyed from the above countries (51 per cent), which make up the top five fastest growing migrant populations, said they had experienced discrimination in Australia in the last year.
For the total population, nearly half (45 per cent) of migrants reported experiencing discrimination in the last 12 months, compared to only 13 per cent of people born in Australia.
Older migrants had a stronger sense of belonging, with 62 per cent of migrants over the age of 65 reporting a sense of belonging, compared to 50 per cent of those aged 18-24 years.
But the study authors note a sense of belonging is complex — this figure was contrasted by more third generation migrants (58 per cent) compared to first generation migrants (56 per cent) reporting a sense of belonging.
Senior researcher Trish Prentice told SBS the study, which was commissioned by the Department of Home Affairs, aimed to record experiences of belonging, participation and social connection.
"Connections were really strong at a neighbourhood level and they made people feel that they belong to those communities. When we looked at belonging to Australia, that was a little bit more complex."
Among longer-term migrants, 71 per cent agreed they belonged in their neighbourhoods, compared with 64 per cent of people who had recently arrived.
Belonging at a national level is low
According to a study published in the 2025 International Journal of Public Administration, when someone doesn’t feel like they belong, they can experience increased stress, decreased physical and mental health, and a reduced capacity to participate in various spheres. This can impact the process of social integration, connection with broader society, and the development of share identity — foundational for social cohesion.
Prentice said: "So when I asked people, do you feel you belong to Australia? Some people said: 'yep, I definitely do'. And some people said: 'not so much'."
The study found only 32 per cent of respondents from the focus countries felt a great sense of belonging compared to almost half of Australian-born residents.
However, most respondents felt a qualified version of belonging.
"When I asked people about those experiences, some of the factors that made them feel like they belong to Australia were things like their visa situation, having security, having had major experiences which connect them to the country more so than to a previous country, sometimes it was a sense of being shaped by Australian values," Prentice said.
Around 17 per cent of those from the focus countries reported only a slight sense of belonging, as opposed to 12 per cent of the Australian-born population.
Belonging also varied by length of residency. Those who have been in the country for longer reported similar levels of belonging to the Australian-born population. More recent arrivals then experienced a lower sense of belonging.
Sense of belonging also varied according to gender, with men tending to feel a stronger sense of belonging, regardless of whether they were born in Australia, born overseas or born in one of the focus countries.
Online rhetoric troubling
Racial justice youth advocate Varsha Yajman told SBS she’s witnessed the increasing bullying of the South Asian community in Australia.
"I remember there being a plane crash with a bunch of Indian passengers on it, and people just chose to make fun of that instead of understanding that so many people died, and seeing those things become a viral meme, and then seeing politicians also choose to talk about anti-immigration, how we should have a ban on Muslim migration and those sorts of things. It's feeling like instead of talking about social cohesion, they're just talking about division," she said.
"I think our politicians love to use phrases like social cohesion or multiculturalism and then not actually define what that means and not really take the steps to achieve it."
Yajman said people are using immigration as a scapegoat for the cost of living and housing crises.
'Belonging in Australia becomes conditional'
Associate professor at Monash University Pearl Subban told SBS belonging is dependent upon how the mainstream feel, citing the recent anti-immigration marches.
Subban is an immigrant herself, and her research focuses on racial equity.
"I think for immigrants in Australia, particularly immigrants of colour, these marches are just reminders that belonging in Australia becomes very conditional," she said.
She said the current climate makes everyday interactions for migrants fraught.
"It becomes sites where you negotiate and you calculate and ask: 'Is this space safe? Is this person safe?'"
The study found respondents born in one of the focus countries are significantly more likely to have experienced discrimination because of their skin colour, ethnic origin or religion in the past 12 months.
Being subjected to derogatory comments or insults, being told they were taking away opportunities from Australians or should ‘go back to their country,’ being stared at, being bullied, physical assault or feeling as though they were not being taken seriously when dealing with authorities, were experiences reported by the interviewees.
The study notes that experiences of discrimination or racism have the power to significantly undermine a sense of belonging by creating feelings of 'otherness'.
Such acts have the potential to disrupt an individual’s feelings of being accepted or valued as part of a community or nation. They can erode trust, weaken social connections and discourage participation in community life.
Social cohesion built from the ground up
The study found that belonging is strongest at a local level.
Migrants' sense of belonging thrived when they could contribute through volunteering, lived in a neighbourhood where people provided for and supported each other, and had close access to public spaces and their own cultural communities.
Prentice said the study helps people to understand the dynamics when it comes to migrants and belonging, connection and social participation.
"I think sometimes discussions around migration, for instance, are very one-sided about should we or shouldn't we, and what the numbers look like and things like that. And underlying that are a whole lot of human experiences."

ALBAWABA - A man was killed, and two others were critically injured in a stabbing attack in Sydney, Australia, police announced on Tuesday, as reported by DPA.
Emergency services were called to a suburb in western Sydney at around 10 a.m. local time after reports that a man had stabbed several people and then fled the scene, according to a statement from New South Wales Police. The attack occurred on a busy shopping street.
Senior Police Officer Simon Glaser said paramedics treated three people for serious injuries, including a man in his 30s or 40s who died at the scene.
He added that the other two victims, a 22-year-old man and a 47-year-old woman, were taken to the hospital in critical condition.
Glaser noted that the man was arrested shortly afterwards during a police operation in the area. He explained that the suspect is known to police for minor offences and several mental health-related incidents and is expected to appear in court later on Tuesday.
Glaser said: "The investigation is still in its early stages, and police do not yet know the motive behind the attack. However, it appears to have been a random attack."

To afficionados, fungi are freaky, mystical and overlooked. They're helping scientists learn more
Fungi have long fascinated scientists and aficionados alike
- Bookmark
Jessica Allen crunched through fallen leaves among Manzanita trees hunting for something few have spotted before: the Manzanita butter clump — a rare and little-known yellow mushroom found, so far, only along North America's Western coastlines.
It was last seen here in California's Napa County two years ago, and Allen, a fungi scientist, was keen to find it. But within minutes, something caught her attention. She knelt, pulled a hand lens to her eye, and peered nose-close into a rock: lichens — a type of fungi — bursting with dazzling shapes, textures and colors.
“It's so easy to get distracted, but there's so many lichen!" she said excitedly.
“That was a good rock,” said ecologist Jesse Miller, president of the California Lichen Society.
“Ok, let's go find some mushrooms," she exclaimed.
Allen and Miller are enchanted by what they describe as the wondrous and mystical world of fungi, and they're part of a growing community of people working to protect them. Nearly all life forms depend on the estimated 2.5 million fungi species on Earth, and they contribute an estimated $54 trillion to the global economy as food, medicine and more, according to a study published in Springer Nature. Despite their essential role, they've been largely neglected by conservation efforts even as they face increasing threats from pollution, habitat loss and climate change. That's been changing in the last decade thanks in part to citizen scientists and a greater understanding of fungi diversity.
“It’s a pretty exciting time in fungal conservation," said Allen, mycologist for NatureServe, a hub for biodiversity data throughout North America. In that role, Allen is helping accelerate and support fungal conservation in the U.S. and Canada.
Amateur researchers play a key role in conservation
Fungi are neither plants nor animals. They’re an enormous kingdom of life forms that include yeasts (essential for breads, cheeses and alcohol), molds (the fuzzy stuff on forgotten fruit), lichens (a symbiosis of fungus and algae or cyanobacteria) and mushrooms (which range from edible to psychedelic to deadly ). They’re among the planet’s great connectors and decomposers. Forests need them, and many animals rely on them for food and nesting.
People have derived medicines like penicillin from fungi. Some are used as building material or can store planet-warming carbon. But scientists have only documented about 155,000 species, 6% of the millions they believe are out there.
Conservation starts with knowing what species exist, where they are, how they’re doing and their threats, which requires boots on the ground. This allows conservationists to assess imperiled species and where to put resources.
That's where groups like the California Lichen Society come in.
“They tend to be the people that often make the most important discoveries, and they’re the ones who are going to be keeping an eye on those rare species over time,” said Allen.
On a chilly recent day, dozens of lichenologists and amateur lichen lovers fanned out across a reserve to get close to rocks and trees. These annual forays are part treasure hunt, part data collection excursion and part nature hike, except its explorers often don’t make it far.
Every powdery, leafy and branchy lichen was an invitation into a miniature world where “Wows!”, “What the hecks!” and “Oh my gods!” abound. As chemist Larry Cool put it: “Lichenologists make terrible hiking partners" because they keep stopping.
Cool's interest in lichens stretches back 53 years to the day he learned they can be used as natural dyes. “Lichen are more than the sum of its parts and are mysteriously unpredictable," he said. “I get a lot of pleasure seeing the incredible variety of creation.”
Ken Kellman is also an amateur lichenologist, but you wouldn't know that from his immense knowledge. A retired air conditioning and heating mechanic, he’s geeked out over them the last 10 years or so, learning on his own and from friends. That obsession has helped scientists discover the biodiversity in his hometown of Santa Cruz, Calif.
“It just keeps your brain in that place where you’re saying ‘Wow!' all the time. ‘That’s cool!’ And that’s my favorite place for my brain to be,” he said.
Fungi conservation in US ‘is still far behind’ but changing
Gregory Mueller has spent much of his career in fungi conservation. As co-chair of the International Union for Conservation of Nature's fungal conservation committee, he coordinates all fungal protection activity across their global network.
According to the group's Red List of Threatened Species, 411 of 1,300 evaluated fungi across the world are at risk of extinction. Parts of Europe and elsewhere have focused on fungal conservation for decades, but the U.S. “is still far behind," Mueller said. Only two fungi species — both lichen — are protected by the federal Endangered Species Act, while some states like California have legal protections, while others like New Jersey have added them to conservation plans.
That's slowly changing, in part because of increasing community science initiatives in the U.S. and abroad.
“There’s a lot of amateur mycologists ... documenting (fungi) with photographs, putting their images on iNaturalist and our Mushroom Observer, and we’ve been able to use those data to better document fungal diversity,” he said. We're "starting to get some idea of what species might be in trouble.”
Scientists are still learning about fungi and threats to them
Most fungi are out of sight, spending most of their lives hidden as a vast, threadlike network called mycelium and producing mushrooms — called the fruiting body — only when conditions are just right.
That's a big reason we know so little about them, said Nora Dunkirk, a botanist and mycologist at Portland State University’s Institute for Natural Resources working to document vulnerable plant and fungi species to help with conservation efforts.
Among their biggest threats includes climate change. Shifts in rainfall patterns, hotter temperatures and worsening wildfires can wipe them out or disturb the delicate relationships between forests and good fungi. Prolonged periods of flooding can starve them of the oxygen they need. Logging, development, invasive insects and pollution also threaten species.
Then there’s overharvesting. The grapefruit-sized and long-lived quinine conk, for example, has been listed as an endangered mushroom species in Europe since the 1980s in part because people have picked too many for their medicinal properties.
“This is an organism that grows on larches all across Europe, and so people see this as a valuable resource and they use it,” said Dunkirk. “But this species specifically has been harvested to its detriment.”
Perhaps the U.S.'s most well-known conservation story indirectly involving fungi happened in the 1990s. The Northern spotted owl was in danger, and officials realized that to save them, they had to manage the entire old-growth forest ecosystems they depended on — including fungi.
With the 1994 Northwest Forest Plan, the federal government established rules to protect about 400 rare and little-known species across three states.
Back in California, Allen and her fellow fungi-loving friends continued their quest for the elusive Manzanita butter clump. They searched up steep slopes and down by a creek, looking closely by their feet.
They never found it.
But that’s how it goes when you're searching for something as ephemeral and unpredictable as mushrooms.
“How many of my days have ended this way? So many,” said Allen. “It was still a great day.”

Russia repelled more than 150 Ukrainian drones overnight, Moscow's defence ministry told state media on Tuesday, as Kiev steps up its counter-attacks ahead of talks in Geneva.
"Overnight, air defence forces destroyed 151 Ukrainian drones over Russian regions, as well as over the Black and Azov seas," the ministry reported.
In Russian-annexed Crimea, Sevastopol governor Mikhail Razvozhayev said two dozen drones were shot down during "one of the longest attacks in recent times".
"Unfortunately, there were injuries. According to preliminary information, one child was wounded," he posted on Telegram.
On Tuesday, the two sides are set to begin another round of diplomatic negotiations backed by the United States, after two previous rounds of talks mediated by the White House yielded no breakthroughs.
While Russia occupies around one-fifth of Ukraine, Kiev has recently made battlefield advances, recapturing 201 square kilometres between Wednesday and Sunday last week, an AFP analysis of data from the Institute for the Study of War shows.

In addition to his participation in Ukrainian pro-independence affairs since the 1980s, the award was made for Shmigel’s service as an Australian journalist writing for Kyiv Post since 2022, as a contributor to all of Australia’s major newspapers, as the author of “The Drone,” a fictionalized account of Ukrainians’ war experiences, and as a strategic advisor to Ambassador Myroshnychenko.
Myroshnychenko said that while Shmigel had contributed to Ukraine’s cause over his entire adult life, he had been especially instrumental in Ukraine’s advocacy work in Australia during the course of the full-scale war. That includes helping Australian military and humanitarian support for Ukraine.
Shmigel told the Parliament House gathering that “like other writers and journalists, I feel I can make a contribution to Ukraine’s war effort by recording and reporting the stories of honorable and heroic Ukrainians.”
“Stories are spiritual steel. They are not easily bent or broken. As long as a nation has its stories, that nation remains fundamentally undefeated,” Shmigel said.

The secret late-night meeting in a Tel Aviv parking garage rocking Netanyahu’s inner circle

The appointment of Israel’s ambassador to London is awaiting a decision by police investigating the so-called “night meeting” affair amid the ongoing travel ban imposed on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s chief of staff, Tzachi Braverman, at the conclusion of his questioning on January 11. The interrogation lasted 13 consecutive hours at the offices of the Lahav 433 national crime unit.
On Monday morning, the Lod District Court heard a police appeal of a Rishon Lezion Magistrate’s Court decision by Judge Menachem Mizrahi to cancel the travel ban and narrow the list of people Braverman is barred from contacting. District Court Judge Michael Karshen said during the hearing that “there is reasonable suspicion at a sufficient level. At this stage it has not weakened but rather strengthened,” adding that the investigation is expected to conclude “in the near future,” according to a police representative. For now, he postponed his decision on whether to accept or reject the appeal.
The suspicion and the delay of the appointment in the UK
Braverman was arrested about a month ago in the early morning hours at his home in Ness Ziona on suspicion of unlawfully disclosing official information, obstruction of justice and fraud and breach of trust. According to police, he received classified information about an investigation into the leak of documents to the German newspaper Bild and passed it to Eli Feldstein to warn him or help him obstruct the probe.
Last week, Braverman was summoned to a hearing before the Civil Service Commission ahead of a possible suspension decision. At the end of his questioning, he was released to five days of house arrest and placed under strict restrictions, including a travel ban, a prohibition on contacting officials in the Prime Minister’s Office, including Netanyahu, and a ban on entering the Prime Minister’s Office and the Kirya military headquarters in Tel Aviv. The travel ban prevented him from traveling to London, where he was set to begin his post as Israel’s ambassador to the United Kingdom.
Five weeks after the overt phase of the investigation began, police are still insisting that Braverman not leave the country for his diplomatic post, citing concerns he could obstruct the investigation and that it would be difficult to summon him for questioning on short notice if he were in London. His attorneys, Jacques Chen, Yaniv Yaki and Noa Firer, told the court that “from the moment he is required again for questioning, he will arrive in Israel within 12 hours.”
Braverman’s arrest marked the launch of a public investigation by Lahav 433 into the “night meeting” affair, which centers on alleged attempts to disrupt the probe into the leak to Bild. Feldstein was also arrested and questioned about the meeting, as was Omer Mansour, an employee of the Prime Minister’s Office who was later released under restrictive conditions. A court later lifted those conditions after it was determined that his role was limited to holding the cellphones of Feldstein and Braverman while they spoke in a car, a conversation he did not hear.
Testified: the former IDF chief of staff and the incoming Mossad chief
Investigators initially believed Braverman’s information about the leak investigation originated in the Israel Defense Forces, where a military counterintelligence unit had opened an inquiry. Former IDF Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi and Military Intelligence chief Maj. Gen. Shlomi Binder gave open testimony. A senior official in Halevi’s office, who now serves in a senior intelligence position, was questioned under caution but was later cleared of suspicion after investigators concluded Braverman had not received the information from the military.
Two weeks after the investigation began, police obtained a sweeping gag order covering all details of the case, including future investigative materials that could reveal methods used by the Shin Bet security agency.
On Sunday, Prime Minister’s military secretary and incoming Mossad chief Maj. Gen. Roman Gofman gave testimony at Lahav 433 offices as part of the affair. Through his testimony, investigators sought to trace the transfer of classified material from the security services to the prime minister and determine what, if anything, passed through Braverman and whether information about the launch of the counterintelligence probe, which involved the Shin Bet, fell within his duties as chief of staff.
Feldstein’s interview — and the arrest
Feldstein, who sparked the affair, said in a television interview about two months ago that he received an urgent late-night phone call from Braverman instructing him to come immediately to a meeting on the fourth floor of a parking garage at the Kirya in Tel Aviv. Feldstein described what he called a “disruption meeting,” during which Braverman handed both of their phones to Mansour and the two sat together in a car. According to Feldstein, Braverman told him there was an investigation into the leak to Bild, showed him a note with six names and asked whether he knew them, adding, “I can shut it down.”
About three weeks after the interview aired, Braverman was arrested on suspicion of obstruction. During questioning, he did not deny that the meeting took place but said he did not clearly recall its contents. Feldstein said he could not remember the names on the note beyond one or at most two. Police are now examining whether, beyond the meeting, he took active steps to obstruct the investigation. Before making the investigation public, Lahav 433 investigators obtained approval from Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara and carried out several covert investigative steps.
'Another extension — only if something new emerges'
“The investigation began as one version against another. We have advanced significantly from that point, the evidence has strengthened and everything appears in the confidential report,” a Lahav 433 representative said Monday morning during a hearing on the police appeal of a Rishon Lezion Magistrate’s Court decision by Judge Menachem Mizrahi to lift Braverman’s travel ban and narrow the list of people he is barred from contacting. “We are at an advanced stage of the investigation and seek to conduct it without interference or investigative contamination.”
The hearing was held before Lod District Court Judge Michael Karshen, who reviewed all investigative materials and the prima facie evidence collected since the probe began. “There is reasonable suspicion at a sufficient level. At this stage it has not weakened but rather strengthened,” he said, adding that the investigation is expected to conclude “in the near future,” according to a police representative.
At a hearing last week in the Magistrate’s Court, Mizrahi rejected a police request to extend the travel ban until February 24 and significantly narrowed the list of people Braverman is barred from contacting. He also ruled that the chief of staff may meet with the prime minister. Braverman’s attorneys have denied all suspicions attributed to him by police. “Even the police do not believe Feldstein,” they said, arguing that investigators negotiated with him overturning state’s witness before ultimately backing away.
Attorney Yaniv Yaki told the court the case is “a political investigation” and that police are effectively carrying out a “targeted thwarting” of Braverman’s appointment as Israel’s ambassador to London. At Tuesday’s appeal hearing before Karshen, Yaki argued that blocking Braverman from assuming the post harms Israel’s foreign relations and national interests. He submitted a letter from Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar outlining the damage caused by the absence of an ambassador in London.
Karshen, who asked police for a projected timeline for completing the investigation after hearing from their representative, said “the investigation is not expected to last long.” He added that once some of the restrictions imposed on Braverman expire on February 24, “police will not be able to request an extension of the travel ban without something new emerging in the investigation.” He postponed his decision on whether to accept or reject the police appeal of the Magistrate’s Court ruling.

ISTANBUL
Russian and American delegations arrived in Geneva for two days of US-mediated peace talks with Ukraine, which will begin later on Tuesday, Russia’s state news agency Tass reported, citing a source.
While "avoiding unfriendly countries,” the Russian delegation's flight from Moscow to Geneva took nine hours to arrive on Tuesday morning, according to the news agency.
“Italian airspace was provided for the flight directly to Switzerland,” it said.
Tass later reported that US Special Envoy Steve Witkoff also arrived in Geneva on Tuesday.
The Ukrainian delegation arrived in Geneva on Monday evening, according to Ukrainian Secretary of the National Security and Defense Council Rustem Umerov.
“We look forward to constructive work and substantive meetings on security and humanitarian issues -- to advance towards a dignified and sustainable peace,” he said on Telegram.
The first round of trilateral security consultations this year, involving Russia, Ukraine, and the US, took place in Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates, on Jan. 23-24, with the Moscow negotiating group led by Igor Kostyukov, chief of the Main Directorate of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation.
A second round followed on Feb. 4-5 at the same location.

Hong Kong crowds flock to Tai Po wishing tree for Lunar New Year blessings
Locals and tourists alike brave the wet weather to mark the start of the Lunar New Year in time-honoured tradition
Local residents and tourists flocked to the wishing tree in Tai Po on the first day of the Lunar New Year to pray for good health, happiness and prosperity for Hong Kong.
Despite intermittent showers and temperatures of around 18 degrees Celsius (64 Fahrenheit) marking the first day of the Lunar New Year, little dampened visitors’ enthusiasm for hanging their wishing placards on the tree.
In Hong Kong, it is traditional to write one’s wishes on a card attached to an orange-shaped plastic ball and throw it onto a banyan tree in the village.
It is believed that wishes will be granted if the card is successfully hung on a branch of the tree.
“Even if it rains, I would still come,” said Wilson Chan, a 62-year-old civil servant who visits the site every Lunar New Year.
“As I get older, I wish for my good health.”

EU countries need to 'urgently coordinate' to adapt to climate change, EU's advisory board warns

More frequent climate-related events such as flooding, wildfires, repeated heatwaves, and droughts call for a precautionary approach, according to the latest report from the European Scientific Advisory Board on Climate Change.
EU countries need to "urgently coordinate" to anticipate and mitigate the effects of climate change, such as flooding, severe storms, and heatwaves, a report from the EU's advisory board on climate change warned on Tuesday.
The scientific report from the European Scientific Advisory Board on Climate Change (ESABCC) urges the EU27 to strengthen its rule-making to ensure the bloc is prepared to address the impacts of climate change by mitigating hazards and adapting to risks, exposing the European Commission's failed 2021 climate adaptation strategy.
The warning comes as Spain and Portugal are reeling from the impact of three powerful storms that triggered widespread flooding, landslides, and storm surges, leaving multiple people dead and causing billions in damage.
Storm Marta alone led to the deployment of more than 26,500 rescue workers in Portugal, with waves towering up to 13 meters and rivers bursting their banks.
Mass evacuations were carried out, and critical infrastructure suffered severe damage, especially in Andalusia, southern Spain. Emergency shelters housed thousands of displaced residents, supported by medical teams on the ground.
Portugal’s economic losses are projected to surpass €3.3 billion, while farmers face devastating crop destruction, according to local media.
Floods in Valencia in October 2024 and in Germany and Belgium in July 2021, with devastating consequences for human life and infrastructure, have also roused more calls for climate adaptation.
The ESABCC's Chair, Professor Ottmar Edenhofer, said extreme weather and climate-related events are already causing severe damage across Europe.
“Extreme heat alone has resulted in tens of thousands of premature deaths in recent years, including an estimated 24,000 in summer 2025," said Edenhofer. "Economic damages to infrastructure and physical assets now average around €45 billion per year."
"These mounting impacts underline that strengthening adaptation is not optional, but essential to protect lives, livelihoods and Europe’s economic foundations."
Adaptation and mitigation, hand-in-hand
ESABCC warns that "adaptation and mitigation must advance together" to prepare for "unavoidable temperature increases" and safeguard Europe’s strategic priorities, as projections indicate climate hazards will continue to intensify.
"A fragmented approach to adaptation could undermine collective resilience, as insufficient measures in one country may trigger impacts and increased exposure in neighbouring areas," reads the report.
Professor Laura Diaz Anadon, vice chair of the Advisory Board, backed a robust EU adaptation framework as the key to addressing systemic risks that can disrupt access to food, water and energy.
Adaptation goes beyond climate policy, Anadon added, noting that taking action today will help protect the health of EU citizens and ecosystems as well as the integrity of the bloc's single market and competitiveness.
Professor Jette Bredahl Jacobsen, vice-chair of the Advisory Board, said adaptation can't prevent all losses, noting that mitigation efforts will remain essential to limit climate hazards to manageable levels.
“Robust risk management means the EU should prepare for a range of possible futures to ensure a resilient Europe. Strengthening adaptation alongside mitigation is essential to safeguard citizens, security, and the EU’s wider strategic goals,” Jacobsen said.
Climate risk assessments, mobilising capital
ESABCC's scientists have offered recommendations for upcoming EU legislation, as the European Commission is slated to present a climate resilience strategy by the end of the year.
Scientists defend harmonised climate risk assessments across EU policies and national governments, using common climate scenarios and methodological standards.
They also urge the EU to adopt a common concept for adaptation planning, preparing for climate risks consistent with global warming of 2.8-3.3 °C by the year 2100.
Mobilising public and private investment for climate adaptation is another key recommendation by climate scientists, who claim such funds would help establish and manage the "growing costs of climate impacts through the EU budget, economic governance, and risk-sharing mechanisms".
"Adaptation has already played an important role in reducing mortality during heatwaves through measures that lower people’s vulnerability to extreme temperatures, such as building and infrastructural changes, heat-health warning systems, or increasing urban green space," reads the report.
The EU has allocated around €658 billion of its 2021-2027 long-term budget to climate action. Negotiations are ongoing to allocate funds under the 2028-2034 budget.
Austrian Green MEP Lena Schilling recently insisted that the wealthy should be taxed in an appearance at the Vienna Opera Ball, which is being sponsored by OMV, one of Austria’s largest industrial companies dealing with oil, gas and petrochemicals, where she appeared in a "Tax the Rich" dress.
“We cannot prevent the climate crisis as long as the super-rich live off untaxed inheritances as if there were no tomorrow, especially while life is becoming unaffordable for so many people,” Schilling told Euronews Green.

Private health premiums to rise at fastest rate in almost a decade

Private health premiums to rise at fastest rate in almost a decade
In short:
Private health insurance premiums will rise by an average of 4.41 per cent from April.
Health Minister Mark Butler says it reflects the rising costs of medical and hospital services.
What's next?
The opposition says the premium increase is another "hit families cannot afford".
Private health insurance premiums will rise at their fastest rate in almost a decade after the federal government approved a 4.41 per cent average increase from April.
The above-inflation rise is the largest since 2017, with Health Minister Mark Butler saying he had ordered insurers to go back to the drawing board on "multiple" occasions before landing on an agreed increase.
Mr Butler said it reflected the rising costs of medical and hospital services, which rose by 5 per cent last financial year.
"The government understands the pressure health insurance premium changes put on Australians and decisions about private health insurance premiums must put consumers first," he said in a statement.
"This premium round has been guided by my commitment to maintain the value of private health insurance for Australians, while making sure the sector plays its part in supporting private hospitals facing rising costs and significant challenges."
Each year, the health minister must approve annual premium rises, which affect more than 15 million Australians who have some form of private health insurance.
The rise is above household inflation, with the additional hip-pocket pressure coming as many Australians deal with cost-of-living pressures.
Health insurance premiums rose by an average of 3.73 per cent last year, as the federal government tried to fend off a political headache on the eve of an election that was largely fought on cost-of-living and health issues.
Private Healthcare Australia chief executive Rachel David said health funds were working to balance the affordability of health insurance with the rising cost of providing care to an aging population that had more complex needs.
"More people are using their health insurance for high-cost hospital care such as joint replacements and cancer treatment, and the cost of delivering care continues to rise. This premium increase reflects those realities," Dr David said.
"If health funds could keep premiums the same without jeopardising their ability to pay claims, they would. The industry is acutely aware of how tough many Australians are doing it right now."
'Another hit families cannot afford'
Shadow Health Minister Anne Ruston said the Albanese government had "delivered the largest health insurance premium rise in eight years".
"This only adds to the growing cost of healthcare under Labor, with Australians now paying more than $50 on average out of pocket to see a GP for the first time in Medicare's history," she said.
"At a time when household budgets are already under enormous pressure, this premium increase is another hit families cannot afford."
The government argues private health insurance premiums have risen by an average of 3.52 per cent while they have been in power, compared to average increases of 4.26 per cent under the former Coalition government.

MOSCOW, Feb 17 - A Russian court has sentenced a U.S. citizen to four years in jail for trying to take the stocks of Kalashnikov assault rifles out of a Moscow airport, the RIA state news agency reported on Tuesday.
The U.S. citizen, who collects Kalashnikov weapons, bought two Kalashnikov stocks and checked in a suitcase containing the butts at Moscow's Vnukovo airport but made no customs declaration, RIA said.
The man, who was not identified by the news agency, was found guilty under an article in the criminal code dealing with the smuggling of weapons, RIA said.
RIA said the man partially admitted his guilt. Reuters was unable to reach the man while he was in detention.
The U.S. State Department advises against all travel to Russia and has repeatedly told its citizens to leave immediately "due to terrorism, unrest, wrongful detention and other risks."
"Russian officials often question and threaten U.S. citizens without reason," the State Department says in its travel advisory. "Russian security services have arrested U.S. citizens on false charges. They have denied them fair treatment and convicted them without credible evidence."
Russian officials deny the U.S. allegations and say that the state merely enforces Russian law. REUTERS

Ramallah Art Fair shows how Palestinians create under occupation

Ramallah Art Fair confronts Gaza genocide and occupation through Palestinian resistance art
In the wake of the ongoing Israeli genocide in the Gaza Strip and daily attacks by Israeli settlers in the West Bank, the fifth edition of the Ramallah Art Fair emerges not merely as an exhibition, but as a confrontation with the Palestinian reality, with the title: Narratives Under Occupation.
Held at the Zawyeh Gallery in Ramallah until 29 March, the art fair brings together 42 artists from across occupied Palestine and the occupied Golan Heights to navigate a landscape of displacement, identity, and profound loss.
Through diverse art forms, these artists document the scars of oppression using their own tools of expression in a collective act of resistance that prioritises audience engagement.
'Narratives Under Occupation'
For Ziad Anani, the founder of Zawyeh Gallery and curator of the fair, the theme was not a preconceived framework; instead, the artworks themselves asserted their own narrative. It was the artists' raw output that dictated the exhibition's direction, rather than the theme being imposed on their work.
"The artists' submissions, all of which reflected the experience of living under occupation, explored the personal stories and the deep connection between the artist's work and their environment," Ziad tells The New Arab.
Ziad is relieved that the fair has overcome significant hurdles, particularly shipping delays caused by Israeli closures and checkpoints.
These logistical barriers highlight the fragmented geography Palestinians must navigate, where moving art across borders and internal divides remains an ongoing challenge.
"Even before the genocide in Gaza, showcasing Gazan artists in the West Bank was fraught with difficulty and risk," Ziad adds.
"There was always that underlying tension: Will the work arrive? Will it be seized? Now, the situation is critical. So many artists in Gaza have seen their studios levelled and their life's work reduced to rubble," he adds.
"For those who managed to save their pieces and carry them into Egypt, that art is a miracle. This reality underscores why distributing Palestinian art globally is no longer just about exposure; it is a vital act of documentation and survival."
Shafik Radwan (1941), the eldest artist in the exhibition, lost his home and all his artistic archives to the destruction in Gaza.
However, a fragment of his legacy survives: since 2015, the gallery in Ramallah has held a portion of his work. Fearing the loss of his art to future Israeli military incursions, Shafik had insisted the gallery keep several pieces in safekeeping. One of these preserved works is now featured in the fair's Rare Section.
The fair introduced the Rare Section during the fourth edition. A section that Ziad believes is vital for the local Palestinian public to encounter rare works by iconic artists they might never have the opportunity to see in person.
Following last year's debut of Ismail Shammout's prints, this year features Samia Halaby, whose work the fair is exhibiting in Ramallah for the very first time. The section also showcases the influential Kamal Boullata and the late Vladimir Tamari.
"While we see strong interest from international collectors, our primary goal is for the local audience to connect with this calibre of art. By engaging with the history of these cultural pioneers through this section, visitors experience a profound, emotional connection to the legacy of Palestinian art," Ziad remarks.
Cross-generational dialogue
The impact Ziad envisions extends to the younger generation of creators featured in the fair.
Heba Tannous (1995), a Ramallah-based artist and architect who is participating with six paintings titled The City From Above, told The New Arab that the exhibition serves as a vital platform for cross-generational dialogue.
"Each artist brings their own perspective and lens to the work," Heba explains.
"It is essential to have a space where these varied experiences and forms of expression can converge and enter into a collective conversation."
Heba emphasises that, in an environment with severe scarcity of public platforms, the fair serves as a vital window into artists' studios.
"Our art is deeply rooted in the local experience and the specific lens through which we view our surroundings," she shares.
"Therefore, the Palestinian community should be the primary audience. Once we establish this solid foundation at home, it naturally opens the door for broader, more diverse exposure."
The City From Above offers Heba's "eagle-eye" view of Ramallah, providing a straightforward representation of the urban reality.
The series captures the raw architecture of daily life: the refugee camps, streets, homes, and local shops.
Avoiding a romanticised lens, Heba stays as close as possible to the narrative of Palestinian existence.
"Unfortunately, this life is constantly hemmed in by the realities of occupation, yet it remains deeply contemporary," she explains.
"My goal was to explore the modern Palestinian identity, what it looks like right now, and how we navigate our lives in this current moment."
The diaspora lens
While Heba Tannous observes the city from a bird's-eye view, Egypt-based artist Mira Shihadeh (1971) approaches Palestine through the lens of the diaspora, reimagining the homeland from afar.
"My art is simply a reflection of the Palestinian people. I want to be almost deceptive, creating something that looks beautiful from a distance but reveals a deeper, more unsettling story when you look closer," Mira tells The New Arab.
"I want the viewer to be drawn in by the beauty, only to realise that there is much more going on beneath the surface. Perhaps that is how we address the narrative of occupation: by painting a beautiful landscape that, upon closer inspection, is scattered with checkpoints."
Mira's work explores the intersection of politics, class, and gender, positioning the female body as a powerful site of resistance and agency.
Her approach is deeply influenced by 20 years as a yoga instructor, which infuses her figurative paintings with a profound understanding of movement and the mind-body connection.
From her position in the diaspora, Mira views the fair's persistence under siege with a sense of "humble distance," recognising that in an environment of closed borders and a halted art market, the very act of gathering becomes a form of resistance.
"Respect," she remarked, reflecting on the weight of the moment. "I wonder what the mood is like there. Are people actually excited for an exhibition?"
Her curiosity underscores the complex emotional landscape of the event, where the local community's response to art in a time of crisis is often a bittersweet mixture of profound relief and heavy-heartedness.
A challenge that Ziad is aware of. He notes that travel restrictions and ongoing tensions have halted the flow of international tourists and collectors.
However, despite these hurdles, staying in Ramallah is non-negotiable for Ziad. The gallery has become a vital cultural hub where artists meet, debate, and create.
"Culturally, we are part of the nation's fabric. Ramallah is the source of our production; without it, our global reach would not exist," he shares.
Today, Zawyeh Gallery operates as a global hub, anchored by its creative heart in Ramallah.
From Dubai, Ziad helps extend that vision outward, connecting Palestinian artists with collectors across Europe, the Americas, and the Gulf, and channelling international reach back toward sustaining the gallery's work at home.

Fight to ban Russian steel intensifies in Brussels

The European Parliament is pushing for a full ban on Russian steel to choke off Moscow’s revenues, but several EU governments still rely on importing it. High-stakes negotiations start next week.
Four years after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the European Union is still importing Russian steel – and not everyone is happy about it.
Next week, MEPs and EU member states will begin negotiations on whether to ban Russian steel outright. What began as a sanctions debate has morphed into a high-stakes political fight.
Swedish lawmaker Karin Karlsbro is preparing to take on the EU council, which represents the member states, with Belgium, Italy, the Czech Republic and Denmark all arguing that they still need imports of unfinished steel for major construction projects.
“It is a big provocation that we haven't done everything possible to limit Putin's war chest,” Karlsbro told Euronews. “The Russian steel industry is a backbone of Russian war, it is the Russian war machinery.”
Finished Russian steel was banned in 2022, but semi-finished steel, a key input for further processing, was spared after a number of countries secured an exemption until 2028 to cushion the blow to their industries.
“Unfinished steel can’t be produced anywhere in the EU,” a European diplomat from one of those countries told Euronews, “while it is required for big infrastructures.”
Three million tonnes
Karlsbro says she was astonished to learn that EU imports of Russian steel amount to nearly 3 million tonnes a year, roughly equivalent to Sweden’s entire annual output and worth around €1.7 billion.
For her, the type of steel is beside the point.
“There is absolutely no argument that this is special steel or highly qualified steel with any essential quality. There is simply no additional reason to buy this steel,” she said.
To bypass the unanimity required for the adoption of EU sanctions by the member states, Karlsbro inserted a ban on Russian steel into a separate European Commission proposal aimed at shielding the bloc from global steel overcapacity, as US tariffs divert excess supply toward Europe.
The European Parliament’s trade committee approved the move on 27 January.
The procedural shift is crucial. Unlike sanctions, the trade file requires onlythe support ofa qualified majority of EU countries, potentially sidelining governments that might otherwise veto a full ban.
“The Parliament is playing politics on this,” an industry source familiar with the file told Euronews.
Another diplomat from a country dependent on Russian semi-finished steel said the ban was important for his government, which is why the 2028 deadline has been set – highlighting the dilemma the EU faces as it balances industrial needs with the need to confront the full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
The talks are beginning as the fourth anniversary of Russia’s invasion approaches, and the clock is ticking. By June, the EU must adopt the Commission’s plan to shield its market from a glut of global steel.
One diplomat insisted the two files – banning Russian steel and protecting the EU market from overcapacity – pursue “totally different goals”.
Still, the same diplomat acknowledged the ban could pass, as there are not enough member states pushing to maintain a phase-out only by 2028.

A man pushed me in the street, he wanted to teach me a lesson. Is that OK now? | Lucy Pasha-Robinson

What motivates a stranger to push a woman in public? That’s a question I’ve been stuck on this week after a man shoved me out of his way on an empty pedestrian street. I didn’t even see him coming – well, I wouldn’t have, as he came up from behind me.
I had walked in his path, he barked at me. “What path?” I thought, baffled, as I took in the huge expanse of empty pavement around us. I was so stupefied by the encounter that I found myself frozen to the spot, watching him walk away in his blue anorak and technical rucksack. He could have been any man from anywhere on his way to work.
As far as street harassment goes, many will have suffered far, far worse. But what made the incident uniquely disturbing was that it was the third similar encounter in as many months. In December, a man verbally harassed me on the tube as I went down an escalator – for walking “too slowly” this time.
Last week, I was peering into a restaurant when I collided head-first with a man walking towards me. The pavement was empty and four metres wide. Why hadn’t he moved out of the way? I asked him. Because I should have been looking where I was going, he told me.
Perhaps I am a slow meanderer of the worst type and the story here is how unaware we have become in public spaces. Who doesn’t find other people annoying? Especially oblivious ones. “Am I oblivious?” I asked my husband. “No,” he told me, “but so what if you were?” He was right. Why, when someone bumps into me, is my reaction to say sorry, or move aside? Why was it the reaction of three men to shout or walk into me, to push me?
I spoke to some women in my life about what had happened, and many shared similar experiences. A colleague tells me a story that is eerily similar to mine. A man barged past her from behind on an empty street – only she had the chutzpah to chase after him in a rage.
Another colleague won’t run any more after a man tried to hit her with his lorry.
Another was told she needed to “shut the fuck up” because she was supposedly talking too loudly in a pub with friends.
Female black and brown friends describe experiencing casual racism on a scale they’ve never encountered before.
A tall friend says she gets shouted at all the time. A small friend says she has never been harassed as much in her life as she was this summer.
A man screamed “CUNT” in the face of an older friend.
And I can bet almost every woman reading this will have had a similar experience. Of men wanting to teach them a lesson – that sharing public space isn’t a man’s job, it’s a woman’s.
Somewhere along the way, the handbrake has come off. Feelings that were once contained now seem to be spilling over. After each encounter, I was left with a gnawing feeling disproportionate to the event itself, an overwhelming sense that something deeply sinister had happened. What thoughts do these men have about women if this is the stuff they are saying out loud? How do they treat the women in their lives if they are so angry they are capable of pushing a woman at 10.30am on a Friday?
“Don’t let that prick ruin your day,” a woman said, after the incident. She appeared – and it is always a woman – like an angel to offer support and solidarity. But it did ruin my day. I walked around feeling heavy, ruminating on how anyone could behave like that, how he could break the social contract so completely.
And the next time I go out alone, on a weekday morning, I assume the brace position. I feel the threat of violence just under the surface. I carry suspicion with me. I wonder what my next encounter with a stranger will look like.

‘Swim, soak, switch off’: an off-grid cabin stay in the Scottish Borders
Unknown

The tiny, off-grid cabin looked almost unreal: made of repurposed oak it stood by a private lochan, with separate cedar sauna, cold outdoor shower, sunken hot tub, and a jetty with two hammocks and a pair of paddleboards. It screamed Finland or Sweden, not a sheep and deer farm in the Scottish Borders. It was the sort of isolated location that would set Ben Fogle’s heart racing in New Lives in the Wild. Two swans bugled my arrival. I felt a little embarrassed that all of it was mine.
Sometimes, we need to escape to a place where the phone coverage is bad enough to make you believe you’re somewhere truly wild. Tiny Home Borders, hidden in rippling foothills 10 miles east of Hawick, is such a place. Last August, owners David and Claire Mactaggart opened a second two-person cabin on their farmland (the first opened in 2022) and I jumped at the chance to stay, swim, soak, and – crucially – switch-off.
That first night, on the windblown deck a metre above the lapping water, I fired up the outdoor wood oven and tried to relax. But there was too much to do. First, I had a sauna. Then, I braved a cold plunge in the lochan and a rewarding soak in the burbling hot tub, with the smell of wood smoke filling my nostrils. A pizza followed beside the cabin’s crackling log burner, and later I stargazed using the cabin’s fabulous telescope.
As farms seek new ways to make money, farm stays and agritourism are, unsurprisingly a growing sector. According to Visit Scotland, the combined value of agritourism and farm retail could reach £250m by 2030, a rise driven by growing consumer interest in sustainable tourism. Fittingly, the country is to host the inaugural Global Agritourism Conference in June, and the big topic of discussion within farming is not only the increasing costs of food production but how to diversify and do so sustainably.
The Mactaggarts built their first tiny hut out of an old bale trailer, as an experiment more than anything else. The dream was to create an eco home away from home, with a mezzanine sleeping space above the lounge and kitchen, and with drama to match the setting below Rubers Law, a mini Ben Nevis on the banks of the River Teviot. Then, quickly, one cabin became two, the second built far out of sight of the other. Plans are afoot for a third cabin in another glen on the farm. And everything is as eco as possible, with hemp insulation, solar panels and batteries, reclaimed wood from the farm – and no wifi.
A 90-minute drive from Edinburgh, the location is a great base for exploring an undervisited part of the country. “The Borders is nothing more than a drive-through for many visitors coming north,” Claire said. “It’s a beautiful area, but it’s one so few know about,” David added.
Beside the location, breakfast is one of the delights of a stay. Fresh bread. Salty butter. Homemade marmalade. Farm eggs, when the hens are laying. Coffee on the deck and a set of binoculars provided. On my first morning, the sky shone saltire blue.
Wildlife adds to the picture. Red deer outnumber people in these hills, so with wellies on after breakfast, I headed up the gentle slopes of Rubers Law to look for the Borders’ Big Five: bellowing deer, plus sheep, fox, pheasant and red squirrel.
I passed along a muddy single track where wildflowers and wild garlic starting to sprout below hawthorn. Ahead, I saw two vicar-collared male pheasants, then, farther up the brae, five enormous hind deer that had come down from the cold of the hill. In the distance, where the path ended, I could see ducks, sheep, cattle and horses. It was Old MacDonald Had a Farm sprung to life.
Few parts of the Borders are lovelier than historic Hawick. This town of textile weavers is full of cosy cafes, craft shops and tweed retailers that are perfect for a hit of winter warmth, and the centre is stitched together by four bridges, but also by mills for some of the world’s best-known knitwear manufacturers, including Hawico and Lovat Mill.
Perhaps most striking is Johnstons of Elgin, home to a visitor centre, cafe and showroom designed to showcase the appeal of Borders knitwear. Thanks to Hawick’s longstanding tradition, its cashmere, merino and tweed pieces are now coveted by the biggest names in haute couture: Chanel, Dior, Louis Vuitton and Ralph Lauren.
After lunch at nearby Damascus Drum, a cafe-bookshop decorated with flat-weave rugs, I joined a guided tour of Johnstons of Elgin’s newly extended operation at Eastfield Mill, which opened last August. The mill is labyrinthine and atmospheric, home to hundreds of knitters, needle-workers and machines, all hand-finishing, stitching and whirring. Next to this is a yarn library holding 18 tonnes of kaleidoscopic colour, from gorse yellow to heathery purple.
My last stop was the Borders Distillery in the town’s former hydroelectric plant, a fitting place to finish on a winter’s day. With the rain pouring outside, the sky dark as slate, a glass of blended Scotch at the tour’s end from distiller David Shuttleworth felt like a blessing. The glass smelt of green apples and grass, and I was perfectly able to picture the Borders farms that grow the barley for the spirit’s malt.
“The whisky industry is about storytelling and ours is tied to Hawick’s landscape,” said David. “The Teviot brought us here and all our malt comes from 20 miles around the distillery.” That also translates to a low carbon footprint and a community-driven vision that, combined with a takeaway miniature dram, left me feeling heartened.
Back at the cabin, it was late, and, out there in the darkness, I sat under the deck’s awning in the rain, my glass of whisky drained. What a great wee place Hawick is, I thought. What a place of rural community and inspiration. And hopefully many newcomers will agree with the Mactaggarts – that this is a place that’s been overlooked by too many for too long.
The trip was provided by Visit Scotland and Tiny Home Borders. Tiny Home One sleeps two, from £180 per night B&B (two-night minimum, including pick up if travelling by public transport). Johnstons of Elgin tours cost £15. Borders Distillery tours, £20. For more information on visiting Hawick, see Scotland Starts Here

My internet provider informed me by email that full fibre broadband had become available for my property, confirmed by Openreach’s “fibre checker” tool.
After a month, Openreach declared the connection uneconomical due to blockages in the conduits below the road.
I can’t change provider as it claims my property is connectable, so ISPs will only quote for full fibre.
JN, Teignmouth, Devon
Openreach miraculously found a solution after I raised the issue.
It said commercial factors may delay an upgrade if infrastructure is inadequate. It added that its online checker is only “an indicator “of a fibre connection” not a guarantee.
“We’ve taken a detailed look at what’s needed to connect JN’s home and found a way to get it done,” it said.
“Sometimes we find unexpected problems when we come to build the final connection. These cases are rare, and when they happen, we work hard to fix them, but we’re sorry that we can’t always do that.”

War update: 201 combat clashes on front line over past day, heaviest fighting in Pokrovsk and Huliaipole sectors
According to Ukrinform, the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine stated this on Facebook, updating on the situation as of 08:00 on Tuesday, February 17.
The enemy carried out two missile strikes using five missiles and launched 81 airstrikes, dropping 200 guided aerial bombs.
In addition, Russian forces deployed 4,574 kamikaze drones and conducted 2,306 shelling attacks, including 56 from multiple launch rocket systems.
Russian aircraft struck areas near Velykomykhailivka, Malynivka, Vovche in the Dnipropetrovsk region, Samiilivka, Novoukrainka, Kopani, Hirke, Shyroke, Charivne, Myrne, Liubytske, Vozdvyzhivka, Rozivka, Nizhenka, Mykilske, Novoandriivka, Kushchove in the Zaporizhzhia region, as well as Olhivka and Vesele in the Kherson region.
Ukrainian Defense Forces aviation struck five areas where Russian personnel were concentrated.
In the Northern Slobozhanshchyna and Kursk sectors, seven clashes occurred. The enemy carried out 88 shelling attacks, including three using MLRS.

MOSCOW, February 17. /TASS/. Russian specialists have developed the Bulavka FPV air defense system, which can be used for kinetic destruction of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), the system developer Rossi told TASS.
"The Bulavka FPV air defense system is our new product, designed for the kinetic destruction of UAVs. The drone is not equipped with a warhead, and its maximum payload is 200 grams. The Bulavka’s maximum speed is 270 km/h. The drone can be used to protect populated areas, fuel and energy, and other facilities," the company representatives said.
According to Rossi, the Bulavka has already undergone a series of tests and could potentially be used to protect Russia's border regions.

St Kilda hero’s brother believed to have met with foul play

St Kilda hero’s brother believed to have met with foul play
St Kilda legend Barry Breen’s fraudster younger brother, who vanished without a trace 14 years ago, may have been the victim of foul play, police now believe.
Brendan Breen was last seen with his girlfriend at the Hilton hotel in South Wharf on April 12, 2012, where the pair had been staying after flying back from a three-week holiday in Thailand and Singapore.
The father of two, who was unemployed at the time and staying at different addresses, was due to catch up for dinner with his ex-partner that night but cancelled at the last minute via text message. Breen was never seen or heard from again.
The convicted fraudster also went by the surnames Green and Lacombe, and the alias Brian Green. His family reported him missing the following month, having grown increasingly concerned about his welfare when he failed to attend his daughter’s wedding.
Breen is a member of a large and supportive extended family which includes brother Barry, who famously kicked the last-gasp behind in the 1966 grand final that led St Kilda to its only ever flag, and several other siblings.
Suspicions among his loved ones that something was badly wrong grew in 2018, when Breen did not attend his daughter’s funeral. His phone and bank accounts have not been accessed since 2012.
“I always thought there was something not right,” Breen’s twin sister, Fiona Dwyer, said. “If anyone is out there that knows what’s happened to Brendan, it would be the kindest of things to do to come forward and share whatever information you have.”
Police issued an appeal on Tuesday for information on what had happened to Breen.
Detective Inspector Dave Dunstan said the missing persons squad had recently re-examined the case and reached the conclusion he was likely to have been the victim of foul play.
Dunstan said police had spoken to friends and associates of Breen’s in an effort to find him but had run out of leads on what might have happened to him.
“We’re hoping someone will do the right thing and let us know what happened to Brendan and come forward now,” Dunstan said.
“There’s plenty of water under the bridge since then, and hopefully now’s the time they can come provide that information and give the family the closure they desperately need”.
In 2007, Breen was sentenced to 5½ years’ jail over his involvement in a fraud ring, the court ordering he spend a minimum of three years behind bars. The sentence was reduced on appeal to a minimum of 18 months after the court considered Breen had a new partner who was supporting him through psychological counselling.
The court heard Breen, who was 50 at the time of his offending, and two co-accusedhad used fake ID papers under false names to commit frauds upon banks and other lenders.
A further co-accused had created the fake IDs and then sold them to Breen and his co-offenders, the court heard.
Breen had tried to convince the court that his offending was due to a dissociative identity disorder – a condition that was formerly known as having a split personality.
Though the Crown had argued there was no proof this had led to his offending, a report by Breen’s psychologist noted: “I am unable to assess at this time the number or discrete nature of his ego fragmentation.”
Breen had an extensive criminal history including several dishonesty offences since moving into a life of crime in his 40s. He was on parole for other offences at the time of his sentencing.
While some of Breen’s frauds were small – in one instance a fake bank card was used to secure $2080 from a bank – others were larger, including using false documentation to finance the purchase of a BMW.
Dwyer, who drifted apart from Breen as an adult, said a breakthrough in the case would bring much needed closure to the family.
“No matter what he has done, if he has done the wrong thing, if he was doing the wrong thing, he’s still my brother,” she said. “Please come forward. Please come forward and help us. Help us find out what’s happened to him.”

India eyes $200B in data center investments as it ramps up its AI hub ambitions

India eyes $200B in data center investments as it ramps up its AI hub ambitions
India is trying to pull in up to $200 billion in investments for data centers as it pushes to become a global AI hub
- Bookmark
India is hoping to garner as much as $200 billion in investments for data centers over the next few years as it scales up its ambitions to become a hub for artificial intelligence, the country’s minister for electronics and information technology said Tuesday.
The investments underscore the reliance of tech titans on India as a key technology and talent base in the global race for AI dominance. For New Delhi, they bring in high-value infrastructure and foreign capital at a scale that can accelerate its digital transformation ambitions.
The push comes as governments worldwide race to harness AI's economic potential while grappling with job disruption, regulation and the growing concentration of computing power in a few rich countries and companies.
“Today, India is being seen as a trusted AI partner to the Global South nations seeking open, affordable and development-focused solutions,” Ashwini Vaishnaw told The Associated Press in an email interview, as New Delhi hosts a major AI Impact Summit this week drawing participation from at least 20 global leaders and a who’s who of the tech industry.
In October, Google announced a $15 billion investment plan in India over the next five years to establish its first artificial intelligence hub in the South Asian country. Microsoft followed two months later with its biggest-ever Asia investment announcement of $17.5 billion to advance India’s cloud and artificial intelligence infrastructure over the next four years.
Amazon too has committed $35 billion investment in India by 2030 to expand its business, specifically targeting AI-driven digitization. The cumulative investments are part of $200 billion in investments that are in the pipeline and New Delhi hopes would flow in.
Vaishnaw said India’s pitch is that artificial intelligence must deliver measurable impacts at scale rather than remain an elite technology.
“A trusted AI ecosystem will attract investment and accelerate adoption,” he said, adding that a central pillar of India’s strategy to capitalize on the use of AI is building infrastructure.
The government recently announced a long-term tax holiday for data centers as it hopes to provide policy certainty and attract global capital.
Vaishnaw said the government has already operationalized a shared computing facility with more than 38,000 graphics processing units, or GPUs, allowing startups, researchers and public institutions to access high-end computing without heavy upfront costs.
“AI must not become exclusive. It must remain widely accessible,” he said.
Alongside the infrastructure drive, India is backing the development of sovereign foundational AI models trained on Indian languages and local contexts. Some of these models meet global benchmarks and in certain tasks rival widely used large language models, Vaishnaw said.
India is also seeking a larger role in shaping how AI is built and deployed globally as the country doesn’t see itself strictly as a “rule maker or rule taker,” according to Vaishnaw, but an active participant in setting practical, workable norms while expanding its AI services footprint worldwide.
“India will become a major provider of AI services in the near future,” he said, describing a strategy that is “self-reliant yet globally integrated” across applications, models, chips, infrastructure and energy.
Investor confidence is another focus area for New Delhi as global tech funding becomes more cautious.
Vaishnaw said the technology’s push is backed by execution, pointing to the Indian government's AI Mission program which emphasizes sector specific solutions through public-private partnerships.
The government is also betting on reskilling its workforce as global concerns grow that AI could disrupt white collar and technology jobs. New Delhi is scaling AI education across universities, skilling programs and online platforms to build a large AI-ready talent pool, the minister said.
Widespread 5G connectivity across the country and a young, tech-savvy population are expected to help with the adoption of AI at a faster pace, he added.
Balancing innovation with safeguards remains a challenge though, as AI expands into sensitive sectors such as governance, health care and finance.
Vaishnaw outlined a fourfold strategy that includes implementable global frameworks, trusted AI infrastructure, regulation of harmful misinformation and stronger human and technical capacity to hedge the impact.
“The future of AI should be inclusive, distributed and development-focused,” he said.

Barcelona lose to Girona 2-1 after Lamine Yamal’s penalty miss
Barca miss a chance to move above Real Madrid in the Spanish league as Catalan neighbours Girona climb to 12th.
Lamine Yamal missed a penalty as Barcelona lost to Girona 2-1, passing up a chance to overtake Real Madrid at the top of La Liga. The defeat was the second in less than a week for Barca and left them second in the table, two points behind Madrid.
A win on Monday would have taken the defending champions above their archrivals, but, instead, a crisis brewed for coach Hansi Flick, whose side lost to Atletico Madrid 4-0 in the Copa del Rey last week.
The second loss came even though Barcelona took the lead early in the second half.
Yamal hit the post with his spot kick on the stroke of half-time, but 14 minutes into the second period, Pau Cubarsi met Jules Kounde’s cross from the right and placed his header perfectly into the top corner.
The goal was Barcelona’s 100th in all competitions this season, making them the second club in Europe’s big five domestic leagues to hit the century mark after Bayern Munich.
However, Girona roared back into the game just three minutes later.
Barcelona’s Joan Garcia was already the busier of the two goalkeepers, but he could not stop Thomas Lemar side-footing home from close range after nice work from Vladyslav Vanat on the left wing.
Both sides pushed for a decisive second, and it was Girona who executed with three minutes remaining, substitute Fran Beltran scoring with a low shot from just inside the box.
Girona’s Joel Roca was sent off in the dying seconds, but there were no more goals.
The victory ended a three-game winless streak for Girona and lifted them by three places into 12th, equal on points with Getafe.
Only seven points separate the 11 clubs from eighth to 18th in La Liga.

Russia carried out another large-scale overnight attack on Ukraine early Tuesday morning, Feb. 17, striking Odesa and the Dnipropetrovsk region just hours before a new round of peace talks in Geneva.
Russian drones targeted Odesa and surrounding areas, damaging civilian and energy infrastructure. Two people were reported injured.

One drone hit an upper floor of a residential building, while separate strikes damaged warehouses and a service station, destroying two cars.
DTEK said Russia inflicted fresh, devastating damage to Odesa’s energy infrastructure overnight.
“The damage is extremely serious. Repairs will take a long time to restore the equipment to working order,” the company said.
DTEK added that restoring power to critical infrastructure is now the top priority.
“We are currently working on site, clearing the rubble. We will do everything possible to eliminate the consequences of the attack as soon as possible,” the statement reads.
The Dnipropetrovsk region came under combined missile, drone, artillery and aerial bomb attacks. In Dnipro, a private enterprise, administrative buildings, homes and vehicles were damaged.
An industrial facility was hit in Kryvyi Rih, and housing was damaged in the Kamianske district. No casualties were reported there.
Western regions of Ukraine were also targeted, with assessments of damage still underway.
Ukrainian monitoring channels said Tuesday’s missile barrage on critical infrastructure largely failed, noting that air defenses intercepted more than 70% of missiles and a significant share of attack drones.
Russian Poisonings Aim to Kill – and Send a Message
Most UAVs were downed by air defense systems, mobile fire groups and fighter aircraft, with only isolated hits recorded.
The Ukrainian Air Force later reported on Telegram that since 6 p.m. on Feb. 16, Russia launched a massive combined strike using four Iskander-M ballistic missiles, 20 Kh-101 air-launched cruise missiles, four Iskander-K cruise missiles, one Kh-59/69 guided aircraft missile, and 396 attack drones of various types - including Shahed, Gerbera and Italmas models. About 250 of the UAVs were Shaheds.
The air assault was repelled by Ukrainian aviation, air defense missile units, electronic warfare and unmanned systems forces, as well as mobile fire groups of the Defense Forces.
According to preliminary data as of 09:30 a.m., air defenses shot down or suppressed 392 aerial targets, including:
- 20 Kh-101 cruise missiles
- four Iskander-K cruise missiles
- one Kh-59/69 guided missile
- 367 Russian UAVs
The Air Force said four ballistic missiles and 18 strike drones hit targets at 13 locations, while debris from intercepted weapons fell at eight additional sites.
President Volodymyr Zelensky responded on Telegram, saying rescue and repair work is ongoing across many regions.
“It was a combined strike, specifically calculated to cause as much damage as possible to our energy sector,” he wrote.
Zelensky revealed that tens of thousands in Odesa are left without heat and water after the drone attack, and that all necessary services are working to provide aid.
In total, 12 regions were hit, with nine people injured, including children. More than ten residential buildings and railways were damaged.
“Partners must respond to all these strikes against life. Russia must be held accountable for aggression. Our diplomacy will be more effective if there is justice and strength,” Zelensky said.
He added that pressure on Russia comes from sanctions, rapid and constant support for the Ukrainian army, and strong air defenses.
“For peace to be real and just, we need to act against the sole source of this aggression. It is Moscow that continues the murders, massive attacks, and assaults,” Zelensky wrote.
The strike came on the eve of the third round of negotiations in Geneva, scheduled for Feb. 17-18.
Ukraine’s delegation has already arrived in Geneva. The talks will begin Tuesday, National Security and Defense Council Secretary Rustem Umerov confirmed, saying Kyiv is prepared for substantive discussions on security and humanitarian issues and remains committed to achieving a sustainable peace.
The sides previously met twice in Abu Dhabi. Ahead of the Geneva round, Moscow reshuffled its delegation, appointing Vladimir Medinsky, an aide to Russian President Vladimir Putin, as its head.

US citizen jailed in Russia after trying to take Kalashnikov rifles out of Moscow airport

A Russian court has sentenced a U.S. citizen to four years in jail for trying to take the stocks of Kalashnikov assault rifles out of a Moscow airport, the RIA state news agency reported on Tuesday.
The U.S. citizen, who collects Kalashnikov weapons, bought two Kalashnikov stocks and checked in a suitcase containing the butts at Moscow's Vnukovo airport but made no customs declaration, RIA said.
The man, who was not identified by the news agency, was found guilty under an article in the criminal code dealing with the smuggling of weapons, RIA said.
RIA said the man partially admitted his guilt. Reuters was unable to reach the man while he was in detention.
The U.S. State Department advises against all travel to Russia and has repeatedly told its citizens to leave immediately "due to terrorism, unrest, wrongful detention and other risks."
"Russian officials often question and threaten U.S. citizens without reason," the State Department says in its travel advisory. "Russian security services have arrested U.S. citizens on false charges. They have denied them fair treatment and convicted them without credible evidence."
Russian officials deny the U.S. allegations and say that the state merely enforces Russian law.

Türkiye’s president to visit Ethiopia after more than a decade
Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s trip to Addis Ababa at the invitation of Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed comes as two countries commemorate century of formal relations
ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s upcoming visit to Ethiopia has received wide coverage in local media, highlighting its diplomatic significance as the two countries mark 100 years since the opening of Türkiye’s embassy in the capital Addis Ababa, a milestone in relations that date back as far as the 16th century.
Both state-owned and private media outlets have broadly portrayed the visit positively, emphasizing longstanding ties, growing economic engagement and Ankara’s diplomatic role in the region.
The trip, scheduled for Tuesday at the invitation of Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, will be Erdogan’s first to Ethiopia in more than a decade.
State-run Fana Broadcasting Corporation has framed the visit as a level up in bilateral relations. In one article about the Turkish president, the headline portrayed him as “the architect of the new Türkiye.”
Private media outlet Addis Standard also reported on the visit, linking it to tensions in the Horn of Africa and Türkiye’s diplomatic engagement in the region. Its coverage said the two countries are expected to sign various cooperation agreements that have already been reached at the official level.
In another report, Pulse of Africa, a pan-African digital media platform launched last October by Abiy, underscored that Türkiye is strengthening its presence in the Red Sea and Horn of Africa as President Erdogan visits Addis Ababa to expand trade, infrastructure and security ties.
Speaking at an event marking the century-old bilateral relations, Türkiye’s ambassador to Ethiopia, Berk Baran, said Erdogan’s visit marks “the elevation of already strong ties.”
“Türkiye and Ethiopia already enjoy a strategic relationship in various aspects, including political, economic and social relations,” he said.
Consistent political ties and dialogue
"In this ambivalent global order, Türkiye and Ethiopia have built a very consistent open relationship without third-party mediation. This should be kept and strengthened,” Emre Yasin Kekec, an independent researcher based in Türkiye, told Anadolu.
Analysts say the relationship has been shaped by mutual political understanding, even when national interests differed.
"I believe Türkiye understands Ethiopia’s positions; we’ve seen this during the Nile dispute, we have seen this during its quest for sea access, and this stems from similarities of geographical context and statehood history," said Ibrahim Mulushewa, a researcher and head of a think-tank based in Addis Ababa, speaking at a panel marking the centennial of ties.
He said this shared perspective has enabled direct engagement between the two countries.
"Turkish understanding sometimes might not be on the same page, but at least both countries see the perspectives, and that very reason created dialogic and direct relations, which also made Türkiye succeed in mediating very sensitive regional matters like that of the Ethiopia-Somalia dispute, which was resolved through the historic Ankara declaration," he said.
People-to-people ties anchor relations
Speaking at a panel discussion on the occasion of the centennial of official bilateral relations, Baran said “the century-old people-to-people diplomacy has been the core character of bilateral relations between Türkiye and Ethiopia,” noting that President Erdogan’s visit “marks a new level of bilateral ties."
Analysts also say the partnership has been sustained as much by societal connections as by formal diplomacy.
“Mostly talks revolve around political diplomacy, while the real bridge is people-to-people relations,” Kekec said.
Scholars also highlighted the role of cultural diplomacy in shaping public perceptions.
“The cultural, social and artistic diplomacy is mostly overlooked, as it is mostly overshadowed by political diplomacy. However, in the Ethiopian context, Turkish TV shows, students like myself who studied in Türkiye, and cultural resonance have made the country positively portrayed across the country,” said Abdulaziz Dino, a lecturer at Addis Ababa University who holds a PhD from Ankara University.
“In this ever-changing global order, traditional diplomacy, though it plays a vital role, would have much less impact unless it is supported by media, cultural and social capital,” he added.
According to the scholars, Erdogan’s visit reflects both the symbolism of a centennial milestone and an effort by both countries to reinforce ties rooted in historical familiarity, diplomatic dialogue and longstanding societal connections.

Pokémon card owned by Logan Paul sells for $16.5 million at auction

An extremely rare Pokémon card owned by American YouTuber Logan Paul sold on Monday, February 16, for $16,492,000, smashing the record for the most expensive Pocket Monster trading card sold at an auction. The supposedly unique PSA 10-graded "Pikachu Illustrator" was originally bought by Paul in another record-breaking sale in 2021 – for $5.28 million.
This time it was purchased by AJ Scaramucci, son of former White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci, according to Guinness World Records, who were at the auction held by Goldin. After the successful bid Paul placed the card, which was attached to what Guinness said was a $75,000 diamond necklace, around Scaramucci's neck.
Guinness World Records certified it as the most expensive Pokémon card – as well as the priciest trading card overall – sold at an auction. Ranging from Pikachu the mouse to Jigglypuff the balloon to the jackal-headed Lucario, there are now more than 1,000 different Pokémon characters, with new "generations" released every few years.
While they have always been swapped and collected, the cards' value have exploded in recent years, not just among fans of the game but also among investors with little or no past interest. Factors determining value include the cards' rareness, the character (Mew, Mewtwo, Pikachu and Charizard tend to be more valuable) and the artist, who is indicated on the card.
A card given the designation "PSA 10" is a virtually perfect card, which must have four perfectly sharp corners, sharp focus and full original gloss, according to industry leader PSA (Professional Sports Authenticator).
Pikachu Illustrator is very popular with collectors because it was designed by Atsuko Nishida, the original creator of Pikachu. The card was never originally sold but was released as a prize in a 1998 illustration contest.
The year after Paul paid – in a Dubai hotel room to a "mystery" seller – the multi-million dollar sum for the mint-condition Pikachu Illustrator, he hung it around his neck at a WWE wrestling event in Texas. The card was inside a protective plastic case attached to a gold chain.
The final $16,492,000 paid on Monday for the card includes a buyer's premium.

Russian forces attack five districts of Dnipropetrovsk region
According to Ukrinform, the head of the Dnipropetrovsk Regional Military Administration, Oleksandr Hanzha stated this on Telegram.
"In Dnipro, a private enterprise, administrative buildings, homes, and cars were damaged. In Kryvyi Rih, an enterprise was damaged. In the Krynychky community of the Kamianske district, housing was damaged. In the Pokrovske community of the Synelnykove district, a private house caught fire," Hanzha wrote.
The enemy also attacked Nikopol, the Chervonohryhorivka and Pokrovske communities. Infrastructure, shops, a training center, apartment buildings, and about a dozen cars were damaged. No people were injured.
As reported earlier, the enemy attacked Dnipro overnight. A fire broke out in one of the city's districts. An administrative building and vehicles were damaged.

Cuba: Fuel shortage creates garbage crisis

Cuba: Fuel shortage creates garbage crisis
February 17, 2026Daily life appears to have ground to a halt in Cuba, as the Trump administration exerts pressure on the Caribbean country by accelerating efforts to cut off oil supplies to the island.
In one of the most visible impacts of the looming energy crisis, trash has begun piling up on street corners because rubbish trucks aren't able to operate on the communist-run island.
Trash piles on street corners make visible the hardening situation in the country
Only 44 of Havana's 106 garbage trucks were operational this month, state-run news outlet Cubadebate reported Monday, leading to a slowdown in rubbish collection.
Hordes of flies hovered over rotten food and assorted waste of cardboard boxes, plastic pottles, and rags piled up. Some residents sifted through the rubbish to find reusable items while motorists dodged piles on the streets.
"It's all over the city," said Jose Ramon Cruz, a local resident. "It's been more than 10 days since a garbage truck came."
Cubans in other cities, too, highlighted the issue on social media, pointing out the risks to public health.
Why is Cuba facing a fuel shortage?
Cuba, home to about 11 million people, has been facing an acute shortage of fuel since early January after Venezuela — the island's top fuel supplier until last year — stopped sending shipments.
Mexico, too, said it was halting fuel shipments to Cuba, after Washington threatened suppliers with higher trade tariffs.
The US has had an embargo on Cuba since 1960, which was briefly eased under the Obama administration. Trump restored the ban since taking office.
The Cuban government has also announced new measures to protect essential services.
Trump says Cuba should make a deal with US
"Cuba is right now, a failed nation," Trump told reporters aboard the Air Force One on Monday, calling on Havana to make a deal with the US.
"We're talking to Cuba right now, and Marco Rubio talking to Cuba right now, and they should absolutely make a deal, because it’s really a humanitarian threat," he added.
Trump stopped short of endorsing a takeover similar to the one in Venezuela, but said if considering the measure, "it wouldn’t be a very tough operation, as you could figure. But I don’t think that’ll be necessary."
Cubans impacted amid political tensions
The Cuban government last week made it mandatory for drivers to use an app to book refueling appointments to avoid lines outside gas stations.
Even then, drivers are facing a monthlong wait for fuel.
At the stations, gas prices were averaging about $1.3 per liter. This could go up to $6 per liter on the black market.
To put this in context, government workers in Cuba earn less than $20 a month when their earnings in Cuban pesos are converted to US dollars using market rates.

India sentences three men to death for attack on Israeli tourist and hosts
The men raped an Israeli woman and her Indian homestay host and pushed three male tourists into a canal, one of whom died
- Bookmark

A court in southern India sentenced three men to death after they were found guilty of raping two women, including an Israeli tourist, and killing a man during a violent attack last year in a heritage temple town.
The incident, which drew international condemnation, occurred on 6 March 2025 when a group of five people, including an American male tourist and an Israeli female tourist, were attacked near the Sanapur Lake in Hampi in the southern Indian state of Karnataka.
The men raped the 27-year-old Israeli tourist and her 29-year-old Indian homestay host and pushed three male tourists into a canal. An American tourist, Daniel Pitas, 23, survived the attack, but a male tourist from Odisha was found dead the next day.
The district court in Koppal on Monday classified the case as “rarest of rare” due to the brutality involved.
While delivering the death sentence, the court stressed that crimes of such brutality, committed against both domestic and international tourists, merited the harshest punishment in order to uphold the rule of law and safeguard public safety.
The judge said the victims were targeted while enjoying a peaceful evening in a high-profile tourist zone.
The three men – Mallesh alias Handi Malla, 22; Sai alias Chaitanya Sai, 21; and Sharanappa alias Sharanabasavaraj, 27 – were convicted on 6 February on charges of gang-rape, attempted murder, robbery, and other offences.
After announcing the guilty verdict earlier this month, the court sought reports on the social background, conduct inside jail, and psychological state of the three men, who previously had criminal records.
The group of tourists had been stargazing and camping near the Tungabhadra river at night when three men on a motorbike approached them and demanded money.
When the victims refused, the men turned violent, physically assaulting them, pushing the men into a canal and then sexually assaulting the women.
“Since the homestay operator did not know them, she told them they had no money. When the men repeatedly insisted, one of the male tourists from Odisha gave them 20 rupees (£0.16). After that, the three men allegedly started arguing and threatened to bash their heads with stones,” police said.
The attack renewed longstanding concerns over the safety of women, especially foreign tourists in India. Hampi is a Unesco World Heritage site, known for attracting backpackers with its spectacular remnants of monuments and temple complexes from the 14th-century Vijayanagara empire.
A police officer familiar with the details of the attack said the men behaved in an “inhuman manner” while assaulting the tourists that night.
The attack and the international attention prompted the Karnataka police to form six special teams. They arrested two of the accused within 48 hours, and the third was arrested within a week of the crime.
The attack came after similar incidents last year, including the rape of a tourist from Spain in Jharkhand and the rape and murder of a 28-year-old Irish tourist in Goa.
Reports of sexual assaults are rampant in India as police recorded 31,516 rape cases in 2022, a 20 per cent increase from 2021, according to the National Crime Records Bureau. Yet the actual figure is believed to be much higher due to lack of reporting caused by the stigma surrounding sexual violence in the country.
The death sentence is required to be upheld by the Karnataka High Court and is subject to appeal in Supreme Court.

Incoming Bangladesh PM Tarique Rahman, lawmakers sworn into parliament
Lawmakers pledged allegiance to Bangladesh as hundreds of people gathered outside Dhaka’s parliament grounds.
Newly elected Bangladesh lawmakers have been sworn into parliament, days after the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) swept the first vote since the 2024 student-led uprising that expelled former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.
Tarique Rahman will take the oath as prime minister later on Tuesday, as the BNP is expected to form a new government after securing more than a two-thirds majority in the elections last week.

Inside the parliament’s oath room, lawmakers pledged loyalty to Bangladesh as they were sworn in by the Chief Election Commissioner AMM Nasir Uddin. Foreign dignitaries, including the Pakistani foreign minister and the speaker of India’s parliament, were in attendance.
Cabinet members were slated to follow suit with another ceremony hosted in front of the parliament building at 4pm (10:00 GMT).
Despite tight security, hundreds of people pooled outside the grounds throughout Tuesday to await the proceedings.
“People really want changes. They want to see new faces in parliament: People with good qualifications, even people who are younger,” said Al Jazeera’s Tanvir Chowdhury, reporting from the capital, Dhaka.
“You’ll see a lot of new faces, and that’s what’s expected: They want new dynamics in parliament.”
The BNP won at least 212 seats in the 300-seat parliament, giving it a strong majority, while the Jamaat-e-Islami party won 77 seats. Hasina’s Awami League was banned from participating in the polls.
Rahman will take over from an interim government that led the country for 18 months after Hasina’s ousting.
He will also be tasked with implementing the July National Charter, which contains 80-plus prospective reforms of Bangladesh’s governance system.
More than 60 percent of the electorate voted to pass the charter in a referendum held at the same time as the election.
The sweeping document introduces term limits, a two-chamber parliament and limits the governing party’s ability to make unilateral amendments, among other changes.
“Lots of fundamental and primary change is expected by the population, particularly the younger population who were behind the July uprising,” Al Jazeera’s Chowdhury said. “They want to be represented in this parliament, and their voices must be heard.”

‘Chance to Rot in Ukrainian Soil’: Nigeria Warns of Russian Recruitment Scam

Nigeria has warned its citizens against accepting offers to fight in foreign wars, citing what it called “rising and alarming cases” of illegal recruitment amid reports that its nationals have been killed in Ukraine.
In a statement on Sunday, Nigeria’s foreign ministry said citizens of the African country were being lured abroad and deployed to combat zones.

“Recent media investigations and security reports indicate that Nigerian nationals were allegedly recruited under false pretenses, including promises of lucrative employment, security jobs, educational opportunities, or migration incentives,” the ministry said.
It added that “several Nigerians who have fallen victim to such unfortunate situations were deployed to combat zones after being misled and coerced into signing military service contracts.”
‘Suicide bombers’
Ukrainian officials have said that two Nigerians were killed in combat last year while fighting alongside Russian forces.
Ukraine’s military intelligence agency said the men died during an assault in the eastern Luhansk region, which has seen intense fighting.
“A trip to Russia is a real chance to end up in an assault unit of ‘suicide bombers’ and, ultimately, to rot in Ukrainian soil,” the agency added.
Nigeria said recruitment tactics included promises of high salaries, signing bonuses and fast-tracked Russian citizenship.

It added that victims were reportedly compelled to sign contracts in foreign languages without adequate legal guidance, and had travel documents confiscated on arrival.
The foreign ministry in Abuja said Nigerians who join foreign conflicts outside approved frameworks “do so at their own risk.”
Preying on Africa
Nigeria’s warning comes amid broader concern across Africa over recruitment drives linked to Russia’s war in Ukraine.
Ukrainian officials say more than 1,400 individuals from 36 African countries have been recruited to fight for Russia, some through deception.
Moscow has not publicly detailed the scale of foreign enlistment.
Kenya said last year that more than 200 of its nationals may have joined the Russian military.
Kenya’s foreign minister told the BBC last week that the practice of Russian recruitment of Kenyan nationals was “unacceptable and clandestine”. It said Nairobi had shut down illegal recruiters and would press Moscow to sign an agreement prohibiting the enlistment of Kenyan nationals.
Distress calls
South Africa has said 17 of its citizens traveled to join Russian forces and later sent distress calls seeking help to return home.
A Reuters investigation has detailed an account of a 20-year-old South African citizen who traveled to Russia thinking he had been accepted to an elite bodyguard training course, only to find himself part of a mercenary group fighting against Ukraine.
After a call between President Cyril Ramaphosa and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin last week, South Africa issued a statement saying the two leaders “pledged their support to the process of returning South Africans fighting alongside Russian forces in Ukraine.”
Russia has expanded its political and security footprint in parts of Africa in recent years, deepening military ties and offering training, arms and security assistance to several governments.
Western influence has waned in some African regions while in others, Ukraine has begun expanding its foothold, attempting to counter increasing Russian influence on the continent.

China conducts combat readiness patrols in disputed South China Sea
Military conducted naval and air combat readiness patrols on Sunday and Monday, says Chinese army spokesman
ISTANBUL
The Chinese military conducted naval and air combat readiness patrols in the disputed South China Sea, state-run media reported on Tuesday.
The combat readiness patrols were held on Sunday and Monday in the waters of the South China Sea, according to Xinhua News, citing Zhai Shichen, spokesman for the Chinese People's Liberation Army Southern Theater Command.
"The Philippines co-opted countries outside the region to organize the so-called joint patrols, which had undermined peace and stability in the region," said Zhai.
The Chinese military will resolutely safeguard China's territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests and firmly uphold regional peace and stability, he warned.
Last month, the Chinese military also conducted "combat readiness" drills with warplanes and warships in the disputed South China Sea.
China and the Philippines have faced repeated tensions in recent years over competing territorial claims in the South China Sea.

EU mutual defence clause should be defined for circumstances ‘below Article 5’, says top officer
Unknown

15:30:37 KST

The EU's mutual defence clause is more strongly worded that NATO's Article 5, but is generally seen as weaker as allies in the military alliance have so far counted on the deterrence provided by the US.
Work to operationalise the European Union's mutual defence clause should concentrate on circumstances that fall "below the threshold" of NATO's Article 5, the bloc's top military official has told Euronews.
General Seán Clancy, Chair of the EU's Military Committee, told Euronews over the weekend that his services "stand ready" to help with redefining what European mutual defence means.
On Saturday, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen used her speech at the Munich Security Conference to call for the EU to become independent in its defence, adding that the time had come for the bloc to bring its mutual defence clause "to life" as part of this effort.
She added that the commitment laid out in the clause, known as Article 42.7 of the Treaties, "only carries weight if it is built on trust and capability".
Von der Leyen's comments come with the EU in the midst of a defence overhaul sparked by Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, with warnings that Moscow could attack another European country before the end of the decade.
But there are also concerns, despite European leaders and ministers publicly stating the contrary, about the US's continued commitment to European security, NATO and its Article 5 collective defence clause.
'Below Article 5'
Both NATO's Article 5 and the EU's Article 42.7 have been activated only once: the former by the US following the 9/11 attacks, the latter by France after the November 2015 terrorist attacks in Paris.
The EU's clause states that "if an EU country is the victim of armed aggression on its territory, the other EU countries have an obligation to aid and assist it by all means in their power".
Asked why the EU needs to further operationalise its mutual defence clause if the 23 member states that are also in the military alliance are convinced of Washington's long-term commitment to their security, General Clancy said that the roles of the two organisations are very clearly defined.
"NATO is a military alliance in the first instance, the EU is not. The EU is something different completely. And this, I guess, is how we would operationalise this, if I could put it in simple terms, below Article 5," he told Euronews.
"So in other circumstances, in terms of hybrid war, in terms of the other, I suppose, types of crisis – be they humanitarian, be they a crisis of a more serious nature, be it responsiveness to hybrid threats. What is the EU's response and how do we operationalise this?"
"I think this is the kind of complementarity, and the focus is complementarity, in order for the EU-NATO understanding and relationship to be strengthened," he added.
Will the EU be able to defend itself by 2030?
One of the key planks of the EU's efforts to ramp up its readiness by 2030 is a programme by the EU Commission to incentivise joint defence procurement in order to plug capability gaps in a faster and cheaper manner.
Member states were for instance offered the possibility to tap into a €150 billion Commission-issued loan in order to jointly acquire capabilities among nine identified priority areas, including ammunition, drones, air defence, ground combat and strategic enablers.
General Clancy told Euronews that EU authorities are now "in an implementation phase" and that "all of the nine capability areas are being worked on."
He conceded however that some sectors are progressing faster than others largely because their industrial bases are more mature. or because lessons from the battlefield in Ukraine have accelerated development. This applies in particular to drones as well as space assets.
The next milestone will be a formal readiness report due in the autumn, intended to provide political leaders – including Commission President Ursula von der Leyen – with greater clarity on where gaps persist and how quickly they can be closed.
Asked whether the EU would be ready to defend itself alone by decade's end, as is the aim under the Commission's Defence Readiness 2030 roadmap, General Clancy struck a cautious tone, arguing that the benchmark should be seen as part of a longer-term shift rather than a fixed end state.
“The last four years have taught us that the world is not the same,” he said, pointing to the war in Ukraine as a stark illustration of how conflict is evolving as it combines elements of conventional warfare – such as trenches – alongside disruptive technology-driven equipment.
This makes it impossible, he said, to truly anticipate what a next war in Europe could look like.
What is clear, he argued, is that readiness in Europe must mean preparing for scenarios ranging from “peace, semi-peace, through crisis and into perhaps state conflict".
“2030 is a target, if you like, and we are accelerating to that, but it’s going to be a continuum,” General Clancy said. Europe, he suggested, will not be able to “sit back” and downgrade defence and security after that date, and will have to sustain current efforts.

Overseas owners shut down local production company behind The Slap

Australian production company Matchbox Pictures to be closed by Universal International Studios
The Australian production company behind popular and award-winning TV shows including ABC TV's Dog Park, The Slap and Secret City is set to close.
In a statement, Matchbox Pictures' international parent company, Universal International Studios, said the decision came after "extensive evaluation of the business and the broader production landscape".
"[The company] maintains its commitment to Australia, but as strategic priorities shift the studio is evolving its operating model in the region," it said.
"Moving forward the company will evaluate production opportunities and engage with local producers and talent on a case-by-case basis as new projects emerge."
In a statement, Matchbox managing director Alastair McKinnon said he was "immensely proud" of the company's work over 18 years.
"Matchbox has made an enormous contribution to the Australian film and television landscape with groundbreaking programs that have defined our industry and captivated audiences here and around the world," he said.
Founded by producers Tony Ayres, Penny Chapman, Helen Bowden, Michael McMahon and Helen Panckhurst in 2008, Matchbox Pictures has made more than 55 movies and TV shows for a wide range of Australian TV networks and local and international streaming platforms.
Those shows included The Survivors, which was Netflix's most-watched local series last year; Safe Harbour, which won an international Emmy in 2019; and ABC TV's Glitch, which won an AACTA for best TV drama and a Logie for outstanding drama series.
NBCUniversal acquired a majority stake in Matchbox Pictures in 2011, before taking full ownership in 2014.
Tony Ayres Productions, which Ayres established in partnership with Matchbox and NBCUniversal in 2018, is also set to close.
It is not known what the closure of Matchbox means for a potential season two of Dog Park. ABC TV did not respond to a request for comment before deadline.
Matthew Deaner, CEO of industry body Screen Producers Australia, said the closure of the production company "marks the end of a remarkable chapter in the modern Australian screen industry".
"Over nearly two decades, Matchbox helped redefine what Australian television and film could be — ambitious, internationally confident and unapologetically local in voice," he said.
He also pointed to the writers, producers and crew who established their careers working on Matchbox productions.
"Its legacy will continue through the people and projects it nurtured," Deaner said.
"Matchbox helped demonstrate that Australian stories could resonate far beyond our borders, and that contribution will endure across the industry."
The closure of Matchbox follows the long-awaited establishment of quotas for streaming services in January, which many in the industry hope will lead to an increase in local production of Australian shows.
According to the Screen Australia drama report, the total expenditure on Australian dramas in 2024-5 was $1.1 billion, a 14 per cent increase from the previous year.
That figure accounts for less than half of total spending on film and TV production in Australia, with $2.7 billion spent in 2024-5.
The number of Australian titles going into production last year also fell from 89 to just 71.

Police filmed everyone. Nobody hid. At Alexey Navalny’s grave, on the second anniversary of his death, his mother stood in the freezing cold and listened.
Two days before the second anniversary of Alexey Navalny’s death, five European countries declared that independent forensic analyses show the opposition leader was poisoned in prison. The substance reportedly used to kill Navalny was the neurotoxin epibatidine — an allegation Russian authorities dismissed as “a planted fabrication.” Even with Navalny dead and buried, officials in Moscow continue to monitor his final resting place. On February 16, as Navalny’s supporters gathered at Borisovskoe Cemetery to honor his memory, police waited, filming everyone who arrived. This did not stop people from laying flowers at his grave. The publication Bereg visited the cemetery on Monday to witness the day’s memorial service. Meduza translated that report into English below.
“I mean, how could you not come?” asked an elderly woman, breathing heavily in the cold, as she made her way to Borisovskoe Cemetery. In her hands was a bouquet wrapped tightly in a fresh daily newspaper. “I don’t usually take it, even though it’s free,” she said, referring to the paper. “It’s nothing but propaganda for [moscow mayor sergey] Sobyanin. But it finally turned out to be useful for something.” The woman walked ahead, unfazed by the cameras pointed at her by journalists and police. “There’s nothing left to be afraid of,” she said.

This year, officers from the Interior Ministry’s “anti-extremism unit” watched not only Navalny’s grave but the entire length of Borisovskie Prudy Street leading to the cemetery, recording people who approached carrying flowers. They also photographed the elderly woman holding the bouquet in the newspaper. “If I’d known, I would have unwrapped the flowers ahead of time and made them look nice,” she joked, adding that the moment looked awkward, like she was hiding something. “But I’m not hiding anything!”
By 9 a.m., several dozen people had gathered at Alexey Navalny’s grave. Police officers in black balaclavas recorded continuously, but no one hid from their cameras. “He wasn’t afraid, and we’re not afraid either,” a young woman said quietly as she laid an armful of roses at the grave.
Later, officials from the British, German, and Polish embassies arrived at the cemetery and waited in a short line to lay flowers. They made no remarks.
By 10 a.m., Alla Abrosimova — Yulia Navalnaya’s mother — arrived along with Lyudmila Navalnaya, Alexey’s mother. Lyudmila laid an armful of scarlet roses, still in full bloom, on her son’s grave; they stood out against the other buds, which had closed in the cold. She reached up and touched the tip of the grave’s cross.
Among those who came to lend support were Valery and Tatyana Yashin, the parents of Ilya Yashin — an opposition politician and Navalny ally — who was exchanged for Russian spies in 2023 and now lives in Germany. “Ilyusha [ilya] was a friend of Alexey’s. We knew him for half our lives,” Valery said with a sigh. “The pain of losing him will stay with us forever. It is a deep and lasting pain.”
Soon, people began approaching Lyudmila Navalnaya one by one to express their condolences. They offered her words of gratitude “for such a son, for our Alexey.” Some said they were trying to make sense of “the legacy Navalny left to all of us” — channeling it into paintings and even theatrical works — though they acknowledged that none of it could be shown publicly until the dawn of what Navalny called “a beautiful Russia of the future.”
Lyudmila Navalnaya listened to each person and embraced those who reached out to hold her. One mourner bowed to the ground before her; another dropped to his knees. “Alexey made me who I am today,” another visitor told Navalny’s mother, and for the first time she wept.
For roughly 30 minutes, Lyudmila Navalnaya stood and listened as people approached her, one after another. The temperature in Moscow that morning had fallen to minus 13 degrees Celsius (9 degrees Fahrenheit). When she was offered a chance to walk around to keep warm, Navalnaya declined. A line of mourners stood before her, each person waiting to offer support and sympathy.
“Thank you, thank you. Your words, your prayers are what sustain us,” Lyudmila replied to each person who came forward. She repeated the remarks she had made at the same spot a year ago — that the whole world knows who ordered her son’s murder — and added: “And we want to identify everyone involved.”
A day earlier, Britain, Germany, the Netherlands, France, and Sweden published a joint statement accusing Russia of violating the Chemical Weapons Convention. According to analyses conducted by multiple independent laboratories, Alexey Navalny was poisoned with epibatidine, a potent toxin found in a South American frog species and now synthesized in laboratories. The researchers who carried out that work at Russian laboratories were affiliated with the State Research Institute of Organic Chemistry and Technology — the same institute that produced the Novichok nerve agent used in the 2018 attack on former spy Sergey Skripal and the 2020 attack on Navalny.
As was the case last year, the memorial service was led by Father Dimitry Safronov, a cleric at Moscow’s Church of the Intercession of the Holy Virgin. The same priest had also performed the funeral rites at Alexey’s burial — an act for which church authorities subsequently suspended him from clerical duties.
“Darkness has no agency,” Father Safronov told those gathered. “In the Gospel of John, there are remarkable words: that the light shines in the darkness, and the darkness cannot overcome it. And so it is in our hearts — if there is light within us, darkness cannot swallow it. If that small spark in our hearts burns, then there is nothing to fear. Evil can only prevail if it enters our hearts.”
Someone in the crowd noticed that in the memorial prayer, Father Safronov referred to Navalny not as “the slain” or “the innocently slain,” but as “the one now commemorated.” He explained that this was “an accepted liturgical formula for days of remembrance of the departed.”
Among the crowd, people murmured about the missing monument at Alexey’s grave, even though his associates had raised money for one. They had held a design competition for a memorial, and a winning proposal was selected a year ago: two stone blocks with Navalny’s name spelled out in titanium or steel letters between them. The fundraising page had carried a hopeful note: “Work on realizing the design has already begun.”
The crowd kept coming. People moved through snowdrifts left behind by a blizzard that had swept through that morning. Snow settled on portraits of Alexey Navalny, drawings, flowers, rubber ducks — a nod to the Anti-Corruption Foundation’s investigation targeting then-Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev — as well as candles and vigil lamps. Beneath the snow, hastily written signs remained visible: “Love is stronger than fear,” “Russia will reclaim its former strength,” “Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness,” and “Lyosha [a diminutive of Alexey], we love you.”
On the crossbar of the simple wooden cross on Navalny’s grave, someone had placed a small golden sculpture depicting a heart made from two cupped hands — the gesture Alexey famously made to his wife, Yulia, in court.
Many visitors came to Navalny’s grave to leave flowers and handwritten notes, then remained there for hours. By midday, the grave was no longer visible, obscured by the crowd.
People sang a verse from “Ray of the Golden Sun,” featured in the 1973 animated short On the Trail of the Bremen Town Musicians:
The night will pass, a clear morning will come, / I know that happiness awaits us both, / The night will pass, the stormy time will pass, / The sun will rise.
The “Serenade of the Troubadour” gave way to songs by artists now designated in Russia as “foreign agents.” Several teenagers sang ”Abel Street” by rapper Noize MC, written in memory of Navalny:
Cain will repent — killing Abel was wrong. / The signals will flip, they’ll switch sides. / They’ll name that damn street after Abel.
At the end of the performance, one of the teenagers recited from memory the “foreign agent” disclaimer: “This information was created and distributed by ‘foreign agent’ Noize MC…”
“That’s wrong — it has to be 15 seconds,” his friends pointed out, citing the Justice Ministry’s rules for audiovisual materials. So the teenager began again from the beginning.
The group also wanted to sing Noize MC’s “Bright Stretch,” a song made famous by a viral street performance in St. Petersburg by the singer Naoko (Diana Loginova) and her band Stoptime. After the video spread, the musicians faced repeated short-term arrests, and Loginova and her partner, Alexander Orlov, ultimately fled the country. The teenagers at Borisovskoe Cemetery, though, could not remember the lyrics to “the Naoko song.”
Before the cemetery closed, the crowd chanted: “Alexey, Russia will be free! And Russia will absolutely be happy! Happy, the way you wanted it! It absolutely will!” They applauded and made their way to the exit.
In a nearby snowdrift, someone had planted a sign bearing a line from Leonid Kaganov’s poem written in memory of Alexey Navalny: “We waited for a miracle to come, and this was it.”

Australia will not repatriate citizens held in Syria over Islamic State links, PM says

Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said Tuesday that his government would not assist Australians held in a Syrian camp for families of suspected Islamic State members in returning home, but would pursue prosecutions if they do return.
“We have a very firm view that we won’t be providing assistance or repatriation,” Albanese told ABC News.
Thirty-four Australians released Monday from a camp in northern Syria were later returned to the detention center for “technical reasons,” two sources told Reuters.
Often referred to in local media as “IS brides” — though the group also includes children — they are expected to travel to Damascus before eventually returning to Australia, despite objections from lawmakers in both the ruling party and the opposition.
A spokesperson for Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke said security agencies were monitoring the situation in Syria and that anyone who had broken the law would be prosecuted.
“People in this cohort need to know that if they have committed a crime and if they return to Australia they will be met with the full force of the law,” he said.
Islamic State is designated a terrorist organization in Australia. Membership is punishable by up to 25 years in prison. Authorities also have the power to strip dual nationals of citizenship if they are members of the group.
Surge in right-wing populism
The potential return of relatives of suspected Islamic State members has become a political flashpoint, amid rising support for the right-wing, anti-immigration One Nation party led by Pauline Hanson.
“They hate Westerners, and that’s what it’s all about. You say there’s great Muslims out there, well I’m sorry, how can you tell me there are good Muslims?” Hanson said in an interview with Sky News on Monday following reports of the families’ possible return.
Her remarks were criticized by members of her own party.
A poll this week showed One Nation’s share of the vote at a record 26%, higher than the combined support for the traditional center-right coalition currently in opposition.
Sarah Henderson, a senator from the Liberal Party, which has seen support eroded by One Nation, said Tuesday that Australians with sympathies toward Islamic State should be barred from reentering the country.
“If these are people who subscribed to ISIS ideology, who subscribe to this extremist ideology, then they should not be returning to Australia,” she told ABC.
Under Australian and international law, citizens have a legal right to enter the country.

Trump says he could 'easily' bridge Saudi-UAE rift
US president plays down Yemen-linked tensions between Gulf allies, says he has no plans to intervene
WASHINGTON
US President Donald Trump suggested that he could “easily” bridge tensions between Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.
“They do indeed have a rift, and we can get it settled very easily,” Trump told reporters on Air Force One as he returned to Washington, DC, from his South Florida estate of Mar-a-Lago.
However, when asked if he had plans to get involved in the dispute between the two Gulf nations, he said he had none.
The comments come amid tensions between Saudi Arabia and the UAE over the conflict in Yemen, after Abu Dhabi withdrew its forces following clashes involving the Southern Transitional Council, the main separatist group in the war-torn country.
Riyadh accused the UAE of backing separatist advances near the Saudi border, a claim Abu Dhabi denied.
Following the rift, the UAE withdrew all forces from Yemen, ending its mission in the country. The confrontation marked one of the most serious rifts within Yemen’s anti-Houthi camp in years.

Türkiye cocoa exports hit all-time high of $1.7 billion in 2025

Türkiye has set a new record in cocoa exports, despite the crop not being cultivated domestically due to climate conditions.
According to the Turkish Statistical Institute (TÜİK), exports doubled between 2021 and 2025, reaching $1.66 billion last year, the highest figure ever recorded. Over the five-year period, cocoa exports rose by 114.7 percent, surpassing $5.5 billion in total.
Globally, cocoa is grown primarily in South America and Africa. In Türkiye, small-scale experimental cultivation has recently begun in the Mediterranean region, though the country’s role in the sector is largely through processing. Cocoa, indispensable to the food industry—especially chocolate—is traded both in raw form and as processed products. The transformation of cocoa into finished goods for international markets has significantly boosted export revenues.
Annual figures show steady growth: $775 million in 2021, $942 million in 2022, $1.02 billion in 2023, and $1.12 billion in 2024, culminating in last year’s record-breaking $1.66 billion.
The United States was the largest buyer in 2025, importing $244 million worth of cocoa products from Turkey. Other major destinations included Iraq ($175 million), Iran ($102.8 million), Saudi Arabia ($74.2 million), and Russia ($69.5 million).
On the import side, Türkiye brought in $2.2 billion worth of cocoa last year. Côte d’Ivoire was the leading supplier with $567 million, followed by Ghana ($331.1 million), the Netherlands ($297.8 million), Germany ($143.6 million), and Belgium ($122.6 million).
The figures highlight Turkey’s growing role in the global cocoa trade, not as a producer but as a processor and exporter of value-added products.

Turkish cosmetics sector rides ‘Turkish Beauty’ wave to global growth

Türkiye’s cosmetics industry is reaping the rewards of its “Turkish Beauty” strategy, launched in 2006, with exports reaching $2.33 billion in 2025 — a year-on-year increase of 11.8 percent.
The sector now exports to 190 countries, driven by rising brand numbers, female entrepreneurship and the global popularity of Turkish television dramas.
According to Adil Pelister, chairman of the Istanbul Chemicals and Chemical Products Exporters’ Association, the industry’s export target for 2026 is $2.5 billion. Experts note that the number of registered brands has quadrupled in the past five years, climbing to 12,000.
Two factors have been particularly influential in shaping the industry’s branding success. Women entrepreneurs have emerged as powerful players, establishing their own companies and reshaping the sector. Meanwhile, Turkish dramas — widely watched from the Middle East to Latin America, the Balkans and Africa — have become an invisible yet effective marketing channel. Viewers often emulate the makeup styles, hairstyles and products used by actors, creating organic demand for Turkish cosmetics abroad.
Fuat Arslan, president of the Cosmetics Manufacturers and Researchers Association (KÜAD), emphasized that cultural exports such as television series can serve as a strong lever for cosmetics growth. He noted that Türkiye is consolidating its position as a regional production and supply hub in the Middle East, Balkans and North Africa. The leading export destinations include Iraq, Iran, Gulf countries, Russia and Saudi Arabia.

Shooting at Rhode Island youth hockey game leaves three people dead, three hospitalized

A shooting during a Rhode Island hockey game between the Coventry and Blackstone Valley high schools left three people dead, including the shooter, and three hospitalized in critical condition on Monday.
According to the local news outlet WPRI, among the victims was the mother of a hockey player, who died in Pawtucket's Dennis M Lynch Arena ice rink. A sibling of a player also reportedly succumbed to his wounds at the hospital. The injured victims include two other family members and a family friend, authorities said.
According to Fox News, a source with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) said that the shooting was motivated by a domestic violence incident, which evolved into a murder-suicide.
The same source said the gunman killed their wife and shot two of their children before turning the gun on themself. The shooter has also shot their third child, who is currently hospitalized.
The shooter, identified by Pawtucket Police Chief Tina Goncalves, was Robert Dorgan, who previously used the name Roberta Esposito. Esposito was a 56-year-old parent of a North Providence High School senior, Target 12 has confirmed.
At Pawtucket Police Department headquarters, a woman identifying herself as the shooter’s daughter told reporters, “He shot my family, and he’s dead now.” She also said the shooter had “mental health issues,” adding that they were “very sick,” WPRI reported.
Police have not publicly identified the victims, saying that information will come out after they notify family members.
Civilian helps to contain the threat
Goncalves told reporters that a civilian, who was in the arena to watch a family member's game, helped to contain the threat by intervening and trying to subdue the shooter at the scene.
"We can also tell you that a good Samaritan stepped in and interjected in the scene, and that's probably what led to a swift end of this tragic event earlier today," she said.
In a video from the time of the shooting, at least 14 gunshots can be heard being fired off consecutively, followed by one or two more gunshots roughly 10 seconds later.
FBI Director Kash Patel shared on X/Twitter that "@FBIBoston is responding to the shooting this afternoon at Dennis M. Lynch Arena in Pawtucket, RI - we will provide state and local law enforcement any and all resources necessary and keep the public updated as we are able. In the meantime, please pray for the victims and their families."
All students from the Coventry Boys Hockey team who were at Lynch Arena have been accounted for and are safe, Coventry Public Schools Superintendent Don Cowart said in a statement provided to Fox News Digital.
Police is still investigating
The police chief said that Pawtucket police are still conducting the investigation and, as of Monday evening, more than 100 witnesses had been interviewed.
“It appears that this was a targeted event, that it may be a family dispute,” said Goncalves.
Pawtucket Mayor Don Grebien has shared an official statement, saying, “What should have been a joyful occasion, with dozens of families, students, and supporters gathered to celebrate Senior Night … was instead marked by violence and fear. Our prayers go out to the victims, their families, and everyone impacted by this devastating incident.”
The authorities of the schools involved in the incident have sent official letters confirming that, in addition to the victims, all the students and families present at the game are safe.
The Rhode Island Interscholastic League announced Monday night that it would temporarily suspend all games “out of respect for the victims and to reflect upon this senseless act of violence.”

Second Temple workshop found on Israel's Mount Scopus during investigation into antiquities thieves

A stone tool workshop from the Second Temple period was discovered on Mount Scopus in Jerusalem during an investigation by the Israel Antiquities Authority into a gang of antiquities thieves, the IAA announced on Monday.
The workshop was discovered at the Ras Tamim archaeological site on the eastern slope of Mount Scopus.
After noting suspicious activity at the site, including unauthorized attempts at excavation, the IAA’s Theft Prevention Unit began a series of ambush and surveillance operations to identify and arrest the suspects.
Five alleged suspects were arrested by the unit late at night at the site while in possession of extensive excavation equipment, including a generator, quarrying tools, and a metal detector.
Some were caught in an underground cave, with others acting as lookouts, according to the IAA's statement.
All five were transferred to the authorities and questioned before eventually confessing. They are expected to be charged with damaging and illegally excavating an antiquities site, punishable by up to five years in prison.
Following the arrest, IAA inspectors investigated the cave in which the thieves were found.
Inside the cave, the IAA discovered a two-thousand-year-old workshop containing hundreds of stone vessel fragments, production waste, and unfinished items, reinforcing researchers' belief in the site's importance to Jewish pilgrims who would have been making their way to Jerusalem from this direction at the time.
The finds are currently on display at the Jay and Jeanie Schottenstein National Campus for the Archaeology of Israel in Jerusalem as part of the “Criminal Past” exhibit, revealing for the first time the complexities of antiquities looting in Israel and the fight against it.
Importance of the site
“Workshops for producing chalk limestone vessels from the Second Temple period are already known in the Judean hills,” Deputy Director of the IAA’s Theft Prevention Unit Dr. Eitan Klein said. “The discovery of this workshop is particularly important, because now a broad picture of the region is emerging.”
He added that tombs, a limestone quarry, and large water reservoirs, including a mivkah, dated to the same era had also been found.
Heritage Minister Amichai Eliyahu emphasized the site's importance, noting that the workshop’s discovery reinforced the idea that Jerusalem is more than a vast archaeological site. It is also “a window into a world preserved deep within the ground, waiting for us,” he said.
“Now, as the earth returns what it safeguarded for us, we are obliged to give back – to protect every root, every vessel, every layer,” he said. “Attempts by our enemies to loot antiquities are not crimes of financial theft, but efforts to steal our identity.”
“We will not allow this, and will continue to act decisively to preserve and safeguard what has always been ours, and always will be.”

Bangladesh’s incoming PM Tarique Rahman sworn into parliament

Bangladesh’s incoming prime minister Tarique Rahman and other politicians were sworn into parliament on Tuesday, becoming the first elected representatives since a deadly 2024 uprising.
Rahman is set to take over from an interim government that has led the country of 170 million people for 18 months since the autocratic government of Sheikh Hasina was overthrown.
The lawmakers, who promised loyalty to Bangladesh, were sworn in by the chief election commissioner, A M M Nasir Uddin.
Bangladesh Nationalist party (BNP) politicians were expected to formally elect Rahman as their leader, and the president, Mohammed Shahabuddin, was set to administer the oath of office to the prime minister and his ministers later on Tuesday afternoon.
Rahman, 60, who is the chief of the BNP and scion of one of the country’s most powerful political dynasties, won a landslide victory in the 12 February elections.
“This victory belongs to Bangladesh, belongs to democracy,” he said in his victory speech on Saturday. “This victory belongs to people who aspire to and have sacrificed for democracy.”
But he has also spoke of the challenges ahead, including tackling the economic woes of the country.
“We are about to begin our journey in a situation marked by a fragile economy left behind by the authoritarian regime, weakened constitutional and statutory institutions, and a deteriorating law and order situation”, he added.
The new leader has pledged to restore stability and revive growth after months of turmoil that rattled investor confidence in Bangladesh, the world’s second-largest garment exporter.
He has also called for all parties to “remain united” in a country polarised by years of bitter rivalry.
Rahman only returned to Bangladesh in December after 17 years in exile in Britain.
The BNP coalition won 212 seats, compared with 77 for the Jamaat-e-Islami-led alliance.
Jamaat, which secured more than a quarter of seats in parliament – a four-fold increase on its previous best – have challenged results in 32 constituencies. But its leader, Shafiqur Rahman, 67, has also said the Islamist party would “serve as a vigilant, principled, and peaceful opposition”.
Hasina’s Awami League party was barred from taking part in the elections.
Hasina, 78, who was sentenced to death in absentia for crimes against humanity, issued a statement from hiding in India decrying an “illegal” election.
But India praised the BNP’s “decisive win” – a notable shift after deeply strained ties.
Only seven women were directly elected, although a further 50 seats reserved for women will be allocated to parties according to their share of the vote.
Four members of minority communities won seats, including two Hindus – a population that makes up roughly 7% of the population in Muslim-majority Bangladesh.

Türkiye seeks to expand sports tourism beyond football

Türkiye is taking significant steps to diversify its sports tourism sector, moving beyond football to embrace cycling, winter sports and other disciplines.
By leveraging its world-class facilities and expanding into multiple sports, the country aims to position itself as a year-round hub for international sports tourism.
Nida Kiraz, President of the Turkish Sports Tourism Association, emphasized that the initiative will cover 12 different sports, aiming to showcase Türkiye’s full potential to the global market.
Kiraz announced that Antalya will host Europe’s largest sports tourism fair from May 31 to June 3, bringing together some of the world’s leading sports companies. He highlighted that sports tourism plays a crucial role in sustaining employment during the winter months, ensuring hotels remain open year-round and providing staff with continuous work opportunities.
Traditionally considered the “dead season,” December through February now sees a surge in athlete arrivals, contributing positively to the economy, he said.
Globally, sports tourism accounts for 10 percent of total tourism activities, while its share in Türkiye stands at just 1.5 percent, according to Kiraz.
Kiraz stressed Türkiye must claim a larger portion of this market, with both the government and private sector working in collaboration to achieve this goal.
He pointed to Türkiye’s diverse facilities, from Erzurum’s winter sports centers and Konya’s velodrome to Samsun’s Olympic complexes and ski resorts in Erciyes and Uludağ, all of which are being promoted to attract international athletes.
Cycling, in particular, is experiencing rapid global growth, and Antalya is emerging as a key destination, he said.
Kiraz revealed that in 2026, the city will host three major events: Tour of Antalya, Gran Fondo and Padelia. He noted that cycling will make a substantial contribution to sports tourism in the region. Golf is also thriving, with courses fully booked and playing an important role in boosting winter tourism.

It’s time to light the lights: World-first Muppets exhibition coming to Brisbane
Kermit, Miss Piggy, Cookie Monster and a host of goblins and gelflings will come to Brisbane when a world-first exhibition opens exclusively at the Gallery of Modern Art from September.
Make, Believe, Magic: The Worlds of The Jim Henson Company has been curated by the gallery and offers a unique journey behind the scenes of The Muppet Show, Fraggle Rock and Sesame Street as well as films Labyrinth, The Dark Crystal and many more.
Puppets, animatronic creatures, sets, props, costumes, original drawings and moving image clips will be on display.
The exhibition will include the Great Hall set from the television series Fraggle Rock: Back to the Rock, taking audiences behind the scenes of a working puppeteer’s film set.
Arts Minister Jean-Paul Langbroek said the exhibition would boost Queensland’s reputation as a key cultural destination.
“We’re a tourism and events state, as we saw just over the weekend with the Royal Edinburgh Military Tattoo,” he said.
“The arrival of the wild and wonderful creatures of The Jim Henson Company at GOMA will add even more kaleidoscopic colour to our state capital, delighting locals and visitors.”
Minister for Tourism Andrew Powell said the exhibition would deliver up to 110,000 visitor nights to Queensland and an anticipated $22 million boost for the state’s economy.
QAGOMA director Chris Saines said the exhibition would be unparalleled in scope.
“The exhibition will celebrate the Henson Company’s extraordinary legacy, highlighting the specialist work of Jim Henson’s Creature Shop, where artists and makers have truly revolutionised the art of puppetry.”
Saines said the show would also highlight productions with an Australian connection, such as the 2023 feature The Portable Door, filmed in Brisbane, and science-fiction series Farscape, filmed in Sydney.
Exhibition curator Amanda Slack-Smith said the idea for the show germinated two years ago when she visited The Jim Henson Company in Los Angeles while compiling GOMA’s Fairy Tales show.
“They were just so generous when I was talking to them about that show, and I’m like, ‘there’s something here’.
“I got to visit the studio where they were making puppets and I got to meet Oscar the Grouch. And I’m like, ‘I’m in love.’”
The Muppets have been a cultural institution since the 1970s, and The Muppet Show has recently been rebooted on Disney+.
Make, Believe, Magic: The Worlds of The Jim Henson Company will open on September 12 during Brisbane Festival.

Bangladesh’s new prime minister to be sworn in after historic election win
Muhammad Yunus led South Asian country for 18 months after a bloody street agitation ousted Sheikh Hasina

- CommentsGo to comments
Muhammad Yunus has stepped down as Bangladesh’s interim leader, paving the way for Tarique Rahman to take over as the new prime minister.
Mr Yunus, a Nobel laureate, returned from self-exile in August 2024 to lead the country after a bloody mass agitation felled Sheikh Hasina’s Awami League government and sent her fleeing to India.
The former banker announced his resignation after Mr Rahman’s Bangladeshi Nationalist Party won a landslide mandate in the first parliamentary election since Ms Hasina’s ouster.
Mr Rahman, 60, the son of late prime minister Khaleda Zia, led his party to victory less than two months after returning from a 17-year self-exile in December. He will take his oath on Tuesday.
Breaking with a long-standing tradition, the swearing-in ceremony will be held at the Parliament Complex instead of Bangabhaban, the presidential palace, and in the presence of foreign leaders. President Mohammed Shahabuddin will administer the oath to the new cabinet at 4pm local time.
Indian parliament speaker Om Birla, Pakistani planning minister Ahsan Iqbal, Sri Lankan health minister Nalinda Jayatiss, Bhutanese prime minister Tshering Topgay, and Maldivian president Mohamed Muizzu will be in attendance. British undersecretary of state Seema Malhotra is also expected.
Mr Rahman’s party bagged 209 of the 300 parliamentary seats while Jamaat-e-Islami, an Islamist party, won 68 seats. Ms Hasina’s Awami League, winner of the previous four elections, was barred from contesting.
On election day on 12 February, Mr Yunus had declared the occasion a celebration akin to “a mega Eid”.
“Today, the interim government is stepping down,” Mr Yunus, 85, said in his farewell speech. “But let the practice of democracy, freedom of speech, and fundamental rights that has begun not be halted.”
He described Ms Hasina’s ouster as a "day of great liberation".
"What a day of joy it was!” he added. “Bangladeshis across the world shed tears of happiness.”
In addition to electing a new government, Bangladeshi voters endorsed sweeping democratic reforms in a national referendum held the same day.
The referendum, which proposed major changes to the country’s constitution, was seen as a major pillar of Dr Yunus’s transition agenda.
It proposed term limits for prime ministers, the creation of an upper house of parliament, stronger presidential powers, and greater judicial independence.
“We didn’t start from zero, we started from a deficit,” Mr Yunus said. “Sweeping away the ruins, we rebuilt institutions and set the course for reforms.”
After his victory, Mr Rahman visited the homes of his political rivals, including Jamaat-e-Islami chief Shafiqur Rahman and National Citizen Party convener Nahid Islam, and held what were described as cordial discussions.
In a press briefing in Dhaka, Mr Rahman said his priorities would be to improve law and order and handle a fragile economy.
“We are about to begin our journey in a situation marked by a fragile economy left behind by the authoritarian regime, weakened constitutional and statutory institutions and a deteriorating law and order situation,” he told reporters.

Ukraine: In Kyiv, exhausted repair crews work non-stop
February 17, 2026This winter, hundreds of apartment blocks in Kyiv have been transformed into towers of freezing concrete. Following massive Russian missile attacks on energy facilities in Ukraine, they are left without heat and electricity.
Not only energy company employees but also private contractors, electricians and plumbers do their best to bring the frozen buildings back to life. Their work in these icy basements often goes unnoticed, but they are very much in demand.
It is extremely difficult to find private contractors in the Ukrainian capital who can replace a power cable that has been burnt through after a network overload, or who can drain cold water from heating pipes. Entire neighborhoods can no longer be supplied with district heating because power plants have been destroyed. Wherever possible, plumbers, electricians and sanitation and heating engineers work tirelessly to reconnect households to water, heating and electricity.
Long hours and little sleep
Oleh Karpov runs a company for sanitation technology and heating engineering. He and his team are hired by homeowners' associations to maintain the plumbing and electrical systems in Kyiv apartment blocks.
Karpov said this year is seriously testing his endurance. His workday begins at 4:00 or 5:00 in the morning, when most of the city is asleep, and finishes well after midnight.
His team has been on duty more or less around the clock since the beginning of January. His employees are physically and emotionally exhausted, he explains, but even with a 39-degree Celsius fever, they still show up for work.
"Sometimes we manage to get two or three hours of sleep. Yesterday, I came home, didn't even wash, went to bed at 2:00 a.m. and was woken again at 5.30 a.m. We're tired, and we're sick, but we go where we're needed," Karpov said. "We know that otherwise it'll just get even worse for the building and for the people living there."
Struggling for workers
Karpov is a war veteran who was discharged from the army for health reasons. Most of the people on his team are older men. Some have serious injuries they sustained on the front lines and struggle with physical limitations.
"Out of 25 workers, I have eight left. Some are at the front. Others have gone abroad. People who work for private companies can't get an exemption from military service like employees of state or municipal companies. There's a huge lack of qualified personnel, Kaprov said.
"I have a welder who's 62 years old and an electrician who's over 60. Then there's one guy who's seriously disabled, and an installer who's an internally displaced person from the Russian-occupied territories and who also has health problems. Young people don't want to do this work, so we do it."
Life-threatening situations
Emergency teams of engineers and electricians typically work quickly to help as many people as possible.
"There aren't enough emergency personnel, so people are working for two or three days without a break. They're on the verge of collapse. Two emergency repair workers recently died from excessive overwork. Many are suffering from physical and psychological exhaustion or frostbite," Oleksiy Kucherenko, a member of parliament and a former minister of housing and communal services, wrote on Facebook.
The mayor of Kyiv, Vitali Klitschko, has confirmed that a 60-year-old fitter died in January while on call at an apartment. The city council is planning to provide the families of workers who died working at apartment blocks and communal facilities with a one-off financial assistance payment of 50,000 hryvnia (around 1,000 euros).
Hardest part of the job
In general, private contractors like Karpov are hired to manage buildings run by homeowners' associations. This doesn't mean they get to charge higher rates, since they're locked into long-term business plans. These contracts are based on a set number of callouts and do not account for the extreme situations caused by Russian air strikes.
"So I take on work for electricians or installers myself, to spare them and give them a break," he says.
According to Karpov, the hardest part of the work is not the utter exhaustion, the ancient pipework or the burnt-out cables. For him, it's the basic lack of recognition.
"They accuse us of being lazy, curse us, are aggressive and expect us to defy the laws of physics. In a building of 300 apartments, there might be one person who thanks us, while the rest say we're doing a poor job. You just get really discouraged in situations like that, and feel like giving up," he admits.
'We have to do something'
Leonid Kulytskyi, 59, has been working as an electrician for almost 30 years. This winter has been the hardest of his entire career, he says. He can only get home to rest for a few hours at a time.
Many Kyiv residents have no heating in their apartments because the power plants have been hit, so they make use of the few hours when there's electricity. But the power grids aren't designed to support so many energy-intensive appliances operating simultaneously.
"As soon as there's electricity, people switch everything on at once: boilers, heaters, kettles. Cables, wiring, and switch boxes burn out as a result. But we have to go out and help people because they're freezing and they'll have no electricity at all otherwise. We have to do something, so they can get themselves warm again," Kulytskyi says.
Despite the crushing workload, he doesn't see himself as a hero. It's simply his duty toward his fellow citizens, says Kulytskyi, whose son is fighting on the front line. The Ukrainian soldiers in the trenches have it far worse, he remarks.
"Russia is driving us to exhaustion. But we're hanging in there. I do my work as best I can. The main thing is for our children to come out of this war alive and healthy."

Israeli approval of West Bank land registration draws outrage

Israel's government has approved a process to register land in the West Bank as "state property", drawing condemnation from Arab nations and critics who said it would accelerate annexation of the Palestinian territory.
Israel's foreign ministry said the measure, approved late Sunday, would enable "transparent and thorough clarification of rights to resolve legal disputes", and was needed after unlawful land registration in areas controlled by the Palestinian Authority.
Türkiye has condemned Israel’s latest decision.
“We strongly condemn the latest decision of the Israeli government, which aims to impose its authority over the occupied West Bank and expand settlement activities,” read a statement issued by the Foreign Ministry on Feb. 15.
“This step, which seeks to forcibly displace the Palestinian people from their land and accelerate Israel’s unlawful annexation efforts, constitutes a clear violation of international law and is null and void,” the ministry said.
Arab nations Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Qatar and Jordan criticised the move as illegal under international law.
The measure is "aimed at imposing a new legal and administrative reality in the occupied West Bank" that would undermine peace efforts in the region, Saudi Arabia's foreign affairs ministry said in a statement.
Jordan's King Abdullah II said the actions "undermine efforts to restore calm and threaten to exacerbate the conflict", according to a statement released by the royal court.
The European Union called on Israel to reverse the move.
"This constitutes a new escalation after recent measures already aimed at extending Israeli control," EU foreign affairs spokesman Anouar El Anouni said.
"We reiterate that annexation is illegal under international law."
U.N Secretary-General Antonio Guterres echoed that point and called the move "destabilising", warning the "decision could lead to the dispossession of Palestinians of their property".
He also called for the decision's immediate reversal, adding in a statement from his spokesman that "the current trajectory on the ground is eroding the prospect for the two-State solution".
The Ramallah-based Palestinian Authority called for international intervention to prevent the "de facto beginning of the annexation process and the undermining of the foundations of the Palestinian state".
Israeli anti-settlement watchdog Peace Now called the measure a "mega land grab".
Jonathan Mizrachi, the NGO's co-director, told AFP that the move would attribute new resources for land registration.
The process will take place only in Area C, which constitutes some 60 percent of the West Bank's territory and is under Israeli security and administrative control.
"There was a lot of ambiguity regarding the land, and Israel decided now to deal with it," Mizrachi said, adding that the grey area over Area C land ownership is likely to be used against Palestinians.
"A lot of land that Palestinians consider theirs, they will find out it's not theirs under this new registration process," he said, believing the move would further the Israeli right's annexation agenda.
Changing demography
Palestinians see the West Bank as foundational to any future Palestinian state, but many on Israel's religious right want to take over the land.
Last week, Israel's security cabinet approved a series of measures backed by far-right ministers to tighten control over areas of the West Bank administered by the Palestinian Authority under the Oslo accords, in place since the 1990s.
Those measures, which also sparked international backlash, include allowing Jewish Israelis to buy West Bank land directly and allowing Israeli authorities to administer certain religious sites in areas under the Palestinian Authority's control.
The latest Israeli initiatives come in the wider context of increasing attacks by Israeli settlers against Palestinians in the West Bank, according to rights groups.
"We are witnessing rapid steps to change permanently the demography of the occupied Palestinian territory, stripping its people of their lands and forcing them to leave," U.N. rights chief Volker Turk said in a recent statement.
U.S. President Donald Trump has opposed Israel's annexation of the West Bank, saying stability in the territory helps keep Israel secure.
However, Trump has held off from directly criticising the new Israeli measures, despite the international outrage.
Excluding Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem, more than 500,000 Israelis live in West Bank settlements and outposts, which are illegal under international law.
Around three million Palestinians live in the territory, which Israel has occupied since 1967.

Russia expects no substantial dialogue with West anytime soon — envoy to OPCW

THE HAGUE, February 17. /TASS/. Russia does not expect any constructive dialogue with the West in the near future, including regarding the case of blogger Alexey Navalny, who is on Russia’s list of terrorists and extremists, and anticipates continued pressure from unfriendly countries, Russia’s permanent representative to the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, Vladimir Tarabrin, told TASS.
"It is clear that there can be no meaningful dialogue with the West in the foreseeable future. They have already made up their minds and convinced themselves that our country is poisoning everyone left and right with polonium, Novichok, and frog poison, violating every possible norm and its obligations under international treaties," the diplomat said, commenting on recent accusations by European countries. According to Tarabrin, a "collective delusion" and psychosis in Western countries, including insinuations about Navalny’s "poisoning," indicate that pressure on Moscow will continue.
On February 14, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Sweden, and France issued a joint statement claiming that Navalny had been poisoned with epibatidine, a toxin extracted from the skin of an Ecuadorian tree frog. The statement said the conclusion was based on an analysis of samples of the blogger’s biological material. In this regard, representatives of those countries accused Russia of violating the Chemical Weapons Convention.

Key Takeaways from the ISW:
- Russian officials are unlikely to deviate from their original war demands during the upcoming February 17 to 18 trilateral US-Ukrainian-Russian talks in Geneva, Switzerland.
- Russia may try to exploit another temporary moratorium on strikes against energy infrastructure to falsely claim that Russia is making a concession.
- Russia appears to be investing in centralized incubators for drone technology and is setting up bespoke roles and units to support specific drone capability development efforts. These drone capability development efforts include supporting drone units’ ability to conduct tactical tasks that support Russia’s battlefield air interdiction (BAI) campaign, as well as drone-based air defense.
- The Kremlin appears to be adapting its tactics to conduct sabotage attacks in Europe.
- At least one Ukrainian FP-5 Flamingo cruise missile did not cause damage to Russia’s Kapustin Yar launch site in Astrakhan Oblast in January 2025.
- Ukrainian forces recently advanced in the Kostyantynivka-Druzhkivka tactical area. Russian forces recently advanced in the Kostyantynivka-Druzhkivka tactical area and near Pokrovsk.

Lebanon says army to take at least 4 months for next stage of Hezbollah disarmament plan

Lebanon's government said Monday that the army would need at least four months to implement the second phase of the military's plan to disarm militant group Hezbollah in the country's south.
Lebanon's government last year committed to disarming Hezbollah, which was badly weakened in a recent war with Israel, and tasked the army with drawing up a plan to do so.
The military said last month said it had completed the first phase of the plan, covering the area between the Litani River and the Israeli border about 30 kilometres (20 miles) farther south.
The second phase concerns the area between the Litani and the Awali rivers, around 40 kilometres south of Beirut.
Information Minister Paul Morcos told a news conference after a cabinet session that the government "took note of the army leadership's presentation" on the second stage of the plan.
"There is a timeframe of four months, extendable depending on available capabilities, Israeli attacks and hindrances on the ground," he said.
Israel, which accuses Hezbollah of rearming, has criticised the army's progress as insufficient, and has kept up regular strikes on Lebanon despite a November 2024 ceasefire that sought to end more than a year of hostilities with the Iran-backed group.
Israel has also kept troops in five south Lebanon areas it deems strategic, while Hezbollah has rejected calls to surrender its weapons north of the Litani.
Lebanon's health ministry said Israeli strikes on Monday on the country's south killed two people, while the Israeli army said it struck Hezbollah operatives.
Also Monday, before the cabinet session, Hezbollah chief Naim Qassem said that "what the Lebanese government is doing in focusing on disarmament is a grave sin, because this issue serves the goals of the Israeli aggression".
"Stop all action to restrict weapons," he added in a televised address, saying the government's "successive concessions" were partly to blame for Israel's persistent attacks.

‘He was fulfilling his dream’: Chadwick Boseman’s brothers on bringing his play to the UK
Unbeknownst to many, the actor so beloved as Black Panther was also a playwright. Six years after his death, his 2005 play about the killing of his friend at the hands of a policeman is making its UK debut. His brothers, Kevin and Derrick, speak with Annabel Nugent about what this moment would mean to him

- CommentsGo to comments
When Chadwick Boseman died in 2020 at the age of 43, four years into a cancer diagnosis that he kept private, he was mourned by many as Black Panther, the noble king of Wakanda: the first Black superhero in a major movie and an icon to millions the world over.
That role cast a long shadow over Boseman’s career, which also spanned directing and playwriting. His CV was full of heroes of the real kind too: he memorably played James Brown in Get On Up, Jackie Robinson in 42, and Thurgood Marshall, the first African-American Supreme Court justice, in Marshall. He bore the weight of those characters, and their responsibilities, with the utmost grace. “I think he was built for it,” says his brother Derrick, who, along with their brother Kevin, has been entrusted with managing Boseman’s estate. “In a way Chad trained and prepared his entire life to step into being ‘Chadwick Boseman’ in the way the world knew him. Those characters he played, he’d read about them and wrote book reports about them at school. He was fulfilling his dream – Blackness was really close to his heart.”
The bright lights of his screen career have meant Boseman’s work as a playwright lives more in the shadows. He had, in fact, enrolled at Howard University with the dream of being a director. After graduating from college, he moved to New York to work in theatre, where he wrote and directed several plays. Now, nearly six years after Boseman’s passing, one of them is being revived for a nine-week run at Shakespeare’s Globe in London.
Written in 2005, Deep Azure follows a community in shock after the murder of an unarmed Black man, Deep, by an undercover police officer. The play, a hip-hop drama that infuses rapping with Shakespearean lyricism, was inspired by Boseman’s friend and fellow Howard University student, Prince Jones, who was killed in 2000 in similar circumstances. It premiered in Chicago in 2005, and was presented last year as a one-night-only reading at Howard Theatre in Washington.
Boseman penned the play when he was living at his brother’s apartment in Prospect Heights in Brooklyn. “It took him a while to write it,” says Kevin, “he was in this process of wrestling with the grief of Prince Jones and also wrestling with the general grief around police brutality and Black bodies, trying to make sense of it. The characters… the romantic partner… there’s a lot of truth in it.”
Boseman would have been honoured to have his work staged at the Globe, his brothers say. “He would have wanted to be engaged in the creative process”. Writing was simply another string in his bow. “He was such a consummate artist,” Kevin says, citing Boseman’s skills as a singer, trumpeter and painter. “He loved language – he was on the high school speech and debate team. He understood the power of words.”
Writing eventually had to take a backseat to his film career, but Deep Azure was critical in his ascent. The play, which Boseman adapted into a screenplay, was picked up by Michael Greene, later his agent.
The play’s themes of police brutality remained depressingly relevant throughout his life – and beyond. “The year Chad died [2020], the killing of Black men by police had almost become theatre and a distraction from what was going on,” recalls Derrick. “In his last couple of weeks, there was a killing and he just looked at me and he said, ‘We have to do something.’” Boseman had been a vocal and passionate supporter of the Black Lives Matter movement, using his celebrity at every turn to further a greater cause – joining hundreds of other Black actors in signing a public letter calling on Hollywood to divest from policing and invest in Black communities.
As for the play’s language, a mix of hip-hop and spoken word that has been called a precursor to Lin-Manuel Miranda’s Broadway hit Hamilton, Boseman was a big fan of the Bard, having studied Shakespeare during a summer course at Oxford, a trip funded by Denzel Washington. Deep Azure shows off another side to the actor beyond his on-screen performances. “Chad was the full package,” says Kevin. “He was beautiful. He could deliver a line. But he was also incredibly, incredibly smart.”
The play, directed by Tristan Fynn-Aiduenu, Olivier-nominated in 2022 for his staggering For Black Boys Who Have Considered Suicide When the Hue Gets Too Heavy, sees a community coming together to heal. It’s easy to draw real-life comparisons with Boseman’s brothers, who were confronted with the strange experience of grieving someone who had become a public figure, bigger than themselves in every way.
It was a blessing that their brother’s death occurred during the pandemic, they say. “Our family could really pull together in isolation, be in community with one another and not deal with the outside world directly,” says Kevin, who learnt he had cancer himself in 2018, two years after Boseman’s diagnosis. “But he was everywhere. We couldn’t walk into a store and not see his face on the cover of a magazine. It was overwhelming.” Derrick recalls being confronted by his late brother’s image constantly, when he’d least expect it: getting new tires put on his car, or scrolling through Netflix at home.
“It was like he wouldn’t go away,” he says. “The whole world was constantly reminding us of what happened. People will message me to this day thinking it’ll make me feel better, but it makes me feel worse. They don’t even know they’re doing it.” It was only recently that Derrick started watching his brother’s movies again. “I see how great an actor Chad was, but I also see his own personality in the way he moves, and the way he talks.”
For all the pain of their loss, the brothers are happy they could be there for Boseman in the end. “Those last five months of his life we were in LA with him and our parents, helping to take care of him along with Simone, his widow,” says Kevin. “It really is one of the greatest privileges of my life to witness his transition [to the other side] and to help him through it.”
Boseman’s legacy lives on in his movies and in his plays, like Deep Azure, but also in things less quantifiable. “Chad was someone who loved humanity, who was curious, and a seeker of knowledge,” says Kevin. “He left an indelible mark on people’s hearts and it’s an honour to create opportunities for who he was to continue to inspire people because at the end of the day, Chad rose to superstardom but he rose from very humble beginnings. It’s a reminder that hard work and dedication to a discipline and a craft can take you as far as you want it to take you.”
‘Deep Azure’ is on at Shakespeare’s Globe, London, until 11 April 2026

‘Hell and back’: Mass rape survivor Gisele Pelicot recounts her ordeal in memoir
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
Ms Gisele Pelicot, the French woman whose husband was convicted of inviting dozens of men to rape her unconscious body, has released her memoir
A Hymn to Life, published on Feb 17, retraces the 2024 mass rape case that turned Ms Pelicot
Explaining her decision to waive her right to anonymity, she wrote: “No one would ever know what they had done to me... No one beyond those involved in the trial would see their faces, look them up and down and wonder how to pick out the rapists among their neighbours and colleagues.”
Hell and back
Describing the moment she learnt her husband had drugged and raped her for years, she wrote that police had initially asked if she and her then husband were swingers. When she had replied that they were not, she was shown images of herself, unconscious in bed with unknown men.
“The officer says a number. He tells me fifty-three men had come to my house to rape me,” the memoir reads.
She then recounts how she went home and hung out her husband’s washing. “I was like a dog waiting by the garden gate for its master,” she wrote.
She also describes the difficult task of telling friends and, especially, her children, and how she was aware that her daughter Caroline was about to “go through hell and back”.
In addition to her now former husband Dominique Pelicot, 50 men were convicted of raping Ms Gisele Pelicot.
Faith in people...is my revenge
During the trial, Ms Pelicot never directly addressed Dominique Pelicot, but she wrote that she planned to visit him in prison to seek answers.
“Did you ever think, ‘I must stop’? Did you abuse our daughter? Did you commit the most abject crime of all? Do you have any idea of the hell we’re living in? ... Did you kill? ... I’ll ask him all these questions. I need answers; he owes me that much.”
Ms Pelicot says she has drawn strength from the thousands of letters she has received from women around the world and from the women waiting outside the courtroom.
“Not long after the trial began, I started to be presented with a bundle of correspondence at the end of each day... I preferred to read their letters rather than the newspapers; they gave me the chance to listen to women’s voices,” she wrote.
“How could I tell the women... that their presence outside the courtroom eased for me what was happening inside.”
In her book, Ms Pelicot also describes how she found love again with a man she met through mutual friends.
The evening she met him, she recalled in the book she “was light-headed with happiness”.
“I needed to love again. I was not afraid... I still have faith in people. Once, that was my greatest weakness. Now it is my strength. My revenge.” REUTERS

Oil in spotlight as Trump's Iran warning rattles sleepy markets

Oil prices were in focus Tuesday as U.S. President Donald Trump ramped up threats towards Iran, shaking up markets subdued by holidays in Asia and the United States.
West Texas Intermediate was up more than one percent, nearing $64 per barrel, while Brent eased slightly to just under $69.
Trump warned Iran of the "consequences of not making a deal" ahead of talks between Washington and Tehran in Geneva.
The U.S. president has repeatedly threatened military action against the Islamic republic — first over its deadly crackdown on anti-government protests, and then more recently over the country's nuclear programme.
The warning rippled through markets in an otherwise quiet start to the week, as Shanghai, Hong Kong, Taipei, Seoul and Singapore remained closed for the extended Lunar New Year holiday.
U.S. markets were set to reopen Tuesday after Monday's break for Presidents' Day.
Gold slid below $5,000 per ounce, while silver dropped four percent.
In Tokyo, the Nikkei was down 0.8 percent after the world's fourth-biggest economy reported weak growth in the fourth quarter on Monday.
"With the U.S. market closed, the Japanese market is expected to start today with little movement due to a lack of material," brokerage house Monex said in note.
"In the foreign exchange market, the dollar/yen exchange rate was trading in the mid-153 yen range, a weaker yen than the previous day, which is likely to support export-related stocks."
Investors will also turn to Japanese Finance Minister Satsuki Katayama's appearance at the Digital Space Conference, Monex added, although "this is likely to have a limited impact on the stock market, and a sense of stalemate is expected throughout the day".
Sydney jumped 0.5 percent after Australian giant BHP, the world's largest copper producer, reported a hike in half-year net profit, boosted by demand for copper to meet the global need for electrical power.
Bangkok shrugged off limp economic growth reported on Monday to rise 0.5 percent, riding a post-election high after the conservative Bhumjaithai Party's stunning victory in Feb. 8 polls.
Mumbai, Jakarta and Manila were also in the green, while Wellington slid 0.5 percent and Kuala Lumpur was little changed.
Traders will also be keeping an eye on artificial intelligence this week, as tech CEOs and global leaders rub shoulders at the AI Impact Summit in New Delhi.
Touted as the biggest edition yet, the five-day summit aims to declare a "shared roadmap for global AI governance and collaboration".
U.S. Fed Governor Michael Barr and San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly are also scheduled to speak on AI on Tuesday, Bloomberg News reported.
While frenzied demand for generative AI has turbocharged profits for many tech companies, anxiety is growing over the risks that it poses to society and the environment.

BHP says it’s paying more in Queensland taxes than it’s making in profits

BHP says it’s paying more in Queensland taxes than it’s making in profits
BHP says it’s paying more in taxes in Queensland than it’s collecting in profits, as the company again lashed the Crisafulli government’s coal royalties regime, which it blamed for acute industry challenges.
The world’s biggest miner has aggressively lobbied the state to overhaul the sector’s tax settings since the former Labor government raised royalties in 2022.
The LNP was initially critical of the tax regime but in government has repeatedly said it would not wind back the settings, despite an intense campaign and ongoing scrutiny from powerful industry leaders.
BHP announced in September that the royalties had forced it to slash 750 jobs from its Queensland operations and mothball the open-pit Saraji South coal mine in the Bowen Basin.
On Tuesday, it told investors its “challenges are acute” in Queensland after it revealed its coal mining business had increased by 2 per cent for little monetary gain.
Chief financial officer Vandita Pant said the operations would extract higher volumes in the medium term “without any capital going in” to the company.
She said the cyclical downturn in coal prices was contributing equally to the hit to the company, alongside royalties.
“What we are paying in taxes and royalties is higher than the profit that we’re generating,” Pant said after BHP reported its earnings.
“We have one of the best portfolios from a quality of coal perspective. The demand dynamics of met [metallurgical] coal of high quality remain positive. However, from a business operational return perspective, the challenges are acute.”
Stuart Bocking, the chief executive of industry lobby group Coal Australia, said the tax settings were crippling jobs in regional Queensland.
“The world’s highest coal royalties are taxing coal jobs out of existence. That’s neither fair nor sustainable,” he said.
“Queensland Labor may have created this job-destroying royalties regime, but the LNP now owns it.”
Bocking said the industry was continuing to lobby the Crisafulli government, but Treasurer David Janetzki again said there would be no change to the coal royalties structure.
He said the government was instead supporting the resources sector by speeding up mine approvals and extending the life of coal-fired power until at least 2046.
“We have been clear about our support for the industry – what it means for regional Queensland – and we’ve delivered a stable environment,” Janetzki told reporters on Tuesday.
“Coal royalties play a vital role in paying for hospitals, roads, dams, bridges, nurses, teachers, doctors. It’s an important role that it plays. We’ve offered that certainty and stability to the industry, and will continue to do so.”
BHP reported that earnings from both iron ore and copper boosted its half-year profit to December 2025 by 28 per cent to $US5.64 billion ($8 billion) as its revenue rose 11 per cent to $US27.9 billion.
The company’s shares rose 6.7 per cent during morning trade to $53.71. The company said it would pay investors an interim dividend of US73¢, fully franked, on March 26.

Canada says ties with China renewed after visa-free travel announcement
Beijing to allow Canadians 30-day visa-free stays starting Feb. 17, 2026, sign of improving relations after years of tensions
ISTANBUL
Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said Monday that Canada is “renewing” its relationship with China after Beijing announced visa-free travel for Canadian citizens, calling the move a key outcome of a new phase in bilateral engagement.
“We’re renewing Canada’s relationship with China. As part of our new strategic partnership, China is granting visa-free travel for Canadians,” Carney wrote on the US social media platform X, describing the policy as a tangible sign of improving ties.
China’s Foreign Ministry said Sunday that ordinary passport holders from Canada and the UK will be allowed visa-free entry starting Feb. 17, 2026. The policy will permit stays of up to 30 days for business, tourism, family visits, exchanges and transit.
“To further facilitate cross-border travel, China decides to, starting from February 17, 2026, extend its visa waiver policy to ordinary passport holders from Canada and the UK,” the ministry said, adding that the measure will remain in effect until Dec. 31, 2026.
The decision follows Carney’s January visit to Beijing, where he met President Xi Jinping and “welcomed [the president's] commitment to introducing visa-free access for Canadians travelling to China,” according to a statement from the prime minister’s office.
British Prime Minister Keir Starmer reached agreements on people-to-people exchanges during a separate visit.
Canada’s Foreign Affairs Minister Anita Anand said on X that the change is making “travel easier, supporting business exchanges, and strengthening people-to-people ties between our countries.”
The visa waiver marks a shift after years of diplomatic tensions, during which Beijing maintained visa requirements for Canadians and restricted Chinese tourism groups traveling to Canada. Most Canadian travelers previously faced a lengthy application process and about $140 in fees to enter China.
The renewed engagement has also coincided with broader economic negotiations, including an agreement allowing tens of thousands of Chinese electric vehicles into Canada in exchange for tariff relief on Canadian agricultural products such as canola seeds.
China has expanded visa-free entry to several Western nations in recent years as part of efforts to revive tourism and international travel following the COVID-19 pandemic.

Airport noise costs Brisbane $100m a year. A curfew would cost $10m, report claims

Airport noise costs Brisbane $100m a year, curfew would cost $10m, report claims
Brisbane residents are collectively losing up to $100 million a year to sleep disruption, health risks, and depressed land values, a new study released by an anti-aircraft noise group has found.
The report, authored by University of Queensland economist Professor John Quiggin, was released by the Brisbane Flight Path Community Alliance late on Monday.
The alliance raised $5000 for the report, which it told potential donors would be “instrumental in shifting public policy”.
Quiggin’s report finds a nighttime curfew of 10pm to 6am, similar to the one at Sydney’s Mascot airport, would come at a “modest” cost to Brisbane’s economy.
“A curfew would not ground the economy, but it would finally let Brisbane residents sleep,” he said.
“On conservative estimates, Brisbane residents are collectively losing up to $100 million per year in the form of sleep disruption, elevated health risks, reduced quality of life, and depressed land values.”
In his report, Quiggin puts the economic cost of a curfew at $10 million a year, “or even less”.
“By contrast, the potential health and economic benefits of a curfew are valued at $50 million or more,” he said.
The report cast doubt on the need for Brisbane Airport’s second runway, given that passenger movements had remained static for about a decade. The Brisbane Airport Corporation’s 2024 annual report shows 22.6 million passengers went through the airport in 2023-24 – a post-COVID high, but still less than the 23.6 million in 2017-18.
“An obvious implication is that the massive increase in aircraft noise associated with the introduction of the second runway has so far been unnecessary,” Quiggin says in the report.
“The old runway was capable of handling a larger volume of passengers than are using the airport at present.”
The report found the cost of a curfew would be mostly borne by the Brisbane Airport Corporation, with smaller costs to freight operators and their customers, and international air travellers.
It also recommended nighttime freight flights be directed to Toowoomba Wellcamp Airport, about 160 kilometres west of Brisbane Airport by road. The extra cost for freight would be about 16¢ a kilogram, adding up to $1.2 million a year, the report found.
“The persistent suggestion that aviation should be exempt from regulatory constraint because it is an essential service is analytically unsound,” Quiggin said.
“Industries that generate externalities – whether transport, manufacturing, or energy – are commonly subject to operating limits, particularly during sensitive night hours.
“It is time to bring Brisbane Airport into line with the rest of the country. A curfew is standard policy, not radical reform.”
Brisbane Airport spokesman Henry Tuttiett said the report understated the real-world harm, such as higher airfares and weaker international connections, that flight caps would inflict on Queensland.
“The report relies on assumptions that have already been academically analysed and disputed, particularly claims about property value impacts,” he said.
“Queensland University of Technology analysis of more than 180,000 residential sales over 36 years found no evidence of long-term price reductions or weaker capital growth in suburbs under flight paths.”
That QUT analysis, commissioned by Brisbane Airport Corporation, attracted criticism in Quiggin’s separate submission to a 2024 Senate inquiry into aircraft noise for its lack of hedonic pricing – an unbundling of a total price to determine what each individual feature was worth.
In response to that criticism, QUT report authors Dr Andrea Blake and Professor Chris Eves submitted to the Senate inquiry that hedonic modelling provided an “illusion of legitimacy and accuracy” that was sometimes not warranted.
Tuttiett said Brisbane Airport’s 24-hour operation was critical to the industries that underpinned Queensland’s economy, particularly tourism and time-sensitive exports.
“The impact of caps and a curfew on Queensland would be profound,” he said.
“Previous economic analysis has estimated the real reduction in activity at $2.3 billion by 2031-32; and $5.5 billion by 2041-42. The reduction in employment is estimated at 24,542 jobs by 2031-32; and 57,922 jobs by 2041-42.”
Tuttiett said there were better ways to deliver relief to communities affected by noise from the new runway that would be less economically damaging.
Those included improved flight paths, more operations over Moreton Bay, and the accelerated rollout of newer, quieter aircraft.
“Brisbane Airport welcomed the outcomes of the Senate inquiry into the mitigation of aircraft noise, and is committed to working closely with airlines, Airservices Australia, and government to minimise aircraft noise for local communities,” he said.

‘Conservation dilemma’ as pumas reclaim national park and feast on its penguins
Unknown

A new study found that thousands of penguins have been killed by pumas over a four-year period, but most were left partly uneaten.
Defenceless penguins are being killed en masse as puma populations recover in Monte Leon National Park in Argentina’s ruthlessly wild Patagonia.
After cattle ranching was abandoned in the country’s south in the 1990s, pumas began recolonising parts of their historical range. At the same time, Magellanic penguin colonies have expanded from nearby islands to the mainland, where "terrestrial predators” had previously been absent.
It’s resulted in what scientists are calling a “conservation dilemma” that could see penguin colonies dwindle in the region. Now, a study by Oxford University has quantified the risk of long-term penguin population survival.
How pumas became these penguins’ biggest threat
Researchers from the Centro de Investigaciones de Puerto Deseado of the Universidad Nacional de la Patagonia Austral and rangers from the Monte Leon National Park have been monitoring penguin populations in the park.
Over four years (2007 to 2010) they counted the number of penguin carcasses attributed to puma predation. They then collaborated with Oxford University’s Wildlife Conservation Research Unit to analyse the data.
The new study, published in the Journal for Nature Conservation, estimates that more than 7,000 adult penguins were killed over the four-year period, but most of them weren’t fully eaten. This is around 7.6 per cent of the adult population.
Lead author Melisa Lera says the number of carcasses showing signs of predation in the colony is “overwhelming”.
“The fact that they were left uneaten means pumas were killing more penguins than they required for food,” she adds. “This is consistent with what ecologists describe as ‘surplus killing’.”
This is similar to domestic cats which can end up hunting more birds – even if they don’t eat them – because they’re abundant and vulnerable.
Will penguins in Patagonia become extinct?
Researchers carried out modelling on the data and concluded that pumas alone were “unlikely” to drive the colony at the national park to extinction.
The penguins’ future appears to be more sensitive to factors such as reproductive success and juvenile survival – but high puma predation will exacerbate these outcomes.
“This study captures an emerging conservation challenge, where recovering carnivores are encountering novel prey,” says co-author Dr Jorgelina Marino.
“Understanding how these dietary shifts affect both predators and prey is essential to inform conservation.”
Since the models identified breeding success and mortality of the juveniles as some of the key determinants of population viability, the authors highlight the need to understand how environmental factors such as nutrients, food and temperature – known to be influenced by climate change – may affect the penguins’ reproductive success.
The Park authorities continue to monitor puma and penguin populations.

How Hong Kong is galloping towards prosperity with Lunar New Year fireworks spectacle
As the city prepares to welcome the Year of the Horse, the SCMP takes a look at the highlights of the spectacle and where best to watch it
Hong Kong will welcome the Year of the Horse with a 23-minute Lunar New Year fireworks display on Wednesday, showcasing vibrant elements inspired by the energy and spirit of horses.
Themed “Prosperity Gallops Across Hong Kong,” the fireworks show is solely sponsored by the Hong Kong Jockey Club at a cost of HK$19 million (US$2.4 million).
The South China Morning Post takes a closer look at the highlights of the extravaganza and the best spots to watch it from.
1. What are the highlights of the show?
At exactly 8pm, thousands of pyrotechnic shells will be launched into the sky from three barges anchored in Victoria Harbour.
According to the production company, Pyromagic Multimedia Productions, the display will stretch 850 metres (2.788 feet) across the harbour and reach up to 250 metres in height.
The show will comprise eight scenes, each with a distinct theme incorporating horse motifs and auspicious symbols.
The spectacle will open with a dazzling 15-second burst of high-density fireworks to evoke the energy of galloping horses and to bid farewell to the previous year.

Strong Lunar New Year demand fuels China’s gold jewellery market
Retailers offer small discounts to spur holiday sales but are set to raise prices after the festival, as investment banks issue bullish outlooks
In the run-up to Lunar New Year, Chinese consumers were busy choosing gold jewellery, a traditional gift with deep cultural connotations, as strong market sentiment overshadowed sharp fluctuations in gold prices and assessments of the sector’s outlook by investment banks remained upbeat.
Jewellers offered small discounts to boost holiday sales. For example, Chow Tai Fook Jewellery Group, China’s largest retailer by store count, launched an 80 yuan (US$12) discount per gram on gold items in its stores nationwide through the end of the Spring Festival. The discount is linked to China’s daily spot gold price.
The jeweller planned to raise prices of some fixed-price gold and gold-inlaid diamond products after the holiday, as gold and raw material prices had increased owing to recent international and domestic market factors, according to social media posts by sales associates of Chow Tai Fook.
“We have been quite busy since the morning of Valentine’s Day, with many customers coming in to select jewellery,” said an associate at a Chow Tai Fook store in Beijing’s downtown Haidian district. “It’s very rare for the Spring Festival holiday to coincide with Valentine’s Day, and I will be working a bit of overtime.”
“Consumers have indicated strong rigid demand, rising investment sentiment, and a notable shift towards younger buyers,” said Fu Yifu, a special researcher at Su Merchants Bank in Nanjing, in eastern China’s Jiangsu province.

Police ‘determined’ to target abusers who drive women to suicide but say they lack of resources

Police are “determined to do more” to hold to account domestic abusers who drive victims to kill themselves, the National Police Chiefs’ Council has said.
Assistant Commissioner Louisa Rolfe, the NPCC lead for domestic abuse, has said that “more posthumous investigations are taking place”, but that officers struggle with a lack of resources, adding that 20% of all crime relates to domestic abuse in most forces.
National guidance had been changed, she said, with the NPCC’s research team going into forces to look at how it was being applied. That guidance, she said, had been adapted based on feedback from families, who had consistently raised concerns about police response.
This included, Rolfe said, “officers too quick to assume, ‘well, it’s a suicide and therefore a case for the coroner, not an investigation to be had by policing’, too often assuming that the domestic abuse perpetrator was the primary next of kin, and therefore risking evidence being lost by, for example, returning personal property like phones to those individuals.
“Not being sufficiently curious in speaking to family, wider family members about what might be going on. So we changed the guidance and we have seen some improvements.”
Rolfe made the comments after the Guardian revealed analysis suggesting that the number of women driven to suicide by domestic abusers was being seriously under-reported, with their cases often overlooked by the police. To illustrate the scale of the crisis, the Guardian is publishing a series of articles about some of those who have died by suicide after domestic abuse.
Rolfe said police forces had been urged to introduce a local review system, similar to that introduced by the Met after the case of Stephen Port, who killed young gay men in east London. Despite similarities in the deaths of four men, the Met failed to recognise that they might be connected.
Scotland Yard, she said, had introduced “a daily review process for all unexpected deaths to just ensure that there was a second opinion on each of those cases”. As a result of the recommendations in relation to domestic abuse suicides, “we’re certainly seeing more posthumous investigations”, Rolfe said.
She pointed to the case of Kiena Dawes, who was subjected to repeated assaults, bullying and belittling from her partner Ryan Wellings before she took her own life, as an example of the difficulty in securing prosecutions. Dawes left a note on her phone saying “Ryan Wellings killed me”. He was found guilty of assault and coercive and controlling behaviour and sentenced to six and a half years, but found not guilty of manslaughter.
“We know from that case how difficult it can be to secure a prosecution that makes a causal link between the abuse and the death, so a manslaughter charge or homicide charge, but we want to pursue more of those,” she said.
Rolfe added: “But also for many families, ensuring that we’re investigating the coercive controlling behaviour that happened in an abusive relationship. So we are seeing more posthumous investigations, which is heartening.”
One of the biggest barriers to progressing investigations, Rolfe said, was diminishing resources, coupled with long delays in the criminal justice system. “The scale of this is challenging, policing has a finite resource,” she said. But she added: “The one really good thing I’ve seen in policing in my 35 years is that the focus on this work has really increased.”
Another challenge, Rolfe said, was the huge amount of digital data that police investigations now involved. “The more data that technology [such as mobile phones] includes, the more work there is for policing,” she said, “but we probably have less resources now than we had 20 years ago when people didn’t really use smartphones.”
Some families whose loved ones killed themselves after domestic abuse have complained that ongoing investigations into that abuse were dropped after a victim took their own life.
Katie Madden, whose case was revealed by the Guardian on Monday, took her own life hours after her partner Jonathon Russell told her to kill herself. At an inquest, Russell said he then ‘went back on’ himself and told her not to. He also admitted to giving her a black eye weeks before she died.
No criminal investigation was ever launched. Madden’s mother was told by police that officers only had the capacity to examine one month’s worth of messages, and dropped an investigation into alleged coercive and controlling behaviour.
In relation to posthumous investigations being dropped, Rolfe said: “There is a reality that we have more work than we can cope with and we have to cut our cloth and make really tough decisions about the prioritisation of cases. And for domestic abuse investigators, sometimes that might mean the cases where they are seeking to protect a victim who needs protection right now might take precedence over a case where sadly the victim is no longer around to be protected.”
However, she said that while she could understand see why officers might choose to discontinue cases, “that doesn’t mean they should stop”. “The most serious cases we deal with are deaths, and therefore we should not be not investigating,” she said.
Another issue, Rolfe said, was “poor communication by investigators overwhelmed with cases, and particularly with the impact of the crisis in the wider justice system”.
While a police investigator should have a caseload of about 15 cases, she said, some now would have more than double that, with the corresponding number of families to keep in touch with. “Ten years ago most of those cases will be in court over the next six months and then move out of their caseload,. For the last five years, those have not been going through the court process, so the list of victims that they’re keeping updated and supporting is just growing, so that’s really tough for policing.”
Rolfe added: “We’re were determined to do more. We’re seeing green shoots of improvement in our response. There’s still a huge amount more to do.”

‘Deliberate targeting of vital body parts’: X-rays taken after Iran protests expose extent of catastrophic injuries
Unknown

Across the planes of Anahita’s* face, white dots shine like a constellation. Some gleam from inside the sockets of her eyes, others are scattered over the young woman’s chin, forehead, cheekbones. A few float over the dark expanse of her brain.
Each dot represents a metal sphere, about 2-5mm in size, fired from the barrel of a shotgun and revealed by the X-ray camera for a CT scan. Shot from a distance, the projectiles, known as “birdshot”, spray widely, losing some of their momentum. At close range, they can crack bone, blast through the soft tissue of the face, and easily pierce the eyeball’s delicate globe. Anahita, who is in her early 20s, has lost at least one eye, possibly both.
The image of Anahita’s head is one of more than 75 sets of medical images – primarily X-rays and CT scans – shared with the Guardian from one hospital in a major city in Iran, taken over the course of a single evening during the regime’s January crackdown on protesters. The plain, grayscale images tell their own story of the deadly violence inflicted on protesters and onlookers by Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC).
They provide further evidence of events described by doctors and protesters across Iran, where guards switched from more traditional ‘crowd control’ to opening fire with high-calibre assault rifles and shotguns. The records present a pattern of people being shot in the face, chest and genitals, a trend also seen in the 2022 “Women, life, freedom” protests. Collectively, they help to illustrate the scale of bloodshed, showing dozens of life-threatening injuries appearing at a single hospital in a midsize city within a few hours.
Many of the images reveal catastrophic injuries that may be fatal even with immediate surgical treatment. The scan of Vahid*, a young man, shows a large-calibre bullet embedded in his neck, his trachea pushed to the right as blood pools and the damaged tissue swells. Scans of another man, middle-aged, show a bullet suspended in his brain, along with a large bubble of gas inside the skull, indicating a devastating brain injury. Medical experts describe it as “likely not survivable”. Two more young men have large-calibre bullets lodged next to their spines. The scan of a young woman shows a deformed bullet that appears to have entered the ribcage under her right arm, torn through the lung, where gas and blood have built up, and come to rest at the left of her spine.
As part of a joint investigation between the Guardian and factchecking platform Factnameh, the images have been assessed by a panel of health and ballistics experts outside Iran, including an emergency medicine doctor, a radiologist and a trauma imaging specialist. The images have also been assessed by an independent Iranian former ER doctor, who says the software used to capture them is consistent with that used in the hospital concerned and that they show no signs of tampering. Descriptions of the extent of the likely injuries are based on the doctors’ assessments, although they caution that without full medical notes and multiple sets of imaging, they cannot make definitive diagnostic statements about individual patients. Dr Rohini Haar, an emergency doctor, adjunct professor at UC Berkeley and medical adviser to Physicians for Human Rights who has reviewed the files, says the cases are “shocking” in their number and severity. “Using live ammunition and large-gauge bullets against so many individuals is … extremely unusual and notable, even globally.”
A radiologist and trauma imaging expert who has reviewed the images says that the group of patients would constitute “absolutely a mass casualty situation. Even for our large hospitals [in the US] … that would be a mass casualty alert that would overwhelm hospital resources.”
Medical experts note that the images would only reflect patients that doctors think they can save, and who have survived to the point where doctors are able to administer detailed scans. Most people shot by a high-calibre round to the head, for example, “wouldn’t have got to a CT scan”, they say. During a mass casualty event, hospitals are forced to prioritise the cases that are life-threatening but treatable without requiring extensive resources, Haar says, meaning that the scans would only represent a small subset of the injured people who presented that night.
Iran is one of a small number of states where armed forces and police use metal birdshot. While an individual birdshot pellet does not cause as much damage as a bullet, they can still be catastrophic. At long range, when the pellets spray outward, they will hit a crowd indiscriminately. Even a single pellet can cause terrible damage. The X-rays show several cases where just one or two pellets are present in the skull (indicating the person was likely hit at longer range), but they appear to have pierced the eye and come to rest in the socket. At close range, a person may be pierced by hundreds of pellets, causing the destruction of all surrounding soft tissue.
X-rays of the chest of Ali* show more than 174 metal pellets sprayed into his right chest cavity, the metal balls tightly packed, indicating he was shot at extremely close range. His right lung has partially collapsed, and is surrounded by leaking blood and gas. Even with extensive, immediate surgical intervention, his risk of death would be very high, medical experts who have reviewed the images say.
“People think birdshot is less deadly than live ammunition. It’s not,” Haar says. “When you’re firing at point-blank range, all of those metal balls are penetrating – they’re like 100 tiny bullets.”
As well as the violence of the injuries, the X-rays are notable for the patterns they reveal: case after case shows patients shot at short to medium range in the face, chest and genitals.
Twenty-nine patients whose records have been viewed by the Guardian have been shot in the face with birdshot. Safie*, a middle-aged woman, still wears simple jewellery in the first CT scan of her head: the thin chain of a necklace dangles against the dark grey of her neck. Also lit up are the metal beads that have burrowed deep into the tissue of her brain. The scans show the progress of medical teams’ efforts to save Safie: a craniotomy, in which a section of the skull is removed either to perform surgery, or to relieve the pressure of the injured, swelling brain crushing against the skull. Later images show that some metal pellets have been removed from the skull, but more than 20 remain embedded in her head and neck. It is not known whether she survived.
At least nine have been shot in the genital or pelvic area with birdshot or, in three cases, with high-calibre rifles. One woman, middle aged, has been shot in the groin, and has almost 200 metal balls distributed into her thighs and pelvic area. A 35-year-old man has similar injuries: birdshot scattered across his groin. According to the medical analysis commissioned by the Guardian, the injuries could cause “serious disfigurement” as well as “serious injuries to the genitals, perineum, rectum, and urinary bladder”. They conclude: “Bladder and bowel incontinence, sterility and impotence are possible long-term outcomes.”
In nine of the patients, the high-calibre bullets are still embedded in the body and clearly visible in the scans. In another seven, the bullet is not visible, but ballistics and medical experts agree that the injuries shown – such as a femur bone shattered along a clear pathway, with metal fragments – are extremely likely to have been caused by a high-velocity bullet. The images showing projectiles have been analysed by two independent ballistics experts, who identify the bullets as full metal jacket rounds consistent with those fired from assault rifles such the AK-47 or KL-133 – weapons used by the IRGC. Full metal jacket bullets often do not deform on impact, holding a clear “bullet” shape. “These are lethal purpose weapons,” says ballistics expert NR Jenzen-Jones, director of Armament Research Services, who has assessed a subset of the images.
In their review of the images, one of the medical analysts describes them as “the kind of injuries you would see in wartime: those are chest shots with a military weapon”. “If you’re firing those kind of weapons at people, you are trying to kill them.”
Haar adds: “These are not the kind of little bullets that we usually see even in policing in the US. These are a whole different level of weapon.”
The X-rays provide further evidence for a growing body of testimony from doctors on the ground treating those injuries, who say damage they have witnessed is catastrophic. Many report conducting dozens of surgeries to remove the eyes of those struck, including teenagers and children. One medic, Dr Ahmad*, whose identity and credentials have been verified by the Guardian, passes on comments from a surgery colleague who treated a very large number of penetrating eye injuries. His youngest patient was a 14-year-old girl, who was brought in by her parents and her brother. “Her face was covered in blood, and her younger brother was shaking uncontrollably,” he says. The parents say the family was at a demonstration when security forces began firing from the roof of a civilian building. “She was shot directly in the left eye [causing] devastating damage. The injury was so severe that the eye could not be saved and had to be surgically removed.”
Ahmad says he has spoken to colleagues across the country who “report a recurring pattern of deliberate gunshot injuries targeting specific organs, most notably the eyes and heart, and less frequently the genital region. These injuries commonly involve penetrating eye trauma, globe rupture, severe intraocular bleeding, retinal damage, and permanent vision loss.” The pattern of injuries “strongly suggests an intent to cause permanent disability rather than unintended harm”, he says, and is “difficult to reconcile with random gunfire in chaotic environments and instead points toward deliberate targeting of vital and symbolically significant body parts”.
Another doctor inside Iran, whose identity and medical credentials were verified by the Guardian, says those arriving in the emergency department ranged from grandparents to toddlers. “They came in with gunshots and also pellets in different locations on the body – to the chest, the abdomen, limbs, genitals … basically the entire body. Live ammunition wounds from pistols, AK47s,” he says. Among the older people was a grandmother in her mid-60s, brought in by her family. She had been caught in the violence when trying to pick up her granddaughter, and was shot at extremely close range by a pellet-loaded shotgun.
“Pellet had spread all across her body,” the doctor says. Staff made two CPR attempts, but the woman died.
“I am still trying to cope with it,” he says. “You can only witness so much.”

Labour take note: the politics of home cannot be ceded to the nativist right | Julian Coman

In the mid-1980s, a remarkable German television series became appointment viewing in my house each Thursday evening. Heimat, an epic portrait of the life and times of a fictional Rhineland village, tracked the inhabitants of Schabbach as they navigated the tumultuous 20th century. Across the course of 15 hours, Edgar Reitz’s drama conveyed a romantic, almost religious, sense of rootedness and love of place. As the aged local gravedigger liked to tell outsiders: “Down on earth as you all know, there’s high and low German, but in heaven – as you’d expect – they speak the Hunsrück dialect.”
Half-playful, half-serious, those words express something both mysterious and beautiful about belonging. But on the political spectrum, where does such a vision sit? James Orr, recently recruited as an intellectual outrider for Nigel Farage, would have a ready and confident answer to that question. A professor of the philosophy of religion at Cambridge, Orr has been trying to lend some highbrow lustre to Faragism. In a recent piece for the Times, he argued: “Reform is beginning to articulate what is routinely dismissed and demonised as rightwing populism, but which is much better understood as a vision animated by the politics of home.” Other parties, his column continued, have governed Britain as if it were “nowhere in particular”, managing a zone rather than cherishing and protecting a place.
Similar observations have long been circulating in the far-right salons of Europe. I remember listening almost a decade ago to Marine Le Pen’s niece, Marion Maréchal, speaking at a rally in the historic city of Sens: “For Macron, our country is not a nation, it’s a space,” Maréchal told a predominantly working-class audience. “Me, I gaze in wonder at the gothic cathedral you have here in Sens, the most splendid in France, and marvel at the majesty of Racine’s verse. But all that doesn’t exist [for Macron]. The only thing that counts is productivity, the economy, benefits.”
By this point, the hackles of many readers will be rising. In a nativist vision, home is by definition not for everyone. Reitz’s masterpiece – which was certainly not that – was criticised for playing down the horrors of Nazi antisemitism, which only rarely intrude on the lives of its characters. And notwithstanding the prominence of figures such as Zia Yusuf and Suella Braverman, Reform’s love of place carries a logic of exclusion. Orr’s intervention was written in celebration of Robert Jenrick’s defection from the Conservatives, not long after Jenrick had notoriously lamented an absence of white faces in Handsworth. The party’s candidate in this month’s seismic byelection in Gorton and Denton is Matthew Goodwin, a former politics professor turned online activist, who has implied that UK-born people from minority ethnic backgrounds might not be, so to speak, echt-British.
These are repellent perspectives. Last week’s long-distance intervention by the billionaire tax exile Jim Ratcliffe, who lamented that Britain was in the process of being “colonised”, illustrated the extent to which they are gaining political traction. But moral excoriation, and edifying homilies in praise of diversity, do not cut it as a response. Watching a recent edition of Question Time, I despaired as the secretary of state for Scotland, Douglas Alexander, challenged a Reform-friendly podcaster on the panel by quoting This Is the Place, by the Manchester poet Tony Walsh. “Some are born here, some are drawn here, but we all call it home” is undoubtedly an uplifting line, but on sensitive subjects the left too often prefers preaching to analysis.
Reform is hoping to eat the lunch of both the left and right by embodying a sentimental politics of patriotic resistance, posing as a nationalist middle way between free-marketeering Thatcherism and the dead hand of a remote state that is indifferent to the struggles of real communities. Orr and Reform’s other intellectual luminary, Danny Kruger, believe this “new right” will create a new centre ground; one that unites traditional Toryism, middle England and a terminally disillusioned post-industrial working class. The coming pitch is for a deglobalised British capitalism, likely to include the taking of public stakes in key industries, accompanied by a cultural drumbeat of ethnocentrism.
The level of chutzpah is enormous. Farage identified with Liz Truss’s laissez-faire zealotry so much that he praised her government’s first and only budget as the best Tory economics “since 1986”. Orr’s new Centre for a Better Britain – the thinktank charged with policy development for a future Reform government – was founded with the help of commodity traders who drank with Farage during the “big bang” days of the 80s and 90s. These were the years when the world was made fit for global finance to plunder the planet according to its own priorities, and nobody then was talking about the politics of home.
But opportunists could not flourish without being handed opportunities. Reform is simply exploiting mainstream parties’ long complicity with a Davos-style worldview that genuflects to the markets, while remaining indifferent to the places whose fate they decide. Labour can point out the hypocrisy of Farage’s position. But in what one might call the party’s post-Mandelson era, its future relevance depends on its ability to make enemies in the right places. After all, the left can draw upon a rich tradition in which the need to resist and tame the uprooting power of capital was always well understood. Ideas of fraternity, solidarity and mutual dependence used to constitute the political atmosphere in which it breathed.
Orr’s contempt for a bloodless economic order, careless of human realities, strikingly echoes the Communist Manifesto’s description of a capitalist modernity in which “all that is solid melts into air, all that is holy is profaned”. Karl Marx was sanguine about the ruthlessness that overturned habit and custom in search of profit, believing that the industrial working class would eventually take back control and build a new Jerusalem. But “utopian socialists” such as the philanthropic factory owner Robert Owen, inaugurated an ethical tradition (co-ops, guilds and the postwar welfare state) which fought to insulate, protect and empower workers and families menaced by the economic forces beyond their control.
A couple of centuries on, a modern sense of heimat is threatened by a dysfunctional housing market that drives a sense of rootlessness and precarity. Town centres and high streets have been hollowed out by unmanaged post-industrial decline, and now by the digital rerouting of our everyday lives. AI threatens not only to take over traditional areas of employment; its future development will oblige us to defend the specificity and value of the human per se. Concerns over immigration are only part of this wider sense of social anxiety, which Farage has surfed to such political effect since the early days of Ukip.
Attacking Goodwin ahead of the Gorton and Denton byelection, Keir Starmer last week urged voters to choose “true patriotism” over the “plastic” version offered by Reform. Let’s hope they do. But the language is weak and banal. Unless Labour rediscovers its ethical ambition in dealing with the economic challenges of the age, and relearns a language of belonging that goes beyond virtuous assertion, such appeals risk being buried under a “unite the kingdom” St George’s flag.

There’s something endearing and confident about a dish named after the feeling it gives you. Bánh khoái means “delight” or “joy” cake. This crisp, savoury pancake originates from Hue, the historic capital of Vietnam’s central region. Traditionally served with a rich hoisin dipping sauce, my take swaps that out for a lighter nước chấm with sesame seeds. It stays true to the spirit of the original, though, preserving its joyful texture and bold, satisfying flavours, while using more accessible ingredients.
Bánh khoái (joy pancake)
This is just as joyful without the prawns: swap them for smoked or marinated tofu, and serve with sweet soy sauce for dipping. Purple perilla (also known as shisho leaves) is available in most Asian food stores.
Prep 10 min
Cook 25 min
Serves 4
8 tbsp vegetable oil
4 eggs, beaten
280g cooked and peeled king prawns (jumbo shrimp), or ready-cooked prawns
4 spring onions, trimmed and finely chopped
200g beansprouts
4 tsp crispy fried shallots, to garnish
For the batter
100g rice flour
25g plain flour
½ tsp salt
1 tsp sugar
½ tsp baking powder
1 tsp ground turmeric
300ml coconut cream (not coconut milk)
For the sesame nước chấm
2 tsp white sesame seeds
400ml nước chấm (Vietnamese fish sauce)
For the salad
½ fresh pineapple, peeled and cored
1 star fruit, or green (unripe) mango
2 baby gem lettuce, leaves separated
80g pea shoots
120g rocket
25g Thai basil
25g purple perilla
In a large bowl, whisk all the batter ingredients until smooth. In a small bowl, stir the sesame seeds into the nước chấm and set aside.
Put a 20cm cast-iron skillet or nonstick frying pan on a medium heat, add two tablespoons of oil and, when it’s hot, pour in about 75ml (five tablespoons) of the batter, swirling the pan to coat the base evenly. Drizzle over a tablespoon of beaten egg, then sprinkle over some prawns, spring onion and beansprouts (if you like them softened; if not, save them for the salad), then leave to cook for about two minutes, until the base is crisp and golden.
Fold the pancake in half to enclose the filling, and transfer to a plate. Repeat with the remaining oil, batter and filling to make four pancakes.
Slice the pineapple and star fruit or mango, arrange them and the remaining salad ingredients on a platter and put in the centre of the table. Garnish with crispy fried shallots.
To eat, wrap pieces of pancake in lettuce with the herbs and fruit, dip into the sesame nước chấm, and enjoy every joyful bite.

Can Lithuania balance minority identity and state language in education?
Unknown

15:00:00 KST

National minorities must be able to preserve their traditions and identity, but proficiency in the Lithuanian language is essential for children’s education, integration and future careers, experts said during a recent national forum on minority rights.
The discussion comes as more families in minority communities – including in Visaginas, one of Lithuania’s most multilingual cities – are choosing Lithuanian-language schools for their children, reflecting a broader debate over how best to balance cultural preservation with equal opportunities.
The issue was explored at the National Human Rights Forum during a panel titled “Children of National Minorities: How to Preserve Identity and Grow Into Full Citizens”.
Recent assessments show that academic results of students attending minority-language schools have slightly improved in recent years but still lag behind those of students studying in Lithuanian. Experts warned that educating children in separate ethnic school systems can deepen divides between communities and contribute to social isolation, even if it helps preserve language and culture.
Anna Grigoit, head of LRT’s National Minorities Content Group, said minorities in Lithuania generally feel secure but acknowledged that challenges remain.
“As a Lithuanian Pole, I feel good in Lithuania,” Grigoit said. “Of course, there is room to improve and to grow, and there are still things we need to talk about.”
Vytautas Magnus University Rector Ineta Dabašinskienė said Lithuania has made significant progress over the last three decades, though advances are sometimes more visible in legislation than in everyday life.
“We have strong legal frameworks and follow European standards,” she said. “But in practice, everyday life does not always reflect that diversity as positively as we would like.”
Children’s Rights Ombudsperson Edita Žiobienė said progress in human rights is never complete and warned that Lithuania neglected minority issues for more than a decade after the expiration of its Law on National Minorities in 2011.
“That period showed that there are areas where the state must wake up and recognise the need to talk about our society and our communities,” she said.
Visaginas Mayor Erlandas Galaguzas said the fact that a Lithuanian-speaking mayor leads a largely Russian-speaking town shows that human rights and democratic participation are functioning. He added that Visaginas, often labelled a Russian town, is home to people of more than 40 nationalities.
“All nationalities find common ground and shared solutions,” Galaguzas said. “It’s not perfect, but overall it works.”
Grigoit, who is raising three children enrolled in Polish-language schools, said she feels fully at home in Lithuania. She acknowledged that her youngest child sometimes lacks confidence in Lithuanian, but said her older children now feel comfortable using the majority language in competitions and daily life.
She argued that children learn best in their native language but stressed that Lithuanian should be introduced early, starting in kindergarten.
“Children are very capable. We shouldn’t underestimate them,” she said.
Although her children attend Polish-language schools, all their extracurricular activities – including music schools and clubs – are conducted in Lithuanian.
“We consciously choose environments where children naturally hear and speak Lithuanian,” she said.
Dabašinskienė noted that minority students’ results have improved in recent years but said Lithuania lacked a long-term education strategy for minority children.
“When people ask why they don’t speak Lithuanian well, we shouldn’t blame the children,” she said. “There was no consistent, long-term policy.”
She said democratic countries must protect minority identity while ensuring integration, adding that strong Lithuanian-language skills are essential for participating fully in society.
Language proficiency varies by region, but minority students generally perform worse on Lithuanian language exams. That can limit access to higher education and career opportunities, she said.
“We need to open two doors,” Dabašinskienė said. “Support families who preserve their identity while also ensuring children integrate and understand the value of Lithuanian for education and careers.”
Grigoit noted that this year marked a milestone, with Polish- and Lithuanian-language students performing at nearly the same level on the national Lithuanian language and literature exam for the first time.
Mayor Galaguzas said minority-language schools can unintentionally burden students, as curricula and textbooks are in Lithuanian, requiring constant translation.
“Children read in Lithuanian, translate it, and respond in their native language,” he said. “That can overload them and affect results.”
He said more parents in Visaginas are choosing Lithuanian-language schools, prioritising their children’s future opportunities while still preserving traditions at home.
Dabašinskienė stressed that language skills also help children build broader social networks beyond their own ethnic groups.
Žiobienė said Europe remains divided on minority education. Western Europe has largely abandoned separate minority schools, while Central and Eastern Europe continue to maintain them. Estonia and Latvia are phasing out Russian-language schools in favour of instruction in majority languages, a path Lithuania has not taken.
“Should minority schools be closed? Probably not,” Žiobienė said. “But the real question is what the state provides to ensure children’s best interests.”
Dabašinskienė said Lithuania’s historical context differs from that of its Baltic neighbours and noted that minority schools have long existed in the country.
“Because of our history, the situation has always been different,” she said.

Spain launches investment fund to tackle housing crisis

) A building designated for affordable social rental housing is pictured on February 13, 2025 in Sant Boi de Llobregat.
Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez has presented a new public investment fund that he said would raise 120 billion euros ($142 billion) and help tackle the country's persistent housing crisis.
Scarce and unaffordable housing is consistently a top concern for Spaniards and represents a stubborn challenge in one of the world's most dynamic developed economies.
The new "Spain Grows" fund, first announced in January, aims to replace the tens of billions of EU post-COVID recovery aid that helped drive Spain's strong growth in recent years.
Sanchez said on Feb. 16 the headline figure, representing 7 percent of Spain's annual economic output, would come through public and private sources, with an initial contribution of 10.5 billion euros of EU money.
The fund would "mobilise up to 23 billion euros in public and private funding to dynamise the housing supply" and help build 15,000 homes per year, Sanchez added, without specifying a timeframe for the planned investment.
Energy, digitalisation, artificial intelligence and security industries would also benefit from the money, the Socialist leader said at a presentation in Madrid.
Tourism is a key component of Spain's economy, with the country welcoming a record 97 million foreign visitors last year, when GDP growth reached 2.8 percent, almost double the eurozone average.
But locals complain that short-term tourist accommodation has driven up housing prices and dried up supply.
The average price of a square metre for rent has doubled in 10 years.
According to the Bank of Spain, the net creation of new households and a lag in housing construction created a deficit of 700,000 homes between 2021 and 2025.

True North steps up Qld copper push with development drilling
Brought to you by Bulls N’ Bears
True North Copper has ramped up extension drilling at its Cloncurry copper project in Queensland to boost resource confidence ahead of a pre-feasibility study, while refining mine design and processing plans.
The project, which sits just south of its namesake township, comprises several deposits, including the underexplored Great Australia Mine, alongside its Taipan and Orphan Shear prospects.
Drilling is now underway, with the program set to punch out about 2700 metres across 14 combined diamond and reverse circulation (RC) holes.
Six diamond holes will focus on metallurgical and geotechnical studies, while a further six RC holes will probe mineralisation extensions across all three deposits and test a suite of near-mine priority targets.
Following last year’s drilling success, Great Australia’s resource now stands at 5.29 million tonnes grading 0.86 per cent copper, 0.07 grams per tonne (g/t) gold and 0.03 per cent cobalt.
Its Taipan deposit tips in with a 5.21-million-tonne resource, grading 0.57 per cent copper, 0.13g/t gold and 0.02 per cent cobalt. Confidence has recently lifted, with indicated material now making up 95 per cent of the total resource. Meanwhile, the Orphan Shear prospect delivers an additional 1 million tonnes at 0.56 per cent copper.
Together, the three deposits total 11.53 million tonnes grading 0.71 per cent copper and 0.09g/t for 80,000 tonnes of copper, 34,000 ounces of gold and 2000 tonnes of cobalt.
True North Copper general manager of operations Matt Varvari said: “The commencement of diamond drilling at Great Australia represents an important step in advancing the Cloncurry Copper Project toward development.
Elsewhere, the company’s Wallace North deposit, about 35 kilometres southeast of Great Australia, is set for a new round of drilling once the rigs finish at Cloncurry.
Although mining at Wallace North wrapped up in 2024, the open pit still hosts a solid 2 million tonnes grading 1.28 per cent copper and 0.77g/t gold and exploration late last year gave the geos something to smile about. Best hits included 19 metres grading a hefty 2.18 per cent copper and 1.76g/t gold from 106 metres, featuring an impressive 9 metres running 4.33 per cent copper and 3.64 g/t gold from 108 metres.
This intercept, located 60m along strike from the existing resource, represents the best intersection ever drilled at Wallace North.
RC drilling will also test priority targets at True North’s Whip and Coppermine Creek prospects, sitting 500 metres along strike southwest of Great Australia Mine. Whip has an intense induced polarisation (IP) anomaly, interpreted as hosting mineralisation.
A previous single drill hole intersected 6m grading 0.31 per cent copper from 142m downhole in a non-optimised position near the core of the IP anomaly. There was no follow-up work. Drilling in 2026 will test the downward continuity of the anomaly.
Coppermine Creek has another IP anomaly, potentially a deep extension of the Great Australia Mine. Previous drilling near the edge of the IP anomaly intersected a tantalising 12 metres running 0.64 per cent copper from 124m. The anomaly also straddles the Coppermine Creek fault, a potential feeder zone to mineralisation at the Great Australia Mine.
IP geophysics has been a very useful prospecting tool in the Cloncurry region. Copper resources at Great Australia and Taipan were both identified using IP, as they contain sufficient copper and iron sulphide to generate an IP response. The targets at Whip and Coppermine Creek may add to the list of copper discoveries using IP.
True North is gearing up for a busy 2026, with fresh green fields exploration programs testing new drill targets at Wallace North, Whip and Coppermine Creek. Brownfields targets to increase the resource base at Great Australia. The company believes it can deliver the next big Queensland copper story as it works towards project development.
With copper prices strengthening and the metal firmly embedded on critical mineral lists, the timing appears increasingly favourable for True North’s expanding Queensland footprint.

Plan to fix beaches washed away by Cyclone Alfred
A plan to fix beaches still damaged by Cyclone Alfred has been finalised, with millions of dollars allocated to the project.
Multiple beaches were severely eroded during the natural disaster in early 2025, with several of the worst impacted areas on the Gold Coast.
The federal and Queensland state government confirmed a $57 million package on Tuesday to help councils with recovery, as part of the wider Environmental Recovery Package.
“Beaches are the heart of many coastal towns as they draw visitors, support local jobs, and are a big part of why people choose to live by the water,” Queensland’s Environment and Tourism Minister Andrew Powell said.
“From sand reshaping to new vegetation, this work will help return our beaches to their natural best.”
A joint statement put out by Powell and his federal counterpart confirmed restoration work would be carried out from Bundaberg to the Gold Coast across 20 projects.
The councils eligible for funding are Brisbane, Bundaberg, Fraser Coast, Gold Coast, Gympie, Livingstone, Moreton Bay, and Sunshine Coast.
“This is a significant package that won’t only bring back a sense of normalcy, but will rebuild habitats for local wildlife and rehabilitate coastlines so they can withstand future severe weather events,” federal minister Kristy McBain said.
“Beaches are an integral part of these communities and it’s crucial that local governments get the support they need to bring some of our nation’s best coastlines back to their former glory.”
The Queensland Reconstruction Authority also backed the move, saying it will help restore the habitats of multiple native species.
Cyclone Alfred made landfall on March 7, 2025. Brisbane was saved from the worst of the storm by its collection of islands in Moreton Bay, which weakened the weather system as it approached.
The Gold Coast was particularly hard hit, with the roof torn from one building and many of its beaches decimated.
It took about eight months for all beaches to reopen, and at the time of the cyclone the local council estimated it could take up to three years for sand levels to return to normal.
Extensive restoration work has already been carried out, with sand pumped onto several beaches.

Underworld figure Waleed Haddara charged with drug, weapon offences after Altona gym arrest
Underworld figure and boxer Waleed Haddara has been arrested after police say they found him with drugs, cash and a knife during a search at a gym in Altona.
Haddara was nabbed after he was spotted by police dropping off a black satchel bag at a building near the gym about 8am on Tuesday.
Police say the bag was filled with methamphetamine, MDMA, cash, a flick knife and Haddara’s identification documents.
Officers then searched a home in South Kingsville connected to Haddara where they say they found more drugs, one can of pepper spray, one can of invisible number plate spray and a baton.
As an underworld figure, Haddara is subject to a firearm prohibition order that prevents him from having or obtaining guns, and allows police officers to search him and those in his vicinity without a warrant.
The Haddara crime family has been linked to large-scale tobacco importations in Australia and are believed to have dominated the black market trade for over a decade, before becoming embroiled in a violent turf war with tobacco kingpin Kazem Hamad.
Hamad eventually forced the surrender of the Haddaras in early 2024, taking control of their distribution networks and shops.
Haddara has been charged with trafficking methylamphetamine and MDMA, negligently dealing with proceeds of crime, dealing with property suspected of being proceeds of crime and possessing a controlled weapon.
He is due to appear at the Melbourne Magistrates’ Court on Wednesday.
Anyone with information on illicit firearm or drug activity is urged to contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000 or submit an online confidential report at www.crimestoppersvic.com.au

Ukraine’s Olympic sign bearer was a Russian woman: ‘I have to be worried’
Disguised in dark glasses and a silver puffer jacket, Anastasia Kucherova says she wept silently as Ukraine got a standing ovation
Anastasia Kucherova, a Russian living in Milan, voiced her opposition to Russia’s war against Ukraine with a highly symbolic, if anonymous, act: carrying the Ukraine team placard during the opening ceremony of the Milan Cortina Winter Games.
Kucherova was swathed in a long, hooded silver puffer coat, her eyes covered with dark glasses – like all the other placard bearers for the 92 nations competing in the Olympics. The Ukraine sign was illuminated for the crowd to read.
At first the country assignments were going to be random, but later the choreographer asked if the volunteers had preferences, and Kucherova chose Ukraine.
Kucherova, an architect who has been living in Milan for 14 years, was unrecognisable, and her nationality was not announced to the public when she led the five Ukrainian athletes competing in Milan into San Siro stadium to resounding cheers.
She first revealed her role to her 879 Instagram followers and then in an interview with reporters.

ALBAWABA - A fire erupted inside a hostel in the Russian capital, leaving at least six people injured on Monday, local media reported.
The flames reportedly spread rapidly across about 80 square metres, RT revealed on Monday. Videos were shared online showing people jumping from the 4th-floor windows in an attempt to save their lives.
Emergency services were called to the fire scene, and after a while, the blaze was brought under control.
Some guests trapped in the fire were seen using bedsheets in an attempt to use them as rope to escape the fire.
According to Russian media, the smoke had filled corridors and rooms, leaving little time for people to escape.
The Russian authorities have opened a probe to determine the cause of the fire inside the hostel in Moscow.

New courthouse offices to review hotline complaints over legal delays

14:52:50 KST

New offices to be set up in courthouses across Türkiye will evaluate complaints submitted through a new judicial hotline aimed at reducing delays in legal proceedings, local media said on Feb. 16.
Under a new regulation, “judicial efficiency offices” will be established in courthouses in all 81 provinces to review requests received via the "Alo Adalet" (Hello Justice) telephone line, according to reports.
Newly appointed Justice Minister Akın Gürlek said in televised remarks on A Haber on Feb. 14 that citizens can submit complaints about delays in legal processes through the hotline instead of the presidential communication center CİMER.
Applications will be examined by the new courthouse-based offices, which are tasked with assessing complaints through internal judicial mechanisms and identifying factors causing delays. Commission chairpersons, chief public prosecutors and judges will coordinate throughout the process, reports said.
Previously introduced by Gürlek as the “zero-delay judicial model,” the initiative will be implemented under the planning of the Council of Judges and Prosecutors (HSK). For delays stemming from issues outside the judiciary, the Justice Ministry may provide additional personnel and physical resources.
The media said this model aims not only to track the number of cases but also to eliminate structural and organizational causes of delays. Particular attention will be given to delays in obtaining expert opinions and forensic medical reports.

Moscow, Kiev set for Geneva peace talks amid Russian attacks

Russian and Ukrainian delegations are set for another round of talks on Tuesday in Geneva as part of the latest fraught push by the United States to end the four-year war.
U.S. President Donald Trump is seeking to position himself as peacemaker of the conflict unleashed when Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, but two previous rounds of talks mediated by the White House have yielded no breakthroughs.
"Ukraine better come to the table, fast," Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One while en route to Washington.
Ukraine says Russia is unwilling to compromise on its sweeping territorial and political demands, and wants to keep fighting.
"Even on the eve of the trilateral meetings in Geneva, the Russian army has no orders other than to continue striking Ukraine. This speaks volumes about how Russia regards the partners' diplomatic efforts," Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky posted on social media Monday.
"Only with sufficient pressure on Russia and clear security guarantees for Ukraine can this war realistically be brought to an end," he added.
The talks, which the Kremlin said will be held behind closed doors and with no media present, comes after two earlier rounds held this year in Abu Dhabi.
Sticking points
The war has spiralled into Europe's deadliest conflict since World War II, with hundreds of thousands killed, millions forced to flee their homes in Ukraine and much of the eastern and southern part of the country scarred by war.
Russia occupies around one-fifth of Ukraine -- including the Crimean peninsula it seized in 2014 -- and areas that Moscow-backed separatists had taken prior to the 2022 invasion.
It wants Ukrainian troops to withdraw from swathes of heavily fortified and strategic territory as part of any peace deal.
Kiev has rejected this deeply unpopular demand, which would be politically and militarily fraught, and has instead demanded robust security guarantees from the west before agreeing to any proposals with Russia.
Ukraine has recently made significant battlefield gains, recapturing 201 square kilometres (78 square miles) last week, according to an AFP analysis of data from the Institute for the Study of War (ISW).
The counterattacks likely leveraged Russian forces' lack of access to Starlink, which has disrupted communications, the ISW said.
The territorial gain is concentrated mainly around 80 kilometres east of the city of Zaporizhzhia, an area where Russian troops have otherwise made significant progress since last summer.
The centrally located region hosts Europe's largest nuclear power plant, which Russia currently controls -- another sticking point in negotiations.
For the talks in Geneva, the Kremlin has reinstated nationalist hawk and former culture minister Vladimir Medinsky as its lead negotiator.
"This time, we plan to discuss a broader set of issues, focusing on key ones related to the territories and other demands," a spokesperson for Vladimir Putin told reporters, including AFP, explaining the personnel change.
Kiev's team will be led by former defence minister Rustem Umerov, while the White House is expected to dispatch Special Envoy Steve Witkoff and businessman and Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner.

Nearly half of all Queensland doctors at risk of burnout, survey finds

Nearly half of all Queensland doctors at risk of burnout, survey finds
Nearly half of the state’s publicly employed doctors are at risk of burnout, a Queensland Health survey has found, with those in remote and regional areas facing greater workplace challenges.
More than 2000 doctors from across Queensland took part in the Medical Workforce Wellbeing Survey last year.
Of the clinicians surveyed, 49 per cent met the threshold of burnout, driven by workforce shortages, increased workload and greater demand for services.
Staff in regional and remote areas were at higher risk of burnout compared to those in metropolitan areas.
Burnout is defined as a state of complete mental, physical and emotional exhaustion, and is often the result of prolonged levels of stress and pressure.
Australian Medical Association President Dr Nick Yim said many clinicians go through burnout, recover and return to work, but many others change their roles or leave the industry entirely.
“It is deeply concerning that nearly half of the Queensland Health workforce is burning out,” Yim said.
“This is something that we need to address. We need to keep our greatest and brightest [doctors] in our state.”
Yim said the issue was worsening and more had to be done to prevent it.
“We need to work with Queensland Health to increase that culture within the healthcare system to ensure that we are looking after [doctors] … that includes investment into things like housing, and also lifestyle measures.”
Queensland Chief Medical Officer Dr Catherine McDougall said the problem was not unique to Queensland, and was faced by health systems across the globe.
“System-level reform combined with targeted local initiatives are needed to address the survey results, but it is important these are introduced with extensive engagement and collaboration with staff,” McDougall said.
The survey showed workload was the key metric that most negatively impacted doctors’ wellbeing, followed by organisational processes, resources, culture, support, supervision and professional development.
Doctors suggested changes including increased staffing, flexible work arrangements, and improved access to leave and relief cover.
Queensland Health’s workforce gap analysis, released in November, showed Queensland will be short nearly 6000 doctors by 2032.
Speaking at a keynote on Tuesday, Health Minister Tim Nicholls said the survey findings were “not acceptable” and promised further details on a fix for workforce shortages later this year.
The Crisafulli government previously pledged 46,000 additional healthcare workers, including doctors, nurses and paramedics, by 2032, but was yet to say how it will achieve such figures.
“Our aim, put simply, is to build the hospitals and to fill them with the clinicians they need. Build and fill,” Nicholls said.
“I have two major goals: releasing and implementing a system-wide workforce rescue plan ... [and giving] clinicians a meaningful voice in hospital decision-making.
“Having a workforce with a bigger say in how their hospitals are run is a core priority of our government.”

Old faces return: Opposition leader Angus Taylor unveils fresh shadow ministry

Just days after winning the Liberal leadership, Angus Taylor has unveiled the frontbench team he's hoping will win the Coalition government at the next election.
He's tasked one of the key roles around managing the economy to Victorian MP Tim Wilson — who narrowly won his seat of Goldstein in a tight contest against independent Zoe Daniel in last May's federal election. Wilson will take on the key treasury portfolio.
Wilson said he wanted to bring back "economic hope" on a pathway forward for struggling Australians.
"The pathway forward for achieving economic hope in Australia is a change of government and the end of the Albanese government. We are going to deliver that," he said.
His deputy Jane Hume, with whom he assumed the leadership last week after toppling Sussan Ley, takes on employment and industrial relations.
Taylor has also rewarded conservative allies, bringing back Sarah Henderson, Jacinta Nampijinpa Price and Andrew Hastie to the frontbench.
Price has been promoted to small business spokesperson, while Western Australian MP Hastie will return to the shadow cabinet as industry spokesperson. Henderson takes on the communications portfolio.
Senator James Paterson's portfolio will shift from finance to defence.
"Today marks a fresh beginning; an opportunity to put the past behind us and to remember that our historic strength comes through unity," Taylor told reporters in Sydney on Tuesday.
New entrants include Aaron Violi in science, technology and the digital economy, Simon Kennedy as assistant to the Opposition leader and assistant finance minister, and Garth Hamilton as assistant energy minister.
Others who'll remain in the shadow cabinet include Michaelia Cash as legal affairs spokesperson and Jonathon Duniam as Home Affairs spokesperson.
The Nationals members of the Coalition will continue in their previous roles. They have been reappointed following the Liberal and National parties' reunification earlier this month.
But some of former Opposition leader Ley's backers, including Paul Scarr, Alex Hawke, Melissa Price and Maria Kovacic were left out of the shadow ministry.
Taylor thanked the colleagues leaving the frontbench.
"We're fortunate to have real depth of talent in our party room, and I'm committed to drawing on all of it," he said.

Anadolu’s recap of top stories from around the globe
ISTANBUL
Here’s a rundown of all the news you need to start your Tuesday, including President Donald Trump saying he will be involved "indirectly" in nuclear talks between the US and Iran that will be held in Geneva on Tuesday, UN chief condemning Israel’s plan to register West Bank land as state property, and Israeli drone strike killing four targeting vehicle along Lebanese-Syrian border.
TOP STORIES
- Trump says he will be involved 'indirectly' in US talks with Iran
President Donald Trump said he will be involved "indirectly" in nuclear talks between the US and Iran that will be held in Geneva on Tuesday.
"I'll be involved in those talks indirectly, and they'll be very important," Trump told reporters Monday en route to Washington when asked what he is expecting from the second round of the indirect nuclear negotiations.
"We'll see what can happen," he added. Under the announced schedule, the talks are set to begin Tuesday morning under Omani mediation and will be hosted at the Embassy of Oman in the Swiss city.
Trump said Iran is "a very tough" negotiator.
"But I would say they are bad negotiators, as we could have had a deal instead of sending out B-2s to knock out their nuclear potential. We had to send the B-2s. I hope they are going to be more reasonable," he added, referring to the US stealth bombers that carried out the bombings on Iranian nuclear facilities during an escalation of the Iran-Israel conflict in June 2025.
- UN chief condemns Israel’s plan to register West Bank land as state property
UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Monday condemned Israel's decision to classify areas of the occupied West Bank as “state property.”
"The secretary-general condemns the Israeli government’s Feb. 15 decision to resume land registration procedures in Area C of the occupied West Bank, following a Cabinet decision in May 2025," said Guterres' spokesperson Stephane Dujarric during a news conference.
He warned that the move could dispossess Palestinians of their property and expand Israeli control over land in the area.
"Such measures, including Israel’s continued presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, are not only destabilizing but, as recalled by the International Court of Justice, unlawful," Dujarric said.
The statement came a day after the Israeli government approved a proposal to register Palestinian land in the West Bank as "state property."
- 4 killed in Israeli drone strike targeting vehicle along Lebanese-Syrian border
Four people were killed Sunday evening in an Israeli drone strike targeting a vehicle in the eastern Lebanese town of Majdal Anjar near the Lebanese-Syrian border despite a ceasefire, Lebanon’s official National News Agency reported.
The agency said an Israeli drone struck a car between the al-Masnaa border crossing and the village of Jdeidet Yabous, along the Lebanon-Syria border, resulting in fatalities and an unidentified number of injuries.
The sound of four strong explosions was reported heard in nearby villages, the agency added.
The Israeli military said in a statement that it carried out a strike against members of the Islamic Jihad Movement in the Majdal Anjar area of Lebanon. There was no comment from the group on the incident. The attacks come amid repeated Israeli violations of a ceasefire agreement reached in November 2024.

Iran, United States set for new talks in Geneva

President Donald Trump warned Iran of potential consequences should it fail to strike a deal with the United States, as negotiators prepare for the latest round of talks in Geneva on Tuesday.
Mediated by Oman, the recently resumed discussions are aimed at averting the possibility of U.S. military action, with Tehran expressing cautious optimism at Washington's "more realistic" position on its nuclear programme.
Trump has repeatedly threatened to intervene militarily against Iran, first over a deadly crackdown on protesters last month and then more recently over its nuclear programme.
"I don't think they want the consequences of not making a deal," he told reporters aboard Air Force One ahead of the talks.
A previous attempt at diplomacy collapsed when Israel launched surprise strikes on Iran in June, beginning a 12-day war that Washington briefly joined to bomb Iranian nuclear sites.
"A cautious assessment is that, from the discussions that have taken place in Muscat to date, at least what we have been told is that the U.S. position on the Iranian nuclear issue has moved towards a more realistic one," foreign ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baqaei said Monday, according to the official IRNA news agency.
According to Tehran, Tuesday's talks in Switzerland will also be mediated by Oman.
Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi met with his Omani counterpart Badr Albusaidi in Geneva on Monday to discuss his country's position "regarding nuclear issues and sanctions relief".
He also stressed Tehran's "seriousness in using result-oriented diplomacy to secure the legitimate interests and rights of the Iranian people" and preserve peace in the region, according to a ministry statement.
Iran has insisted that the discussions be limited to the nuclear issue, though Washington has previously pushed for other topics to be discussed, including its ballistic missiles and support for armed groups in the region.
War games
Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, the ideological arm of the military, began a series of war games on Monday in the Strait of Hormuz to prepare for "potential security and military threats", Iranian state TV said.
Iranian politicians have repeatedly threatened to block the strait, a strategic route for oil and liquified natural gas, as both sides ramp up pressure with talks set to resume.
U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters on Monday: "We're hopeful there's a deal."
"The president always prefers peaceful outcomes and negotiated outcomes to things."
Araghchi, meanwhile, said on X that he too had come to "Geneva with real ideas to achieve a fair and equitable deal", but added there would be no "submission before threats".
The foreign minister also said he was meeting in Geneva with the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Grossi, "for deep technical discussion".
The West fears the programme is aimed at making a bomb, which Tehran denies.
Regime change?
Washington has dispatched Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, the White House confirmed on Sunday.
On Friday, Trump said a change of government in Iran would be the "best thing that could happen", as he sent a second aircraft carrier to the Middle East to ratchet up military pressure.
The first carrier dispatched to the region, the USS Abraham Lincoln, was positioned about 700 kilometres (435 miles) from the Iranian coast as of Sunday, new satellite images showed.
Iran's deputy foreign minister Majid Takht-Ravanchi told the BBC that Tehran would consider compromises on its uranium stockpile if Washington lifted sanctions that have crippled the country's economy.
"If we see the sincerity on their (American) part, I am sure we will be on a road to have an agreement," he said.

'Bring the money or die': man kidnapped, tortured with heated iron rod in northern Israel over debt

A 25-year-old man from the northern Arab town of Daburiyya was indicted Tuesday on charges of kidnapping and severely abusing a man for hours over a debt.
According to the indictment filed by the Northern District Prosecutor’s Office in the Nazareth District Court, the suspect abducted the victim earlier this month and took him to a cabin near Afula, where he and an accomplice allegedly beat and burned him with a heated iron rod.
The case began on Dec. 12, when a northern resident called the police emergency hotline to report her husband missing. She said she had received a message from him stating that he had been kidnapped and was being held in a wooden structure, and asking her to alert authorities.
Officers who arrived at the location found the man bruised across his body and suffering from burns in multiple places. He said his captors had fled after noticing officers approaching.
Investigators said the victim had been at a pizzeria in Afula hours earlier when the suspect and others, to whom he allegedly owed money, asked him to get into a vehicle to talk. The victim said he refused and expressed fear, but once inside the car he was attacked.
“Where are you going? Running from me? I caught you, now I’ll show you. We’ll get there and talk,” the suspect allegedly told him, according to the indictment.
The men then drove to a cabin in the area, where the suspect and his accomplice allegedly beat the victim repeatedly. At one point, the suspect heated an iron rod in a fireplace and told the victim, “I’m heating the rod. Start thinking how to settle this now.”
The attackers pressed the heated rod against the victim’s body, causing burns, according to the indictment. Later that evening, the suspect allegedly pressed an object resembling a handgun to the victim’s head and said, “What do you prefer, bring the money or die now?”
The assault continued through the night until the attackers left the victim with another man assigned to guard him. The victim asked the guard for his phone, saying he only wanted to scroll through it. After receiving the device, he managed to send his location to his wife, who alerted Northern District officers.
Following a manhunt lasting several weeks, authorities arrested one of the suspects on Jan. 25. He was indicted on charges of kidnapping for extortion, extortion by threats, extortion by force, aggravated assault and unlawful imprisonment. The search for the second suspect is ongoing.

Media regulator urges Saeima to terminate operations of Russian-language radio stations in Latvia
According to Delfi, NEPLP Chair Ivars Abolins stated that Latvia should not finance the activities of private Russian-language radio stations.
He argued that Latvia is effectively funding such stations because they use state-owned frequencies free of charge, which are public property and the most valuable part of their business.
Abolins also recalled that more than a month has passed since NEPLP submitted a proposal to the Human Rights and Public Affairs Committee of the Saeima to gradually phase out Russian-language radio stations over an eight-year period. He criticized the head of the committee, Leila Rasima, for not including the issue on the agenda.
The head of the regulator urged lawmakers to "approach this issue from a state-minded position" and support the ban by stopping the use of public resources to fund Russian-language radio broadcasting.
"Latvia has transitioned to state-funded education exclusively in the Latvian language, and there are no arguments for valuable state resources to be spent on supporting a Russian-language information space in the commercial radio environment," Abolins emphasized.
As Ukrinform previously reported, television channels in Kyrgyzstan must increase the share of Kyrgyz-language broadcasting to 60%, as required by law.

Land concessions in focus at high-stakes Russia-Ukraine peace talks in Geneva

Representatives of Ukraine and Russia will meet in Geneva on Tuesday and Wednesday for a fresh round of US-mediated peace talks that the Kremlin says are likely to focus on land, the main sticking point.
US President Donald Trump is pressing Moscow and Kiev to reach a deal to end Europe's biggest war since 1945, though Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has complained that his country is facing the greatest pressure to make concessions.
Russia is demanding that Ukraine cede the remaining 20 percent of the eastern region of Donetsk that Moscow has failed to capture — something Kiev refuses to do.
"This time, the idea is to discuss a broader range of issues, including, in fact, the main ones. The main issues concern both the territories and everything else related to the demands we have put forward," Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Monday.
The venue has switched to the Swiss lakeside city after Abu Dhabi hosted two rounds of talks that both sides described as constructive but which failed to reach any major breakthrough.
The Geneva round comes just days before the fourth anniversary, on February 24, of the start of the Russia-Ukraine war. Tens of thousands of people have been killed, millions have fled their homes, and many Ukrainian cities, towns and villages have been devastated by the conflict.
Russia occupies about 20 percent of Ukraine's national territory, including Crimea and parts of the eastern Donbas region seized before 2022. Its recent air strikes on energy infrastructure have left hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians without heating and power during the course of a harsh winter.
Hopes are low for any significant advance
The Kremlin said the Russian delegation would be led by Vladimir Medinsky, an aide to President Vladimir Putin.
However, the fact that Ukrainian negotiators have accused Medinsky in the past of lecturing them about history as an excuse for Russia's invasion has further lowered expectations for any significant breakthrough in Geneva.
Military intelligence chief Igor Kostyukov will also take part in the talks while Putin's special envoy Kirill Dmitriev will be part of a separate working group on economic issues.
Speaking at the annual Munich Security Conference on Saturday, Zelenskyy said he hoped the Geneva talks would prove "serious, substantive... but honestly sometimes it feels like the sides are talking about completely different things".
Kiev's delegation will be led by Rustem Umerov, the secretary of Ukraine's national security and defence council, and Zelenskyy's chief of staff Kyrylo Budanov. Senior presidential aide Serhiy Kyslytsya will also be present.
Before the delegation left for Geneva, Umerov said Ukraine's goal of "a sustainable and lasting peace" remained unchanged.
As well as land, Russia and Ukraine also remain far apart on issues such as who should control the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant and the possible role of Western troops in postwar Ukraine.
US envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner will represent the Trump administration at the talks, a source told Reuters.
They are also attending talks in Geneva this week with Iran.

Festive buzz in Hong Kong as visitors pour in for Lunar New Year
‘I always come to Hong Kong with my husband, so this time I brought the whole family to spend the holiday here and show them around for the first time,’ visitor Ruby Luo says
Crowds filled Hong Kong’s airport and a major cross-border rail terminal on the first day of the Lunar New Year, with many visitors saying they chose to spend the holiday in the city to enjoy its festive spirit, food and mild weather.
According to the latest Immigration Department data, more than 1.7 million Hongkongers made outbound trips from February 13 to 16, up from 1.47 million in the January 25–28 period last year. They include about 320,000 residents who left the city on Monday.
Over the same period, 663,139 visitors arrived in the city, with more than 530,000 coming from mainland China.
The total number of visitors rose by 5 per cent compared with last year, while the number of mainland travellers grew by 7.1 per cent from 498,967 in 2025.
On Lunar New Year’s Eve, the city welcomed 111,757 visitors, more than 84,000 of whom were from the mainland.
The West Kowloon high-speed rail terminus was packed with travellers in bright, colourful attire on Tuesday morning, with many passengers arriving in large groups.

Guatemala ends state of emergency as gang crackdown cuts crime

Guatemala ended a state of emergency declared a month ago after several armed attacks by the Barrio 18 gang that left 11 police officers dead, and is now preparing for a new security deployment in the capital.
President Bernardo Arevalo on Monday ordered the measure, which allowed arrests without a warrant, after gang-affiliated inmates took hostages at three prisons while a wave of violence was unleashed across the capital.
Barrio 18 has been declared a "terrorist organisation" by Guatemala and the United States.
Arevalo announced on Sunday night that a less restrictive "state of prevention" would come into effect on Tuesday, with police and soldiers deployed in Guatemala City and its surrounding municipalities.
"Our government will continue working so that we can walk our streets and neighbourhoods with greater peace of mind," the president said as he lifted the state of emergency.
Asserting that the measure had achieved "resounding" results, Arevalo said that 83 "highly dangerous" gang members were arrested, extortion fell by 33 percent, and homicides by 49 percent, compared to the same period last year.
According to the president, gang activity had been controlled by cutting off communication systems that allowed prisoners to contact the outside world.
On the streets, however, there was some doubt about whether the violence would end.
Tutor Mariela Raxon, 40, lamented that Guatemala was implementing "weak measures disguised as big decisions" without attacking the "root" causes of problems such as poverty.
Under the so-called "Sentinel Plan," police and soldiers will conduct joint patrols in metropolitan areas "with high rates of extortion and assault" and in surrounding municipalities, the defence ministry said in a statement.
Guatemala's homicide rate in 2025 was 16.1 per 100,000 inhabitants, more than double the global average.
Since mid-2025, gang members have staged uprisings at prisons to demand their leaders be held in less restrictive conditions.
The violence a month ago, however, was an escalation, with Arevalo attributing it to an alleged plot to destabilise his government.

Malaysia and Japan plan major cross-border carbon capture project, despite climate benefit doubts
Japan wants to ship carbon emissions to Malaysia in a first-of-its-kind project in Southeast Asia for carbon capture and storage

Japan wants to ship carbon emissions to Malaysia in a first-of-its-kind project in Southeast Asia for carbon capture and storage, a widely debated process that critics say is more symbolic than effective in curbing climate change.
Despite such doubts, Malaysia is positioning itself as Southeast Asia's hub for the alternative technology, a three-step process that captures, transports and buries carbon dioxide which contributes to climate change. With about 81% of Malaysia's electricity generated from fossil fuels, climate activists say carbon capture is an expensive distraction from proven emissions-reducing actions such as transitioning to renewable energy.
Japan, one of the world's top carbon emitters, plans to ship emissions from its heavily polluting industries –– spanning electric power, oil refining, cement, shipping and steel –– to Malaysia within the next few years. If the project succeeds, experts say it may blaze a path for other Southeast Asian nations with carbon storage potential, like Indonesia and Thailand.
Detractors say it will slow progress of already off-track global efforts to curb emissions.
The plan “dangerously shifts the burden of climate change onto Malaysia rather than onto Japan," said Rachel Kennerley, a carbon capture specialist with the Washington-based Center for International Environmental Law.
Doubts about carbon capture
The debated process starts with capturing emissions directly from a polluting source, like a refinery or power station. This can be done in different ways, such as retrofitting a facility to emit directly into a storage location or by building vacuumlike structures to suck up emissions.
While Japan and Malaysia have yet to share detailed plans, the carbon dioxide will likely then need to be separated from the other captured gasses emitted during industrial processes.
The carbon will then be liquefied and later transported in specially designed ships to burial sites, likely in depleted gas fields off the coast of the Malaysian state of Sarawak on the island of Borneo.
After the liquefied carbon is injected into the ground the site will have to be monitored for leaks.
Some governments and fossil fuel giants like Exxon Mobil and Shell promote the strategy as a climate solution that buys time for countries and industries to transition to cleaner energy.
The European Union’s first offshore carbon storage facility, taking emissions from Denmark and injecting them into the seabed below the North Sea, is due to start operating by mid-2026. A Norwegian facility launched last year is testing cross-border carbon shipments.
There is “an almost fantastical theoretical uptick” in carbon capture interest, said Grant Hauber, with the U.S.-based Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. He said it “offers a tantalizing promise that just won’t deliver.”
While the International Energy Agency considers carbon capture, utilization and storage a tool for curbing climate change, the IEA's latest Net Zero Emissions scenario forecasts it will contribute less than 5% of emission reductions by 2050.
Malaysia pushes for carbon capture
Malaysia passed a bill last year promoting the carbon capture industry. Without providing details, the Ministry of Economy, which declined to comment, projected the fledgling sector could add up to $250 billion to the economy within 30 years.
Malaysia’s state-owned oil and gas company, Petronas, is leading the $1.1 billion construction of what will be world’s largest offshore carbon storage facility, slated to begin operations by the end of the decade. Petronas declined to comment.
Rather than investing in proven decarbonization actions, like solar energy rollouts or grid development, Eqram Mustaqeem, who campaigned against carbon capture in Malaysia, said “we're spending high amounts of money on a technology that is under-delivering and unproven."
Japan pilots cross-border project
Fossil fuels generate the lion’s share of energy in Japan, which is among the world's top five highest carbon emitters.
Japan is investing in nine carbon storage sites, three of them in Malaysia, to try to cut its net emissions. It estimates that by 2030, the sites will store 20 million tons of carbon annually, roughly 2% of Japan's yearly emissions.
Malaysia will likely be paid an undetermined amount per ton of emissions stored. Japan could then subtract those emissions from its total carbon output.
Officials from Japan's state agencies leading the project, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry and the Japan Organization for Metals and Energy Security, or JOGMEC, did not respond to requests for comment.
Government documents show a range of Japanese companies intend to ship emissions to Malaysia.
Carbon capture or ‘climate colonialism’
Ayumi Fukakusa, of the advocacy group, Friends of the Earth Japan, called the idea of exporting emissions to other countries “carbon colonialism.”
Apart from the doubts about the effectiveness of carbon capture, critics also object to the idea of managing emissions rather than reducing them.
“Japan gets to keep polluting and driving climate change, while claiming to ‘clean up’ its emissions by shipping the carbon to Malaysia," said Kennerley of the Center for International Environmental Law. She said that will make Malaysia “a carbon dumping ground for industrial pollution” and detract from climate action.

Family in Avanos keeps centuries-old pottery tradition alive

The Yorgun family, residing in the tourism hotspot of Nevşehir’s Avanos district, has been continuing the ancestral craft of pottery for centuries.
Processing alluvial soil sourced from former beds of the Kızılırmak River, family members create handmade products using traditional methods learned from their fathers and grandfathers.
Earning their livelihood by shaping clay for years, the family also contributes to keeping the cultural heritage alive by passing the craft on to future generations.
Mümtaz Yorgun, 58, who works in the workshop inherited from his grandfather, told state-run Anadolu Agency that they take pride in practicing an art passed down through centuries.
“Pottery is both a profession and a cultural legacy for us. I have been doing this since I was seven. I learned it from my grandfather. I left school and came to the workshop. I taught my nephew, my son and the neighbor’s children. We collect the soil from areas about five kilometers outside Avanos, sift it and knead it like dough. In the past, we used to make water jugs and cheese pots. Now we produce whatever is in demand,” he said.
Yıldıray Yorgun, 55, said he has been shaping clay in the workshop since childhood and has worked as a master craftsman for 35 years.
He underlined that interest in handmade products is vital for preserving traditional arts.
Gökhan Özgül, 52, said all masters in the workshop are involved in every stage of production and continue their profession collectively.
Noting that earthenware used in kitchens has recently regained popularity, he said the family has focused production in that direction.
“We, as nephews, cousins, myself and our children, represent the fifth generation. After us, our nephews and children will carry it on. Our roots go back 500 years. We continue to produce pottery. The foundation of this craft is the region’s unique soil. Currently, we make clay pots for kebabs for restaurants. We produce jars, casseroles and various items according to demand. It is a good profession for the future, but since it is difficult to learn, there is not much interest,” he said.

‘Adopt a Statue’ program restores centuries-old marbles

A 15th-century statue that once stood outside Milan’s iconic Duomo has found a new home.
The Bearded Saint with Book was recently restored under the “Adopt a Statue” program, launched in 2020 by the centuries-old institution that oversees the cathedral’s conservation. As of Feb. 13, it is on display at Piazzale Cadorna, behind a glass window at the headquarters of FNM, a Lombardy-based transport company.
The program recruits donors — either companies or individuals — to fund restoration of a statue under a loan agreement that allows it to occasionally be displayed outside the Duomo.
“The uniqueness of this project is that statues that would otherwise remain in our deposits are restored and brought back to their original beauty,” the program’s project manager, Elisa Mantia, said in an interview with The Associated Press. “In that way, they can continue to tell the story of the Duomo even in places that are far from the monument.”
These agreements are in some cases granted for an initial one-year term and may be renewed. The initiative follows previous fundraising campaigns in which donors could adopt gargoyles or spires in exchange for inclusion in the Duomo’s donor register, where contributors’ names are recorded as part of the cathedral’s long history of support.
From storage to public display
The construction of the Duomo began in 1386, under the rule of Gian Galeazzo Visconti, then lord of Milan, in collaboration with the city’s archbishop. The cathedral was built on the site of two preexisting basilicas and its completion took more than five centuries. One of its bronze doors was not installed until 1965.
Because construction spanned centuries, the Duomo’s statues were carved by artists from different regions and periods, resulting in a monument that reads as a timeline of evolving artistic styles.
The Veneranda Fabbrica del Duomo, which oversees the cathedral’s conservation, has sought funding to restore statues removed over the centuries for maintenance or safety reasons.
“Culture can save the world,” Andrea Gibelli, president of FNM, said during a press conference on Feb. 13 to mark the unveiling of Bearded Saint with Book. “We want to spread the cultural riches we are fortunate to have, which are often overlooked or not fully appreciated."
Other sculptures adopted under the program by different sponsors have included a 16th-century David, a depiction of Samson and the Lion, and a statue of Saint Matthew the Apostle.
While the number of adopted statues isn't disclosed and not all are displayed in public spaces, Mantia said that her institution has preselected around 30 sculptures as eligible for restoration. Each case must be authorized by Italy’s cultural heritage authorities, as the process involves a formal loan agreement subject to conservation, insurance and transport regulations.
“We usually select them because they are very beautiful and not so damaged that they would be unsafe to loan,” Mantia said.
Once a donor reaches out, experts like Mantia accompany them to the Duomo’s storage facilities to choose a sculpture. After it is selected, restoration typically takes between one and three months.
Centuries-old marble
Bearded Saint with a Book was originally displayed outdoors. Aside from a black crust from air pollution on its surface, it had no structural damages preventing its loan.
“This often involves only surface finishing or an intervention with compresses or mechanical cleaning,” Mantia said.
The marble used for both the statues and the Duomo itself comes from the quarries of Candoglia in Italy’s Piedmont region. The same stone has been used since the late 14th century, under the supervision of the Veneranda Fabbrica del Duomo.
“Beyond being the symbol of Milan, the Duomo is also a symbol of its history,” Mantia said. “It is a monument that grew together with the city, that tells within itself, in its statues and in the style with which it is decorated, the entire history of the city.”

A man has been killed, and two people were critically injured in a stabbing attack along a busy shopping strip in western Sydney in Australia’s New South Wales (NSW) state, local media reported.
The attack occurred in the suburb of Merrylands on Merrylands Road, a busy commercial strip, where emergency services were called after reports that a man had stabbed several people before fleeing the scene on foot, according to ABC News on Tuesday.
A man believed to be in his 30s or 40s died at the scene despite emergency efforts.
A 22-year-old man and a 47-year-old woman were rushed to the hospital in critical condition, authorities said.
Police confirmed that two of the stabbings took place inside a business premises, while a third occurred on the footpath outside.
Police arrested a man behind a nearby house on Smythe Street, and he was taken to Granville Police Station.
"The alleged offender is known to police for petty crime and a number of mental health incidents," said NSW Police Superintendent Simon Glasser.
A crime scene has been established as police continue investigations into the motive behind the attack.

Ancient assembly building to be restored

A new phase has begun for the protection and restoration of a 2,200-year-old public assembly building, known as the Bouleuterion, unearthed after 11 years of excavations at the Aigai Ancient City in the Yunusemre district of Manisa.
Professor Yusuf Sezgin, head of the Aigai excavations, said they plan to begin restoration work on the Bouleuterion during this year’s excavation season, describing it as one of the best-preserved assembly structures surviving from antiquity.
Excavations for 2025 are ongoing at the 2,700-year-old ancient city, one of the 12 Aeolian cities established in western Anatolia, located within the borders of Yuntdağıköseler neighborhood in Yunusemre. Work on the Bouleuterion, one of the most significant structures of the ancient city, has been completed.
With a capacity of around 200 people and built in the mid-second century B.C., the structure ranks among the best-preserved assembly buildings to have survived from ancient times.
Sezgin noted that excavations first began in 2004 in the area where the assembly building stands today.
“This was where the first excavation started. At that time, it was not even known that this was an assembly building. The area was completely covered with shrubs, brush and piles of stones. Over the last period, we worked for a total of 11 years and fully uncovered the public assembly building,” he said.
Noting that Aigai functioned as a polis, or city-state, in antiquity, Sezgin said political decisions were once made at the site.
“Today we are on the summit of Yunt Mountain in a rural landscape, but in antiquity, there was an assembly here where political decisions were taken. Around 2,200 years ago, the people of Aigai made decisions about their city in this building. This system reflects a governance model close to direct democracy,” he said.
Sezgin also highlighted that artifacts related to the goddess Hestia and honorary statues belonging to the family that commissioned the building were uncovered during the excavations.
“This structure is extremely important not only architecturally but also because of the finds it contains. An assembly building preserved to this extent is very rare in western Anatolia,” he said.
Conservation and restoration phase
Following the completion of excavations, the project has moved into its second phase.
“In archaeology, excavation is followed by conservation and restoration. We are currently preparing our projects for this stage. After receiving the necessary approvals from the relevant boards, we plan to begin conservation and restoration work on the assembly building in 2026,” Sezgin said.
The goal is to protect the structure with a roof and recreate its interior using replica statues, allowing visitors to understand how a public assembly functioned in antiquity.
“It is a great opportunity to demonstrate this with such a well-preserved example,” he added.
Sezgin stated that the first phase of restoration is expected to be completed in approximately one year and that sponsorship support will be sought once the total project cost is finalized.
He also noted that the challenging geography of Aigai has worked to its advantage.
“Because the city is far from large and modern settlements, it has not suffered serious destruction. Nearly 80 percent of the assembly building remains in its original state. The seating rows and architectural elements can be restored with minor interventions. This makes the structure extremely valuable in terms of antiquity,” he said.

Trump ups pressure on Kyiv as Russia, Ukraine hold peace talks in Geneva
Kremlin says the talks are likely to focus on the issue of Ukrainian territory that Russian wants Kyiv to cede.
Delegations from Russia and Ukraine are set to meet for another round of peace talks in Geneva, as United States President Donald Trump pushes for an end to Europe’s biggest conflict since World War II.
The two-day talks, which begin on Tuesday, are likely to focus on the issue of territory and come just days before the fourth anniversary, on February 24, of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

Trump is pressing Moscow and Kyiv to reach a deal soon, though Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has complained that his country is facing the greatest pressure from Washington to make concessions.
Russia is demanding that Kyiv cede the remaining 20 percent of the eastern region of Donetsk that Moscow has failed to capture – something Kyiv refuses to do.
Trump again increased the pressure on Ukraine late on Monday.
When asked about the talks on board Air Force One, he described the negotiations as “big” and said, “Ukraine better come to the table, fast.” He did not elaborate further, saying, “That’s all I am telling you.”
The talks, which the Kremlin said will be held behind closed doors and with no media present, come after two earlier rounds held this year in Abu Dhabi. Those talks did not yield a breakthrough.
“This time, the idea is to discuss a broader range of issues, including, in fact, the main ones,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Monday. “The main issues concern both the territories and everything else related to the demands we have put forward,” he said.
Ukraine, meanwhile, said Russia was unwilling to compromise and wants to keep fighting.
“Even on the eve of the trilateral meetings in Geneva, the Russian army has no orders other than to continue striking Ukraine. This speaks volumes about how Russia regards the partners’ diplomatic efforts,” Zelenskyy said in a social media post on Monday.
“Only with sufficient pressure on Russia and clear security guarantees for Ukraine can this war realistically be brought to an end,” he added.
‘Serious’ intentions
The Russia-Ukraine war has spiralled into Europe’s deadliest conflict since 1945, with tens of thousands killed, millions forced to flee their homes and many Ukrainian cities, towns and villages devastated by the fighting.
Russia occupies about one-fifth of Ukraine, including Crimea and parts of the eastern Donbas region seized before the 2022 invasion. It wants Ukrainian troops to withdraw from swaths of heavily fortified and strategic territory as part of any peace deal. Kyiv has rejected the demand, which would be politically and militarily fraught, and has instead demanded robust security guarantees from the West.
The Kremlin said the Russian delegation would be led by Vladimir Medinsky, an aide to President Vladimir Putin.
However, the fact that Ukrainian negotiators have accused Medinsky in the past of lecturing them about history as an excuse for Russia’s invasion has further lowered expectations for any significant breakthrough in Geneva.
Military intelligence chief Igor Kostyukov will also take part in the talks, while Putin’s special envoy Kirill Dmitriev will be part of a separate working group on economic issues.
Vladmir Sotnikov, a political scientist based in Moscow, said the Russian team will consist of about 20 people, many more than delegations in previous rounds of talks.
“I think the Russian intentions are serious. Because you know, the situation here in Russia is that ordinary people are just tired of this war,” he told Al Jazeera.
Kyiv’s delegation will be led by Rustem Umerov, the secretary of Ukraine’s national security and defence council, and Zelenskyy’s chief of staff, Kyrylo Budanov. Senior presidential aide Serhiy Kyslytsya will also be present.
Before the delegation left for Geneva, Umerov said Ukraine’s goal of “a sustainable and lasting peace” remained unchanged.
As well as land, Russia and Ukraine also remain far apart on issues such as who should control the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant and the possible role of Western troops in post-war Ukraine.
US envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner will represent the Trump administration at the talks, according to the Reuters news agency. They are also attending talks in Geneva this week with Iran.

Oil holds steady as markets eye crucial US–Iran talks

Oil prices were steady on Tuesday as investors assessed risks of supply disruption after Iran conducted naval drills near the Strait of Hormuz right ahead of nuclear talks with the US later in the day.
US President Donald Trump said on Monday that he would be involved "indirectly" in the talks in Geneva, adding he believes Tehran wants to make a deal. At the weekend, Trump said that regime change in Iran "would be the best thing that could happen."
Brent crude futures were 0.2 percent lower at $68.59 a barrel by 0106 GMT, following a 1.3 percent gain on Monday.
US West Texas Intermediate crude was at $63.73 a barrel, up 84 cents, or 1.34 percent, but the move included all of Monday's price action as the contract did not have settlement that day due to the US Presidents Day holiday.
Many markets are closed on Tuesday for Lunar New Year holidays, including mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, South Korea and Singapore.
"The market remains unsettled amid ongoing geopolitical uncertainties," Daniel Hynes, an analyst at ANZ, said in a research report.
"Should tensions in the Middle East ease, or meaningful progress be made in the Ukraine situation, the risk premium currently built into oil prices could swiftly unwind. However, any negative outcome or further escalation could prove to be bullish for oil."
Iran began a military drill on Monday in the Strait of Hormuz, a vital international waterway and oil export route from Gulf Arab states, which have been appealing for diplomacy to end the dispute.
Iran, along with fellow OPEC members Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, and Iraq, export most of its crude via the strait, mainly to Asia.
Meanwhile, Citi said if disruptions to Russian supply keep Brent in a $65 to $70 per barrel range in the coming months, OPEC+ is likely to respond by increasing output from spare capacity.
OPEC+ is leaning towards a resumption in oil output increases from April, three OPEC+ sources said, as the group prepares for peak summer demand and price strength is bolstered by tensions over US-Iran relations.
"It is our base case that both Iran and Russia-Ukraine deals happen by or during the summer of this year, contributing to a decline in prices to $60-62/bbl Brent," Citi said.

Chinese tourists shun Japan over lunar new year holiday as rift deepens

Chinese tourists are continuing to shun Japan in large numbers, with the country falling out of the top 10 destinations for those celebrating the lunar new year with a trip abroad.
Japan has had a dramatic drop in the number of Chinese visitors since the end of last year as a diplomatic row between Tokyo and Beijing over the security of Taiwan continues.
Chinese tourism to Japan, where a weak currency is helping fuel a tourism boom, almost halved in December compared with the same period in 2025, Japan’s transport ministry said.
The trend looks set to continue, months after Japan’s prime minister, Sanae Takaichi, suggested her country’s self-defence forces could be deployed if China attempted to invade Taiwan.
China claims the self-governing democracy as part of its own territory and has vowed to unite it with the mainland, by force if necessary.
Takaichi’s remarks led to an angry response in China, where officials urged tourists and students not to travel to Japan.
South Korea is expected to become the most popular overseas destination for Chinese travellers during the 40-day travel frenzy, with an estimated 250,000 expected to visit, up 1.5 times from the previous year.
Japan will welcome fewer people from China than other countries in the region, including Thailand, Singapore, Vietnam and Russia, according to media reports. Instead, the number of Chinese tourists visiting Japan during the lunar new year holidays is expected to fall by up to 60% from the previous year.
The dispute over Taiwan has intensified since Takaichi told MPs in November that military involvement was an option if a crisis in the Taiwan Strait posed an “existential” threat to Japan.
Her refusal to back down has invited more criticism from China, including its foreign minister, Wang Yi, who this week accused Takaichi of trying to revive Japan’s militarist past.
Wang told the Munich Security Conference on Monday: “Japanese people should no longer allow themselves to be manipulated or deceived by those far-right forces, or by those who seek to revive militarism.
“All peace-loving countries should send a clear warning to Japan: if it chooses to walk back on this path, it will only be heading toward self-destruction.”
In response, Japan protested through diplomatic channels, while the foreign ministry in Tokyo condemned Wang’s claims as “factually incorrect and ungrounded”.
“Japan’s efforts to strengthen its defence capabilities are in response to an increasingly severe security environment and are not directed against any specific third country,” the ministry said in a statement.
It said there were “countries in the international community that have been rapidly increasing their military capabilities in a non-transparent manner”, but added that “Japan opposes such moves and distances itself from them”.
Liu Xiaoming, China’s special representative on Korean peninsula affairs, upped the ante when he said Takaichi’s remarks were proof of Japan’s “unextinguished ambition to invade and colonise Taiwan once again, and the lingering ghost of revived militarism”.
In a post on X that referenced Japan’s 1941 surprise attack on Pearl Harbor, Liu added: “The lessons of history are not far away and must be heeded. If Japan refuses to repent and change its ways, it will inevitably repeat the same tragic mistakes.”
Officials in Beijing have repeatedly warned travellers they face threats to their safety in Japan, although there have been no reports of incidents targeting tourists from China.
On Sunday, the Chinese consulate general in Osaka again urged Chinese nationals to refrain from travelling to Japan after a fatal stabbing in the city. The incident, in which a teenager was stabbed to death and two others injured in a popular tourist area, did not involve Chinese nationals.
Not all people have heeded the official travel advice. A Chinese man told the Kyodo news agency it was important to promote goodwill between ordinary people from both countries. Another, a woman from Shanghai, said she still planned to visit Japan with her parents. “The travel alert is aimed at promoting criticism of Japan,” she told Kyodo. “But my family has not been brainwashed.”

Last week, the Ukrainian military fired a record 200 rounds of ammunition in a single day at civilian targets in the Belgorod Region, Rodion Miroshnik, Russian Foreign Ministry Ambassador-at-Large, told TASS, adding that five civilians were killed in the region over the week.
"The Belgorod Region remains the area most frequently targeted by Ukrainian forces. Last week, a record number of munitions were fired at civilian targets in the region from UAVs, artillery, and HIMARS rocket launchers - around 200," he said.
Miroshnik specified that the Belgorod, Shebekinsky, Krasnoyaruzhsky, Valuysky, Volokonovsky, and Grayvoronsky districts were most often targeted by UAV attacks. "Civilians were killed and injured in strikes by Ukrainian drones. Over the week, 52 civilians fell victim to the barbaric strikes by Kiev - five of them were killed. The wounded include a four-year-old girl injured in a rocket attack on the village of Sevryukovo," the agency source said.
Earlier, Miroshnik told TASS that over 20 civilians in Russian regions had been killed in Ukrainian strikes over the past week, with more than 120 people, including six children, wounded.

Authorities in China say they are expecting to see a record 9.5 billion passenger trips, up from 9 billion the previous year, during the 40-day spring festival.
Hundreds of millions of people across Asia began on Tuesday to mark the Lunar New Year with prayers, fireworks and festivities as China ushered in the Year of the Horse, one of 12 animals in the Chinese zodiac, succeeding the Year of the Snake.
The Lunar New Year, which coincides with the lunar calendar's first new moon, is a 15-day celebration that takes place annually between 21 January and 20 February, the most important annual holiday in China and some other East Asian nations.
This year's extended Lunar New Year holiday is expected to boost China's economy, raising domestic consumption, a top objective for Beijing this year.
Chinese authorities say they are expecting to see a record 9.5 billion passenger trips, up from 9 billion the previous year, during the 40-day spring festival.
As every year, China celebrated the Lunar New Year with a TV show, and once again the humanoid robots were a central part of the performance Monday night.
One of the highlights of the CCTV Spring Festival gala was a martial arts performance by children and robots. For several minutes, humanoids from Unitree Robotics showed different sequences and even brandished swords.
The performance shows China’s push to develop more advanced robots powered by improved AI capabilities. In Taiwan, the solemn peal of a temple bell rang out 108 times — an auspicious number — as people flocked to the Baoan Temple in Taipei on Tuesday morning.
They lit incense sticks, bowed their heads and left offerings of colorful flower bouquets on outdoor tables on the temple grounds in Taiwan’s capital city.
Celebrations in Hong Kong, Fireworks in Vietnam
With celebrations being held across Asia, incense smoke wafted into the air at a temple in Hong Kong where people line up every year to make wishes for the new year at midnight.
Holding up a cluster of incense sticks, many bowed their heads several times before planting the sticks in containers placed in front of a temple hall.
While entertainers in Vietnam sang at an outdoor countdown event before multiple fireworks shows at several cities in the Southeast Asian nation, where the festival is called Tet.
Light shows lit up bridges and skyscrapers as the fireworks went off, and crowds clapped in rhythm to live pop music performances.
Chinese street fairs in Moscow
People sampled Chinese cuisine from stalls and strolled along snowy streets decorated with red lanterns and dragons as two weeks of events got underway Monday at various venues in the Russian capital.
The third annual Lunar New Year celebration comes at a time of warming relations between China and Russia—ties that have frustrated many European governments because of the war in Ukraine.
Argentines join celebrations in Buenos Aires
To commemorate the Lunar New Year, thousands of Argentineans flocked to Chinatown in Buenos Aires, where they witnessed martial arts exhibitions and dragon and lion dances on the main stage.
The Chinese immigrant community is among Argentina’s most dynamic, accounting for more than 180,000 people in the South American nation.

Israel to try Oct. 7 Hamas terrorists in special military tribunal amid debates over death penalty

Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara said Monday that the Military Advocate General’s Corps will oversee the prosecution of Hamas Nukhba terrorists accused of carrying out the Oct. 7 massacre, instead of the State Attorney’s Office.
The decision comes as legislation regulating the prosecution of the terrorists advances in the Knesset and was approved by the Constitution, Law and Justice Committee for a first reading.
In a statement, Baharav-Miara said the decision was made following a meeting with State Attorney Amit Aisman and Military Advocate General Itay Offir. In light of the bill being promoted in the Knesset and the legislature’s directive that proceedings be conducted in a military court, it was decided the cases would be managed by the Military Advocate General’s prosecution before a special military court to be established for that purpose, she said.
“All relevant authorities will continue to cooperate in handling the case and act to bring the terrorists to justice,” she said.
The bill, initiated by lawmakers Simcha Rothman of the Religious Zionism party and Yulia Malinovsky of Yisrael Beitenu, was approved for a first reading at the end of December after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu gave his backing.
Weeks before the decision, Southern District Attorney Erez Padan said prosecutors overseeing the investigations of more than 300 Nukhba terrorists had completed preparing indictments. He said that over two years authorities worked intensively with police and the Shin Bet security service to advance the prosecution of all those who took part in the massacre and were captured and detained.
“This is an unprecedented investigation in scope, unlike anything seen in Israel and, I believe, in the world,” Padan said. He said suspects were captured in three waves: on Oct. 7, in the days that followed during efforts to clear the area, and during the ground maneuver, which he said is ongoing. Dozens of massacre and destruction scenes were investigated, he added.
How the process will work
The legislation seeks to regulate the prosecution of Hamas terrorists and their accomplices who carried out acts of war, murder, rape, kidnapping and looting from Oct. 7 through Oct. 10, as well as those who committed offenses against hostages afterward.
Under the proposal, indictments will be filed in a special military court established under Defense Regulations. Charges could include genocide, harming the sovereignty or territorial integrity of the state, initiating war, aiding the enemy in wartime, offenses under the Counterterrorism Law and murder.
The court will sit in panels headed by a presiding judge who is a retired district court judge serving as a military officer, alongside two additional members who are officers qualified to be appointed as district court judges with criminal law expertise.
Appeals may be heard before a panel headed by a retired Supreme Court justice, a retired district court president or the president of the Military Court of Appeals, along with two retired district court judges. Decisions will be made by majority vote.
In cases where a death sentence is imposed and no appeal is filed by the defendant, an automatic appeal will be considered as having been submitted.
Unlike other military courts, the chief of staff will not be required to confirm the verdict and will have no authority to intervene in rulings or sentences.
Proceedings will follow the rules of procedure and evidence applied in courts operating under the Courts Law, though the court may deviate from them if it determines, with reasons recorded, that doing so is necessary and does not substantially harm the fairness of the proceedings.
Hearings will be broadcast on a dedicated website unless held behind closed doors or if the court orders otherwise for recorded reasons. All proceedings will be audiovisually documented and preserved in the state archives. Defendants will be entitled to choose qualified defense attorneys from Israel or from the West Bank.
The proposal also calls for establishing a ministerial steering committee to coordinate government preparations for prosecuting participants in the Oct. 7 massacre and to formulate government policy on the matter. The committee would be chaired by Netanyahu and include Justice Minister Yariv Levin, Defense Minister Israel Katz and Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar.

‘It was terrifying’: Australia faces reckoning over brutal police crackdown on pro-Palestine protests
Police in Sydney are being investigated by a state watchdog over their response to protests around Israel president Isaac Herzog’s visit. Namita Singh speaks to witnesses and rights groups about an incident that shocked Australia
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
Rebecca Payne was wearing a fluorescent pink vest – clearly identifying her as a legal observer – as she filmed from the edge of a crowd of Australians protesting the visit of Israeli president Isaac Herzog in Sydney last week.
When she was first hit with pepper-spray and started feeling an immediate burning sensation in her eye, her first thought was that it was an accident. It was only later, when she watched back footage of the incident, that Payne realised a police officer had reached over and pepper-sprayed directly into the packed crowd.
The protest on 9 February would quick grow violent, and the scenes of clashes between demonstrators and police exploded on social media. Many have since accused authorities of using excessive force while officials have accused protesters of being aggressive towards officers and said the police acted with “remarkable restraint”.
Thousands of people had gathered near Sydney Town Hall as Herzog began a four-day state visit focused on commemorating the victims of a December attack at a Jewish festival in Bondi Beach. Fifteen people were killed in Australia’s worst mass shooting in almost three decades.
The protesters accused Herzog of inciting genocide against Palestinians in Gaza. Herzog rejected the accusation and claimed that protests against him were meant to “undermine and delegitimise” Israel’s right to exist.
“Without any warning at all, he suddenly just pepper sprayed a whole bunch of us for absolutely no reason that I could detect,” Payne tells The Independent, referring to the officer. “I felt it go into my right eye and land on my left cheek.”
“I literally could not see a thing,” she says. “I was completely blind. My face was burning. I was really frightened that I was going to get knocked over and trampled.”
Moments later, she says, police charged. Protesters were pushed and punched, people coughed and screamed, and she stumbled forward in tears, clinging to a stranger to avoid falling on her face.
“It was absolutely terrifying,” she says. “My first feeling was shock – that police in Sydney would behave in this way. And then fear.”
It was subsequently revealed that the New South Wales police had used capsicum spray on the protesters, prompting allegations of the use of excessive force and an investigation by the state watchdog.
The rally took place after organisers failed in a last-minute legal bid to overturn a ban on a planned march through the city centre.
It had been declared a “special event”, giving police expanded powers and preventing the protesters from marching.
Payne, who has monitored demonstrations in New South Wales since 2020, had arrived at the rally expecting tension. But she insisted that she didn’t witness violence from demonstrators that would justify what followed.
“I did not see one protester do anything that a police person could reasonably feel threatened by,” she says. “But I saw so many instances of police violence that were completely unprovoked.”
Police said 27 people were arrested, with nine later charged, and that 10 officers were assaulted.
Assistant commissioner Peter McKenna claimed his officers were “threatened, jostled and assaulted” during “a number of melees, rolling fights” and were “significantly outnumbered”.
State police chief Mal Lanyon said that officers showed “remarkable restraint” and “did what they needed to do".
NSW premier Chris Minns said the police had been “put in an impossible situation” that night and urged the public “not to look at a 10-second clip without the full context”. He claimed officers had done “everything possible” to avoid violent confrontations.
Payne disputes the characterisation. “Most of the protest was peaceful,” she says. While there had been tension when police initially prevented people entering the protest area, she did not witness demonstrators acting violently at the time the spray was deployed.
The incident in Sydney has sparked renewed scrutiny over Australian police’s use of pepper spray and other crowd-control methods.
A video from the Sydney protest verified by Human Rights Watch showed officers punching people on the ground, dispersing people kneeling in prayer and spraying protesters from up close. One clip featured a voice shouting “Stop it! Stop it!” as two officers repeatedly struck a restrained protester.
Annabel Hennessy, Australia researcher for the rights group, says they are “particularly concerned about the apparent use of force” at protests against the Israeli president’s visit.
“From our initial analysis of videos and taking statements from witnesses, it does appear that force was used,” she tells The Independent.
She points to international standards governing so-called less-lethal weapons. “Under UN guidance on less lethal weapons in law enforcement, chemical irritants like pepper spray should only be used when a law enforcement official has reason to believe there is an imminent threat of injury. In many of the videos, pepper spray appears to be used on protesters who do not appear to be behaving in a way that is violent,” she says.
According to Hennessy, some of the most troubling accounts of the night came from legal observers who described being sprayed and then immediately charged by officers.
“Pepper spray is a non-discriminatory weapon,” she notes. “It is very concerning when it’s used on a large group of people in such a way, particularly when people describe being sprayed, unable to see, falling over, and then having to seek hospital care afterwards.”
Beyond the immediate injuries, Hennessy warns of a wider democratic impact. “It can have a chilling effect on the right to public assembly when we see this kind of apparent excessive force used against protesters,” she says.
“It can deter others from exercising their right to public assembly and free speech. And that’s really worrying, because the right to public assembly is a cornerstone of democracy.”
Amnesty International Australia welcomed confirmation that the NSW Law Enforcement Conduct Commission would examine the clashes, noting the watchdog had received a significant number of complaints.
“Amnesty International was shocked and horrified by the unnecessary and disproportionate force used by NSW police against First Nations Peoples, Muslims in prayer and members of the public who came together at the Sydney Town Hall protest to demand Herzog be investigated for incitement of genocide,” Mohamed Duar, the organisation’s Occupied Palestinian Territory spokesman, said in a statement. “Law enforcement officials should be protecting people’s right to protest, not violently suppressing peaceful protest and harming those standing up for human rights.”
He described the police’s conduct as “a serious assault on those rights and a deeply troubling display of state-sanctioned violence”.
Pepper spray, also known as OC or capsicum spray, is a chemical irritant derived from capsaicin, the compound that gives chilli peppers their heat. It is generally dispensed as a stream, mist or fog and is intended under the NSW Police’s guidance “for self-defence to assist in the restraint of a subject, or to limit a subject's actions”.
The UN Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms states that law enforcement should apply non-violent means before resorting to force and use only the minimum necessary.
Civil society and legal groups, including the Australian Democracy Network and the Grata Fund, reported an increase in the deployment of pepper spray at protests between 2019 and 2024.
Their research found OC spray was used at 11 protests in 2023–24, compared with seven in the previous five years. In at least five incidents it was allegedly sprayed directly into the faces of the protesters, leaving more than 200 people across 18 protests over five years requiring treatment by street medics after exposure.
While the national data for 2025 is yet to be compiled, figures shared with The Independent by the Australian Democracy Network show police using OC spray at protests on six occasions in Victoria and two in NSW. This includes a 70-year-old being sprayed during a Wollongong march in support of the Palestinian people in October.
The research also recorded 51 incidents of the use of excessive force in restraining protesters from 2019 to 2024, including the use of headlocks, chokeholds, and officers placing knees on people’s heads and necks. Injuries recorded included a perforated eardrum, bruising, soft tissue damage, scarring, a broken arm, and a sprained finger.
The firing of rubber bullets at a protest in Melbourne in September 2024 led to at least 20 people being treated for injuries. Foam baton rounds and pepper spray were also used during clashes at a Land Forces military conference in the city. At other protests, tear gas and flash-bang grenades were deployed, including against people who were reportedly moving away and complying with police directions.
Police horses were ridden into crowds on at least four occasions in NSW and Victoria, according to the research, and four children aged 16 and under were pepper-sprayed.
The watchdog said that it was “in the public interest” to investigate what happened in Sydney, “including incidents of alleged misconduct on the part of NSW police officers against persons attending that location for a protest”.
A spokesperson for the NSW minister for police told the ABC the government would cooperate, adding: “At this time, the most appropriate course of action is to allow the LECC to carry out its functions independently and without interference.”

US and Iran to hold a second round of nuclear talks in Geneva

US and Iran to hold a second round of nuclear talks in Geneva
US and Iran to hold a second round of nuclear talks in Geneva
GENEVA (AP) — The U.S. and Iran are expected to hold their second round of talks about Iran’s nuclear program Tuesday in Geneva as the United States ramps up its military presence in the Middle East and Iran holds large-scale maritime exercises.
U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly threatened to use force to compel Iran to agree to constrain its nuclear program. Iran has said it would respond with an attack of its own. Trump has also threatened Iran over its deadly crackdown on recent nationwide protests.
The first round of talks Feb. 6 were held in Oman, a sultanate on the eastern edge of the Arabian Peninsula, and were indirect, with SUVs flying the American flag entering the palace venue only after it appeared the Iranian officials had left. The arrangements for Tuesday’s round of negotiations were not clear.
Trump’s envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner were traveling for the new round of talks. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, visiting Budapest, Hungary, said Monday that the U.S. hopes to achieve a deal with Iran, despite the difficulties. “I’m not going to prejudge these talks,” Rubio said. “The president always prefers peaceful outcomes and negotiated outcomes to things.”
Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, who is leading the talks for Iran, met with the head of the U.N. nuclear watchdog agency Monday in Geneva.
“I am in Geneva with real ideas to achieve a fair and equitable deal,” Araghchi wrote on X. “What is not on the table: submission before threats.”
Last week, a top Iranian security official traveled to Oman and met with Omani Foreign Minister Badr al-Busaidi, the chief intermediary in the talks, in a meeting likely focused on updates from the first round and next steps.
“Regional peace and security is our priority, and we urge restraint and wise compromise,” al-Busaidi wrote on X after his meeting with Ali Larijani, a former Iranian parliament speaker who now serves as the secretary to the country’s Supreme National Security Council.
Iran has in the past communicated its positions in writing when dealing with the Americans. Famously, Japan’s then-Prime Minister Shinzo Abe tried to hand Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei a letter from Trump in 2019 that he refused to take.
Iran holds naval drills against the US military buildup
Iran announced that its paramilitary Revolutionary Guard started a drill early Monday morning in the Strait of Hormuz, the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman, waterways that are crucial international trade routes through which 20% of the world’s oil passes.
Separately, EOS Risk Group said sailors passing through the region received a radio warning that the northern lane of the Strait of Hormuz, in Iranian territorial waters, likely would see a live-fire drill Tuesday. Iranian state TV did not mention the live-fire drill.
It was Iran’s second warning in recent weeks about a live-fire drill.
Last week, Trump said the USS Gerald R. Ford, the world’s largest aircraft carrier, was being sent from the Caribbean Sea to the Mideast to join other warships and military assets the U.S. has built up in the region.
The Ford, whose new deployment was first reported by The New York Times, will join the USS Abraham Lincoln and its accompanying guided-missile destroyers, which have been in the region for over two weeks. U.S. forces already have shot down an Iranian drone that approached the Lincoln on the same day last week that Iran tried to stop a U.S.-flagged ship in the Strait of Hormuz.
Gulf Arab nations have warned any attack could spiral into another regional conflict in a Mideast still reeling from the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip.
Iran says any deal must include easing of punishing sanctions
The Trump administration is seeking a deal to limit Iran’s nuclear program and ensure it does not develop nuclear weapons. Iran says it is not pursuing weapons and has so far resisted demands that it halt uranium enrichment or hand over its supply of uranium.
Iran’s Deputy Foreign Minister Majid Takht-Ravanchi signaled that Tehran could be open to compromise on the nuclear issue, but is looking for an easing of international sanctions led by the United States.
“The ball is in America’s court. They have to prove they want to have a deal with us,” Takht-Ravanchi told the BBC on Sunday. “If we see a sincerity on their part, I am sure that we will be on a road to have an agreement.”
“We are ready to discuss this and other issues related to our program provided that they are also ready to talk about the sanctions,” he added.
The U.S. and Iran were in the middle of months of meetings when Israel’s launch of a 12-day war against Iran back in June instantly halted the talks. The U.S. bombed Iranian nuclear sites during that war, likely destroying many of the centrifuges that spun uranium to near weapons-grade purity. Israel’s attacks decimated Iran’s air defenses and targeted its ballistic missile arsenal as well.
Iran has insisted its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes. Before the June war, Iran had been enriching uranium up to 60% purity, a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels.

A Greenland sled dog champion fears for his culture as climate change melts the ice

A Greenland sled dog champion fears for his culture as climate change melts the ice
Dog sled culture in northern Greenland is at risk as climate change is causing the ice and snow to melt
- Bookmark
Growing up in a village in northern Greenland, Jørgen Kristensen’s closest friends were his stepfather’s sled dogs. Most of his classmates were dark-haired Inuit; he was different. When he was bullied at school for his fair hair — an inheritance from the mainland Danish father he never knew — the dogs came to him.
He first went out to fish on the ice with them alone when he was 9 years old. They nurtured the beginning of a life-long love affair and Kristensen’s career as a five-time Greenlandic dog sled champion.
“I was just a small child. But many years later, I started thinking about why I love dogs so much,” Kristensen, 62, told The Associated Press.
“The dogs were a great support,” he said. “They lifted me up when I was sad.”
For more than a thousand years, dogs have pulled sleds across the Arctic for Inuit seal hunters and fishermen. But this winter, in the town of Ilulissat, around 300km (186 miles) north of the Arctic Circle, that’s not possible.
Instead of gliding over snow and ice, Kristensen’s sled bounces over earth and rock. Gesturing to the hills, he said it’s the first time he can remember when there has been no snow — or ice in the bay — in January.
The rising temperatures in Ilulissat are causing the permafrost to melt, buildings to sink and pipes to crack but they also have consequences that ripple across the rest of the world.
The nearby Sermeq Kujalleq glacier is one of the fastest-moving and most active on the planet, sending more icebergs into the sea than any other glacier outside Antarctica, according to the United Nations cultural organization UNESCO. As the climate has warmed, the glacier has retreated and carved off chunks of ice faster than ever before — significantly contributing to sea levels that are rising from Europe to the Pacific Islands, according to NASA.
The melting ice could reveal untapped deposits of critical minerals. Many Greenlanders believe that’s why U.S. President Donald Trump turned their island into a geopolitical hotspot with his demands to own it and previous suggestions that the U.S. could take it by force.
In the 1980s, winter temperatures in Ilulissat regularly hovered around -25 Celsius (-13 Fahrenheit) in winter, Kristensen said.
But nowadays, he said, there are many days when the temperature is above freezing — sometimes it can be as warm as 10 Celsius (50 Fahrenheit.)
Kristensen said he now has to collect snow for the dogs to drink during a journey because there isn’t any along the route.
Although Greenlanders have always adapted — and could make dog sleds with wheels in future — the loss of the ice is affecting them deeply, said Kristensen, who now runs his own company showing tourists his Arctic homeland.
“If we lose the dog sledding, we have large parts of our culture that we’re losing. That scares me,” he told AP, pressing his lips together and becoming tearful.
The sea ice is disappearing
In winter, hunters should be able to take their dogs far out on the sea ice, Kristensen told AP. The ice sheets act like “big bridges,” connecting Greenlanders to hunting grounds but also to other Inuit communities across the Arctic in Canada, the United States and Russia.
“When the sea ice used to come, we felt completely open along the entire coast and we could decide where to go,” Kristensen said.
This January, there was no ice at all.
Driving a dog sled on ice is like being “completely without boundaries — like on the world’s longest and widest highway,” he said. Not having that is “a very great loss.”
Several years ago, Greenland’s government had to provide financial support to many families in the far north of the island after the sea ice did not freeze hard enough for hunting, said Sara Olsvig, chair of the Inuit Circumpolar Council, which represents Inuit people from across Arctic nations.
The warming weather also makes life more dangerous for fishermen who have swapped their dog sleds for boats, because there is more rain instead of snow, said Morgan Angaju Josefsen Røjkjær, Kristensen’s business partner.
When snow falls and is compressed, air is trapped between the flakes, giving the ice its brilliant white color. But when rain freezes, the ice that forms contains little air and looks more like glass.
A fisherman can see the white ice and try to avoid it, but the ice formed from rain takes on the color of the sea – and that’s dangerous because “it can sink you or throw you off your boat,” said Røjkjær.
Climate change, Olsvig said, “is affecting us deeply,” and is amplified in the Arctic, which is “warming three to four times faster than the global average.”
The glaciers are melting
Over the course of his lifetime, the Sermeq Kujalleq glacier has retreated by about 40 kilometers (25 miles) said Karl Sandgreen, 46, the head of Ilulissat’s Icefjord Center which is dedicated to documenting the glacier and its icebergs.
Looking out of the window at hills which would normally be covered with snow, Sandgreen described mountain rock revealed by melting ice and a previously ice-covered valley inside the fjord where “there’s nothing now.”
Pollution is also speeding up the ice melt, Sandgreen said, describing how Sermeq Kujalleq is melting from the top down, unlike glaciers in Antarctica which largely melt from the bottom up as sea temperatures rise.
This is exacerbated by two things: black carbon, or soot spewed from ship engines, and debris from volcanic eruptions. They blanket the snow and ice with dark material and reduce reflection of sunlight, instead absorbing more heat and speeding up melting. Black carbon has increased in recent decades with more ship traffic in the Arctic, and nearby Iceland has periodic volcanic eruptions.
Many Greenlanders told AP they believe the melting ice is the reason Trump — a leader who has called climate change “the greatest con job ever” — wants to own the island.
“His agenda is to get the minerals, ” Sandgreen said.
Since Trump returned to office, fewer climate scientists from the U.S. have visited Ilulissat, Sandgreen said. The U.S president needs to “listen to the scientists,” who are documenting the impact of global warming, he said.
Teaching children about climate change
Kristensen said he tries to explain the consequences of global warming to the tourists who he takes out on dog sled rides or on visits to the icebergs. He said he tells them how Greenland’s glaciers are as important as the Amazon rainforest in Brazil.
International summits, such as the United Nations climate talks in November in the Amazon gateway city of Belem, play a role, but it’s just as important to “teach children all over the world” about the importance of ice and oceans, alongside subjects like math, Kristensen said
“If we don’t start with the children, we can’t really do anything to help nature. We can only destroy it,” Kristensen said.

‘I won’t disappear to run for parliament’: Formerly independent mayor likely Liberal candidate for Groth’s seat

‘I won’t disappear to run for parliament’: Formerly independent mayor likely Liberal candidate for Groth’s seat
A local mayor who is the leading contender to replace outgoing Nepean MP Sam Groth for the Liberal Party is under fire for previously campaigning as a fierce independent who had no ambitions to leapfrog to state parliament.
Three-time Mornington Peninsula Shire Mayor Anthony Marsh confirmed on Monday night that he had applied for preselection with the Liberal Party. The move triggered consternation among his fellow councillors, who will hold their first meeting of the year on Tuesday night.
Former deputy opposition leader Sam Groth resigned from parliament last week, forcing his electorate to the polls for a byelection just months before the state election in November.
According to Liberal sources, Marsh only applied to join the party last Tuesday. Other nominees to be the Liberal candidate include David Burgess, Briony Camp, Nathan Conroy and Bree Ambry.
The usual rule that requires members to wait two years before running for election was waived for Marsh. Instead of a branch vote, which takes three weeks, the candidate for the seat will be chosen by about 20 members of the party’s state executive and a handful of members of the Nepean state electorate conference in a vote on February 24. The expedited process is allowed under the party’s rules.
The Age has seen a draft no-confidence motion targeting the mayor circulating on Tuesday and intended to be raised at the council meeting on Tuesday night. The motion alleges Marsh misled colleagues and the community over his political ambitions. It is unclear whether the motion will be ruled eligible under the council’s governance rules.
Marsh told The Age in a survey before the 2024 council elections that he was not a member of a political party. He repeated the statement in his official Victorian Electoral Commission candidate statement, promising he was committed to the council “for the long haul”.
“I have no political affiliations. This is not a career for me, and I won’t disappear to run for parliament – I’m in it for the long haul!” the statement read.
In another 2024 pre-election survey responding to the statement “councillors are better if”, completed for ratepayer activist group Council Watch, Marsh wrote: “They are not affiliated with a political party and refuse to join one whilst they are a councillor.”
Marsh also told other media outlets just last month that he was “not running for Nepean, nor am I a member of the Liberal Party”.
Federal Liberal MP for Flinders Zoe McKenzie, who is involved in the candidacy process, suggested five weeks ago that rumours Marsh was considering a run were “silly stories spread by people with too much time on their hands”. She posted these comments from her official Facebook page.
Marsh has been contacted for comment.
He turned off comments on his post confirming his tilt at Nepean as a Liberal on his official council Facebook page on Monday night.
“I have received overwhelming encouragement from local members, community leaders and residents since the byelection was announced, and I am grateful for that support,” his post read. “In accordance with Liberal Party rules, I will not be making further public comment during the preselection process.”
Marsh was first elected to the council in 2020. He has been mayor three times over the past five years. He lives in Mt Martha, which is outside Nepean boundaries.
Mornington Peninsula has been in some turmoil during the current term under Marsh’s leadership: Local Government Minister Nick Staikos appointed monitors for 12 months in December to “support the council to improve its governance processes and practices”.
The Nepean byelection is likely to cost more than $2 million based on previous costs for the Werribee and Prahran byelections. The Age has confirmed the teal independents movement will announce a candidate by the end of February, while One Nation is poised to announce a candidate once writs are issued by the Speaker of the House, which could be as soon as this week.
Should Marsh win preselection, he would step down from his role on the council temporarily during the byelection. If successful in the byelection, he would be required to resign from his councillor role, which would in turn trigger a costly council byelection for his Briars ward, which takes in the Mount Martha area.
The Age recently revealed the skyrocketing costs of council byelections for ratepayers. The costs have jumped from about $1000 to as much as $180,000 because cheaper “countbacks” aren’t allowed under the new single-member ward structure.

Man killed and two fighting for life in ‘random’ triple stabbing attack in Sydney
Witnesses describe seeing blood on the ground and hearing screams

A man has been killed and two others severely injured in a “random” stabbing attack on a busy high street in suburban Sydney, police said.
Officers arrived at the scene in Merrylands, around 25km west of Sydney’s central business district, at 10am to attend to reports that a man stabbed multiple people before fleeing the area on foot.
A man was later arrested from a nearby street and taken to the Granville Police Station, police said.
Two of the victims were stabbed inside a high street shop, while the third was attacked on the street outside.
One victim, a man aged in his thirties or forties, was declared dead at the scene. Paramedics attended to two others – a 22-year-old man and a 47-year-old woman – with serious injuries before they were taken to hospital in critical condition.
A knife about 25cm long was used in the stabbings, superintendent Simon Glasser said.
“It’s very early in the investigation. Police are unaware at this point what the motive was. However, it appears it was a random attack,” Mr Glasser told a news conference.
“The alleged offender is known to police for petty crime and a number of mental health incidents,” he said. “He is not linked to the address he was located at. However, he is a local to the area.”
Mr Glasser said the victims were by themselves on Merrylands Road when the incident occurred and the three were not related to each other.
He said there were a lot of people in the area at the time of the attack.
“It’s a horrible offence to have taken place in Merrylands just prior to lunchtime with lots of people around,” Mr Glasser said of the “highly confronting” scene.
“It’s very reassuring to see members of the community come and help other members of the community that needed immediate assistance.”
Witnesses said they heard screams and later a large number of police, as well as helicopters, ambulances and police cars, arriving at the scene.
“We walked outside to see what’s happening. We seen a bunch of people, like a massive crowd, and then there was just a lady in front of the shop … and there’s just a bit of blood on the floor,” an eyewitness told ABC news.
Another eyewitness reportedly said he saw a woman with a neck injury as she was coming out of a convenience store.
Joseph Roussini, 59, said he called the emergency services after he saw a woman “screaming for her life”, according to the Sydney Morning Herald. He said he saw a “man and a lady coming out of the shop, and the man was holding the lady by the neck to try and stop the bleeding”.

Drone attacks on Russia: oil refinery ablaze, five airports closed and power cuts reported in Kazan – videos
Drones attacked several Russian sites on the night of 16-17 February, including the Ilsky oil refinery in Krasnodar Krai, where a large-scale fire broke out.
Source: Krasnodar Krai Operational Headquarters; Russian Telegram channels; monitoring channels
Details: According to Telegram channels linked to Russian security services, Krasnodar Krai had been under attack by Liutyi drones since the evening. Russian propagandists claimed that air defence systems had downed more than 20 drones over the region.
Local residents reported hearing more than 10 explosions near the village of Ilsky, after which a large-scale fire broke out at the local refinery.
Update: Krasnodar Krai Operational Headquarters confirmed the attack on the refinery in the morning.
"A fire broke out at the Ilsky oil refinery as a result of the UAV attack. There were no casualties. A tank containing petroleum products was damaged. The total area of the fire is about 700 sq m," the statement said.
It was noted that 72 firefighters, 21 fire appliances and a fire train had been involved in tackling the blaze.
Airports in Krasnodar, Sochi and Gelendzhik suspended operations for at least four hours because of the aerial threat. An air-raid warning was also issued in Novorossiysk and Slavyansk-on-Kuban.
Meanwhile, drones attacked the Republic of Tatarstan. Explosions were heard on the outskirts of Kazan and in Nizhnekamsk at around 03:00. Eyewitnesses reported bright flashes in the sky and the sound of blasts, after which the electricity supply was cut in one district of Kazan.
Airports in Kazan and Nizhnekamsk also temporarily suspended arrivals and departures.
There has been no official information about the consequences of the strikes in Tatarstan.
For reference: The Ilsky Oil Refinery (KNGK-INPZ LLC) is one of the key oil processing facilities in Russia's Southern Federal District. It has a capacity of more than six million tonnes of oil per year. The refinery produces diesel fuel, petrol and fuel oil, which, due to its proximity to Black Sea ports, are actively used to support logistics for Russian forces in Ukraine.
Background: The Ilsky refinery has been repeatedly targeted, leading to temporary shutdowns of its operations.

Russians launch new militarization program for children in temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine
According to Ukrinform, the Eastern Human Rights Group stated this on Facebook.
"On the temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine, a new propaganda campaign has been launched – 'Week Before Defender of the Motherland Day.' Under the slogans of 'serving the Motherland' and 'proper upbringing,' children are systematically indoctrinated with loyalty to the aggressor state. At a school in the city of Svitlodarsk, during a 'Conversations About Important Things' lesson, fifth-graders are told about the 'feats of heroes,' 'honorable military service,' and the 'heroes of the DPR,'" the statement says.
It is noted that after such brainwashing, children are encouraged to join the all-Russian campaign "Our Defenders of the Motherland." They are urged to follow the example of those fighting on the side of the occupation regime.
In this way, human rights defenders point out, a new value system is being imposed in which war is normalized and serving the occupier is portrayed as a virtue. Particularly telling is the involvement of children themselves as instruments of propaganda – through "class monitors," "patriotic sectors," and collective performances. An environment is being created in which refusal to participate means isolation and pressure. Schools are turning into platforms for political mobilization.
"The war continues not only on the front line; it continues in the minds of children, and it is there that the occupation regime is trying to entrench itself for decades," the human rights activists emphasize.
As Ukrinform previously reported, behavior grades will appear in the diaries of students in the temporarily occupied territories.

Waste piles up in Cuba as US-imposed fuel blockade halts collection trucks

Waste piles up in Cuba as US-imposed fuel blockade halts collection trucks
Cubans suffer under a US fuel blockade as President Donald Trump calls the Caribbean country a ‘failed nation’.
The United States-imposed fuel crisis in Cuba is also turning into a waste and health crisis, as many collection trucks have been left with empty fuel tanks, causing refuse to pile up on the streets of the capital, Havana, and other cities and towns.
Only 44 of Havana’s 106 rubbish trucks have been able to keep operating due to the fuel shortages, slowing rubbish collection, as waste piles up on Havana’s street corners, the Reuters news agency reported on Monday, citing state-run news outlet Cubadebate.

Other towns are also seeing rubbish pile up, and residents have taken to social media to raise the alarm over the risk to public health, according to Reuters, citing Cuban media.
“It’s all over the city,” said Jose Ramon Cruz, a resident of Havana.
“It’s been more than 10 days since a garbage truck came,” Cruz told Reuters.
The mounting rubbish crisis has added to the suffering on the tiny island-state, which US President Donald Trump described on Monday as a “failed nation”.
“Cuba is now a failed nation. They don’t even have jet fuels to get their aeroplanes to take off, they’re plugging up their runway,” Trump said.
“We’re talking to Cuba right now, and Marco Rubio is talking to Cuba right now, and they should absolutely make a deal. Because it’s really a humanitarian threat,” he said.
Cuba’s severe fuel crisis is a result of the US cutting off crucial oil supplies once imported from Venezuela. Washington’s move followed the bloody US military raid on Caracas and the abduction of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and his wife in early January.
US ‘violations of peace, security and international law’
Trump has been threatening Cuba and its leadership for months, and increased his choke-hold on the Cuban economy by recently passing an executive order that allows the US to impose crippling sanctions on any country that supplies oil to Cuba.
Asked if the US intended to remove the Cuban government, akin to Washington’s abduction of Maduro in Venezuela, Trump said: “I don’t think that will be necessary.”
Last month, Trump warned Cuban leaders to “make a deal, before it is too late”, without specifying the consequences of not meeting his demand.
Amid the crisis, Mexico sent two navy ships carrying 800 tonnes of humanitarian aid to Cuba last week, and on Monday, Spain said it would use the Spanish Agency for International Development and the United Nations to channel aid to Havana.
The announcement was made as Spanish Minister of Foreign Affairs Jose Manuel Albares met with his Cuban counterpart, Bruno Rodriguez Parrilla, in Madrid on Monday, where the pair “addressed the current situation in Cuba following the tightening of the embargo”.
In a post on X, Rodriguez criticised “the violations of peace, security and international law and the increasing hostility of the United States against Cuba”.
The Cuban foreign minister’s stop in Madrid followed visits to China and Vietnam, where he has sought support amid the US’s de facto blockade.

Niger, Algeria announce 'new dynamic' in ties, progress on pipeline
The head of Niger's military junta declared the start of a "new dynamic" with Algeria following a meeting with its president on Monday, announcing plans to start construction on a new gas pipeline.
Ties between the two countries had been strained for nearly a year after Algeria last April shot down a drone from Mali, which along with Niger and Burkina Faso belongs to a confederation of military-led Sahel nations.
Niger's General Abdourahamane Tiani met with President Abdelmadjid Tebboune in Algiers on Monday, with the latter saying the visit marked an "end to an abnormal period of chilliness" between the two countries.
After the meeting, Tiani expressed a shared desire to "inspire a new dynamic in our fraternal cooperation and neighbourly ties".
Following the drone incident, the Alliance of Sahel States (AES) had recalled their ambassadors from Algeria, which responded in kind.
But last week Tebboune restored Algeria's ambassador to Niger to help "relaunch" bilateral dialogue, shortly after Niamey's envoy in Algiers resumed his duties.
Tebboune said the thaw would see the "construction of a gas pipeline crossing the territory" of Niger, with the first steps to take place after the end of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan in March.
The 4,000-kilometre Trans-Saharan Gas Pipeline will transport gas extracted in Nigeria to Algeria, and has been on the drawing board for more than 15 years.
Plans for the project had accelerated in early 2025 before the falling out between Algeria and the Sahel states.
Following Monday's meeting, Tebboune promised support for Niger, which is facing severe economic difficulties, listing plans for projects in the health and education sectors.
On Friday, an Algerian delegation also travelled to Burkina Faso to discuss cooperation in the mining and hydrocarbon sectors.
But it remained to be seen if the thaw with Niger would lead to a similar rapprochement with Mali, which accuses Algeria of maintaining ties with terrorist groups along their shared border.
Regarding Tiani's visit to Algiers, a Malian diplomat told AFP news agency that "Niger is free to have relations with whoever it wants, provided it does not harm the interests of the confederation".
An adviser to the presidency in Bamako, however, said Mali should have been "made aware of the reasons" for the visit.

US and Iran set for high-stakes nuclear talks in Geneva as threat of war looms
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
GENEVA, Feb 17 - The U.S. and Iran hold indirect talks in Geneva on Tuesday aimed at resolving their long-running nuclear dispute, with little clear indication of compromise as Washington masses a battle force in the region.
U.S. envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner will take part in the negotiations, which are being mediated by Oman, a source briefed on the matter told Reuters, alongside Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi.
U.S. President Donald Trump said that he would be involved "indirectly" in the Geneva talks and that he believed Tehran wanted to make a deal.
"I don't think they want the consequences of not making a deal," Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One on Monday. "We could have had a deal instead of sending the B-2s in to knock out their nuclear potential. And we had to send the B-2s."
Tehran knows that a previous attempt to revive talks was under way in June last year when Washington's ally Israel launched a bombing campaign against Iran, and was then joined by U.S. B-2 bombers that struck nuclear targets. Tehran has since said it has halted uranium enrichment activity.
The U.S. military is preparing for the possibility of weeks of operations against Iran if Trump orders an attack, two U.S. officials told Reuters.
Iran itself began a military drill on Monday in the Strait of Hormuz, a vital international waterway and oil export route from Gulf Arab states, who have been appealing for diplomacy to end the dispute.
IRAN-U.S. NUCLEAR TALKS UNDER SHADOW OF PROTESTS AND WAR
Tehran and Washington renewed negotiations on February 6 on their decades-long dispute.
Washington and its close ally Israel believe Iran aspires to build a nuclear weapon that could threaten Israel's existence. Iran says its nuclear programme is purely peaceful, even though it has enriched uranium far beyond the purity needed for power generation, and close to what is required for a bomb.
Since the June strikes, Iran's Islamic rulers have been weakened by street protests, put down at a cost of thousands of lives, against a cost-of-living crisis driven in part by international sanctions that have strangled Iran's oil income.
Unlike last time, the U.S. has now placed what Trump calls a massive naval armada in the region.
Washington has sought to expand the scope of talks to non-nuclear issues such as Iran's missile stockpile. Tehran says it is willing only to discuss curbs on its nuclear programme - in exchange for sanctions relief - and that it will not give up uranium enrichment completely or discuss its missile programme.
On Monday, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio told a news conference in Budapest that it was hard to do a deal with Iran, but the U.S. was willing to try.
Iran's Araqchi on Monday met Rafael Grossi, head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, in Geneva to discuss cooperation with the IAEA and technical aspects of the impending talks with the U.S.
On Tuesday afternoon, Witkoff and Kushner will participate in three-way talks with Russia and Ukraine as Washington attempts to coax Ukraine and Russia into an agreement to end Moscow's four-year-old invasion of Ukraine, the source said. REUTERS

Trump says he will sit down this week with Democrats on partial shutdown
'We're going to protect law enforcement. We're going to protect ICE,' US president says
WASHINGTON
US President Donald Trump said Monday that he will sit down with Democrats this week to discuss the partial shutdown at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).
"I will," Trump told reporters en route to Washington when asked if he would sit down with Democrats this week on DHS funding.
The partial government shutdown at the DHS began early Saturday after Congress failed to pass a funding bill before a midnight Friday deadline, with Democrats blocking the measure, demanding reforms to DHS and especially its Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency, whose aggressive crackdowns in US cities have met widespread opposition.
Trump reiterated that law enforcement has to be protected and blamed the Democrats for the shutdown.
"This has nothing to do with Republicans. This is a Democrat shutdown," he said.
The shutdown follows weeks of negotiations between Democrats and Republicans on reforms to immigration enforcement and oversight of agencies such as ICE and US Customs and Border Protection (CBP).
Following the killing of two Americans by ICE agents in the state of Minnesota in January, Democrats have insisted on stronger oversight and tighter limits on immigration enforcement -- including banning the use of masks by ICE officers, requiring body cameras to remain on, and mandating visible identification -- as a condition for supporting the funding bill.
"We're going to protect law enforcement. We're going to protect ICE. They're part of the whole system that is working," Trump said.
The funding lapse affects DHS and its constellation of agencies, including the Secret Service and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).
Without funding, many workers deemed essential will be forced to work without pay or furloughed, while others will be told to stay home.
But two of the agencies that have stoked Democratic furor amid Trump's migrant crackdown, ICE and CBP, are unlikely to suffer major operational effects from the partial shutdown through his One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which was passed last year.
Lawmakers are expected to resume negotiations in an effort to end the partial shutdown, though there was no immediate indication of when a vote might occur.
If the partial shutdown drags on, tens of thousands of federal workers could be required to continue to work without pay, while some agencies might be compelled to scale back staffing levels until funding is restored.

Qatari official appointed to Trump's Gaza Board of Peace linked to Qatargate investigation
Unknown

The name of Qatar’s representative on U.S. President Donald Trump’s Gaza Board of Peace has surfaced during the Shin Bet and police investigation into the Qatargate affair, according to information obtained by ynet and Yedioth Ahronoth.
Investigators from the Shin Bet and the police’s Lahav 433 major crimes unit have examined ties between employees of the Israeli company Novard and Ali al-Tawadi, a senior Qatari diplomat who serves as Qatar’s representative on the body overseeing the management of the Gaza Strip under Trump’s Gaza Board of Peace.
As part of the probe, investigators focused on meetings and contacts between Novard personnel — particularly one senior executive — and al-Tawadi, both before and during the war. Israelis questioned as suspects in Qatargate met with al-Tawadi during the war, and some were hosted by him in Doha. Additional Israelis who are not suspects in the case also maintained contact with Qatari officials, met with al-Tawadi and were hosted by him.
The Qatargate investigation centers in part on suspected ties between Novard employees and Qatari officials involving an alleged influence operation and other projects that, as previously reported by Haaretz, began around the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.
According to ynet and Yedioth Ahronoth, one of the investigative tracks pursued primarily by the Shin Bet, and to a lesser extent by Lahav 433, concerns connections between Novard personnel — including retired Maj. Gen. Yoav “Poli” Mordechai, a former senior official in the Mossad, and other company executives — and al-Tawadi, who is considered a senior figure in the Qatari government.
Al-Tawadi was recently appointed by Trump as Qatar’s representative in the Gaza management body operating under his Gaza Board of Peace initiative.
He was present in the Oval Office in September 2025 during a phone call in which Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu apologized to Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed al-Thani following a failed strike in Doha. International reports at the time said al-Tawadi also met with Netanyahu during that visit. The Prime Minister’s Office denied that claim, saying al-Tawadi was present only during the phone call.
Al-Tawadi previously held a senior official role in organizing the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, and his name has been linked in the past to corruption allegations. In the lead-up to the tournament, Novard entered into a business arrangement with Qatar’s World Cup organizing committee to provide cybersecurity services for the event. The services were delivered through additional companies.
Al-Tawadi is the second senior Qatari official whose name has been reported by ynet and Yedioth Ahronoth as connected to the Qatargate investigation. In July 2025, the outlets first revealed the identity of another senior Qatari figure said to have directed the Israelis suspected in the affair: Sheikh Tamer bin Hamad al-Thani, head of Qatar’s Government Communications Office since March 2023.
Sheikh Tamer, a member of Qatar’s ruling family and a graduate of Northwestern University in Qatar with a focus on communications and media studies, met on several occasions between 2021 and 2023 with representatives of Israeli companies, according to investigative findings. Among those he met were adviser Yisrael Einhorn and retired Maj. Gen. Mordechai.

Australia eases protest restrictions in Sydney after nearly 2 months
Move comes after recent clashes between police, protesters during Israeli President Isaac Herzog’s visit
ISTANBUL
Australian authorities lifted extraordinary restrictions Tuesday on protests in New South Wales (NSW), marking an end to nearly two months of tightened control on public assembly in the state, local media reported.
NSW Police Commissioner Mal Lanyon said he no longer required the special powers granted after the Dec. 14 mass shooting at a Jewish festival on Sydney's Bondi Beach which left 15 people dead and dozens injured, which had enabled police to limit or block protests in designated parts of Sydney, SBS News reported.
"I'm satisfied the conditions that led to the extension last time do not exist now, and I'm more than happy for (police) to work with protesters," Lanyon said.
The restrictions were first imposed on Christmas Eve.
The decision comes a week after police violently broke up protests against the Australian visit of Israeli President Isaac Herzog.
Police and protesters clashed as thousands of people took to streets across Australia to protest the visit.
Civil liberties advocates and protest organizers have launched a constitutional challenge in the NSW Court of Appeal, seeking to prevent similar emergency powers from being used if a future terror attack is declared.

University of Michigan student accused of using AI for college papers sues for disability discrimination
The lawsuit claims professors mistook symptoms of her disability for signs of AI generation — which the student vehemently denies
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
A disabled University of Michigan student claims that her professors discriminated against her by falsely accusing her of using AI to write her essays.
In a lawsuit filed in federal court last week, lawyers for a young woman known as 'Jane Doe' accused the university and individual instructors of treating symptoms of her disability as telltale signs of AI-based cheating.
They say the student, who has OCD and anxiety disorder, presented unspecified "proof" that she had not used AI, only to be overruled and blocked from graduating.
"Despite that notice, U-M and its Office of Student Academic Affairs proceeded with disciplinary actions without implementing disability-informed accommodations, allowed the same accuser to remain the gatekeeper for grading and remedial work," the lawyers wrote.
"The accusations were based heavily on subjective judgments about Plaintiff’s writing style and on self-confirming 'AI comparison' outputs generated using Plaintiff’s own outlines and content."
It is the latest lawsuit by students who say they were unfairly tarred as plagiarists over essays that they claim to have written.
In October 2025, a student on Long Island sued Adelphi College for allegedly branding his own work as AI-generated and refusing to allow any appeal. One year earlier, the parents of a Massachusetts teenager sued their son's high school for similar reasons.
At the same time, teachers and professors say they have been overwhelmed by AI-generated schoolwork that has rapidly rendered traditional methods — such as homework — close to obsolete.
Colleges, too, are reportedly using AI to analyze and evaluate admission essays, allowing them to sort more quickly through tens of thousands of applications.
The 'Jane Doe' lawsuit also touches on the shaky record of AI detection tools, which research suggests are often inaccurate.
According to the complaint, Doe's instructor had publicly posted: "I fear that grading has made me paranoid and inclined to see AI everywhere."
In November 2025 he allegedly filed an academic misconduct accusation against Doe, claiming he was "immediately suspicious" of the paper's "unmistakable" AI-esque style.
Doe countered with "medical and psychological documentation" explaining that her disabilities — obsessive compulsive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder — might sometimes make her seem dishonest even though she was not.
"Plaintiff’s disabilities affect her ability to tolerate high-stress academic and disciplinary proceedings, particularly those requiring live verbal defense, rapid processing, and adversarial questioning," the complaint reads.
"Plaintiff’s clinicians warned that anxiety- and OCD-related writing traits – such as a formal tone, meticulous structure, stylistic consistency, and highly organized presentation — may be misinterpreted as artificial or dishonest behavior, and that Plaintiff’s limitations necessitate disability-informed handling of any disciplinary proceedings."
In summary, the complaint argues, "Defendants treated disability-related traits and limitations as evidence of guilt and failed to apply disability- informed modifications in the academic integrity process."

Nunez double keeps Al-Hilal unbeaten in Asian Champions League
Saudi Pro League leaders Al-Hilal secured a 2-1 win over Al-Wahda of the United Arab Emirates in Riyadh on Monday to move into the knockout rounds of the Asian Champions League Elite with the competition's only remaining unbeaten record.
Former Liverpool striker Darwin Nunez scored twice for Simone Inzaghi's side, including the 77th-minute winner, as the four-times champions finished on top of the western group phase standings with seven wins and a draw from eight matches.
Shabab Al-Ahli confirmed their progress to the last 16 despite losing 4-3 against defending champions Al-Ahli but Sharjah FC's 2-1 defeat to Uzbekistan's Nasaf guaranteed the side from Dubai would finish in the top eight positions.
Qatar's Al-Duhail will have to wait to learn their fate after losing 3-2 to already-eliminated Al-Shorta from Iraq in Baghdad.

Nunez, who has been left out of Al-Hilal's squad for the second half of the Saudi league season following the arrival of Karim Benzema, powered home a header from a Ruben Neves free kick for his side's opener in the 19th minute only for Brahima Diarra to level for the visitors 13 minutes later.
But the Uruguayan earned Al-Hilal all three points when he slid the ball in at the far post from a low cross.
Diyorbek Abdunazarov secured Nasaf's first win of the campaign with an unstoppable drive past Sharjah goalkeeper Adel Al-Hosani three minutes from time to deal their hosts a blow that leaves the Emiratis on the verge of elimination.
Al-Ahli, meanwhile, held on to claim their fifth win of the group phase after racing into a four-goal lead in Jeddah, Feras Al-Brikan putting his side in front in the 12th minute before an own goal from Bogdan Planic doubled their advantage.
Enzo Millot and Saleh Abu Al-Shamat were also on target for Al-Ahli, who were cruising to victory until two goals in 12 minutes from Breno Cascardo gave Shabab Al-Ahli hope.
Mohammad Juma hit his side's third in the fifth of seven minutes of stoppage time, to leave Matthias Jaissle's side hanging on for the win.
Two goals in a minute from Bouly Sambou secured Al-Shorta's first win of the campaign, leaving Al-Duhail sweating over the outcome of Tuesday's matches, when Al-Sadd take on Al-Ittihad and Al-Gharafa face Tractor FC.
The top eight finishers advance to March's round of 16 while the quarter-finals, semi-finals and final will be played in a centralised format in Jeddah in April.

MOSCOW, February 17. /TASS/. The number of Chinese tourists visiting Moscow rose by about 10% in 2025, the city’s Deputy Mayor Natalya Sergunina said.
"The number of Chinese tourists visiting Moscow rose by about 10% last year, reaching 470,000," she said, as cited by the Moscow City Tourism Committee.
According to Sergunina, China has topped the list of countries for the number of tourists traveling to the Russian capital for the past several years. In addition, Moscow actively cooperates with China in the fields of technology, trade, education, culture and tourism.
What Chinese tourists like about Moscow are historical landmarks, unique architecture, well-established parks, beautiful embankments and other public places, as well as advanced infrastructure and a public agenda full of activities. The most popular places include downtown museums, the city’s subway, the Zaryadye Park and the VDNKh exhibition center. Chinese tourists tend to get information about Moscow from friends, social media and special websites. In particular, the Discover Moscow tourist website is available in Chinese.
On Monday, the Lunar New Year Festival kicked off in Moscow. The celebrations will last until March 1, with colorful shows, theatrical games and masterclasses taking place at 60 venues across the city. About 150 restaurants are also taking part in the festival, offering traditional Chinese food.

Bangladesh's Yunus announces resignation, end of interim govt
Bangladesh's interim leader Muhammad Yunus stepped down on Monday in a farewell broadcast to the nation before handing over to an elected government.
"Today, the interim government is stepping down," the 85-year-old Nobel Peace Prize winner said.
"But let the practice of democracy, freedom of speech, and fundamental rights that has begun not be halted."
Yunus returned from self?imposed exile in August 2024, days after the iron?fisted government of Sheikh Hasina was overthrown by a student-led uprising and she fled by helicopter to India.
"That was the day of great liberation," he said. "What a day of joy it was! Bangladeshis across the world shed tears of happiness. The youth of our country freed it from the grip of a demon."
He has led Bangladesh as its "chief adviser" since, and now hands over power after congratulating the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and its leader Tarique Rahman on a "landslide victory" in elections last week.
"The people, voters, political parties, and stakeholder institutions linked to the election have set a commendable example," Yunus said.
"This election has set a benchmark for future elections."
Rahman, 60, chief of the BNP and scion of one of the country's most powerful political dynasties, will lead the South Asian nation of 170 million.
'Rebuilt institutions'
Bangladeshi voters endorsed sweeping democratic reforms in a national referendum, a key pillar of Yunus's post-uprising transition agenda, on the same day as the elections.
The lengthy document, known as the "July Charter" after the month when the uprising that toppled Hasina began, proposes term limits for prime ministers, the creation of an upper house of parliament, stronger presidential powers and greater judicial independence.
"We did not start from zero -- we started from a deficit," he said.
"Sweeping away the ruins, we rebuilt institutions and set the course for reforms."
The referendum noted that approval would make the charter "binding on the parties that win" the election, obliging them to endorse it.
However, several parties raised questions before the vote, and the reforms will still require ratification by the new parliament.
The BNP alliance won 212 seats, compared with 77 for the Jamaat-e-Islami-led alliance, according to the Election Commission.
Jamaat chief Shafiqur Rahman conceded on Saturday, saying his Islamist party would "serve as a vigilant, principled, and peaceful opposition".
Newly elected lawmakers are expected to be sworn in on Tuesday, after which Tarique Rahman is set to become Bangladesh's next prime minister.
Police records show that political clashes during the campaign period killed five people and injured more than 600.
However, despite weeks of turbulence ahead of the polls, voting day passed without major unrest and the country has responded to the results with relative calm.

Judge orders Trump administration to restore Philadelphia slavery exhibit
Judge accuses the US government of trying to rewrite history by taking down the exhibit in the city of Philadelphia.
A judge in the United States has ordered the National Park Service (NPS) to restore an exhibit about nine people who were enslaved by former President George Washington at a historical site in the city of Philadelphia.
The ruling on Monday came after Philadelphia sued President Donald Trump’s administration over the takedown of several explanatory panels at the Independence National Historical Park, the site where Washington lived with his wife in the 1790s.

The removal came in response to a Trump executive order to restore “truth and sanity to American history” at the nation’s museums, parks and landmarks. It directed the Interior Department to ensure the sites do not display elements that “inappropriately disparage Americans past or living”.
US District Judge Cynthia Rufe ruled that all materials must be restored in their original condition while the lawsuit challenging the removal’s legality plays out. She prohibited Trump officials from installing replacements that explain the history differently.
In her scathing 40-page decision, Rufe accused the federal government of trying to erase US history, much like the fictional authoritarian regime that ruled George Orwell’s dystopian novel 1984.
“As if the Ministry of Truth in George Orwell’s 1984 now existed, with its motto ‘Ignorance is Strength,’ this Court is now asked to determine whether the federal government has the power it claims – to dissemble and disassemble historical truths when it has some domain over historical facts,” Rufe wrote. “It does not.”
Rufe had warned Trump administration lawyers during a hearing in January that they were making “dangerous” and “horrifying” statements when they said government officials could choose which parts of US history to display at NPS sites.
There was no immediate comment from the Trump administration.
The historical site is among several where the Trump administration has quietly removed content about the history of enslaved people and Native Americans. This included signage at the Grand Canyon National Park, which said settlers pushed Native American tribes “off their land” for the park to be established and “exploited” the landscape for mining and grazing.
Trump’s orders have also led to the restoration of Confederate statues and other moves that civil rights advocates say could reverse decades of social progress and undermine the acknowledgment of critical phases of US history.
The Philadelphia exhibit, created two decades ago in a partnership between the city and federal officials, included biographical details about each of the nine people enslaved by the Washingtons at the home, including two who escaped.
Several local politicians and Black community leaders celebrated the ruling, which came while many were out rallying at the site for its restoration.
State Representative Malcolm Kenyatta, a Philadelphia Democrat, said the community had prevailed against an attempt by the Trump administration to “whitewash our history”.
“Philadelphians fought back, and I could not be more proud of how we stood together,” he said.
State Representative Brendan Boyle, who also represents Philadelphia, welcomed the ruling.
“I’m proud of our country and its founding ideals. That means we tell the full truth about our history, the good and the bad,” he said.

AI greenwashing: Most of Big Tech’s AI climate promises fall flat, study finds
Unknown

14:00:47 KST

Only 26 percent of climate-related AI claims cite any academic papers, while 36 percent didn’t cite any evidence at all, according to German non-profit Beyond Fossil Fuels.
A new report is casting serious doubt over claims from some artificial intelligence (AI) companies that their products can meaningfully reduce carbon emissions.
Estimates of AI’s climate impact vary widely. A January study published in the journal Patterns found that data centres alone may have emitted between 32.6 million and 79.7 million tonnes of carbon dioxide in 2025, which is roughly equivalent to the annual emissions of a small European country.
Meanwhile, the International Energy Agency (IEA) has suggested that AI could reduce global emissions by up to 5 per cent by 2035 by speeding up energy sector innovations, potentially offsetting the emissions generated by data centres. For example, the IEA said AI could help scientists test materials and battery chemistries to support new solar power technology.
Beyond Fossil Fuels, a German non-profit, examined over 150 climate-related claims from the world’s biggest AI companies and organisations like the IEA to see what type of evidence supports the claims that AI could cut emissions.
Only 26 percent of their sample cited published academic papers to support their claim, and another 36 percent did not cite any evidence. The remainder leaned on corporate reports, media articles, NGO publications or unpublished academic work.
The analysis notes that corporate sources rarely include peer-reviewed evidence or primary data to substantiate their claims.
“The evidence for massive climate benefits of AI is weak, whilst the evidence of substantial harm is strong,” the report notes.
For example, Google claimed AI could cut 5 to 10 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 if the technology scales. Researchers traced this claim to a 2021 blog post from consulting firm Boston Consulting Group (BCG), which extrapolated that figure from their experience with clients.
The analysis describes the Google claim as “extrapolation of massive global climate benefits … on seemingly anecdotal evidence”.
Many AI companies argue that smaller, narrowly trained models, such as those trained on a single high-quality database, are better for the environment.
Yet, the researchers caution that the claims about narrow AI models could be overstated because there is a lack of peer-reviewed evidence that shows that these models can meaningfully reduce emissions.
The analysis also did not find a single example where generative AI systems such as ChatGPT, Gemini, or Copilot led to a “material, verifiable and substantial level of emissions reductions.”
“Even if these benefits are real, they are unrelated to - and dwarfed by - the massive expansion of energy use from the generative AI industry,” the press release added.
The authors note that the results do not mean AI technologies do not have any climate benefits, but say there is little evidence that AI reduces emissions enough to offset the energy it will take to run these systems.
Euronews Next contacted OpenAI, Microsoft, Google and the IEA for statements on how they cite climate-related estimates.

Europeans are dangerously reliant on US tech. Now is a good time to build our own | Johnny Ryan
Unknown

14:00:47 KST

The French judge Nicolas Guillou knows exactly how deep Europe’s dependence on US tech is. Guillou and his colleagues at the international criminal court are under US sanctions. They can no longer use e-commerce, book hotels online or hire a car. Their home smart devices ignore them. Credit cards from European banks no longer function, because Europe has still not developed its own EU-wide payments system, so most electronic purchases go through Visa and Mastercard. Converting euros to foreign currencies is extraordinarily difficult because everything passes through dollars. Living in Europe is no protection against Donald Trump bricking your digital life.
This dependence is not limited to mod-cons. Last year, the chairman of the Danish parliament’s defence committee said that he regretted his part in Denmark’s decision to buy US-made F-35 fighter jets: “I can easily imagine a situation where the USA will demand Greenland from Denmark and will threaten to deactivate our weapons and let Russia attack us when we refuse. Buying American weapons is a security risk that we can not run.” He is not alone. Spain has abandoned plans to buy F-35s.
Perhaps the danger should have been clear a decade ago when it was revealed that US spies routinely record the phone calls of millions of Europeans and bug the phones of European leaders. But across Europe, governments, militaries, businesses, doctors, professors and teenagers alike continued to trust US technology. Sensitive state policies are drafted in Microsoft software. Health and tax records live on Amazon’s servers. Important decisions are made over video systems run by Microsoft, Cisco or Zoom. Young Europeans view the world through a lens distorted by Snapchat filters and YouTube algorithms. Europe’s news organisations rely on Google ad auctions.
Despite all this, Europe possesses a path to digital sovereignty. Loosening the US grip on the word processing, video conferencing and “enterprise software” that companies rely upon is not technically difficult. As veteran tech investor Roger McNamee told me, most of this tech was perfected in the 1990s and 2000s and has since become “enshittified” due to monopoly effects. Investors are selling software stocks because they fear these products can be too easily built by new coding large language models. Now is a good time for Europe to build better.
Austria’s military has already dumped Microsoft and moved to open-source services hosted in Europe, and some German regional governments have done the same. Danish schools were told to abandon Google laptops by the Danish data protection authority in 2024. The new Dutch government says digital sovereignty will be a national priority. France has moved its 5.7 million public sector workers to Visio, an alternative to Zoom developed by the government, running on French infrastructure. And the European Commission is building a system based on Matrix, a European open-source technology that enables communication across different apps and servers, without surrendering control of conversations to a single company.
But Europe’s real tech challenges lie deeper. First, each of the 27 countries in the EU has its own ways of doing business and its own particular legal requirements. Even though the European market is huge (450 million consumers), startups never reach critical mass because it is too difficult for them to operate across Europe. The IMF estimates that cross-border friction inside the EU is equivalent to a 110% tariff. This, as a report by the former Italian prime minister, Enrico Letta, details, kills everything from consumer tech to cloud infrastructure in the cradle.
Despite identifying this problem decades ago, EU countries have been unwilling to sacrifice national practices and disappoint domestic lobbies that benefit from the status quo. That may now finally change after the potentially momentous agreement by EU leaders last week to make Europe “one market”, and to “buy European” in strategically important sectors such as defence, space, clean tech and AI.
A second challenge is that European startups cannot get the kind of investment and initial public offerings enjoyed in the US because Europe’s capital market is also an untidy mess of national markets. This may change soon, too, with a union-wide financing system in the works, to unlock €10tn sitting in savings accounts for investment.
The final challenge is that Europe’s governments may not have the necessary political resolve to defend the continent. When faced with the threat to seize Greenland, did they finally take a tough line with Trump at Davos in January? It is at least as likely that it was his own treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, fearing the damage to the dollar from a retaliatory trade war, who convinced the US president to back down.
But polling after the Greenland crisis shows that most western Europeans (including people in the UK) don’t want more US influence. They want more Europe. They want more powers and decision-making at EU level, too.
Some leaders, such as Friedrich Merz and Giorgia Meloni want to achieve economic transformation by cutting regulation and watering down EU standards across the board. But rather than dilute its data laws, Europe should start to enforce them rigorously, to finally break the chokehold that Google, Microsoft and Amazon have over the European market.
The US tech sector looks like an asset now, but it is also a potential liability, because of its sheer dominance of the US economy, and because Trump’s voters do not share his love for it. Europe can attack that vulnerability, and in doing so shatter Trump’s support.
For now, though, Europe still outsources the machinery and plumbing of its democracy, commerce and military to US tech firms. This has, in effect, handed Trump a kill switch that Europeans should fear.
Before the US president makes his next demand, before his agents further undermine Europe’s democracy, the leaders of Europe should make clear that they will not fall on their knees. They will rise. And build.

Claims that AI can help fix climate dismissed as greenwashing

14:00:47 KST

Tech companies are conflating traditional artificial intelligence with generative AI when claiming the energy-hungry technology could help avert climate breakdown, according to a report.
Most claims that AI can help avert climate breakdown refer to machine learning and not the energy-hungry chatbots and image generation tools driving the sector’s explosive growth of gas-guzzling datacentres, the analysis of 154 statements found.
The research, commissioned by nonprofits including Beyond Fossil Fuels and Climate Action Against Disinformation, did not find a single example where popular tools such as Google’s Gemini or Microsoft’s Copilot were leading to a “material, verifiable, and substantial” reduction in planet-heating emissions.
Ketan Joshi, an energy analyst and author of the report, said the industry’s tactics were “diversionary” and relied on tried and tested methods that amount to “greenwashing”.
He likened it to fossil fuel companies advertising their modest investments in solar panels and overstating the potential of carbon capture.
“These technologies only avoid a minuscule fraction of emissions relative to the massive emissions of their core business,” said Joshi. “Big tech took that approach and upgraded and expanded it.”
Most of the claims that were scrutinised came from an International Energy Agency (IEA) report, which was reviewed by leading tech companies, and corporate reports from Google and Microsoft.
The IEA report – which devoted two chapters to the potential climate benefits of traditional AI – had a roughly even split between claims that rested on academic publications, corporate websites and those that had no evidence, according to the analysis. For Google and Microsoft, most claims lacked evidence.
The analysis, released during the AI Impact Summit in Delhi this week, argues the tech industry has misleadingly presented climate solutions and carbon pollution as a package deal by “muddling” types of AI.
Sasha Luccioni, AI and climate lead at Hugging Face, an open-source AI platform and community, who was not involved in the report, said it added nuance to a debate that often lumped very different applications together.
“When we talk about AI that’s relatively bad for the planet, it’s mostly generative AI and large language models,” said Luccioni, who has pushed the industry to be more transparent about its carbon footprint.
“When we talk about AI that’s ‘good’ for the planet, it’s often predictive models, extractive models, or old-school AI models.”
Green claims even for traditional AI tended to rely on weak forms of evidence that had not been independently verified, the analysis found. Only 26% of the green claims that were studied cited published academic research, while 36% did not cite evidence at all.
One of the earliest examples identified in the report was a widespread claim that AI could help mitigate 5-10% of global greenhouse gas emissions by 2030.
The figure, which Google repeated as recently as April last year, came from a report it commissioned from BCG, a consulting firm, which cited a blogpost it wrote in 2021 that attributed the figure to its “experience with clients”.
Datacentres consume just 1% of the world’s electricity but their share of US electricity is projected to more than double to 8.6% by 2035, according to BloombergNEF. The IEA predicts they will account for at least 20% of the rich world’s growth in electricity demand to the end of the decade.
While the energy consumption of a simple text query to a large language model such as ChatGPT may be as little as running a lightbulb for a minute, partial industry disclosures suggest, it rises considerably for complex functions such as video generation and deep research, and has troubled some energy researchers with the speed and scale of its growth.
A spokesperson for Google said: “Our estimated emissions reductions are based on a robust substantiation process grounded in the best available science, and we have transparently shared the principles and methodology that guide it.”
Microsoft declined to comment, while the IEA did not respond to requests for comment.
Joshi said the discourse around AI’s climate benefits needed to be “brought back to reality”.
“The false coupling of a big problem and a small solution serves as a distraction from the very preventable harms being done through unrestricted datacentre expansion,” he said.

‘Economic fighters’: the volunteers helping direct sanctions against Russia
Unknown

14:00:46 KST

In August 2022, Olena Yurchenko stumbled across a heated discussion on a Russian-language online forum – and made a discovery that would ultimately affect US and European sanctions policy on the Ukraine war.
The war had begun six months earlier. Yurchenko, 22, had been forced to leave Ukraine for Latvia after Russian strikes on her home town in the north. She had joined a nascent effort to pressure western companies to move their operations out of Russia. But the “name and blame” tactic only went so far, she said.
Her discovery was about computer numerical control (CNC) machine tools, which are used in almost all modern precision manufacturing. Without them, Russia would have to machine-cut key military components – tank hulls and missile casings – by hand.
Russia does not make CNC machines, Yurchenko found out. In fact, only a handful of companies in the world do. After over a year of investigation, and many meetings, the EU and the Biden administration put CNC machines on the sanctions list.
These sanctions, which led to a 2025 fine against the US manufacturer Haas Automation, have not stopped Russia manufacturing military components. But it has been forced to go to great lengths to obtain the machines, said Yurchenko.
“Russians used to buy 70% of the CNC machines from the west. Now they are buying 80% of their CNCs from China. And these CNC machines are of a lower quality, bad precision, like a one-time razor,” she said. Russia also attempts to smuggle CNC machines in through Belarus and central Asia.
More than in any previous conflict, civil society groups and a loose band of international volunteers have shaped the course of Europe and the US’s efforts to support Ukraine. The US and the EU have together announced more than three dozen rounds of sanctions since the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, covering thousands of entities from defence conglomerates to plastic manufacturers. Many of the more precise actions have been identified not by officials in Washington or Europe, but by a loose, worldwide coalition of civil society organisations and individual volunteers who have devoted themselves to uncovering exactly what Russia needs to keep sending men and machines to the war.
Chief among these are the “economic fighters” of Ukraine: organisations such as ESCU, which has a team of eight analysts, and loosely coordinates with the government’s war effort. But there is a broad coalition of Americans, Europeans and even Russians bound together in a wide-ranging civilian network.
Together, they have mapped the materials and supply chains that sustain the war, from Arctic-going barges manufactured in Singapore to chromium mined in Kazakhstan. Their efforts have changed the art of economic warfare, say officials.
“We have done 19 sanctions packages so far, two of them under the Danish EU presidency,” said Simon Kjeldsen, the sanctions coordinator for Denmark’s foreign ministry.
“Each of the packages have closed some loopholes and targeted Russian circumvention. And they have often done that … [with] a correlation and inspiration from what has been uncovered by Ukrainian civil society organisations.”
Civil society groups “have the energy and the investigative wherewithal to really drill down on supply chain dynamics, really niche areas of violations of sanctions, whether it’s energy or banking or export control violations,” said Laura Cooper, a former US deputy assistant secretary of defence for Russia, Ukraine and Eurasia.
“They do so with great precision. This is very helpful especially in the context of government offices that are largely overworked, under-resourced and can only follow so many leads at once.”
Sanctions have not forced Russia to end its war in Ukraine, nor have they made it change course by bringing its industrial base to ruin. But over time, they have eroded its capacities. The EU’s sanctions envoy said this month that Russia’s efforts were becoming “unsustainable” because of the way sanctions have distorted its economy.
“Their effects are not immediate, unfortunately,” said Ilona Khmeleva, the secretary of ESCU. “If we have sanctions today, we’ll see the results next year. The problem is that sanctions are like little cuts. If you have a lot of them, you can stop Russia.”
Diesel engines, mechanical lubricants and chromium
For an advanced economy with a legacy of manufacturing, Russia has a surprisingly hollowed-out industrial base.
That was what Andrew Fink, a former US defence contractor, discovered in 2021 shortly before the start of the full-scale invasion.
“I was talking to a Ukrainian friend of mine about other things that the United States could sanction to potentially deter a war,” he said. His friend told him that Russian corvettes – small, missile-carrying-boats in the Black Sea – were built using Chinese copies of German engines. “I thought this was very interesting, that Russia is not even able to make diesel engines.”
Yurchenko reached roughly the same conclusion on CNC machines: “In Russia specifically they are critical, because most of the military complex specialists either died or drank themselves into an early grave after the fall of the Soviet Union.”
Fink was able to confirm the finding in an old interview, in which a senior Russian engineer defensively explained to journalists why Russia struggled to manufacture engine components. The discovery launched Fink, 36, into a years-long obsession with unpicking Russia’s war economy.
In 2023, researching the imports of a Gazprom subsidiary, he found that Russia buys vast quantities of mechanical lubricant additives abroad, mostly from Chinese and Korean manufacturers. These are a class of difficult-to-manufacture chemicals added to petroleum to produce motor oil; there are only a handful of companies in the world that produce them. Without them, Russia would struggle to produce lube for mechanised warfare.
Fink brought the tip to the US anti-corruption group DeKleptocracy, which is headed by a former state department Russia expert, Kristofer Harrison, who began a two-year pressure campaign to limit the export of these chemicals to Russia.
Harrison told the Guardian the current level of CNC smuggling, for example, “indicates how badly [Russia] needs western technology to keep their economy going”.
There have been others. In 2024, ESCU led a successful campaign to convince the EU to interdict chromium exports to Russia. Chromium is a kind of metal used to plate artillery barrels; Russia depends on imports from Kazakhstan and Latin America.
In 2022, DeKleptocracy was part of a coalition of civil society groups that pushed the Biden administration to impose sanctions on Arctic-going vessels – barges and ice-class tankers – which are necessary to service and build Arctic LNG 2, the gas terminal that Russia is building roughly 1,000km (620 miles) east of Murmansk.
These sanctions arguably slowed the project for years. Russia obtained its first ice-class tanker – capable of transporting the gas through the Arctic waters to the transshipment terminal at Murmansk – last month.
Cooper and Kjeldsen, the US and Danish officials, say the coordination between governments and groups such as ESCU and DeKleptocracy, along with tens of others, may outlast the current conflict.
“This is a new approach and it’s a way of harnessing the huge public outrage that we saw after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. We saw energy and determination, not just from within Ukraine, but from around the world to try to hold Russia to account,” said Cooper.
Kjeldsen said Denmark has set up an initiative with the Kyiv School of Economics to focus on economic tools and resilience, which will include a “sanctions hub of excellence”.
“ This is the start of something that’s more long running,” he said.

Speaking privately with their bankers in February 2023, two associates of India’s Adani family confirmed that they held billions of dollars worth of stock in their conglomerate, Adani Group, through several hedge funds.
Their admission, found in banking documents obtained by OCCRP, had a direct bearing on a scandal that was roiling the country. Just weeks earlier, American short seller Hindenburg Research had published an explosive report claiming that the Adani Group’s decade-long stock rally had been improperly driven by insiders through “brazen” manipulation.
The affair made headlines across the world, in part because of the Adani Group’s widely perceived closeness to Prime Minister Narendra Modi. But after plummeting for a time, Adani’s stock recovered. The company issued a lengthy response denying all wrongdoing and decrying the report as an “attack on India.” And after a lengthy investigation, the country’s market regulator, SEBI, released two orders that found no violations in two aspects of the case, essentially ruling in favor of the Adani Group. No findings from its many other strands of investigation have ever been publicly aired.
In the meantime, OCCRP and its reporting partners, the Financial Times and the Guardian, had revealed the names of two men who had spent years secretly trading Adani stock: Nasser Ali Shaban Ahli, a citizen of the United Arab Emirates, and Chang Chung-Ling, a Taiwanese citizen. Both men’s ties to the Adani family have been widely reported over the years, and both held positions in affiliated companies. The Adani Group again denied all allegations of impropriety, pursuing journalists in court and accusing them of representing “Soros-funded interests.”
But now, internal documents from REYL Intesa Sanpaolo, a Swiss banking group headquartered in Geneva, reveal that Ahli and Chang’s investments in the Adani Group were much larger and more recent than was publicly known. While previous reporting revealed investments in the hundreds of millions between 2013 and 2018, the documents show they held about $3 billion in Adani stock through several hedge funds as recently as 2023 through accounts with Reyl Finance (MEA) Ltd., a Dubai-based subsidiary of REYL Intesa Sanpaolo.
According to an internal report, Ahli and Chang confirmed this to their bank in writing, explaining that they had made these investments because they had personal and professional relationships with members of the Adani family and trusted their business acumen. In their statement to the bank, Ahli and Chang denied the allegations made by Hindenburg Research.
Chang, Ahli, and the Adanis
The internal report also refers to inquiries about Ahli and Chang that the bank received from Swiss authorities. According to an August 2024 court ruling, prosecutors in the country were conducting a criminal investigation into Chang, suspecting him of acting as a “front man” for Adani Group investments, and froze over $310 million in assets. No charges have been brought. Asked about the status of the case, the Federal Prosecutor's Office did not comment on Chang’s identity, but confirmed that a criminal investigation into money laundering and forgery of documents was underway. The bank did not respond to requests for further detail. The Adani Group has denied any involvement.
The Swiss case, which closely tracks OCCRP’s previous reporting on the affair, is just one of the legal challenges the Adani Group has faced in recent years. In November 2024, U.S. federal prosecutors indicted the group’s founder Gautam Adani and his nephew for allegedly promising to pay hundreds of millions of dollars in bribes to Indian officials. A spokesman for the Eastern District of New York declined a request to comment on the status of the case. The Securities and Exchange Commission filed a parallel civil complaint, which is ongoing. The group has called the accusations “baseless” and said it would pursue “all possible legal recourse.”
Indian Investigations into Adani
In response to requests for comment, an Adani Group spokesperson wrote that any alleged “front men” for the Adani family are in fact “public shareholders.”
“Under Indian law, a listed company neither controls nor directs who purchases publicly traded shares, nor does it have visibility into or responsibility for the source of funds of public shareholders beyond disclosures mandated by regulators,” the spokesperson wrote. “Any suggestion that promoter shareholding has been misstated or concealed is incorrect and contrary to disclosures made in accordance with applicable law.”
The allegations found in the Hindenburg Report “have been adequately addressed by us and already examined at the highest levels of India’s regulatory and judicial framework, including the Supreme Court of India,” the spokesperson wrote. “The Adani portfolio of companies remain fully compliant with all laws and disclosure requirements across jurisdictions and continues to have complete faith in due process and the rule of law.”
Ahli and Chang did not respond to requests for comment. In a short statement, a representative of Intesa Sanpaolo wrote that the bank “is not in a position to comment, as any disclosure is not permitted by law in Italy, the United Arab Emirates and Switzerland.”
Billions invested through the British Virgin Islands
The new revelations about Ahli and Chang appear in documents that detail their bank’s response to the Hindenburg Research report and ensuing scandal.
According to these documents, after becoming aware of the allegations, the Italy-based Fideuram Intesa Sanpaolo Private Banking carried out an internal investigation into whether anyone connected to the Adani Group held any accounts with its private banking units.
That investigation identified three relevant accounts, holding just over $3 billion in assets, at Reyl MEA, a Dubai subsidiary of the Swiss REYL Intesa Sanpaolo:
Nasser Ali Shaban Ahli held $2.02 billion through his BVI-based company, Gulf Asia Trade & Investment Ltd. Almost the entire amount was invested in hedge funds which had seen “significant increases in value over the last 3 years” and were “likely” invested in Adani Group companies.
Chang Chung-Ling held $1.02 billion through his BVI-based company, Lingo Investment Ltd. Almost the entire amount was invested in the same hedge funds, again with the note that they were “probably being invested in Adani Group companies.”
Vinod Adani, the elder brother of the Adani family, held $6.5 million through his UAE-registered company, Kommerce Trade & Services. Most of this was invested in a pharmaceutical company, though investigators noted some loan-related transactions “of a not particularly significant amount” between his company and Chang’s. Adani did not respond to requests for comment.
Afterwards, Intesa Sanpaolo’s Chief Audit Officer and anti-financial-crime team requested that Ahli and Chang be called in for a meeting to explain their investments and their stance on the Hindenburg Research allegations.
At that meeting, held in February 2023 with the CEO and a board member of Reyl MEA, both men signed a written statement confirming that the accounts were theirs and stating that they had made their investments in Adani stock because they had personal and business relationships with the family and trusted their business acumen. They denied any wrongdoing and promised to diversify their holdings “in the short term.”
The bank also took additional measures, blocking any transactions on their accounts without specific authorization from an anti-money laundering officer.
It did not respond to reporters’ questions about its client relationship with Chang and Ahli.
The Hedge Funds
Swiss Investigations
The documents obtained by reporters also add new details to what is known about Swiss law enforcement attention to Ahli and Chang.
According to the internal report from Fideuram Intesa Sanpaolo Private Banking, half-a-year before the Hindenburg report was published, Swiss “judicial authorities” sent “specific information requests” to REYL Intesa Sanpaolo about accounts held by Ahli and Chang. Subsequently, the bank submitted suspicious transaction reports to the Swiss Financial Intelligence Unit relating to both men, as well as Vinod Adani. The relevant accounts were closed at the end of December 2022 due to a lack of activity, and they are not the same accounts later found to hold the $3 billion.
The Swiss information requests came as the authorities were looking into Chang for “suspicion of money laundering and forgery of documents” in an investigation that has been ongoing since 2021, according to an August 2024 decision by the Swiss Federal Criminal Court. (As reported at the time by Gotham City and the Financial Times, though Chang’s name does not appear in the decision, he can be identified by the information provided.)
In that investigation, which was begun by prosecutors in Geneva but later taken over by the Federal Prosecutor's Office, Chang is suspected of being a “front man” for the Adani group as part of a scheme to enable insiders to own a larger share of its stock than is permitted by law — exactly as he was described in previous reporting by OCCRP and the Financial Times. In connection with the case, Swiss prosecutors have frozen $311 million held by Chang in five bank accounts.
In the August 2024 decision, the Swiss Federal Criminal Court rejected an appeal by Chang’s company — the very same Lingo Investment Ltd that held his $1 billion — to unfreeze the money.
“The prosecuting authority must have time to conduct its investigation,” the court ruled. “It should be noted that the appellant is clearly unable to provide [prosecutors] with the explanations — in the form of supporting documents — which it should be able to provide in order to dispel the doubts legitimately raised.”
Asked about the status of the case, the Federal Prosecutor's Office did not comment on Chang’s identity, but confirmed that a criminal investigation into money laundering and forgery of documents was underway.

Greenlanders value the Royal Family – but younger generations are less convinced

A new survey shows that the Royal Family continues to hold personal significance for many Greenlanders, even as a generational divide becomes increasingly clear.
Fifty percent of respondents say the Royal Family has either “some” or “great” personal importance to them. In contrast, 22 percent say it has little or no importance.
The poll was conducted by survey expert Sune Steffen Hansen for The Copenhagen Post between January 22 and 29. Prepared in collaboration with Opinion Denmark, it is based on 610 interviews representing all age groups and municipalities across Greenland.
“The survey indicates that the Royal House still carries symbolic weight in Greenland,” says Hansen. “At the same time, it reveals a clear generational gap that cannot be ignored.”
A matter of age
Support for the monarchy rises significantly with age. Among Greenlanders aged 65 and over, 78 percent say the Royal Family has some or great personal importance, and more than half in this age group describe that importance as “great.”
In the 50–64 age group, 53 percent say the Royal Family has some or great importance.
Among younger Greenlanders, however, the picture is different. In the 18–34 age group, just 18 percent say the Royal Family has great personal importance, while 24 percent say it has some importance.
“The results clearly show that the Royal Family is facing a generational shift,” Hansen says. “If the monarchy wants to maintain strong ties in Greenland in the long term, it will need to engage younger generations more actively.”
The findings are published ahead of this week’s visit to Greenland by King Frederik X, who ascended the throne following the abdication of Queen Margrethe II in 2024.
While debates about Greenland’s constitutional future continue, the monarchy still appears to retain emotional resonance for a substantial share of the population – particularly among older Greenlanders.

New Orleans celebrates Mardi Gras, the indulgent conclusion of Carnival season
People are celebrating Mardi Gras in New Orleans on Tuesday with parades, revelry and costumes
- Bookmark
As people head back to work Tuesday after the long holiday weekend, beads will be flying, crawfish boiling and parades rolling in New Orleans as the city celebrates Mardi Gras.
Mardi Gras, also known as Fat Tuesday, marks the climax and end of the weekslong Carnival season and a final chance for indulgence, feasting and revelry before the Christian Lent period of sacrifice and reflection. The joyous goodbye to Carnival always falls the day before Ash Wednesday.
Among the final parades in Louisiana’s most populous city, which is world-famous for its Mardi Gras bash, is one hosted by the Zulu Social Aide & Pleasure Club.
Marchers and float riders in the Zulu parade wear African-inspired garb and toss “throws” — trinkets that include plastic beads, candy, doubloons, stuffed animals, cups and toys. This parade's signature “throw” is hand-decorated coconuts, coveted items that many revelers hope for.
Later in the day Rex, the King of Carnival parade will roll along St. Charles Avenue, lined by paradegoers and stately oak trees covered in Spanish moss and beads.
Carnival events are popular for their spectacular and enormous floats, and also the intricately crafted outfits worn, such as Black masking Indians, whose beaded and bejeweled costumes are topped with feathered headdresses, or paradegoers walking the French Quarter in homemade costumes that capture the unique spirit of the Big Easy.
The good times will roll not just in New Orleans but all across the state, from exclusive balls to the Cajun French tradition of the Courir de Mardi Gras, or Fat Tuesday Run — a rural event in Central Louisiana featuring costumed participants performing, begging for ingredients and chasing after live chickens to be cooked in a communal gumbo.
Parades are also held in other Gulf Coast cities such as Mobile, Alabama, and Pensacola, Florida, and there are other world-renowned celebrations in Brazil and Europe.

Damage from air pollution caused by war exceeds UAH 146B in Kherson region
According to Ukrinform, the State Environmental Inspectorate of the Southern District stated this on Telegram.
"The State Environmental Inspectorate of the Southern District continues its systematic work to document the negative impact of armed aggression on the environment," the statement said.
It is noted that from February 24, 2022, to early February 2026, inspectors assessed the damage caused to atmospheric air in the Kherson region as a result of shelling and fires triggered by hostilities. The total recorded damage amounts to more than UAH 146,203,127,000.
According to the Inspectorate, all collected materials and completed calculations have been handed over to law enforcement agencies to be added to criminal proceedings, and have also been submitted to the Operational Headquarters under the State Environmental Inspectorate of Ukraine for further response and appropriate measures.
As Ukrinform previously reported, as of early April 2024, damage in the Kherson region caused by air pollution due to the war amounted to nearly UAH 145 billion.

Russia sees new allegations regarding Navalny’s case as information attack — envoy

THE HAGUE, February 17. /TASS/. Moscow sees European countries’ allegations about the cause of the death of blogger Alexey Navanly (listed as a terrorist and extremist in Russia) as another information attack, Vladimir Tarabrin, Russia’s permanent representative to the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), told TASS.
"We definitely see the joint statement by the five countries (the UK, Sweden, Germany, France and the Netherlands - TASS) alleging that Navalny had been poisoned in an odd manner using a biotoxin made from the venom of a Latin American frog as another information attack on Russia," he emphasized.
The envoy pointed out that the European countries had failed to present any evidence or expert opinion on the matter. Tarabrin believes that the West’s goal is to produce "high-profile bogus stories and hysterical accusations," while unfriendly countries are not interested in searching for real answers.
On February 14, Germany, Great Britain, the Netherlands, Sweden and France issued a joint statement claiming Navalny had been poisoned using epibatidine, a poison extracted from the skin of an Ecuadorian dart frog. The conclusion is said to have been made based on an analysis of samples of Navalny’s biomaterials. The countries accused Russia of an alleged violation of the Convention on the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.
Russian Presidential Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that Moscow was very negative about Western allegations regarding "conclusions" on the causes of Navalny’s death and strongly rejected them.
The death of Navalny, who was serving his sentence in a penal colony in Siberia, became public on January 16, 2024. According to the colony’s administration, he became ill and collapsed after a walk. Paramedics on the spot and an ambulance crew that arrived shortly thereafter tried to resuscitate him but to no avail.

Moroccan lawyers end strike after reform bill suspended: bar
Lawyers in Morocco ended a weeks-long strike on Monday after the government suspended a bill regulating the legal sector and created a commission tasked with initiating dialogue, a professional association said.
Omar Mahmoud Bendjelloun, a board member of the Association of Moroccan Bars (ABAM), told AFP news agency that Prime Minister Aziz Akhannouch had promised on Wednesday to "personally take charge" of the bill with the cooperation of the ABAM, "putting in place a mixed commission" of officials and legal practitioners.
Justice Minister Abdellatif Ouahbi had initiated the legislation, which was presented as being intended to modernise the sector and strengthen anti-corruption measures.
The government approved the text of the bill in December, but has now put off forwarding it to the parliament for a vote as previously planned.
Moroccan lawyers had launched a rolling strike protesting the bill several weeks ago, deeming it a threat to their independence and demanding a participatory approach.
Early this month, thousands of black-robed lawyers gathered in the capital Rabat for a demonstration against the measure.
A main point of contention was the provision to grant the courts direct disciplinary power over lawyers. Normally, disciplinary matters are handled internally by the bar association.
According to Bendjelloun, the government has since taken "a step back", opening the door for a "way out of the crisis".
Justice Minister Ouahbi told a session of parliament earlier this month that the "matter is in your hands".
"Let them (the lawyers) give you the changes they want and I will discuss them with you," he said. "I am ready to drop, modify or reform anything that harms lawyers."
But, he added, "the legal profession needs change, and I will implement that change".

Bedouin residents disguised as IDF soldiers rob gold, cash, from Hebron jewelry store

Bedouin criminals posing as IDF soldiers robbed a jewelry store in Ad-Dahariya in the West Bank's Hebron Governate, stealing 4 kilograms of gold, jewelry, and more than NIS 100,000 in cash, the police reported on Monday
The group was fully equipped with a rifle, a pistol, ammunition, airsoft weapons, and full tactical uniforms, according to the report. A further investigation revealed that several vehicles were also used, one of them bearing a fake license plate.
"During the robbery, the suspects aimed their weapons at the employees, handcuffed them, blindfolded them, assaulted them violently, and caused them injuries," the police spokesperson said in a statement.
Suspects abducted victim, opened fire on vehicle
While fleeing, the defendants abducted one of the victims into their vehicle, later opening fire and causing extensive damage to one of the cars pursuing them.
According to the report, some of the suspects were arrested following a pursuit by officers from the Hebron police station and Border Police forces in Judea and Samaria, while others were apprehended as part of a joint investigation conducted in cooperation with the Gidonim Unit of Lahav 433 and the District Police Coordination Unit in the Judea and Samaria District.
The suspects were later extradited, and an indictment was filed against them.
Illegal weapons seized in Bedouin town, murder suspects arrested
On Thursday, police seized two handguns, an explosive device, ammunition, and magazines from a school compound in the Bedouin town of Lakiya in southern Israel during an enforcement operation.
Police also announced on Friday that three suspects were arrested for the murder of a man in a Bedouin village on Thursday.
These finds follow recent enforcement waves across the Negev targeting smuggling routes, arms caches, and local criminal networks that have resulted in around 200 confiscations of illegal weapons and 200 arrests of suspects over the last couple of weeks.
The operation, called "On Target," has been active since January, and encompasses a series of focused raids on criminal bodies within the Arab community.
The launch of the crackdown came amidst a major uptick in crime in the nation’s Arab sector.
Officers will continue proactive activity against illegal weapon possession, focusing primarily on cases where arms are hidden in schools and other places that may pose an immediate danger to the public, stated the police.

NEW YORK, February 17. /TASS/. Washington and Tehran could discuss the possibility of US access to Iran’s mineral resources, CNN reported, citing sources.
According to one of the sources, during multiple rounds of US-Iran talks last year, there were discussions about possible business deals that could be struck in conjunction with a nuclear agreement, including granting the US privileged access to developing Iran’s oil, gas and rare earth minerals. The topic is expected to be raised again, the source added.
The next round of Iran-US talks on Tehran’s nuclear program, mediated by Oman, is set to be held in Geneva on February 17.

Colombia to issue temporary decree on minimum wage hike after its suspension by high court
In a rare reversal, business leaders warn that withdrawing the already-implemented wage increase would trigger 'unmanageable instability'
BOGOTA, Colombia
Colombia’s government said Monday that it will issue a temporary decree on the 2026 minimum wage after the country’s highest administrative court ordered a provisional suspension of the historic increase.
The battle over the minimum wage reached a boiling point as the government reconvened the Permanent Commission on Wage and Labor Policy.
The move follows a high-stakes ruling by the Council of State that provisionally suspended a historic 23.7% hike in the minimum wage issued in a decree by President Gustavo Petro in December.
While the court’s freeze left millions of workers in legal limbo, Labor Minister Antonio Sanguino confirmed Monday that the government has no intention of backing down.
"We will defend to the utmost the right of workers to a living wage," Sanguino said following a negotiating session.
"The government will comply with the court's order by issuing a new transitional decree, but we are not ruling out maintaining or even exceeding the original figure," he added.
The Council of State’s intervention serves as a "precautionary measure" following several lawsuits. The court pointed to potential legal flaws in the original December decree, specifically questioning whether the government ignored technical requirements mandated by Law 278 of 1996, which requires wage hikes to be balanced against current inflation and national productivity. It has also raised alarms that the substantial hike could inadvertently push businesses into the informal sector to avoid rising labor costs.
In a rare twist, business associations -- led by Bruce Mac Master, president of the National Association of Colombian Businessmen (ANDI) -- have expressed concern about lowering the wage now that it has already been implemented.
While Mac Master originally warned that a double-digit hike would hurt the economy, he noted Monday that withdrawing the 23.7% increase now would trigger "unmanageable instability."
"We decided not to sue (over) the decree because we recognize that rights have already been generated for workers since Jan. 1," he said.
Business leaders are now caught between their technical concerns about inflation and the logistics of recalibrating payrolls that have been active for over six weeks.
President Petro, speaking in a televised address Sunday night, dismissed claims that the new wage has fueled inflation, instead blaming price hikes on meat exports. Framing the judicial suspension as an institutional blockade against the working class, he has called for nationwide demonstrations.
“The vital wage will remain in place until the new decree is issued,” he said. “We will see each other in every public square this Thursday, Feb. 19, at 4 p.m. to defend this historic achievement.”
The government has eight days to publish the new transitional decree.

Hillary Clinton accuses Trump administration of Epstein ‘cover-up’ as president claims he’s been ‘totally exonerated’ in the files
The Justice Department insists it has already released all of its Epstein records in compliance with a 2025 law

Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton accuses the Trump administration of carrying out a “cover-up” in its handling of the Epstein files, while the president claims the files “totally exonerated” him and “pulled in” the Clintons.
"Get the files out,” Clinton told the BBC on Monday from Berlin, where she attended the World Forum. “They are slow-walking it.”
Clinton’s husband former President Bill Clinton is mentioned and pictured numerous times in the Epstein files. Both Clintons have denied any contemporaneous knowledge of Epstein’s crimes, and survivors and authorities have not accused them of wrongdoing.
Over the weekend, Clinton echoed her calls for transparency while speaking at the Munich Security Conference.
She called the content of the Epstein files “horrifying” and demanded their full release.
“It is something that needs to be totally transparent,” she said on a panel.
“I’ve called for many, many years for everything to be put out there so people can not only see what’s in them but also, if appropriate, hold people accountable,” she added. “We’ll see what happens.”
Clinton’s comments piqued Trump, who claimed the Epstein files were partisan and had in fact “exonerated” him.
“I have nothing to hide,” the president told reporters on Monday. “I’ve been exonerated. I have nothing to do with Jeffrey Epstein. They went in hoping that they’d find it and they found just the opposite. I’ve been totally exonerated.”
Of the Clintons, Trump said the files had “pulled them in” and that Clinton’s recent comments in Germany were a sign of “Trump derangement syndrome.”
“They’ve been pulled in and many other Democrats have been pulled in,” he claimed.
Both Clintons are due to testify before Congress later this month, after initially signaling they would resist what they called “invalid and legally unenforceable” subpoenas in the Republican-led Epstein probe in the House.
"We will show up but we think it would be better to have it in public," Clinton said in her BBC interview, arguing that she and her husband were being used as a “shiny object” to deflect blame from the Trump administration.
The Justice Department said in a letter to lawmakers over the weekend it had released all pertinent records that it could in order to comply with last year’s bipartisan Epstein Files Transparency Act, which President Trump signed after months of warring with members of his own party who backed the bill.
Legislators insist the Trump administration continues to fail to meet its obligations under the bill.
“Your government is withholding information,” Rep. Nancy Mace, one of the backers of the law, wrote on X on Saturday.
The Trump administration has released about two percent of the data investigators have described as being in their possession on Epstein, according to analysis and internal emails obtained by U.K. broadcaster Channel 4 News.
In addition to this reported deficit of releases, lawmakers have also accused the DOJ of “muddying the waters” by disclosing scores of high-profile figures whose names appear in the files only tangentially, such as people mentioned in news articles shared by the late sex criminal.
“To have Janis Joplin, who died when Epstein was 17, in the same list as Larry Nassar, who went to prison for the sexual abuse of hundreds of young women and child pornography, with no clarification of how either was mentioned in the files is absurd,” Rep. Ro Khanna, one of the lawmakers leading the Epstein disclosure effort, said on X.

How did Westpac let a $44 mortgage snafu become a PR disaster?

Opinion
How did Westpac let a $44 mortgage snafu become a PR disaster?
The case of St George customer Fiona Vinall’s legal crusade against her bank is quickly rising to the level of a fable. The dispute, in which the small borrower took on the corporate might of St George bank’s parent, Westpac, in the NSW Supreme Court, was a win for common sense over the bank’s procedural absurdity.
But while Vinall bravely slayed the St George dragon, the fact that she had to do so has left the bank’s commitment to care for its customers looking murky.
So bizarre was the bank’s behaviour in response to Vinall’s mistaken $44 underpayment on one month’s interest on her mortgage that Supreme Court judge David Hammerschlag branded the bank’s conduct as “legally unjustifiable and short on commercial morality”.
The conduct was even shorter on common sense. This was a $44 problem that will have cost Westpac ten of thousands of dollars in legal fees and an even higher toll in public relations.
As this case progressed from a minor skirmish to a cause celebre, Westpac reached the point where it was attempting “to defend the indefensible”, according to the judge, who appeared nonplussed about the case’s progress through the courts and the vigour with which Westpac was pushing its position.
Sure, the customer may have made a small, understandable error, but it was the bank’s blunderous response full of calamitous box-ticking and bureaucratic decision-making that turned the snafu into a disaster.
This tale begins with Vinall’s $284,192 loan from St George – the interest payment for which was reduced last July following the Reserve Bank rate cut. A letter from the bank to Vinall said her interest payment would fall after July 10, 2025. She duly reduced her payment on July 12 in line with the rate cut.
But the reduced payment didn’t come into effect until the following month, which inadvertently left this customer about $44 in arrears. When she became aware of her mistake shortly after, she rectified the situation and paid the additional amount.
She also alleged that the notification letter from the bank was misleading.
This is where the story should have ended. Instead, the bank reported the underpayment as an event of “arrears” with credit reporting agency Equifax Australia. This resulted in Vinall’s credit history preventing her from borrowing to buy a new house, she said.
The shortfall in one month’s payment resulted in a procedural notification to the credit agency the bank said it was obligated to make.
Had someone inside the bank with seniority been apprised of Vinall’s understandable mistake and its rectification, surely the matter could have been dealt with rather than having the customer take it to court.
After all, the shortfall was equivalent to 0.0155 per cent of the outstanding mortgage, Hammerschlag noted. Relative to Westpac’s $140 billion market capitalisation, the amount is too small to calculate.
Ultimately, Westpac fought the case armed with barristers and “an affidavit from a bank officer seeking to defend the indefensible, namely maintaining that the credit record was (and presumably remained) an accurate reflection of what had happened ie that there had been an adverse credit event by the $44.11 payment shortfall,” Hammerschlag’s judgment read.
But it was only after the judge took the unusual step of escalating by asking for Westpac’s chief executive, Anthony Miller, to come to court that the bank capitulated and took steps to remove the offending black mark from the credit register.
The situation that led to this bank snafu may be familiar to many borrowers – and as such the publicity around this case could easily open a can of worms and lead to the bank needing to reset its communications with customers. It will certainly garner more attention for how Westpac handles Vinall’s claim for damages against it stemming from the failed house purchase.
The judge described the bank’s communication around the changes to interest payments “at best ambiguous and at worst likely to mislead”.
It makes you wonder how many other customers have made similar mistakes, suffered the same consequences and without redress.

Young entangled humpback whale leads rescuers on multi-state rescue mission
The sight is distressing: a juvenile humpback whale, separated from its mother, and so badly entangled in ropes it bears deep cuts and scars along the length of its body.
This is the predicament facing authorities and locals along the NSW and Victorian coasts, who have over the past fortnight spotted the calf with ropes tightly wound around the base of its dorsal fin.
Deep welts indicate the ropes have shifted over a period of time, inflicting multiple wounds on the juvenile whale.
The Organisation for the Rescue and Research of Cetaceans in Australia (ORRCA) first received a report of an entangled young whale off Tathra, on NSW’s far south coast, on January 31.
ORRCA spokeswoman Pip Jacobs said the juvenile whale was next seen more than 200 kilometres north, off the coast of Jervis Bay, on February 4.
Late last week it was spotted again – this time off Refuge Cove, on the eastern side of Wilsons Promontory National Park, on the Victorian side of the border and heading south.
“It does look like quite a young whale, like it’s potentially just left its mother, and that normally happens after about a year old,” Jacobs said.
“But this particular whale is also showing a lot of decline in body condition, likely due to the entanglement … it is seemingly underweight, so that also impedes our ability to age it.”
Jacobs said a specialised whale entanglement team would be required to free the animal if found.
“Disentanglement is incredibly difficult and dangerous,” she said. “If you can imagine, a humpback whale can weigh up to 40 tonnes, and it is a large animal that is in stress as well.
“We would never encourage any member of the public to disentangle a whale on their own, because they’re not licensed to do so, but also because it’s incredibly dangerous, [depending] on water conditions, as well as the condition of the whale and how it’s behaving.”
It is unusual to see humpback whales at this time of year in Australian waters.
Ongoing attempts by search teams on private vessels and authorities in Victoria to locate the animal, last spotted on the weekend, have been unsuccessful.
Orcas, also known as killer whales, which are known to prey upon juvenile humpback whales, are also in the area.
A spokesperson for Victoria’s Department of Energy, Environment and Climate Action (DEECA) Incident Management Team said the whale had been moving very slowly and appeared underweight.
The spokesperson said abandoned, lost and discarded fishing gear, known as ghost nets, are a global problem directly impacting marine life such as whales.
DEECA Incident Controller Renee Hutchison said the ongoing search had covered a vast area since the whale was first reported to Victorian authorities on February 14.
“The area we are searching with spotter planes is quite large, which means people in boats near Wilsons Promontory are a valuable resource to complement the DEECA search efforts.”
The Captain Paul Watson Foundation, which is in Victoria preparing to depart for Antarctica to interrupt commercial krill hunts and has been helping efforts to find the humpback, urged anyone who has seen the whale to contact authorities.
A group of 24 activists on board the MV Bandero, including 10 Australians, have been moored in Victorian waters ahead of their planned expedition to Antarctica to disrupt international krill fishing operations.
ORRCA has urged members in Victoria and Tasmania to report any sightings of the whale to DEECA Emergency Whale and Dolphin Rescue Hotline on 1300 136 017 or ORRCA on (02) 9415 3333.

Drones strike multiple Russian regions, sparking major fire at oil refinery in Krasnodar Krai
Drone attacks targeted several regions of Russia overnight on Feb. 17, including the Ilsky oil refinery in Krasnodar Krai, where a large-scale fire broke out following reported strikes, according to local authorities, Telegram channels, and monitoring groups.
The refinery, which supplies fuel to Russian troops, processes 6.42 million tons of oil annually, according to Ukraine's General Staff. Due to its proximity to Black Sea ports, its products are widely used to support Russian military logistics.
Pro-Russian Telegram channels with alleged ties to security services claimed that Krasnodar Krai had been under attack by Ukrainian drones since the evening. Local air defense systems shot down more than 20 drones over the region, though the Kyiv Independent could not immediately verify these claims.
Residents reported hearing more than 10 explosions near the settlement of Ilsky. Shortly afterward, a major fire erupted at the local oil refinery. The Krasnodar Krai operational headquarters confirmed that the region had been attacked but did not disclose details regarding damage or the facilities affected.
Krasnodar Krai, a strategic region in southwestern Russia on the Black Sea and Sea of Azov, is located across the Kerch Strait from the occupied Crimean peninsula.
Amid the reported aerial threat, airports in Krasnodar, Sochi, and Gelendzhik suspended operations for at least four hours. Air raid sirens were also activated in Novorossiysk and Slavyansk-na-Kuban.
At the same time, drones reportedly targeted the Republic of Tatarstan, located in central European Russia's Volga-Ural region. Around 3 a.m. local time, explosions were heard on the outskirts of Kazan and in Nizhnekamsk. Witnesses reported hearing the sounds of blasts, after which electricity supply was disrupted in one district of Kazan. The city is located roughly 1,300–1,400 kilometers (800-870 miles) from the Russia‑Ukraine boder.
Airports in Kazan and Nizhnekamsk temporarily halted arrivals and departures. Russian authorities had not released official information on the aftermath of the strikes in Tatarstan.

Unique Pokemon card sells for US$16.5 million, smashing world record
Previously bought by US YouTuber Logan Paul for US$5.28 million in 2021, the card sold for three times that amount at an auction on Monday
The supposedly unique PSA 10-graded Pikachu Illustrator was originally bought by Paul in another record-breaking sale in 2021 for US$5.28 million.
This time it was bought by AJ Scaramucci, son of former White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci, according to Guinness World Records, whose representatives verified the record at the auction held by Goldin on Monday.
After the successful bid, Paul placed the card, which was attached to what Guinness said was a US$75,000 diamond necklace, around Scaramucci’s neck.
Guinness World Records certified it as the most expensive Pokemon card – as well as the priciest trading card overall – sold at an auction.
Ranging from Pikachu the mouse to Jigglypuff the balloon to the jackal-headed Lucario, there are now more than 1,000 different Pokemon characters, with new “generations” released every few years.

US lawmakers call on congressman to resign over remarks about Muslims
Randy Fine faces condemnation as Democratic representative calls statement 'disgusting bigotry,' California governor labels him a 'racist slob'
ISTANBUL
US lawmakers called Monday on Congressman Randy Fine to resign over comments he made about Muslims.
"If they force us to choose, the choice between dogs and Muslims is not a difficult one," the Florida Republican wrote on the US social media company X’s platform Sunday, responding to a statement by Palestinian-American activist Nerdeen Kiswani that dogs "definitely have a place in society, just not as indoor pets" because "they are unclean."
California Rep. Ro Khanna called Fine's remarks "disgusting bigotry," demanding he be censured as a matter of "morality and decency, not politics."
Arizona Rep. Yassamin Ansari said Fine "has repeatedly dehumanized Muslims without consequence," calling on House Speaker Mike Johnson to reprimand him while adding that if Fine cannot meet basic standards of human dignity, he should resign.
New Jersey Rep. Rob Menendez questioned whether Johnson, as a Christian, is obligated to speak out against hateful rhetoric or will "continue to remain silent."
California Rep. Eric Swalwell warned that every Republican failing to condemn the vitriol "only gives it more oxygen," while Texas Rep. Marc Veasey called Fine's behavior "blatantly racist."
Maryland Rep. Johnny Olszewski and Ohio Rep. Shontel Brown both condemned the "blatant Islamophobia" as unacceptable, particularly from a member of Congress.
California Gov. Gavin Newsom demanded Fine to resign, calling him a "racist slob."
The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), the nation's largest Muslim civil rights and advocacy organization, described Fine as "a modern Klansman and Nazi all wrapped into one, only his targets are Muslims and Palestinians," citing his previous calls for the destruction of all “mainstream Muslims” and the genocide of everyone in Gaza, while urging congressional leaders to demand his resignation.

Accused Invasion Day rally terrorist identified after suppression order lifted
A Perth man who allegedly threw a homemade bomb into a crowd of protesters at an Invasion Day rally in the CBD has been identified for the first time after a suppression order on his identity was lifted.
Liam Alexander Hall, 32, is accused of making and throwing the device – which had allegedly been designed to detonate – from a terrace balcony into a crowd in Forrest Place as they marched to protest the date of Australia Day.
It took authorities nine days to determine whether to charge Hall with engaging in a terrorist act – the first charge of its kind laid in Western Australian history.
Hall’s lawyer Simon Freitag appeared in Perth Magistrates Court on Tuesday on his behalf and said his client was aware of the new offence.
Hall was excused from attending due to medical issues.
Hall’s identity was initially suppressed by the court due to concerns for his safety behind bars at Hakea Prison, and based on the fact he was experiencing mental health issues.
However, federal prosecutors and WA Police opposed the suppression order continuing, arguing Hall’s safety had been managed well behind bars.
“There’s a risk of misidentification of the accused,” prosecutor Kirsten Nelson said.
“I’ve been instructed there has been one instance on Facebook where someone has been misidentified as the accused.”
Three lawyers for various media outlets also argued against the suppression order, and said suppressing Hall’s identity could potentially lead to “speculation, rumour and collateral harm”.
However, Freitag argued the suppression order should continue, and now also apply to the new terror charge.
He said Hall was still at risk in custody, the extent of his vulnerability was not yet known, and there was no public benefit for people to know which prison Hall was in.
Freitag also argued releasing Hall’s name could put his family at risk.
“I assume the media will want to get hold of his family and interview them and take photos from the front of his house,” he said.
Magistrate Lynette Dias ultimately decided to lift the suppression order and said she was confident the man’s safety was being well looked after in prison, and WA Police had taken steps to protect the family.
Also on Tuesday, Premier Roger Cook, Opposition Leader Basil Zempilas and Nationals leader Shane Love spoke on a motion put to parliament condemning the alleged attack.
“I’m so grateful for whatever it was that stopped that [alleged]bomb detonation, grateful that I can stand here with the immense privilege of reflection, rather than the devastation of mourning, despite the world around us,” Cook said.
Noongar Yamatji woman Jade Cameron attended parliament on Tuesday in support of the motion and said the broader community was grateful the suppression order was lifted. She urged calm in the wake of the news.
“We do ask that nobody takes matters into their own hands, because we want him to face the full extent of the law,” she said.
Cameron was also present at the rally on the day of the alleged attempted bombing.
“It wasn’t just myself, and my elders here. There were thousands. There were families. There were people who came down to spend the day with us. Other races, other white Australians who came to sit there and spend their day with us, who were almost a part of that catastrophic event. ”
Authorities earlier this month charged Hall with one count of engaging in a terrorist act.
“This is the first time this charge has been laid in Western Australia,” Premier Roger Cook said at the time.
“This charge ... alleges the attack on Aboriginal people and other peaceful protesters was motivated by hateful, racist ideology.”
WA Police Commissioner Col Blanch said Hall’s internet history allegedly revealed he had “self-radicalised” online and accessed “pro-white material”.
The device allegedly contained ball bearings and contained screws wrapped around an unknown liquid in a glass container that had been designed to detonate in what WA Police Minister Reece Whitby said could have been a “mass casualty” event.

Judge tells US National Park Service to reinstall Philadelphia slavery exhibit
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
NEW YORK/ WASHINGTON - A United States federal judge in Pennsylvania ordered the National Park Service on Feb 17 to reinstall a slavery exhibit at a Philadelphia historic site, pending the outcome of litigation after the city sued the government over its removal.
The exhibit was dismantled and removed in January in response to US President Donald Trump’s claims, rejected by civil rights groups, of an “anti-American ideology” at historical and cultural institutions.
“The government claims it alone has the power to erase, alter, remove and hide historical accounts on taxpayer and local government-funded monuments within its control,” US District Judge Cynthia Rufe wrote in her opinion.
“Its claims in this regard echo Big Brother’s domain in Orwell’s 1984,” Judge Rufe added, referring to the dystopian novel by George Orwell.
The National Park Service and Philadelphia did not respond to requests for comment.
Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, who backed the lawsuit, welcomed the order.
“Here in Pennsylvania, we learn from our history – even when it’s painful,” he said on X. “We don’t erase it. Donald Trump may want to whitewash our shared history – but we will not let him win.”
In its suit, Philadelphia accused the federal Interior Department, which oversees the National Park Service, and top officials of breaking the law.
The judge granted the city’s request for a temporary block and ordered the National Park Service to restore the exhibit pending the outcome of litigation.
“As if the Ministry of Truth in George Orwell’s 1984 now existed, with its motto ‘Ignorance is Strength’, this court is now asked to determine whether the federal government has the power it claims – to dissemble and disassemble historical truths when it has some domain over historical facts,” Judge Rufe said in the 40-page opinion.
“It does not.”
The exhibit was at the President’s House Site in Independence National Historical Park, where the first US president George Washington lived when the Pennsylvania city was the nation’s capital.
The President’s House described the history of slavery and Washington’s ownership of enslaved people.
Mr Trump has targeted US institutions, from museums to monuments to national parks, to remove what he calls “anti-American” ideology.
His declarations and executive orders have led to the dismantling of slavery exhibits, the restoration of Confederate statues and other moves that civil rights advocates say could reverse decades of social progress and undermine the acknowledgment of critical phases of US history. REUTERS

Japan’s lost ‘tigers’ were actually a different big cat species, study reveals
Cave lions lived in Japan long after they went extinct elsewhere, study reveals
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
Fossils uncovered in Japan, thought to be from the archipelago’s lost tiger population, have now been revealed to be of an ancient species of lion.
While there are no native lion or tiger populations in Japan today, this was not always the case.
Fossils indicate that at least one species of large cat roamed the archipelago during the Late Pleistocene period, lasting from approximately 129,000 to 11,700 years ago.
Previous research suggested these fossils belonged to ancient tigers, but a new DNA analysis of the specimen reveals these were actually an ancient species of lion, upending what was known about the region’s biodiversity history.
Lions spread out of Africa around a million years ago and began expanding their range across Eurasia. They stayed in the more northern regions of Eurasia, while tigers were typically found farther south.
During the Late Pleistocene, their ranges often overlapped in a region known as the "lion-tiger transition belt” that stretched across Eurasia, from the Middle East through Central Asia to the Russian Far East.
Some animals also crossed into Japan from mainland Asia when land bridges formed during periods of low sea levels.
“Periodic land connections between the archipelago and the Asian mainland, resulting from lowered sea levels during glacial periods, enabled the migration of continental fauna to Japan,” explain scientists in a new study published in the journal PNAS.
Researchers previously uncovered fossils belonging to the genus Panthera in Japan from soil layers corresponding to the Middle and Late Pleistocene periods.
These were initially attributed to tigers based on physical features of the remains, as well as habitat studies suggesting that southwestern Japan was more suitable for tigers, especially during cooler periods.
Other research has shown that cave lions were present in the southeast Russian Far East, northeastern China, and the northern Korean Peninsula during the Late Pleistocene.
This raised questions about which species the Japanese fossils came from. Now, a more thorough DNA analysis provides reliable proof that all of the ancient Japanese "tiger" remains were actually a now extinct lion species, referred to as cave lions.
The specimens were found to be from around 31,060 years ago.
Based on these findings, researchers theorise that cave lions most likely colonised Japan between about 72,700 and 37,500 years ago, likely via the northern land bridge during glacial periods.
They suspect cave lions persisted in Japan for at least 20,000 years after their extinction elsewhere in Eurasia.
“Periods of relative isolation, punctuated by episodic land connections to the continent, have historically enabled the persistence of relict populations, such as the Japanese wolf, which survived well into the Holocene, after their continental counterpart population went extinct," scientists wrote.
“Our findings challenge the long-held view that tigers once took refuge in Japan, showing instead that cave lions were widespread in northeast Asia during this period and were the Panthera lineage that colonized Japan, reaching even its southwestern regions despite habitats previously thought to favor tigers,” they concluded.

US talking to Cuba 'right now’: Trump
'We'll see how it all turns out. But Cuba and us, we are talking,' US president says
WASHINGTON
The US is talking to Cuba "right now," President Donald Trump said Monday.
"We're talking to Cuba right now," he told reporters en route to Washington.
Trump said Secretary of State Marco Rubio is holding the talks.
"They should absolutely make a deal," he added.
Trump called Cuba "a failed nation."
"We'll see how it all turns out. But Cuba and us, we are talking. In the meantime, there's an embargo, there's no oil, there's no money," he said.
Asked if he would consider a military operation like the one in Venezuela, Trump said he did not want to answer that question.
"Why would I answer that? If I was, it wouldn't be a very tough operation, as you can figure, but I don't think that'll be necessary," he said.
The US has reinstated its blockade of Cuba, declaring its intention to overthrow the republic's communist government by one means or another.
Washington has imposed an embargo on fuel deliveries to the island nation, which was already facing acute shortages.
The US previously succeeded in halting oil supplies to Cuba from Mexico and Venezuela, and in the latter case, US forces captured President Nicolas Maduro.
Washington has also announced its intention to impose proportional import duties on goods from countries that dare to supply fuel to Cuba.

Hungary expects Russian oil supplies through Croatia to begin in March

BUDAPEST, February 17. /TASS/. The Hungarian company MOL expects that Russian oil supplies to Hungary and Slovakia through Croatia, which are required due to Ukraine’s move to block deliveries via the Druzhba oil pipeline, will begin in March.
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said on February 15 that Budapest and Bratislava had asked Croatia to allow the transportation of Russian oil via the Trans Adriatic pipeline as oil supplies via the Druzhba pipeline had been blocked by Ukraine. Croatia agreed citing the EU’s rule emphasizing the need to prevent threats to the energy security of member states.
Russian oil is supposed to be transported to the Croatian port of Omisalj by tankers before being delivered to Hungary and Slovakia via the Trans Adriatic pipeline. MOL noted that maritime deliveries would lead to longer transit times. "The first shipments are expected to arrive at the port of Omisalj in Croatia in early March, from where it will take a further 5-12 days for the crude oil to reach the MOL Group's refineries," the company said in a statement.
MOL has also approached the Hungarian Energy Ministry, initiating the release of about 250,000 tons of strategic crude oil reserves if Ukraine continues to block oil supplies via the Druzhba pipeline. "The current situation does not threaten fuel supplies: the market is being served without disruption, and MOL continues to operate within the framework of normal business," the company pointed out, adding that both Hungary and Slovakia had "sufficient crude oil reserves for approximately 90 days."
On February 13, oil industry sources told TASS that the management of Ukrtransnafta, the Ukrainian company responsible for oil transit through the country, would not give permission to resume supplies. According to the sources, the company had mitigated the consequences of an accident at the Brody line operation dispatcher station in Ukraine on February 6, but the oil pumping had still not resumed.

US and Iran set for new talks in Geneva

President Donald Trump warned Iran of potential consequences should it fail to strike a deal with the United States, as negotiators prepare for the latest round of talks in Geneva on Tuesday, February 17. Mediated by Oman, the recently resumed discussions are aimed at averting the possibility of US military action, with Tehran expressing cautious optimism at Washington's "more realistic" position on its nuclear program.
Trump has repeatedly threatened to intervene militarily against Iran, first over a deadly crackdown on protesters last month and then more recently over its nuclear program.
"I don't think they want the consequences of not making a deal," he told reporters aboard Air Force One ahead of the talks. A previous attempt at diplomacy collapsed when Israel launched surprise strikes on Iran in June, beginning a 12-day war that Washington briefly joined to bomb Iranian nuclear sites.
"A cautious assessment is that, from the discussions that have taken place in Muscat to date, at least what we have been told is that the US position on the Iranian nuclear issue has moved towards a more realistic one," foreign ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baqaei said Monday, according to the official IRNA news agency. According to Tehran, Tuesday's talks in Switzerland will also be mediated by Oman.
Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi met with his Omani counterpart Badr Albusaidi in Geneva on Monday to discuss his country's position "regarding nuclear issues and sanctions relief." He also stressed Tehran's "seriousness in using result-oriented diplomacy to secure the legitimate interests and rights of the Iranian people" and preserve peace in the region, according to a ministry statement.
Limited to nuclear issue
Iran has insisted that the discussions be limited to the nuclear issue, though Washington has previously pushed for other topics to be discussed, including its ballistic missiles and support for armed groups in the region.
Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, the ideological arm of the military, began a series of war games on Monday in the Strait of Hormuz to prepare for "potential security and military threats," Iranian state TV said. Iranian politicians have repeatedly threatened to block the strait, a strategic route for oil and liquified natural gas, as both sides ramp up pressure with talks set to resume.
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters on Monday: "We're hopeful there's a deal." "The president always prefers peaceful outcomes and negotiated outcomes to things." Araghchi, meanwhile, said on X that he too had come to "Geneva with real ideas to achieve a fair and equitable deal," but added there would be no "submission before threats."
The foreign minister also said he was meeting in Geneva with the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Grossi, "for deep technical discussion." The West fears the program is aimed at making a bomb, which Tehran denies. Washington has dispatched Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, the White House confirmed on Sunday.
On Friday, Trump said a change of government in Iran would be the "best thing that could happen," as he sent a second aircraft carrier to the Middle East to ratchet up military pressure. The first carrier dispatched to the region, the USS Abraham Lincoln, was positioned about 700 kilometers from the Iranian coast as of Sunday, new satellite images showed.
Iran's deputy foreign minister Majid Takht-Ravanchi told the BBC that Tehran would consider compromises on its uranium stockpile if Washington lifted sanctions that have crippled the country's economy. "If we see the sincerity on their (American) part, I am sure we will be on a road to have an agreement," he said.

Coles downplays meaning of 'Down Down' pricing in federal court case

Coles downplays meaning of 'Down Down' price tags and advertising in case against ACCC
Coles has downplayed what shoppers understood when they saw its "Down Down" price tags and advertising, saying "not much", on the second day of a bombshell federal court case.
The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) is suing Coles in a lawsuit described as "the case of the century" by a former ACCC boss.
Yesterday, the ACCC accused Coles of a "planned" campaign to mislead customers with fake or "illusory" discounts on hundreds of common household items from dog food to yoghurt and bottles of Coke.
The consumer watchdog claims the supermarket giant jacked up prices for a short time before cutting them and including items in the "Down Down" promotion.
It claims the "Down Down" price was actually more than, or the same as, the regular price.
In evidence this morning the judge overseeing the case, Justice Michael O'Bryan, asked Coles to explain what it was telling customers with its prominent marketing campaign, featuring giant red hands pointing down.
"It's really asking a bigger question about what ordinary consumers understand about the Down Down program," Justice O'Bryan said.
"I don't know if I've seen a statement from Coles which directly answers that question."
In response, legal counsel for Coles John Sheahan KC said: "In terms of what consumers would take from the advertising campaigns and the red hand — not much."
"It's an indication that Coles is trying to keep prices low," he said.
Justice O'Bryan probed further, asking if Coles would accept that "Down Down" was a promotion and showed a discount.
"Yes," Mr Sheahan responded.
'ACCC case too complicated': Coles
During today's proceedings, Coles began hitting back and pointing out what it saw as serious flaws in the consumer watchdog's case.
It spent much of the morning explaining the complex way in which it set and negotiated prices with suppliers and how it agreed to "Down Down" pricing.
This required detailed planning and forecasting as well as assessing whether a supplier could deliver the large quantities needed for a promotional discount, as it resulted in a steep increase in sales.
Mr Sheahan said the ACCC case was too complicated because it relied on an assumption that the average shopper understood the many factors that went into deciding a price while they were browsing the aisles.
"It's too complex to credibly attribute to an ordinary, reasonable consumer walking down the aisle at Coles," he said.
"What they would be concerned [about] when they're walking down the aisle … is whether the claimed discount was, to use of the expression yesterday 'fair dinkum.'"
Yesterday, the ACCC used three prices Coles charged for a tin of dog food to illustrate what it claimed was the misleading conduct.
For a period of almost 300 days between April 2022 and February 2023, Coles offered a 1.2 kilogram loaf of Nature's Gift Wet Dog Food for $4, ACCC legal counsel Garry Rich told the court.
Then for seven days the price rose by 50 per cent to $6.
On the eighth day the price was set at $4.50 — 13 per cent more than customers had been paying for all but seven of the previous 303 days — with Coles labelling the product "Down Down".
Mr Rich said while that statement was "literally true" it was also "utterly misleading".
"It did not disclose that a reasonable consumer would not have understood that Coles had increased the price to $6 for just seven days, immediately before the promotion, and that for 296 days before that, the price was $4," he said.
That line of argument was criticised by Coles.
"In the end, all prices are temporary. Nothing lasts forever," Mr Sheahan said.
He said both sides accepted that the pricing tickets customers were shown in store were "literally correct".
Mr Sheahan repeated Coles's defence that it also reflected a genuine discount.
If Coles added background information about the price history to the ticket it would be too difficult to understand, he said.
He added that for most of the 245 items the case was examining, Coles had not increased the price for a very short period.
With a few minor exceptions, the products were sold at the higher price for four to six weeks and a substantial volume was sold.
Coles also argued that the consumer watchdog had failed to establish what a regular price should be and how long it should be offered for.
The case continues over the next fortnight.

Trump takes a swipe at Marjorie ‘Traitor’ Greene as former congresswoman says she’s faced hundreds of death threats
Trump and Greene had a public falling out late last year over her support of releasing the Epstein files
- Bookmark

President Donald Trump has taken another swipe at Marjorie Taylor Greene, whom he’s called a “traitor,” as the former congresswoman says she’s faced hundreds of death threats.
Greene used to be one of Trump’s strongest supporters before a public falling out over issues, including the release of the so-called Epstein files, which culminated in the Georgia Republican’s resignation from Congress.
“We have a lot of people who want to take Marjorie ‘Traitor’ Greene’s place,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One Monday. “Many, many candidates and I have to choose one and they say whoever I endorse is going to win.”
Trump’s comments came a day after Greene spoke about the more than 700 death threats she has received after going against the president in the fight to release government documents related to the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.
“I started getting serious death threats—serious death threats. A pipe bomb death threat on my home, a pipe bomb death threat on my family construction business, and then direct death threats on my youngest child, my son,” Greene said in an interview with podcaster Jillian Michaels.
“We reported, I think, 773 official death threats, and they have to reach a certain criteria before we can report them to Capitol Police. And I dealt with that. But when they came in on my child, on my own child, based on the president’s language — and that’s what the death threats were, it was because he called me a traitor — my son is going to be threatened to be killed,” the former congresswoman continued.
Greene said that she sent the death threat about her son to top members of the Trump administration, including the president himself.
“The president himself texts me back and is very nasty and tells me that it’s my fault,” Greene said. “He blames me for the death threats coming in on my own son, has no compassion.”
The Independent has reached out to the White House for comment.
Amid their feud, Trump wrote on Truth Social last November that he was withdrawing his support for Greene, writing, “all I see ‘Wacky’ Marjorie do is COMPLAIN, COMPLAIN, COMPLAIN!”
“I understand that wonderful, Conservative people are thinking about primarying Marjorie in her District of Georgia, that they too are fed up with her and her antics and, if the right person runs, they will have my Complete and Unyielding Support,” Trump wrote.
Greene stood with only a few House Republicans who initially pushed for a bill to compel the Justice Department to release the Epstein files. Trump later signed the bill into law, despite being initially opposed to it, after mounting pressure from Congress. The Justice Department has since released millions of documents in connection with the disgraced financier.
During a CNN interview in November 2025, Greene said, “Everyone across the board agrees – release the Epstein files. So this is something that I get calls into my office almost every day about.”
Greene resigned from Congress in January. When announcing her decision in November, Greene said, “I have too much self respect and dignity, love my family way too much, and do not want my sweet district to have to endure a hurtful and hateful primary against me by the President we all fought for, only to fight and win my election while Republicans will likely lose the midterms.”
In reaction to her announcement, Trump wrote on Truth Social, “Marjorie ‘Traitor’ Brown, because of PLUMMETING Poll Numbers, and not wanting to face a Primary Challenger with a strong Trump Endorsement (where she would have no chance of winning!), has decided to call it ‘quits.’”
Greene defended her patriotism during her interview with Michaels, saying, “What he meant is I was a traitor to him, not to the country and not to the American people.”
The special election to fill Greene’s seat will take place on March 10.

Imran Khan's sons fear for his health, seek visas to visit him in Pakistan
Imran Khan's sons say they fear for their father's deteriorating health in a Pakistani jail and are seeking permission to visit the former prime minister, urging authorities to grant access after more than two years apart.
Khan's lawyer told Pakistan's Supreme Court last week that the ex-cricketer had lost significant vision in his right eye while in custody. A medical board said on Monday the swelling had reduced after treatment and his vision had improved.
Speaking to Reuters news agency in London, where they are based, Khan's sons, Kasim and Sulaiman, 26 and 29, said they were uncertain about the medical report. They spoke to their father on Thursday for the first time since September.
They said their father usually avoids discussing his health, but during the call he expressed frustration, saying he had been denied treatment for his eye for a few months.
"It's hard not to feel low at times because we've been away from him so long," Kasim said of his father, whom he and his brother call 'Abba', adding that he should be moved to a proper medical facility and have access to his private doctors.
Authorities say medical procedures are under way and reject opposition claims of neglect. The Supreme Court has sought details of his treatment.
JAILED SINCE AUGUST 2023
Khan, 73, has been jailed since August 2023 after convictions he and his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party call politically motivated.
Since his 2022 ouster in a no-confidence vote, he has faced multiple cases, including over state gifts and an unlawful marriage. Some convictions have been suspended or overturned, with appeals pending. He denies wrongdoing.
Kasim and Sulaiman were raised in Britain after Khan's divorce from their mother, British socialite and filmmaker Jemima Goldsmith. They have not seen their father since November 2022 after he survived an assassination attempt. They said they applied for visas last month but have yet to receive a response.
"Maybe the establishment is worried that if we go and see him it would create more noise, and just more attention to his situation," Sulaiman said, when asked why there could be a delay.
The Pakistani embassy in London and Pakistan's foreign ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Kasim said their immediate concern was his health, but there were other pressing issues, including "his freedom, abiding by correct human rights processes and also the rule of law and just ensuring that he's allowed a proper, fair trial".
Broadcast outlets have been restricted from airing Khan's name and speeches or even showing his image. Only a single court photograph has been publicly available since his imprisonment.
PTI swept to power in 2018 and retains a large support base across key provinces.
For four days, PTI supporters have blocked major highways linking Khyber Pakhtunkhwa to Punjab, stranding thousands of vehicles and affecting fuel and food supplies in some areas.
Asked if they had a message for Khan's supporters, Kasim asked them to "keep faith and keep fighting", adding: "It's the same kind of message we're trying to hold on to."

Hyatt hotel chain executive steps down after Epstein ties exposed
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
WASHINGTON – The executive chairman of the Hyatt hotel chain stepped down on Feb 16 after e-mails revealing his ties to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein
US businessman Thomas Pritzker maintained contact with Epstein well after the latter was convicted of soliciting prostitution from a minor in 2008.
Epstein died in prison in 2019 awaiting charges of sex trafficking girls, in what was ruled a suicide.
“Good stewardship... means protecting Hyatt, particularly in the context of my association with Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, which I deeply regret,” Mr Pritzker said in a statement picked up by US media.
Maxwell, Epstein’s associate, is serving a 20-year sentence for her role in a conspiracy to traffic girls
Hyatt in a statement said – without mentioning Epstein – that Mr Pritzker would retire from his role as executive chairman of the board of directors and that he would not seek re-election to the board at the company’s shareholders meeting in May.
US media reported on an e-mail exchange from 2018 where Epstein asked Mr Pritzker to help secure reservations for a woman travelling in Asia.
The woman told Mr Pritzker she was “going to try to find a new girlfriend for Jeffrey”, to which Mr Pritzker replied: “May the Force be with you.”
Files on Epstein released by the US government, including troves of his e-mail correspondence, have exposed his ties to the rich and powerful around the world.
Many have resigned from their positions in scandal and tainted by association with Epstein, even if the files do not prove they committed a crime.
Mr Pritzker is the cousin of Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker, a possible contender for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2028. AFP

‘Something has to change’: Cut cigarette tax or more people will get hurt, says Liberal MP

‘Something has to change’: Cut cigarette tax or more people will get hurt, says Liberal MP
A Liberal MP says excise on tobacco should be slashed back to where it was almost a decade ago, warning more innocent people will be hurt by organised criminals fighting to supply the illicit cigarette trade unless the current tax system is overhauled.
As the NSW government accused the federal government of contributing to the explosion in illicit tobacco by failing to prevent imports of illegal products, Mary Aldred said it was clear that years of higher excise rates were driving a social crisis that was doing severe damage to the federal budget.
This masthead reported on Monday new research by Oxford Economics, commissioned by one of the nation’s largest independent retailers, that backed a 30 per cent cut in excise as part of a broad suite of measures aimed at undermining the illegal tobacco trade.
The federal budget is facing a $67 billion shortfall in tobacco excise in the decade up to 2028-29 despite a steep rise in tax rates, with smokers moving to illicit products. Illegal cigarettes can be less than a third of the price of a legal product.
Aldred, whose electorate east of Melbourne has suffered cases of criminals selling illicit tobacco or trying to pressure legal sellers, said apart from cutting excise levels back to their 2017 level, the entire illegal tobacco issue should go to national cabinet for a co-ordinated approach.
A national taskforce headed by the Australian Federal Police should oversee a targeted policing response to the wave of criminal activity.
She said some of the country’s most notorious organised criminals were overseeing firebombings and ram raids that had cost the life of at least one person, Victorian woman Katie Tangey.
Aldred told his masthead: “I’m really worried we’re going to see more people hurt if we don’t do something different.
“The federal government is getting less revenue, more people are smoking and we’ve had the biggest increase in organised crime that we’ve seen in decades. Something has to change.”
Oxford Economics found that without a change to the tax structure and more stringent policing at the border and across retail outlets, 90 per cent of all cigarettes bought in Australia by the end of the decade would be illegal.
It found a deep cut in excise would be enough to encourage smokers to return to legal cigarettes.
The NSW government has previously backed a cut in tobacco excise.
NSW Health Minister Ryan Park said he would be receptive to “any policy measure” that reduced the use of tobacco, noting much of the illegal product was being imported.
“This public health failure has seen states and territories have to dedicate further resources in licensing, enforcement and in dealing with the healthcare challenges that result from it,” he said.
“In addition to the demand created by the excise, I am concerned about the influx of these products through our borders, and clearly there’s more to be done in that regard.”
New federal Liberal leader Angus Taylor noted the Coalition had gone to the last election promising to decriminalise vaping, arguing the current policy system was failing.
“I think we’ve got to be sensible about this and realise there’s a big problem, and the current way it’s being managed is not working,” he told The Kyle and Jackie O Show.
In his last budget, Treasurer Jim Chalmers unveiled a two-year, $150 million package targeted at the illicit tobacco trade. In the same budget, he revealed a near $17 billion downgrade in expected tobacco excise collections.
Prime Minister Anthony Albanese would not be drawn on whether the government would freeze or cut tobacco excise, saying it was an issue that would be dealt with in the budget.
But he signalled a further clampdown on the illegal trade was an option.
“There are two reasons why [the tobacco excise] was put in place. It’s not just about revenue,” he told ABC radio on Tuesday.
“It’s also about sending a message on health. And when it comes to illegal tobacco, we’re spending a lot of money as well. A lot of those taxes are going into clamping down on illegal tobacco and those criminals associated with it.”

Walmart’s Sam’s Club cracks China market formula even as foreign retailers shut shop
The warehouse retailer opened 10 new stores in 2025, accelerating expansion in smaller cities like Zhangjiagang and Yangzhou
US warehouse retailer Sam’s Club has gained traction among Chinese shoppers by strengthening localisation and launching more China-tailored products, continuing to expand even as many foreign retailers have scaled back their mainland operations or exited the market.
Instead of replicating its US model, Walmart-owned Sam’s Club has introduced products catering to local tastes, including copper gourd ornaments, ginseng and some traditional food items in the days leading up to the Lunar New Year holiday. Its stores have seen robust foot traffic, with some gift-box varieties such as nuts selling out.
Sam’s Club has also adjusted the packaging size of many Member’s Mark private-label products. For example, its roughly 1kg American-style steak has been reduced to between 450 grams and 800 grams to suit the living and storage conditions of Chinese households.
“Sam’s Club has managed to expand in China, largely because it has tapped into the rising demand for quality consumption among middle-class households,” said Fu Yifu, a special researcher at Su Merchants Bank in Nanjing, eastern Jiangsu province.
“Its localisation strategy has been tailored to Chinese consumers’ preferences, creating a competitive edge, while its instant delivery service addresses the pain point of bulk buying for immediate use.”

On a car-congested island, would you accept money not to drive?

On a car-congested island, would you accept money not to drive?
Valletta, Malta: How much cash would you ask for if you were paid to stop driving?
On a stunning island in Europe, crowded with history but choked with cars, the government came up with an idea to fix the traffic.
And the young people of the island had a quick response: No.
The Maltese government is struggling to get out of first gear with its plan to pay €25,000 over five years to anyone aged 18 to 30 who is willing to give up their driver’s licence.
The offer, worth about $42,000, is enough to buy a new car after the five years have expired. There might even be some spare change after the purchase of a Fiat 500 (from €20,000) or a Renault 4 electric vehicle (from €23,000).
But the money is not enough to convince the young to give up the freedom that comes from owning their own wheels.
“It’s a big thing, getting your licence,” says Gianluca Cremona, 18, an apprentice aviation mechanic.
“It’s a big part of being 18, driving around and having a bit of fun. So this idea doesn’t seem to sit right with a lot of people.”
It is not just that Cremona wants to drive to the beach with his friends. (He recommends Golden Bay and Ghadira, north-west of the capital, Valletta). It is his concern that public transport is not good enough.
So the government has a serious challenge. Malta now has 784 motor vehicles for every 1000 people, according to a national transport plan issued last year.
That is higher than other European Union countries, such as Poland, which has 703, or Italy, with 681. And Malta is the smallest nation state in the EU, with a land mass of just 316 square kilometres – less than half the size of the city of Canberra.
The country’s transport minister, Chris Bonett, is only counting on the licence incentive for some of the solution. Other ideas include a park-and-ride plan, more bus routes, a big investment in roads and an acceptance that remote working helps reduce traffic.
But the licence scheme is the talking point among the young. One concern is that the payments are spread over five years, at €5000 per year, so the recipients have to be patient. For most, however, the problem is the lack of alternatives to driving.
The Maltese National Youth Council says young people have repeatedly said that no financial incentive would convince them to give up their cars.
“Individuals cannot be expected to abandon private vehicles unless they are first provided with a public transport system that is reliable, efficient and trustworthy,” it says.
Visitors to Malta may not see this problem. Valletta and surrounding cities are ideal for walking or, better yet, catching a small boat across the harbour. Tourists can stroll from the 16th-century fortress walls to the tunnels of the Second World War within about 15 minutes, unless they stop at the cafes, bars and shops that line the streets.
Workers, however, have to battle the traffic. Cremona is at the start of his apprenticeship and expects to work long hours with a 6am start at the airport outside Valletta. Speaking to this masthead in the capital, he says he cannot do this by public transport.
“Buses? They’re not that reliable. We can all be honest about that. There’s no metro. That’s the main problem,” he says.
“It’s impossible to work without a car. It’s impossible to start your life properly without a car.”
Cremona has a solution for the government: change the incentive. He thinks the money should be offered to older people so they take their cars off the roads – starting with people aged over 70.
The government may find some young people willing to take up the offer. It has budgeted €25 million for the policy, which means only 1000 people have to accept.
Cremona will not be one of them. He wants to drive with his friends to places like Blue Grotto, a network of caves by the sea.
“It’s so amazing,” he says. “You can see the sunset – it’s beautiful. If you just go, drive around a bit, maybe stop and walk around, there are just so many places.”
Would he give that up for €25,000? No chance. You can’t put a price on freedom.

Sentences of up to 15 years for Tunisian synagogue attack
Tunisian courts handed down prison sentences of up to 15 years to five defendants tied to a deadly May 2023 attack on a synagogue on the island of Djerba, one of their lawyers told AFP Monday.
The attack on the Ghriba synagogue left five people dead, not including the assailant, a National Guard officer, who was killed during the attack.
A student and the attacker's fiancee, who were prosecuted for "complicity in homicide" and "membership in a terrorist group," were sentenced to three and eight years in prison respectively, said Nizar Ayed, lawyer for several victims of the attack.
According to Ayed, the assailant acted "as a lone wolf".
Two other defendants, whose exact roles were not disclosed, were sentenced to seven and 15 years' imprisonment, with the heavier penalty given out because the defendant had fled justice, according to the lawyer.
The assailant's sister, currently out on bail, was sentenced to one year in prison.
The defence for the accused will appeal, Mustapha Mlaouah, the fiancee's lawyer, said.
On May 9, 2023, the attacker killed three of his colleagues as well as two Jewish worshippers, Aviel Haddad, a 30-year-old Tunisian, and his cousin Benjamin, a 42-year-old French national.
He shot dead one colleague while working at the island's port and then drove to the synagogue, about 20 kilometres away, where hundreds of people were taking part in the third day of an annual Jewish pilgrimage.
There he killed the two Jewish men and wounded several officers providing security, two of whom died later from their wounds.
The student's mother told AFP during a hearing that her family merely rented a studio to the assailant.
"I sometimes cooked for him and asked my son to take him food -- our generosity backfired on us," said Latifa Jlidi.
Before independence in 1956, Tunisia had more than 100,000 Jews, but the community has since dwindled to around 1,500 members, the great majority living in Djerba.

Don't let the lie stand: Denounce the Israeli genocide claim, no matter who raises it - editorial
Unknown

The bald-faced lie that Israel committed genocide in Gaza is quickly becoming the 21st-century equivalent of the centuries-old blood libel against the Jewish people.
It has crept into mainstream global discourse, and unless massive efforts are made to debunk the false claims once and for all, when the history of the two-year Israel-Hamas War is taught in the decades to come, the focus will not be on the October 7 massacre and the cruel and inhumane treatment of hundreds of Israeli hostages. It will highlight the “genocide” that Israel committed against the Gazans.
The latest example – and one of the most vilifying – of genocide being bandied about matter-of-factly occurred late last week, when Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-New York) alleged at the Munich Security Conference that US aid to Israel had enabled genocide.
When asked by Haaretz reporter Hagar Shezaf if she thought “the Democratic presidential candidate in the 2028 elections should reevaluate military aid to Israel,” AOC, a touted Democratic candidate for the 2028 presidential election, responded with the mantra she’s spouted since the October 7 massacre: that Israel was indiscriminately killing Palestinians in Gaza.
“I think that personally, that the idea of completely unconditional aid, no matter what one does, does not make sense,” she said. “I think it enabled a genocide in Gaza, and I think that we have thousands of women and children dead that don’t, that was completely avoidable.”
Besides the dark irony of AOC’s attack on the Jewish state being stated in the birthplace of Adolf Hitler’s Nazi movement that carried out the Holocaust – the worst genocide in human history – her statement reveals how deeply the “genocide” lie has permeated into the mainstream diplomatic discourse.
Thankfully, the issue is coming to the forefront, thanks to an online campaign initiated by a group of respected Jewish thinkers, teachers, and writers not generally associated with the Right’s allegiance to the notion that Israel can do no wrong. Among the Israeli signatories are Rabbi Irving “Yitz” Greenberg, journalist and teacher Yossi Klein Halevi, and Rabbi Micha Odenheimer of Tevel b’Tzedek, an Israeli nonprofit.
They plainly but eloquently stated the obvious, which has been either ignored or disputed.
They wrote: “The unprecedented combat conditions of the war – hundreds of kilometers of tunnels, thousands of booby-trapped homes – the conflating of combatants with ‘journalists’ and ‘human rights workers,’ the ratio of civilian-to-terrorist casualties, considered low for asymmetrical urban warfare, the absence of mass starvation despite repeated claims of imminent catastrophe, the warnings given to civilians before attack: All these factors were erased in the eagerness to indict Israel for genocide.
“A crucial difference between war as tragedy and war as genocide is intent. In this war, only one side intended to commit genocide, and that is Hamas.
“To accuse Israel of genocide, the massacre of October 7 has been systematically downplayed, while Israeli actions have been distorted and amplified. Israel went to war on October 8, not out of vengeance, as its detractors claim, but to break the Iranian-led siege of terror enclaves on its borders, and to restore its deterrence, without which it cannot survive in the long term in the Middle East. Thousands of rockets and missiles were fired at Israel in the weeks following the massacre, while Hamas starved and tortured 250 Israelis, some of whom were murdered in captivity.”
On October 8, as Israel was still fighting terrorists within its border communities and hadn’t yet begun burying its dead, anti-Zionists began raising the cry of “genocide,” they wrote.
Genocide accusations used as pretext for excluding, attacking, and murdering Jews worldwide
The accusation of genocide, as uttered by AOC and hundreds of other public influential figures, has become a pretext for excluding, attacking, and even murdering Jews around the world. They clearly stated, adding that its purpose is to delegitimize Jewish self-determination and to turn the only Jewish state into the world’s arch criminal and pariah.
Urging both Jews and non-Jews to treat the accusation of genocide with revulsion – as the latest in a long history of lies about the Jewish people – the petitioners state at the end of their letter: “‘A lie has no legs,’ notes the ancient Hebrew proverb. We will not allow this lie to stand.”
It’s time for all of us to join these calls for reason and make our voices heard to denounce the claims of genocide whenever they are raised and by whoever raises them.

NYC staffer appointed by Mamdani says 'one Israeli left is too many' in resurfaced antisemitic post

A New York City Health Department staffer wished for all Israelis to be wiped off the Earth in a resurfaced X/Twitter post, Jewish watchdog group Canary Mission revealed on Monday.
Achmat Akkad, a community coordinator in NYC's health department since 2017, called for the eradication of Israelis on the social media platform, claiming that “one Israeli left in this world would be one too many!"
Among the other publications revealed by Canart Mission was a deleted November 10, 2021, post in which Akkad threatened that “Jews that don’t support apartheid are safe. Zionists aren’t!”
“Israel exists by sacrificing the blood of Black and brown people as an offering to white supremacy,” he said in another.
A year ago, Akkad also claimed that Zionists “are behind the attacks, far right parties being elected across the world, attacks on free speech, the wars in MENA, the dehumanization of Muslims, and an increase in police power."
According to Canary Mission, Akkad, who since 2025 has used the X handle @BlackIntifada, was arrested at an anti-Israel protest in 2024.
Akkad appointed by Mamdani
Multiple sources reported that NYC Mayor Zohran Mamdani appointed Akkad as a Community Engagement Training Specialist. The appointment comes amidst backlash following the establishment of the “Global Oppression and Public Health Working Group” under Mamdani’s administration.
The group, whose goal is to explore how global oppression affects the well-being of certain communities in the city, has been criticized for focusing on international politics rather than core public health responsibilities, according to The Algemeiner, a NYC-based newspaper covering Jewish affairs.
The New York Post reported that its participants, who often accuse Israel of genocide in Gaza, would meet "in the middle of the workday Tuesday at the agency's headquarters in Long Island City and remotely," while thousands of cases of flu and RSV spread across the five boroughs.
On Thursday, City Council Speaker Julie Menin called for a probe into the Department of Health over its “Global Oppression Working Group," alleging that taxpayer funds were being misused.
“Our health care officials should be fighting infectious diseases and addressing skyrocketing health care costs instead of spending public time debating geopolitics on city time,” Menin told The New York Post.

Ukraine-Russia war latest: Kyiv’s forces make huge gains on battlefield ahead of Geneva peace talks
Ukrainian forces take back over 200 sq km in just five days, wiping out weeks of Russian gains

Ukrainian soldiers have been able to make dramatic battlefield gains in the war-hit country’s east after Russian troops lost access to Starlink satellite internet, a US-based think tank said.
Ukrainian forces managed to recapture 201 sq km (78 sq miles) from Russia between Wednesday and Sunday, equivalent to the Russian gains for the entire month of December, data from the Institute for the Study of War showed.
This is the most land retaken by Kyiv’s forces in such a short period since a June 2023 counteroffensive, undoing weeks of Russian advances to the east of Zaporizhzhia city.
It comes ahead of the latest round of US-brokered peace talks between Russian and Ukrainian officials in Geneva later today.
The Kremlin has said the talks will focus on land, with Russia demanding that Ukraine cede the remaining 20 per cent of the eastern region of Donetsk that Moscow has failed to capture by force – something Kyiv refuses to do.
Ukraine sanctions 10 Russian athletes for supporting Putin's war
Ukraine has sanctioned at least 10 Russian athletes who have actively supported Russia’s aggression in Ukraine, president Volodymyr Zelensky said.
The sanctions will apply to sports figures who visited occupied Ukrainian territories, publicly defended Russia’s invasion and occupation, raised funds for Russian forces, or organised events for Ukrainian children forcibly abducted by Russia, the presidential office said.
“This Ukrainian sanctions package should be a signal to others around the world – a signal that one cannot simply turn a blind eye to support for aggression,” Zelensky said.
“When Ukrainians at the Olympics are forbidden to even mention the victims of Russian aggression, that is clearly a global rollback of justice. We will restore justice,” he added.
Ukrainian territory remains key talking point at Geneva peace talks
Representatives of Ukraine and Russia are set to meet in Geneva in a few hours' time for a fresh round of US-mediated peace talks that the Kremlin says are likely to focus on land, the main sticking point.
Russia is demanding that Ukraine cede the remaining 20 per cent of the eastern region of Donetsk that Moscow has failed to capture – something Kyiv refuses to do.
“This time, the idea is to discuss a broader range of issues, including, in fact, the main ones. The main issues concern both the territories and everything else related to the demands we have put forward," Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Monday.
The venue has switched to the Swiss lakeside city after Abu Dhabi hosted two rounds of talks that both sides described as constructive but which failed to reach any major breakthrough.
Poland shuts airports due to ongoing military operation
Authorities in Poland have temporarily closed airports in Rzeszow and Lublin because of military aviation operations, the Polish Air Navigation Services Agency (PANSA) said this morning.
Polish commanders said military aviation operations began in the country's airspace due to strikes by Russia's long-range air forces on Ukrainian territory.
Trump pressures Ukraine ahead of peace talks in Geneva
Donald Trump is pressuring Ukraine to reach a deal with Russia ahead of the US-brokered talks in Geneva today.
“It’s easy… Ukraine better come to the table, fast,” the US president said, speaking to the reporters onboard Air Force One while en route to Washington.
Officials in Kyiv confirmed a Ukrainian delegation was heading to Geneva on Monday for another round of talks with Russian officials, ahead of next week's fourth anniversary of Russia's full-scale invasion.
Trump’s remarks did not call for action from the Russian side, which has been seeking Ukraine’s territory and political concessions from Kyiv without budging from its demands.
Moscow wants Ukraine to cede the entirety of the Donbas area, including areas it has failed to capture by force.
Ukraine makes big gains as Putin’s troops suffer from Starlink shutdown
Ukrainian soldiers have been able to make dramatic battlefield gains in the war-hit country’s east after Russian troops lost access to Starlink satellite internet, a US-based think tank said.
Ukrainian forces managed to recapture 201 sq km (78 sq miles) from Russia between Wednesday and Sunday, equivalent to the Russian gains for the entire month of December, the ISW’s data showed.
This is the most land retaken by Kyiv’s forces in such a short period since a June 2023 counteroffensive. The territory secured by Ukraine is mostly to the east of Zaporizhzhia city, where Russian troops have made significant progress since mid-2025.
“These Ukrainian counterattacks are likely leveraging the recent block on Russian forces’ access to Starlink, which Russian milbloggers (military bloggers) have claimed is causing communications and command and control issues on the battlefield,” the ISW said.
Starlink internet terminals used by Russian troops in Ukraine were deactivated earlier this month, dealing what one official said was a big setback for Moscow that had disrupted assault operations.
Russian forces have made unauthorised use of thousands of satellite-based Starlink internet connections for secure communications since the invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Kyiv says.
Russian delegation arrives in Geneva for talks on Ukraine
The Russian delegation has arrived in Geneva for today's US-brokered peace talks on Ukraine, Russia’s news agency Interfax reported.
Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov has said the talks in Geneva will deal with a "broader range of issues related to the territories and other issues connected to the demands that we have” but didn't elaborate on the issues.
Russian president Vladimir Putin's adviser Vladimir Medinsky, who headed Moscow's team of negotiators in the first direct peace talks with Ukraine in Istanbul in March 2022 and who has forcefully pushed Putin's war goals, is returning to lead Moscow's delegation.
Medinsky has written several history books that focus on exposing purported Western plots against Russia and denigrate Ukraine.
Igor Kostyukov, the head of Russian military intelligence, and deputy foreign minister Mikhail Galuzin, along with other officials, will also be in the delegation, Peskov said.
Fire at Russia's Ilsky refinery after drone attack, officials say
A fire has been reported at a Russian oil refinery in Krasnodar region, officials said this morning, shortly after it came under attack from Ukrainian drones.
Local authorities said the fire was reported from Ilsky refinery and a reservoir with oil products was damaged.
Just hours earlier, the Russian defence ministry said at least 24 drones were downed over the Krasnodar region.

Russia downs 151 Ukrainian drones overnight
Russian air defence systems have shot down at least 151 Ukrainian drones overnight, the country’s defence ministry said this morning.
The drones were downed over the Black Sea, Crimea and other bordering regions, the defence ministry said in its Telegram.
Russia typically reports only how many drones its air defences say they downed, not how many Ukraine launched, and rarely discloses the full extent of damage unless civilians are killed or civilian sites are hit.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) will be analysing the DNA found in a pair of gloves near the house of Nancy Guthier, who has been missing ever since she was last seen on January 31, using the Combined DNA Index System (CODIS), the agency revealed on Monday.
The system is a national DNA database managed by the FBI that contains profiles from offenders and crime scenes to assist in investigations.
The investigation could make a key breakthrough if the DNA on the gloves matches a person or a crime scene in the database.
Currently, CODIS holds profiles for over 19 million offenders, has produced more than 781,492 hits, and has helped solve more than 758,449 investigations since November 2025, according to FBI data.
FBI's possible use of genealogy sites to find Guthrie
Another NewsNation report revealed that the bureau may be using genealogy sites to identify the owner of the gloves.
“I suspect they are doing parallel analyses right now in order to not waste any time,” CeCe Moore, a DNA expert, told NewsNation.
A separate report by Reuters explained that the family of Guthrie had been ruled out as possible suspects in a kidnapping scheme, after being cooperative and gracious as authorities investigated the kidnapping.
Nancy Guthrie's family has been cleared as possible suspects in her abduction, Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos said on Monday.
"To suggest otherwise is not only wrong, but it is also cruel," he said in a statement. "The Guthrie family is victims plain and simple."

Shares fall in Japan, while most of Asia's markets are shut for the Lunar New Year holiday
Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 index has fallen 1%, while most markets in Asia are closed for Lunar New Year holidays
- Bookmark
Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 index fell about 1% on Tuesday following a U.S. national holiday, while most markets in Asia were closed for Lunar New Year holidays.
U.S. futures declined and oil prices were mixed. Prices for gold and silver also fell.
Weak economic data released Monday appeared to be clouding sentiment in Tokyo, and a 6.2% decline for tech giant SoftBank Group also pulled shares lower. The decline follows a big rally after a resounding win for Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi’s ruling party in a Feb. 8 general election.
By midday, the Nikkei 225 was down 1% at 56,237.65.
Traders likely were locking in profits from the recent gains that took the Nikkei to record levels. Polls show Takaichi's popularity is slowly slipping, as hopes for economic revival from her plans to increase government spending and cut taxes subside.
In Australia, the S&P/ASX 200 gained 0.3% to 8,964.10, while India's Sensex edged 0.1% lower. In Thailand, the SET was down less than 0.2%.
European shares ended mixed on Monday and trading in the U.S. was closed for Presidents Day. U.S. markets are set to reopen Tuesday.
On Friday, the S&P 500 edged up less than 0.1% a day after one of its worst losses since Thanksgiving. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.1%, and the Nasdaq composite slipped 0.2%.
Share prices have been waxing and waning with fluctuations in confidence over massive investments in AI. Investors are also focused on inflation and how price pressures might affect interest rates.
In other dealings early Tuesday, benchmark U.S. crude rose 65 cents to $63.54 a barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, lost 29 cents to $68.36 a barrel.
The U.S. dollar slipped to 153.17 Japanese yen from 153.51 yen. The euro cost $1.1841, down from $1.1852.
The price of gold fell 1.4% and silver was down 3.4%.
Bitcoin fell 0.6% to about $68,500.

Trump says he will be involved 'indirectly' in US talks with Iran
'I'll be involved in those talks indirectly, and they'll be very important,' US president says, referring to upcoming negotiations in Geneva
WASHINGTON
President Donald Trump said he will be involved "indirectly" in nuclear talks between the US and Iran that will be held in Geneva on Tuesday.
"I'll be involved in those talks indirectly, and they'll be very important," Trump told reporters Monday en route to Washington when asked what he is expecting from the second round of the indirect nuclear negotiations.
"We'll see what can happen," he added.
Under the announced schedule, the talks are set to begin Tuesday morning under Omani mediation and will be hosted at the Embassy of Oman in the Swiss city.
Trump said Iran is "a very tough" negotiator.
"But I would say they are bad negotiators, as we could have had a deal instead of sending out B-2s to knock out their nuclear potential. We had to send the B-2s. I hope they are going to be more reasonable," he added, referring to the US stealth bombers that carried out the bombings on Iranian nuclear facilities during an escalation of the Iran–Israel conflict in June 2025.
Iran wants to make a deal, the president reiterated.
"I don't think they want the consequences of not making a deal. They want to make a deal," he said.
Iran and the US resumed indirect nuclear diplomacy in Muscat on Feb. 6 under Omani mediation, nearly eight months after talks were suspended following an Israeli attack on Iran that sparked a 12-day war.
Assessments from both sides were positive following the latest round of talks, which took place amid heightened tensions due to a US military buildup in the Persian Gulf region.
Uranium enrichment remains a key point of contention. Iran demands the lifting of Western economic sanctions in exchange for restricting its nuclear activities. The US, meanwhile, has called on Iran to fully halt enrichment and transfer its stockpile of highly enriched uranium abroad.
Washington has also sought to expand the scope of talks to include Iran’s ballistic missile program and its support for armed groups in the region while Tehran has repeatedly said it will negotiate only on its nuclear program.

Iraqi-UAE consortium plans $700 million data cable amid AI boom
An Iraqi-Emirati consortium is planning a $700 million subsea-and-terrestrial data cable linking the United Arab Emirates to Turkey via Iraq, one of the project's backers said, just over a week after the announcement of a Saudi-backed fibre-optic project in Syria.
Gulf neighbours Saudi Arabia and the UAE are each trying to tap into demand for connectivity in the region and become hubs for AI infrastructure, including data centers, amid wider economic and geopolitical competition across the region.
The Iraqi-UAE project, branded WorldLink, would comprise an undersea cable from the UAE to Iraq's Faw peninsula on the Gulf, which will then run overland north to the Turkish border, Ali El Akabi, head of Iraq's Tech 964 - one of the three members of the consortium - told Reuters news agency.
FIVE-YEAR PROGRAMME
El Akabi said the project would be privately funded and rolled out in phases over the next five years. It aims to ease congestion and reduce transit times versus the traditional paths that run through the Suez Canal.
The Emirati and Saudi governments did not comment to the latest reports.
Saudi Arabia and Syria announced on February 7 plans to set up a fibre-optic network under a wider investment package.
That project, dubbed SilkLink, is a roughly $1 billion push to rehabilitate Syria's infrastructure and position it as a data route between Asia and Europe.
In response to a request for comment on the UAE-Iraqi project, the Syrian telecoms ministry told Reuters in a statement: "Additional infrastructure investment improves route diversity and resilience for everyone."
"SilkLink is designed to deliver low-latency and high- availability... and we expect to be highly competitive on both performance and resilience," it said.
Besides Tech 964, WorldLink's sponsors include Iraq-Kurdish DIL Technologies and UAE-based Breeze Investments.
"AI infrastructure readiness is a necessity as we witness its adoption worldwide," said Nayef Al Ameri, chairman of Breeze Investments, in a statement. "WorldLink is designed to deliver the fastest and most reliable connectivity in the region serving these needs."
Iraq, which is trying to market itself as a stable transit corridor after decades of conflict, launched a $17 billion "Development Road" rail-and-road plan in 2023 to connect Faw to Turkey.

The big stink over a plan for more than 1000 homes

The big stink over a plan for more than 1000 homes
A Cranbourne golf club established in the 1950s by Melbourne Jews who had been barred from other courses due to antisemitism will be closed down and potentially redeveloped into a new suburb with more than 1000 homes, under a local council proposal.
Part of the planned housing estate would be built within the buffer zone of one of Melbourne’s largest active landfills, whose owner was fined a record $1 million in November for its failure to manage odour and leaching.
Planning officers have recommended City of Casey councillors approve carving up the northern half of the 70.4-hectare Cranbourne Golf Club, arguing it is a rare opportunity to provide large-scale housing in an established suburb, rather than on the sprawling fringe.
But residents’ groups have urged the council to reject the proposal at a meeting on Tuesday night, given its proximity to a landfill with a poor record of environmental breaches.
The proposed subdivision of the golf club marks the first time councillors in the area will vote on a significant development since a previous council was sacked in 2020 over a corruption scandal involving alleged private payments for favourable development decisions.
The Independent Broad-based Anti-Corruption Commission charged former Casey mayor Sam Aziz and consultant John Woodman over their alleged part in the bribery scandal in September, following a five-year investigation.
Councillors called in the golf club proposal for a vote in December, owing to its broad community interest. Previous planning decisions have been delegated to council officers since the council was reformed in November 2024.
The Casey Residents and Ratepayers Association has objected to the proposed redevelopment, arguing housing would be situated unacceptably close to Veolia’s Hampton Park landfill, which is licensed until 2040.
Veolia was ordered to pay a record $1 million to a community fund in November for its failures to manage noxious gas emissions and contaminated liquids at the landfill site.
The penalty, issued in the Supreme Court, was the largest given since Victoria’s Environment Protection Authority had its powers to pursue breaches of “general environmental duty” strengthened in 2021.
Part of the golf course lies within the EPA’s 1500-metre landfill separation buffer for human health and amenity impacts. Council officers’ recommendation for the development relies on an assessment that homes can be built within 1000 metres of the landfill if odour and leachate is properly managed.
Association president Anthony Tassone said residents were deeply concerned about the prospect of homes being built inside an active-landfill buffer.
“The former Cranbourne Golf Course sits about 1.25 to 1.3 kilometres from the Hallam Road landfill, which remains licensed until 2040 and falls within the EPA’s default 1.5-kilometre separation distance.
“While developer-appointed consultants have reportedly described the odour risk as low, no independent, peer-reviewed assessment endorsed by the EPA has been publicly released to justify reducing that buffer. Until that occurs, the precautionary principle should apply,” Tassone said.
“Approving housing closer to an active landfill without transparent, independently verified evidence that it is safe simply shifts risk onto future residents and the existing community.”
Veolia aims to close the landfill before its licence expires in 2040 and convert part of the site into a waste transfer station.
The proposal remains deadlocked, after the EPA rejected Veolia’s application last April, finding the transfer station presented “unacceptable risk to human health … primarily from odour and noise emissions”.
Veolia appealed through VCAT and a judgment is pending.
Nine south-eastern suburbs councils, including Casey, have signed contracts to supply kerbside rubbish to the facility.
Lynbrook Residents Association president Scott Watson said the council should, at the very least, wait until the VCAT judgment has been published.
“How on earth can they possibly consider to put hundreds of additional homes within the buffer when the EPA have said the current proposal for a waste to energy facility is not safe? It’s illogical to even consider approving this when it’s still up before VCAT,” Watson said.
Cranbourne Golf Club is due to close on February 28, after 72 years.
The land was previously owned by the Cranbourne Country Club, which sold it to developer and former Carlton footballer Fraser Brown for a reported $190 million.
Country club president Bradley Wein said the golf club had lost many of its members because Jewish golfers no longer face the same discrimination they did when the course was opened.
“Our role as the owner of the land was founded 70 years ago with a view to promote Jewish golf through the community, because of antisemitism that was around in the 1950s when Jewish people couldn’t get into other clubs. But that’s largely changed now. The club lost its purpose for many Jewish members, and they’ve gone to other clubs,” Wein said.
He said no club member had ever raised the issue of odour from the landfill.
“I used to play there regularly. I don’t think that there was any particular problem with odour, but I don’t live in the area, so I don’t know what it’s like at 2am,” he said.

Australia won't repatriate 34 women and children from Syria
Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese says his government will not repatriate from Syria a group of 34 women and children with alleged ties to the Islamic State group
- Bookmark
The Australian government will not repatriate from Syria a group of 34 women and children with alleged ties to the Islamic State group, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said Tuesday.
The women and children from 11 families were supposed to fly from the Syrian capital Damascus to Australia but Syrian authorities on Monday turned them back to Roj camp in northeast Syria because of procedural problems, officials said.
Only two groups of Australians have been repatriated with government help from Syrian camps since the fall of the Islamic State group in 2019. Other Australians have also returned without government assistance.
Albanese would not comment on a report that the latest women and children had Australian passports.
“We’re providing absolutely no support and we are not repatriating people,” Albanese told Australian Broadcasting Corp. in Melbourne.
“We have no sympathy, frankly, for people who traveled overseas in order to participate in what was an attempt to establish a caliphate to undermine, destroy, our way of life. And so, as my mother would say, ‘You make your bed, you lie in it,’” Albanese added.
Albanese noted that the child welfare-focused international charity Save the Children had failed to establish in Australia’s courts that the Australian government had a responsibility to repatriate citizens from Syrian camps.
After the federal court ruled in the government's favor in 2024, Save the Children Australia chief executive Mat Tinkler argued the government had a moral, if not legal, obligation to repatriate families.
Albanese said if the latest group made their way to Australia without government help, they could be charged.
It was an offense under Australian law to travel to the former Islamic State stronghold of al-Raqqa province without a legitimate reason from 2014 to 2017. The maximum penalty was 10 years in prison.
“It’s unfortunate that children are impacted by this as well, but we are not providing any support. And if anyone does manage to find their way back to Australia, then they’ll face the full force of the law, if any laws have been broken,” Albanese added.
The last group of Australians to be repatriated from Syrian camps arrived in Sydney in October 2022.
They were four mothers, former partners of Islamic State supporters, and 13 children.
Australian officials had assessed the group as the most vulnerable among 60 Australian women and children held in Roj camp, the government said at the time.
Eight offspring of two slain Australian Islamic State fighters were repatriated from Syria in 2019 by the conservative government that preceded Albanese’s center-left Labor Party administration.
The issue of Islamic State supporters resurfaced in Australia after the killings of 15 people at a Jewish festival at Bondi Beach on Dec. 14. The attackers were allegedly inspired by IS.

Olympio drill core lights up with visible gold in Quebec

Olympio drill core lights up with visible gold in Quebec
Brought to you by BULLS N’ BEARS
Olympio Metals has sparked excitement in Quebec after intersecting multiple occurrences of visible gold in phase two diamond drilling at its Paquin prospect, part of the company’s Bousquet gold project on the world-class Cadillac Break.
The fourth hole of an eight-hole program snagged visible gold in a 6.25m zone from 182.75m to 189m, hosted in dark smoky-black quartz veining with associated sulphides and strong carbonate-chlorite alteration.
Logging by geologists showed common black quartz veining and sulphides reaching up to 5 per cent, with visible gold grains noted throughout the interval. Pending assays are eagerly awaiting to confirm the visual logging.
Notably, the new hole is not an isolated flash in the pan. It follows up on strong 2025 drilling, which delivered standout grades, including 1.5m running an eye-watering 54.2 grams per tonne (g/t) gold from 235.5m and another 6.4-metre hit grading a stellar 6.54g/t from 183m.
‘We are delighted to see significant visible gold in the fourth hole of our follow-up program at Paquin.’Olympio Metals managing director Sean Delaney
Earlier drill holes have already revealed gold specks trapped in quartz veins, suggesting a healthy dose of free gold, which is always the simplest and cheapest to process. The repeat appearance of visible gold in smoky quartz veins at Paquin could therefore be a classic calling card of a high-grade system starting to show its hand.
Olympio Metals managing director Sean Delaney said: “We are delighted to see significant visible gold in the fourth hole of our follow-up program at Paquin. Hole BO-26-63 has confirmed the potential of the main lode at Paquin.”
The gold-laden drill hole was deliberately drilled from a different azimuth to previous holes to better understand the geometry of the lode. The result has strengthened the structural model, intersecting the main lode from a new angle and confirming continuity of the quartz-sulphide system.
Assays from the current program are due next month. While visual gold is never a substitute for laboratory results, the combination of coarse gold, thick quartz veining and strong sulphide development provides a compelling visual indicator.
The geology reads like a textbook Abitibi shear-hosted system, where Archean-aged greenstones of eastern Canada funnel gold into smoky blue-grey quartz veins developed within east–west striking, north-dipping shear zones. The mineralisation at Paquin occurs in silicified and carbonate-altered greywackes, with visible gold associated with the sulphide minerals arsenopyrite, pyrite and pyrrhotite.
Strategically, Bousquet sits in established mining country, about 30km east of Rouyn-Noranda in Quebec, one of the world’s most mining-friendly jurisdictions. The project area commands a 10-kilometre stretch of the Cadillac Break, a legendary regional structure teeming with world-class gold deposits and more than 110 million ounces to its name.
Just 15km west is the famed Bousquet Mining Camp, where heavyweights such as Agnico Eagle’s 15-million-ounce La Ronde and Iamgold’s 2.4-million-ounce Westwood reside. Olympio believes its Paquin mineralisation echoes the nearby O’Brien project, which has one million ounces of gold.
Olympio holds an option to acquire up to an 80 per cent interest in the Bousquet project, with Bullion Gold retaining a 20 per cent carried interest. To date, the company has completed nearly C$1 million in exploration spending and made C$0.30 million in payments, steadily advancing its foothold in the district.
With phase two drilling ongoing, historical high-grade intercepts already on the board and fresh visible gold now lighting up the core trays, the next catalyst will be the assays.
If the lab confirms what the eye can see, Olympio may have something far more than just another shear-hosted showing along the Cadillac Break.

Sydney stabbing: man killed in ‘random’ attack on busy shopping street
Emergency services rushed to the Merrylands shopping strip after reports that a man had stabbed multiple people before fleeing on foot
Emergency services were called to a suburb in Sydney’s west at about 10am after reports that a man had stabbed multiple people before fleeing on foot, New South Wales Police said in a statement. The stabbing took place along a busy shopping strip.
Paramedics treated three people for serious injuries, including a man aged in his thirties or forties who died at the scene, Police Superintendent Simon Glasser said.
The other two victims, a 22-year-old man and a 47-year-old woman, were taken to hospital in critical condition, he added.
Glasser said a man had been arrested a short time later following a police operation in the area.

WASHINGTON, February 17. /TASS/. US weapons orders have exceeded $900 billion but allies and partners have to wait for the deliveries, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Pentagon chief Pete Hegseth said in an op-ed for the USA Today.
"US defense sales remain at an all-time high with 43% of the global market share," the op-ed reads, adding that over 16,000 current orders "total more than $900 billion."
However, Rubio and Hegseth note that "allies and partners who willingly offer advanced payments must wait patiently, often several years, until we have produced enough systems to exceed our needs and begin to meet theirs." Meanwhile, lengthy timelines tempt US allies "to look to other suppliers who claim they can deliver faster, even if they offer inferior products."
The op-ed notes that the US administration had to find a new way of managing weapons sales after the previous strategy proved ineffective. The new strategy is aimed at "shortening the wait times and lowering the costs." According to Rubio and Hegseth, "it revitalizes the American defense industrial base with growth and increased production capacity, and it means unlocking hundreds of billions in additional investment for production lines."

Iran's Revolutionary Guards begin military drills in Strait of Hormuz
Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps on Monday began a series of military exercises in the Strait of Hormuz, state media reported, on the eve of talks with the United States.
The war games, the duration of which was not specified, aim to prepare the Guards for "potential security and military threats" in the strait, state TV said, after the United States deployed a large naval force to the area.
Iranian hardline politicians have repeatedly threatened to block the strait, especially during times of heightened tensions with the United States, but it has never been closed.
Around a quarter of all seaborne oil and a fifth of the world's liquified natural gas transit through the strait, according to the International Energy Agency.
The exercises, overseen by Guards chief General Mohammad Pakpour, aim to bolster the IRGC's ability to react quickly, Iranian media reported. The Guards are the ideological arm of Iran's military.
The Guards initiated the drills from Abu Musa Island -- Iran's southernmost territorial point -- with Pakpour saying forces built "a strong fortress all around the island," according to state television.
The report said island-based units in the Gulf can act without mainland support, with missiles able to "destroy enemy destroyers within a radius of 1,000 kilometres."
It also showed a blurred video of a drone, but avoided giving operational details, which remained classified.
The drills were taking place as Tehran and Washington prepared for a new round of talks in Geneva on Tuesday, mediated by Oman. It also comes at a time of heavy US military deployment in the region.
The decades-long adversaries resumed negotiations on February 6 in Oman, their first since diplomacy collapsed last June when Israel sparked a 12-day war with surprise strikes on Iran, which the United States briefly joined to strike Iranian nuclear facilities.
US President Donald Trump has been pressuring Iran to reach an agreement, especially with recent US naval force deployments to the region that he has described as an "armada".
After sending the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln and escort battleships to the Gulf in January, Trump said on Friday that a second supercarrier, the Gerald R. Ford, would depart "very soon" for the Middle East.
On Monday, IRGC navy official Mohammad Akbarzadeh warned that all foreign ships in the region were "under full intelligence surveillance and within the reach of our defence power".
"The armed forces are fully prepared, monitoring the enemy's movements and never ignoring threats," the state-run IRNA news agency reported him saying.

Train derails in Switzerland, injuring five amid avalanches in the Alps

Train derails in Switzerland, injuring five amid avalanches in the Alps
The accident, near the town of Goppenstein, occurred as the region is under its second-highest avalanche warning, a level four out of five.
A regional train has derailed in southern Switzerland, injuring five people, police said, as the risk of avalanches in the region has reached its second-highest level.
The accident on Monday near the town of Goppenstein occurred amid heavy snow and at an altitude of 1,216 metres (4,000 feet), according to the AFP news agency.
“According to initial findings, an avalanche may have crossed the tracks shortly before the train passed,” police said, adding that the public prosecutor’s office has opened an investigation.
“Five people were injured. One of them was taken to hospital,” police added.
The train accident follows a series of deadly avalanches across the Alps in recent days involving skiers.
On Friday, three skiers were killed after being swept away by an avalanche in the upmarket French Alpine resort of Val d’Isere.
Cedric Bonnevie, who oversees the resort’s pistes, said one of the victims was a French national while the others were foreign citizens.
He said one victim appeared to have been caught in the avalanche high on the mountain slope, while the other two were part of a group of five, including a professional guide, lower on the mountain face and did not see the avalanche approaching.
In Italy, rescuers said last week that a record 13 backcountry skiers, climbers and hikers had died in the mountains over the previous seven days, including 10 in avalanches triggered by an exceptionally unstable snowpack.
Fresh snowfall during recent storms, combined with windswept snow sitting on weak internal layers, has created especially dangerous conditions across the Alpine arc bordering France, Switzerland, Austria and Italy, Italy’s Alpine Rescue said.
“Under such conditions, the passage of a single skier, or natural overloading from the weight of snow, can be sufficient to trigger an avalanche,” Federico Catania, Alpine Rescue’s spokesperson, said.
The avalanche deaths have occurred on ungroomed mountain slopes, away from the well-maintained and monitored Winter Olympic sites in Lombardy near the Swiss border, Cortina d’Ampezzo in Veneto, and the cross-country skiing venues in Val di Fiemme, within the autonomous province of Trentino.

The future of ECU’s decommissioned Mount Lawley campus revealed
Up to 1100 homes will be built on the old Edith Cowan University campus in Mount Lawley, but that likely won’t occur until 2030, Housing Minister John Carey has revealed.
Carey and Creative Industries Minister Simone McGurk revealed the masterplan for the 18.6 hectare site on prized inner-city land on Tuesday.
The masterplan includes between 900 and 1100 homes, which will be a mix of medium-density terrace housing and some apartment towers alongside a new shopping precinct.
The plan also includes a new primary school and repurposed ECU library and WA Academy of Performing Arts buildings that will become a “creative hub”.
“I think we’ve struck the balance right here,” Carey said.
“I think what people will be really excited about ... more is that we are retaining the WAAPA facilities.
“It would have been, perhaps, easier just to have demolished it all and started again, but retaining the WAAPA facilities is in line with our commitments, but also the recognition that this place does have history.
“You can’t ignore it. It’s a beloved tradition held by the local community, and we’re recognising that.”
With the state in the grips of a housing crisis, Carey conceded this would be a long-term project.
He said the campus wouldn’t be handed back to the government until the end of the year and there was still lots of work to do in terms of a structure plan and remediation works of the site.
“I’ve learned that these can be challenging sites. That’s why I’m always up front. This is a long-term project, but I think everyone would agree there’s a huge opportunity here to create an incredible urban village with a creative hub, new housing, green spaces,” he said.
The campus is largely empty after the $853 million ECU city campus opened this week, where most of the ECU Mount Lawley and WAAPA teaching activity now takes place.
The creative hub, which will use the old WAAPA buildings, would be used by community groups and businesses.
McGurk said she was confident it wouldn’t be a white elephant.
“I understand those concerns. It is quite a big footprint, but there is also quite a bit of demand for fit for purpose space, performance space and rehearsal space for our creative industries,” she said.

The second round of negotiations between Iran and the United States, which will begin on Tuesday in Geneva, is expected to be more detailed and concrete than the exploratory talks held 11 days ago in Oman. According to media reports, Iran is expected to offer to dilute its stockpile of 60 percent enriched uranium to a lower level of enrichment as a goodwill gesture, in exchange for the removal of sanctions.

Why the harsh words between China and India over a remote, inhospitable valley?
Verbal sparring has thrown an obscure footnote in border tensions into the limelight and exposed the complexities left behind by history
In January, India’s external affairs ministry said the stretch was “Indian territory” and that it had “consistently protested with the Chinese side against attempts to alter the ground reality”.
Beijing responded that the area “belongs to China”, adding that it was “fully justified” in conducting infrastructure construction “on its own territory”.
The exchange also showed how the ghosts of colonial empires and their geopolitical rivalries of more than one and a half centuries ago continue to haunt the world’s two most populous nations in an era increasingly characterised by great power competition.
Where is the region and why is it contentious?
Shaksgam Valley, also referred to as Kelechin Valley, is considered a major segment of the so-called Trans-Karakoram Tract, stretching across nearly 5,000 sq km (1,930 square miles), almost four times the size of New York City.

Who are France's second-home owners?

Ahead of France's municipal elections on March 15 and 22, second homes have emerged as a key issue in local campaigns. In several tourist towns, debates have focused on the electoral weight of second-home owners and questions of taxation. Often blamed for the housing crisis, these residences have become a lightning rod for tensions, as owners are accused of worsening the shortage of available homes and fueling soaring prices.
But behind these criticisms, the reality is more nuanced. How many second homes are there in France, and where are they concentrated? Le Monde analyzed how the phenomenon has evolved and the many different uses that the term "second home" encompasses. Our research shows that these homes do not form a monolithic bloc that would require a single type of political response.
A figure that has remained steady for 10 years
In 2025, there were 3.7 million second homes, representing 9.8% of all housing in France, according to public data. The increase seen between 1980 and 1990, driven by tax and real estate incentives along coastal areas and in ski resorts, was followed by a stabilization in the number of second homes.
This has resulted in a highly uneven distribution of these "part-time" residences across the country. Nearly 40% are concentrated along the coasts, notably the Atlantic and Mediterranean shores, as well as in Corsica, while 16% are located in mountain areas, mainly in the Alps and Pyrénées. The national record is found in Germ, in the Pyrénées: In this small town with 33 residents, 97.2% of homes are second residences.

Hume, Wilson to lead Taylor’s economic team, Paterson set for move to defence
Updated ,first published
Deputy Liberal leader Jane Hume and Goldstein MP Tim Wilson will lead the opposition’s effort to regain the party’s image as better managers of the economy in Angus Taylor’s new-look frontbench.
The new opposition leader revealed his new team in Sydney on Tuesday afternoon, four days after toppling Sussan Ley, and was calling MPs who were promoted during the morning.
Wilson is the new shadow treasurer, while Hume, who is entitled to pick her portfolio as deputy leader, will be the productivity and industrial relations spokeswoman. Both are classic free-market moderates from inner-city Melbourne.
Hume will not hold the finance portfolio that she held alongside Taylor as shadow treasurer last term, when the Peter Dutton-led opposition was panned for its economic offering and the Coalition suffered an embarrassing defeat. The finance spokeswoman will be Tasmanian senator Claire Chandler.
In another key move, Senator James Paterson has shifted from finance to defence, the portfolio held by Taylor before he became leader. Paterson was an important player in rallying support for Taylor to take over.
Ted O’Brien, a Mandarin speaker who was deputy leader under Sussan Ley, will become foreign affairs spokesman and remain in shadow cabinet. Moderate senator Andrew Bragg, another Ley backer, retains the housing portfolio and will take on the role of environment spokesman.
Taylor was still making calls to winners and losers about lunchtime on Tuesday before a mid-afternoon announcement.
A group of ardent Ley backers were cut from the shadow cabinet, including Andrew Wallace, Alex Hawke, Maria Kovacic, Melissa Price, Kerrynne Liddle, and Paul Scarr.
Taylor promoted Andrew Hastie back to the frontbench as industry spokesman, while Jacinta Nampijinpa Price (small business, skills and training), Sarah Henderson (communications), Tony Pasin (government waste) were all promoted.
A group of younger MPs, including Phil Thompson (defence material), Matt O’Sullivan (childcare), Aaron Violi (science and innovation), and Simon Kennedy (assistant minister to the leader of the opposition) have all been given promotions.

Measuring the deep tech gender gap

A new EU-backed study sheds light on the gender gap in investments across Europe, with a particular focus on deep tech — a category of innovation that is central to Europe’s long-term competitiveness, security and economic resilience.
Deep tech refers to companies built on scientific breakthroughs and advanced engineering, often emerging from research laboratories and universities. These include firms working in areas such as artificial intelligence, advanced materials, semiconductors, robotics, quantum technologies, climate and energy systems, health and biotech, and industrial technologies. Unlike many consumer-facing digital startups, deep-tech companies typically require long development timelines, specialized talent and significant upfront capital before reaching market.
For the EU, deep tech is strategic. It underpins the green and digital transitions, strengthens industrial leadership, and reduces dependence on external technologies in critical areas such as energy, health and security. Ensuring that talent can access capital in these sectors is therefore not only a question of fairness — it is a question of Europe’s ability to compete globally.

Australia police recover trove of ancient Egyptian artefacts stolen during museum heist
Looted artefacts include 2,600-year-old wooden cat figurine, a mummy mask and an ancient necklace
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
Australian police have charged a 52-year-old man after a robbery at a museum in the town of Caboolture and recovered a cache of stolen ancient Egyptian artefacts.
Investigators claimed that the man broke into the Abbey Museum of Art and Archaeology in Caboolture, north of Brisbane, at about 3am local time on Friday and stole several “priceless” items.
Local media identified the man as Miguel Simon Mungarrieta Monsalve. He reportedly told the police that he believed it was his “duty” to return the artefacts to their “rightful place”.
The stolen items included a rare painted wooden cat figurine from Egypt’s 26th Dynasty, a 3,300-year-old necklace, a mummy mask verified by the British Museum, and other jewellery.
Police said most of the artefacts were found the next day in a car at a ferry terminal south of the museum, with only minor damage.
The remaining wooden cat sculpture – believed to be about 2,600 years old – was allegedly discovered later when the suspect was arrested on Russell Island, off the coast of Queensland, NBC News reported.
The man has now been charged with breaking and entering, along with three counts of wilful damage, according to the Guardian.
Earlier, the museum’s events and public programmes manager, Joel Stephens, said the stolen items were part of the museum’s educational programme.
“For us it’s devastating and heartbreaking. We have over 10,000 school students every year come through the museum, engage in both our archaeological digs and also come through the museum and learn about world history.
“These pieces are part of our signature collection and [are] really significant to that education programme.”
According to the public broadcaster Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), the suspect had told the police earlier that he did not believe the museum should have had the artefacts in its possession because of the institution’s links to the “Catholic Church”.
“The defendant believed it was his duty to acquire the artefacts and return them to their rightful place …,” the police prosecutor told the court. “It’s not the right place to have [them]. In addition, he’s also got the artefacts wrapped up in his country flag.” The suspect is originally from Venezuela and was living in a van.
Magistrate Deborah Vasta was quoted as saying by ABC Mr Monsalve’s "bizarre" alleged offence as akin to "something from a 'Simpsons' episode" had it not been so serious.
Prosecutors alleged in court on Monday he also caused “irreparable damage” to other objects during the burglary.
The museum later said that they were “relieved” to get the artefacts back. However, it said that “each piece must first undergo professional assessment and conservation to protect its long-term future”.
Earlier, museum manager Nina Pye urged the thief to return the items, saying: “If they’re damaging them they have no value regardless. Bring it back where it can benefit the community and education as a whole.”
Mr Monsalve was refused bail.

Angus Taylor unveils shadow ministry

Angus Taylor reveals shadow ministry, elevating Andrew Hastie and Jacinta Nampijinpa Price
In short:
Angus Taylor has announced his new shadow ministry.
The new Liberal leader has promoted right-faction supporters including Andrew Hastie and Jacinta Nampijinpa Price.
Mr Taylor has indicated that the economy, home ownership and immigration are the priorities he intends to address as leader.
Angus Taylor has elevated a new generation of right-faction Liberals into his new-look shadow ministry and reinstated the suspended Nationals to the Coalition front bench.
The federal opposition leader unveiled his senior team on Tuesday afternoon in Sydney, confirming the promotion of prominent figures like West Australian MP Andrew Hastie and Northern Territory senator Jacinta Nampijinpa Price.
"This is a team that blends proven experience with the next generation of Coalition talent," Mr Taylor said.
"The team is designed to do two key things — one, prosecute Labor's failures … and two, ensure the Coalition changes Australia for the better."
To make room for his appointments, Mr Taylor has dumped key supporters of Sussan Ley, who he defeated in a Liberal leadership ballot 34-17 last week, to the backbench.
Mr Taylor has also allowed Nationals MPs and senators serving a six-week suspension from the front bench as part of the Coalition reunion negotiated by Ms Ley and Nationals Leader David Littleproud to return to their respective roles immediately.
"Today marks a fresh beginning," Mr Taylor said.
"An opportunity to put the past behind us. Historically, strength comes through unity.
"I think it's signalling a strong reset, an important reset in the leadership.
"It's time to get on with it and get back to the unified Coalition we know has been such a strength for our side of politics and such a strength for this nation."
'Next generation' refresh
Mr Hastie will be the opposition's shadow industry and sovereign capability minister, while Senator Nampijinpa Price has been appointed as shadow skills, training and small business minister.
Goldstein MP Tim Wilson, a moderate and one of the few inner-city based Liberals in parliament, has been elevated to shadow treasurer, replacing former deputy Liberal leader Ted O'Brien.
Senator Jane Hume, who as deputy Liberal leader is able to choose her role, will have a broad economic remit as shadow minister for employment and industrial relations, as well as productivity and deregulation.
"Without productivity, we simply cannot have rising wages without inflation, without productivity, we cannot have a growing economy that will deliver the prosperity and promise for future generations," Senator Hume said.
"This will be my relentless focus."
Taylor supporters main winners in reshuffle
Most of the major changes benefited right-faction Liberals, with Tasmanian senator Claire Chandler promoted to shadow finance and public service minister and Victorian senator James Paterson moved to defence.
Herbert MP Phil Thompson has been lifted into the shadow cabinet with the defence industry and personnel portfolios, as has Victorian senator Sarah Henderson, as shadow communications and digital safety minister.
Casey MP Aaron Violi has been promoted to the outer shadow ministry in a broad portfolio including science, technology, cyber security and the digital economy.
Joining him in the outer ministry will be West Australian senator Matt O'Sullivan in a rebadged portfolio titled shadow minister for choice in child care and early learning.
Broad shake-up across Liberal ranks
Mr O'Brien has been given foreign affairs, with WA senator Michaelia Cash shifting from that portfolio to instead take on the shadow attorney-general position.
NSW senator Andrew Bragg will remain as shadow housing and homelessness minister and also added environment to his role, while Wannon MP Dan Tehan has retained shadow energy and emissions reduction minister.
Tasmanian senator Jonno Duniam stays as shadow home affairs minister and also has responsibility for immigration, while South Australian senator Anne Ruston keeps the health and aged care portfolio.
Lindsay MP Melissa McIntosh has been given a range of shadow cabinet roles, including women, NDIS, families and social services.
Berowra MP Julian Leeser will remain in the shadow cabinet with the Indigenous Australians and education portfolios.
Ley backers move to backbench
Supporters of Ms Ley, including Queensland senator Paul Scarr, MP Alex Hawke, Wright MP Scott Buchholz, Durack MP Melissa Price and Fisher MP Andrew Wallace, were booted from the shadow ministry.
Moncrieff MP Angie Bell has been moved backwards to an outer ministry role covering sport, youth and art.
Queensland senator James McGrath has also been shifted to the outer ministry as shadow urban infrastructure and cities minister and shadow special minister of state.
Mr Taylor thanked the outgoing members of the shadow ministry for their "tireless service".
"We are fortunate to have talent in our party room, and I'm committed to drawing on all of it," he said.
Mr Taylor said "healthy competition" among his front bench would lift his whole team to deliver for Australians.

Indonesia’s capital is drowning in waste: ‘the smell is awful’
With 42 million people churning out 14,000 tonnes of rubbish every day, Jakarta and its satellite cities are running out of room for trash
Reading Time:3 minutes
Why you can trust SCMP
Garbage-choked streets, overloaded landfills and the fear of trash avalanches haunt Indonesia’s capital region, as the world’s most populous metropolis grapples with a waste crisis.
Jakarta and its satellite cities, known collectively as Jabodetabek, are home to 42 million people and produce up to an estimated 14,000 tonnes of waste daily.
That has placed increasing strain on the eight or so landfill sites that serve the region, which are now all close to or entirely full, according to local media reports.

At a traditional market in the city’s south, Nurhasanah said the rubbish piling up by her coffee and snacks stand was bad for business.
“The smell is awful, very pungent. It is also unpleasant to look at. It looks filthy,” said Nurhasanah, who like many Indonesians only has one name.

Ukrainians to face tougher conditions for long-term residence in Czech Republic

Ukrainians to face tougher conditions for long-term residence in Czech Republic
Interior Minister Lubomir Metnar said this at a government briefing, according to an Ukrinform correspondent.
"We want the number of people working here to increase and grow. That is why today the Cabinet approved a government decree introducing the so-called special long-term residence program, which is a tool to support working and self-sufficient people who have lived in the Czech Republic for a long time, work, pay taxes, and follow the rules," Metnar said.
He clarified that the program is intended for those who meet clear and strict conditions and are fully integrated. This means that:
- they must pass a security check;
- neither they nor their family members may receive any benefits;
- they must have no insurance arrears;
- their children must be enrolled in school;
- and the entire family must reach a gross annual income of 440,000 Czech crowns.
"These are the conditions, and we have set them this way. We will focus on those who are truly economically self-sufficient here, have committed no offenses, and want to work and fully integrate," the minister said.
A further requirement for obtaining the special long-term residence permit is that refugees must have lived in the Czech Republic under temporary protection for at least two years.
Metnar said that as of the beginning of the year, more than 390,300 foreigners with temporary protection were residing in the Czech Republic. Over 180,000 of them are working and integrated into the labor market. According to him, last year 80,000 Ukrainians applied for long-term residence status, but only 17,000 met the conditions, and just 16,000 completed the registration process.
"For us, long-term residence must be fair to workers, fair to employers, and help stabilize our labor market, where there has been a long-standing shortage of workers. Our government's goal is a clear transition from humanitarian assistance to labor integration," Metnar said.
Before the government meeting, the Freedom and Direct Democracy (SPD) party, led by Tomio Okamura and part of the ruling coalition, stated that it opposed the draft decree allowing refugees from Ukraine to apply for a special long-term residence permit this year. Okamura argued that no foreigner should have simplified conditions for obtaining special long-term residence permits in the Czech Republic compared to others. SPD advocates tightening residence conditions for all foreigners in the country.
The relevant law is expected to be prepared no later than May.
As of late 2025, as many as 393,056 people, or about 3.6 percent of the population, had temporary protection status in the Czech Republic, allowing Ukrainian asylum seekers access to public health insurance, education, and the labor market.

US judge orders reinstatement of Washington slavery exhibit

US judge orders reinstatement of Washington slavery exhibit
February 17, 2026A federal judge has ruled that an exhibit about people enslaved by George Washington, the first president of the United States, must be temporarily restored at Washington's former home in Philadelphia.
In her decision on Monday, US District Judge Cynthia Rufe said that all materials must be restored in their original condition while a lawsuit challenging the legality of the removal is underway.
The city of Philadelphia had sued after the National Park Service removed explanatory panels and a video installation from Independence National Historical Park in January. The exhibit, which opened in 2010, paid tribute to the nine people enslaved by the Washingtons at the home.
In her ruling made Presidents Day, the federal holiday honoring Washington's legacy, the judge also prohibited the Trump administration from installing replacements that explain the site's history differently.
Judge cites '1984' in ordering exhibition's reinstatement
The park service took down the exhibit after President Donald Trump signed an executive order in March 2025 "restoring truth and sanity to American history" at the nation's museums, parks and landmarks.
Since returning to office, Trump has taken aim at educational and historical curricula and exhibits that talk about race relations in the United States and cast the country's history in a negative light.
In Monday's decision, Rufe wrote that "the government claims it alone has the power to erase, alter, remove and hide historical accounts."
She cited British novelist George Orwell's defining work about a dystopian, authoritarian state in his book "1984" in her judgment.
"As if the Ministry of Truth in George Orwell's '1984' now existed, with its motto 'Ignorance is Strength,' this Court is now asked to determine whether the federal government has the power it claims — to dissemble and disassemble historical truths when it has some domain over historical facts," Rufe wrote.
"It does not."
Trump targets history of slavery, LGBTQ+ movement
The site in Philadelphia is among several where the administration has quietly removed content about the history of enslaved people, LGBTQ+ people and Native Americans.
Earlier this month, the National Parks Service removed a rainbow flag from the Stonewall National Monument, where bar patrons rebelled against a police raid and catalyzed the modern LGBTQ+ rights movement.
Although days later, New York City officials raised the rainbow flag again at the site.
Trump officials also ordered the changing of signage at Little Bighorn National Monument in the state of Montana.
The signage describes "broken promises to Native American tribes" and refers to "the loss of Indigenous culture and language under boarding school systems," according to local broadcaster KTQV.

Australian PM Albanese says no help for ISIL relatives held in Syria camp
A group of 34 women and children holding Australian passports is forced to return to Syria’s Roj detention camp for ISIL relatives.
Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has announced that his government will not repatriate Australian women and children from Syria who have been identified as relatives of suspected ISIL (ISIS) fighters.
“We have a very firm view that we won’t be providing assistance or repatriation,” Albanese told ABC News on Tuesday.

Albanese said that while it is “unfortunate” that children have been affected, Australia is “not providing any support”.
“As my mother would say, you make your bed, you lie in it,” he said.
“We have no sympathy, frankly, for people who travelled overseas in order to participate in what was an attempt to establish a caliphate to undermine and destroy our way of life,” he added.
A spokesperson for Australian Minister for Home Affairs Tony Burke also warned that those who return to Australia from Syria will face the law if they have committed crimes.
“People in this cohort need to know that if they have committed a crime and if they return to Australia, they will be met with the full force of the law,” the spokesperson said, according to the Reuters news agency.
A total of 34 women and children holding Australian citizenship were released on Monday from the Kurdish-controlled Roj detention camp in northern Syria.
The Australians, who are said to be relatives of ISIL fighters, were later returned to the camp due to what was described as “technical reasons”, the Reuters and AFP news agencies reported.
Roj detention camp director Hakmiyeh Ibrahim told Al Jazeera that the women and children from 11 families were handed over to relatives “who have come from Australia to collect them”.
The women and children were seen boarding minibuses to reach the Syrian capital, Damascus, from where they were to depart for Australia.
But halfway through the trip, Kurdish escorts were ordered to turn back, as the group did not have permission “to enter government-held territory”, according to Al Jazeera’s Heidi Pett, who is reporting from Aleppo.
Rashid Omar, an official at the Roj camp, later confirmed to AFP that the Australian nationals were forced to return to the detention facility. He said that representatives of the families were still working to resolve the issue with Syrian authorities.
‘Concern in the Australian population’
The humanitarian organisation Save the Children Australia filed a lawsuit in 2023 on behalf of 11 women and 20 children, seeking their repatriation, citing Australia’s “moral and legal responsibility” to its citizens. The Federal Court ruled against Save the Children, saying the Australian government did not control their detention in Syria.
A 17-year-old Australian boy died while under detention in Syria in 2022.
Rodger Shanahan, a Middle East security analyst, told Al Jazeera that the Australian government is facing more resistance to the return of its citizens from Syria following the deadly Bondi Beach attack in December, in which 15 people were killed, at a Jewish festival in Sydney.
“I think that there’s a concern in the Australian population that people might appear to have done away with their radical views, but they still retain them deep down,” Shanahan said.
While Kurdish-led forces still control the Roj camp, they withdrew from the larger al-Hol camp in January, when Syria’s central government’s security forces took control of the area.
At one point, the al-Hol camp housed some 24,000 people, mostly Syrians, but also Iraqis, and more than 6,000 women and children with foreign nationalities.
Governments around the world have been resisting the repatriation of their citizens from the camps in Syria.
The Roj camp also housed United Kingdom-born Shamima Begum, who was 15 when she and two other girls travelled from London in 2015 to marry ISIL fighters in Syria. In 2019, the UK government revoked Begum’s citizenship soon after she was discovered in a detention camp in Syria.
Since then, Begum has challenged the decision, which was turned down by an appeals court in February 2024.
Born in the UK to Bangladeshi parents, Begum does not hold Bangladeshi citizenship. She is reported to still be in the Roj camp.

Guatemala ends emergency powers after a monthlong crackdown sparked by 10 police killings
Guatemala has ended its monthlong state of emergency after deadly attacks on police pushed President Bernardo Arévalo to seek special powers against gangs
- Bookmark
Guatemala lifted its state of emergency Monday, one month after President Bernardo Arévalo sought special powers following the killing of 10 police officers by suspected gang members.
The measure had restricted some constitutional rights, allowing authorities to do things like make arrests without a warrant issued by a judge. That will not be allowed under less restrictive measures scheduled to take effect Tuesday, but Arévalo has not detailed exactly what those will be.
The new measures would not require congressional approval or renewal.
Arévalo said Sunday that 83 gang members had been arrested during the state of emergency and that homicides and reports of extortion had fallen during the period compared with the same stretch a year earlier. He did not provide figures.
The brief state of emergency contrasts with extraordinary powers granted to El Salvador President Nayib Bukele to deal with gang violence that have been renewed monthly by that country's Congress for nearly four years.
In January, gangs in Guatemala retaliated against police after authorities put down riots in three prisons.

Trump warns Iran of consequences ahead of new talks in Geneva
President Donald Trump cautioned Iran over potential repercussions if it fails to reach a deal with the US as negotiations mediated by Oman resume in Geneva on Tuesday. Tehran expressed cautious optimism over Washington’s “more realistic” stance on its nuclear programme.
President Donald Trump warned Iran of potential consequences should it fail to strike a deal with the United States, as negotiators prepare for the latest round of talks in Geneva on Tuesday.
Mediated by Oman, the recently resumed discussions are aimed at averting the possibility of US military action, with Tehran expressing cautious optimism at Washington’s “more realistic” position on its nuclear programme.
Trump has repeatedly threatened to intervene militarily against Iran, first over a deadly crackdown on protesters last month and more recently over its nuclear programme.
“I don’t think they want the consequences of not making a deal,” he told reporters aboard Air Force One ahead of the talks.
A previous attempt at diplomacy collapsed when Israel launched surprise strikes on Iran in June, beginning a 12-day war that Washington briefly joined to bomb Iranian nuclear sites.
“A cautious assessment is that, from the discussions that have taken place in Muscat to date, at least what we have been told is that the US position on the Iranian nuclear issue has moved towards a more realistic one,” foreign ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baqaei said Monday, according to the official IRNA news agency.

According to Tehran, Tuesday’s talks in Switzerland will also be mediated by Oman.
Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi met with his Omani counterpart Badr Albusaidi in Geneva on Monday to discuss his country’s position “regarding nuclear issues and sanctions relief”.
He also stressed Tehran’s “seriousness in using result-oriented diplomacy to secure the legitimate interests and rights of the Iranian people” and preserve peace in the region, according to a ministry statement.
Iran has insisted that the discussions be limited to the nuclear issue, though Washington has previously pushed for other topics to be discussed, including its ballistic missiles and support for armed groups in the region.
War games
Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, the ideological arm of the military, began a series of war games on Monday in the Strait of Hormuz to prepare for “potential security and military threats”, Iranian state TV said.
Iranian politicians have repeatedly threatened to block the strait, a strategic route for oil and liquefied natural gas, as both sides ramp up pressure with talks set to resume.
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters on Monday: “We’re hopeful there’s a deal. The president always prefers peaceful outcomes and negotiated outcomes to things.”

Araghchi, meanwhile, said on X that he too had come to “Geneva with real ideas to achieve a fair and equitable deal”, but added there would be no “submission before threats”.
The foreign minister also said he was meeting in Geneva with the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Grossi, “for deep technical discussion”.
The West fears the programme is aimed at making a bomb, which Tehran denies.
Regime change?
Washington has dispatched Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, the White House confirmed on Sunday.
On Friday, Trump said a change of government in Iran would be the “best thing that could happen”, as he sent a second aircraft carrier to the Middle East to ratchet up military pressure.
The first carrier dispatched to the region, the USS Abraham Lincoln, was positioned about 700 kilometres (435 miles) from the Iranian coast as of Sunday, new satellite images showed.
Iran’s deputy foreign minister Majid Takht-Ravanchi told the BBC that Tehran would consider compromises on its uranium stockpile if Washington lifted sanctions that have crippled the country’s economy.
“If we see the sincerity on their (American) part, I am sure we will be on a road to have an agreement,” he said.

Hong Kong airport’s second terminal to fully open, serve 15 airlines from May 27
Transport and logistics minister Mable Chan says the two terminals will complement each other and ‘greatly enhance’ the airport’s capacity
The Hong Kong airport’s second terminal will fully open on May 27, authorities have announced, with the redeveloped facility set to serve as the base for 15 airlines.
The terminal, which will mostly handle regional flights, is part of the airport’s HK$141.5 billion (US$18.1 billion) expansion project launched in 2016 that also included a third runway. Its coach hall opened in September.
Fred Lam Tin-fuk, chairman of the Airport Authority, said on Tuesday that the first terminal, used mainly for long-haul flights, was busy and that the second terminal would “share some of the flight load”.
“The design philosophy for the entire Terminal 2 aims to be more vibrant, youthful and technologically forward-thinking. It will introduce new self-service facilities and incorporate numerous smart technologies,” he said.
“We have also introduced a wide range of new dining options, which I believe will appeal to everyone.”
The airlines expected to operate out of the second terminal include Hong Kong Airlines, HK Express and Greater Bay Airlines.

Japan’s Riku Miura and Ryuichi Mihara Are the Olympic Pairs Skating Champions
Unknown

There’s been a lot of chatter online and in the figure skating community about the ice at the Milano Ice Skating Arena. It’s too soft; it’s made with a new, more environmentally friendly system that’s less consistent and more sensitive to the heat and moisture of spectators in a packed arena. Sharing the venue with short track speed skating doesn’t help, since speed skaters like the ice harder and colder.
But in the end, ice is ice, and everyone is skating on the same surface. Yes, in the pairs final, many of the 16 pairs experienced falls or doubled planned triple jumps. But in securing gold, Riku Miura and Ryuichi Mihara from Japan didn’t seem to be bothered by any of that. With every monster throw from Mihara and Miura’s solid landings, the crowd roared in approval, and their flawless routine to the Gladiator soundtrack drew the only standing ovation of the evening from the arena.
The gold is the first medal in pairs skating for Japan. Anastasiia Metelkina and Luka Berulava from Georgia also earned their country’s first Olympic medal in the sport—a silver—and Minerva Fabienne Hase and Nikita Volodin from Germany rounded out the podium for bronze.
Most of the pairs in the competition struggled with mistakes—until Miura and Mihara took to the ice. Their jump combination—a triple toe loop, double axel and double axel—earned the second highest points for a jump combo of the night, and their speed impressed the judges enough to award them 9.46, 9.32, and 9.46 for their composition, presentation, and skating skills, out of a maximum of 10 in each section.
Entering the final, the pair were in fifth place, after a costly mistake in a lift during the short program. “We still can’t believe that this happened after yesterday’s performance,” said Mihara. “It’s a little bit of disbelief that we were able to get a medal for Japan pairs skating for the first time ever, and we hope that our performance tonight is going to lead the Japanese skating community into the future to perform better and better moving forward.”
In pairs figure skating, this Olympics is an opportunity of sorts, as a traditional powerhouse in the event, Russia, is banned from the Games following the invasion of Ukraine. From 1964 to 1998, pairs from the then Soviet Union, and now Russia, have stood at the top of the Olympic podium. Countries like Georgia have been building strong skating programs; its team of women’s, men’s pairs and dance skaters finished just off the podium, in fourth, in the team event, and earned its first pairs medal in Milan.
Miura and Mihara train with Canadian coach Bruno Marcotte in Ontario, and enlisted Marie-France Dubreuil, who co-founded the Ice Academy of Montreal and coached more than a dozen ice dance teams at the Milan Olympics, to choreograph their free program. Marcotte fought back tears after Miura and Mihara’s rousing skate; it was Marcotte who suggested the two skate together. While talented coaches and choreographers abound in Japan, say some of the country’s skating media, the pair wanted to take advantage of more global talent in their bid for their country’s first Olympic medal in the sport. It was Marcotte who asked Mihara to pair with Miura, and asked if they would move to Canada in 2019, after auditioning them, to take advantage of his coaching staff, which includes his former student Meagan Duhamel, an Olympic gold and silver medalist in pairs.
“What I saw in Riku is a very talented skater and she had the mindset to be great in pairs; she’s not afraid, she’s gutsy,” says Marcotte. During the audition, they performed a single twist in which Mihara throws Miura into the air, “and it just flew; it was something special right away,” he says. He admits he didn’t immediately think they would become Olympic champions, but is happy to be proven wrong.
COVID helped the duo as well; since the lockdown in Canada allowed them to bond better as a pair and improved their on ice chemistry. The move paid off for the Japanese pair, who finished seventh at the 2022 Beijing Olympics but quickly moved up in ranking, winning the world championship the following year and again in 2025. A shoulder injury that Miura experienced in December forced them to withdraw from the Japanese nationals that month heading into the Olympics, but the pair never doubted they would skate in Milan.
The pair skated both the short and free program portions of the team event to open their Milan Olympics, and they helped Team Japan to a silver in that event. But the toll of skating another full event—the pairs competition—was clear during their short program before the final. They struggled with a lift and finished in fifth.
“I was feeling really down about how I performed,” said Mihara. “And in the beginning, I wasn’t able to move on from that performance even up until today’s practice.” Miura said she had put the short program behind her and was focused on the free program final, but “Ryuichi was crying even until this morning,” she said. “So I felt like I needed to be strong and support him and help him to focus for the free program.” Marcotte says the pair remained at the arena throughout the whole day, following their practice in the morning, and following a nap, Mihara seemed to have shaken off the previous day’s mistake. “When he came back from his nap he was the Ryuichi I know. So I told them your goal is to be the best in the world today; deliver the best performance and be the best in the world today.”
That’s what she and Mihara did, but they weren’t the only ones looking for redemption. Deanna Stellato-Dudek and Maxime Deschamps of Canada, weren’t even sure they would compete after Stellato-Dudek injured her head in a training accident the day before they were scheduled to leave. Already breaking barriers at 42, Stellato-Dudek had retired from competitive skating as a singles skater for more than 15 years before training again to compete in pairs in Milan. The pair fell to 11th, but Stellato-Dudek sees just competing at the Olympics as a victory.
“I find that women, especially in their 40s, it’s just kind of expected of you to take up less space in the world and not pursue your dreams any more, and perhaps even help somebody else pursue theirs,” she tells TIME. “And I really hope that, just with the performance I had here, and being able to make it to the Olympics and doing something that less than 1% of the population can accomplish at 42 years old, that it encourages other women to go after their dreams if they are under estimated, to prove people wrong, and just to take up as much space as they want.”
Americans Emily Chan and Spencer Akira Howe skated to a new season’s best score, undoubtedly carrying the weight of hope and aspirations of their home club, the Skating Club of Boston, which lost six skaters in 2025 when their commercial flight returning from a development camp for young athletes collided with a military helicopter over the Potomac River in Washington, DC.
Chan and Howe finished seventh, and their teammates Ellie Kam and Danny O’Shea finished ninth. The last US pair to reach the Olympic podium were Jill Watson and Peter Oppegard, who earned bronze in 1988. Kyoko Ina and Jason Dungjen came the closest to a medal after that in 1998 with a fourth place finish, but since then, American pairs have struggled to bring home Olympic hardware.

U.S. Reportedly Sends Asylum Seekers to Cameroon in Secret

The United States is now deporting migrants fleeing war or persecution in their home countries to the African nation of Cameroon, often in defiance of U.S. courts.
As the New York Times reports, none of them is from Cameroon but they have been offloaded there in secret. Those detained say they can leave the state-run facility there only if they agree to return to the countries they fled. The process represents a window into President Donald Trump’s campaign to circumvent the asylum process and hasten deportations.
The United States has not announced any deal with Cameroon to warehouse foreign nationals and the State Department declined to comment to the Times. A Senate oversight report released last week disclosed that Washington has already paid $32 million in payments to third-country hosts under a process that was only rarely employed before Trump came back to Washington. The Senate report disclosed that the use of third nations is often a workaround to protections against returning migrants to homes where they would face persecution or death. It’s murky if those third nations are honoring asylum seekers’ requests to stay away from their home states but it is clear that U.S. law prohibits sending many of those seeking refugee status directly back.
Trump’s muscular removal of migrants from the United States is a hallmark of his second term. His crackdown has more than a few similarities with a military invasion of some cities, his roundups have left immigrant communities cowering and their neighbors defiant. Even some typical Trump allies have voiced concern that the efforts are easily seen as too aggressive.
Still, the Trump Administration seems determined to double-down, including sending in handcuffs at least nine asylum seekers from a detention center in Louisiana to Cameroon on Jan. 14. At least eight of them had court orders protecting them from removal from the United States as they sought to stay. It appears that was the first flight to move migrants from U.S. soil to that West African nation.
There, according to the Times interviews, two of the nine have accepted the demands that they return to their home nations on the belief they were ineligible to receive asylum in Cameroon. Some have been in this detention limbo for more than a year now and did not know their destination until they were shackled on flights out of the United States. None, their lawyers told the Times, had a record of violent crime. Instead, they feared retaliation for refusing to join the military or identifying as LGBTQ.
The pool of worldwide refugees tops a million people a year but less than 5% successfully find asylum through the United Nations.
Cameroon's place in the U.S. network of off-the-book deportation destinations is a new disclosure but it’s hardly alone. Sites in Equatorial Guinea and Ghana have been stopover locations for asylum seekers—many of whom have U.S. court protections while they go through the system—being returned to their home countries against their will. It accounts for but a piece of the harsh system Trump is telegraphing to would-be refugees to look elsewhere.

Hillary Clinton slams Epstein 'cover-up,' calls for public testimony
France

Former US secretary of state Hillary Clinton has accused President Donald Trump of orchestrating a "cover-up" over files related to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, according to an interview with the BBC published Monday, February 16. "Get the files out. They are slow-walking it," Hillary Clinton, who is due to testify before a Congressional committee on the issue, told the British broadcaster in an interview in Berlin.
The Justice Department last month released the latest cache of so-called Epstein files -- more than three million documents, photos and videos related to its investigation into sex criminal Epstein, who died from what was determined to be suicide while in custody in 2019.
Clinton's husband, former president Bill Clinton, features regularly in the files, but no evidence has come to light implicating either Clinton in criminal activity. The couple has been ordered to give closed-door depositions before the House Oversight Committee, which is probing the deceased financier's connections to powerful figures and how information about his crimes was handled.
"We will show up but we think it would be better to have it in public," Hillary Clinton told the BBC. "I just want it to be fair," she said. "I want everybody treated the same way." The former secretary of state said she and her husband "have nothing to hide. We have called for the full release of these files repeatedly."
The Department of Justice has said it has no more files to release, though lawmakers have criticized it for not publishing internal government memos, notes and emails on Epstein.
'Never met the guy'
Clinton said the Republicans probing her are trying to deflect attention away from Trump, whose name is also mentioned in the files many times. "Look at this shiny object. We're going to have the Clintons, even Hillary Clinton, who never met the guy," she said. Trump denies any wrongdoing. Mere mention in the files is not proof of having committed a crime.
Former president Bill Clinton has acknowledged flying on Epstein's plane in the early 2000s for Clinton Foundation-related humanitarian work, but said he never visited Epstein's private island. Hillary Clinton, who ran against Trump for president in 2016, has said she had no meaningful interactions with Epstein, never flew on his plane and never visited his island.
In the interview with the BBC, she said she had met Ghislaine Maxwell, an Epstein associate who was convicted of conspiring with him to sexually abuse minors, "on a few occasions." Responding to her comment that the congressional testimony was a bid to create a distraction, Trump denied it, telling reporters Monday evening he had been "totally exonerated."
Hillary Clinton will appear for her deposition on February 26, while Bill Clinton will appear on February 27.

High-pitched noise used to deter rough sleepers under trouble-plagued Perth bridge

High-pitched noise used to deter rough sleepers under trouble-plagued Perth bridge
The Cook government was surprised by a City of Perth and Public Transport Authority decision to install speakers and play a high-pitched noise to deter people from setting up tents at a popular homeless encampment site on a cycle path in East Perth.
The Public Transport Authority said it had installed speakers at the request of the City of Perth that played a high-pitched noise 24/7 under the Lord Street overpass, 150 metres north-east of McIver train station.
The City of Perth backed its decision to deploy the technology but said the PTA had operational management of it.
Premier Roger Cook said the decision to act on the City’s request was made at a “lower level of the agency” and was not one his government would have taken.
“That decision did not go up the chain of authority or the chain of management,” he said.
“Obviously, this is not what we do in Western Australia. We try to avoid persecuting or making life uncomfortable for people who are homeless and already experiencing a great deal of discomfort.”
The area around that site has been a popular spot for rough sleepers to set up camp in previous years, but large fences have been erected, resulting in tents being set up alongside the cyclepath.
After the noise was investigated by homelessness advocates the PTA switched off the noise on Tuesday morning.
Hostile architecture and the use of noise and music to deter anti-social behaviour has been mired in controversy with the City of Bunbury forced to apologise in 2023 for playing The Wiggles’ Hot Potato on loop in the Bricknell Music Shell, which was a popular spot for the city’s homeless to gather.
A City of Perth spokeswoman said it installed the devices in response to reports of anti-social and criminal behaviour concerns.
“The device forms one part of a broader safety approach and was implemented in response to requests for action to help improve the safe use of the space. It is not intended to target or deter people experiencing homelessness,” she said.
“We recognise this is a sensitive issue and remain committed to balancing safety, accessibility and the respectful use of public spaces for everyone in the community.”
Housing Minister and Perth MP John Carey, who is a former homelessness minister, said the use of the noise at the East Perth underpass caught him by surprise, and he only became aware of it on Tuesday morning.
He said the use of hostile approaches to deter rough sleepers was not endorsed by his government, but he was aware that pocket of Perth had been an area of concern.
“I wasn’t aware of it so it has caught me by surprise. But what hasn’t caught me by surprise has been the challenges at that particular pocket. It is well known by the local community,” he said.
“The advice just given to me is that the PTA has now turned it off, and that the PTA will be working with the City of Perth.
“More broadly as the local member, I am aware of this underpass there has been significant concerns raised by the local community, including assaults of local residents.
“I personally had a woman contact me, a local constituent who had been assaulted there. So clearly, there’s work to be done in improving the safety around the underpass.”
Carey said there were better ways to deter anti-social behaviour, including through improved lighting and beefing up homeless outreach.
“We increased funding for homelessness outreach. We’ve got Common Ground. We want to assist people to transition off our streets, but we also still face anti-social behaviour issues in particular pockets,” he said.
A PTA spokeswoman said the City of Perth requested the installation of a noise device at the Lord Street underpass.
“The noise device has been turned off. We will be working with the City of Perth to determine a more suitable way forward,” he said.
Homelessness advocate Jesse Noakes questioned how Carey would feel if that noise was playing outside his house all night.
“Will he fix the root cause of homelessness, safe and secure housing tenancies which is what his local community is actually demanding?” he said.
Shelter WA chief executive Kath Snell said the use of the device was disturbing and her organisation condemned it.
“Moving people on is not a person-centred response and only makes the problem worse, forcing people into areas further from the city and services, and potentially more dangerous or unsanitary areas,” she said.
“Hostile architecture reinforces stigma and can make it even harder for people to access support.“
Greens homelessness spokesman Tim Clifford called on the government to conduct a review into how and why the speakers were approved.
The City of Perth was approached for comment.

Germany says it has exhausted its own air defence missile stocks for Ukraine: We gave everything we had
German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul has said that Berlin has effectively run out of its own stocks of air defence missiles and can no longer supply them to Ukraine directly from its reserves.
Source: Wadephul in response to questions about the shortage of air defence capabilities in Ukraine, as reported by Clash Report
Quote: "Partly because we don't have any more. What there still is… comes from American production. Honestly, everything that is coming out of the production halls there now also goes directly to Ukraine. This is happening within a mechanism that is largely financed by Europeans, primarily Germany."
Details: Wadephul stressed that Berlin is not to blame in this situation, as the country has provided everything it had and continues to finance a large share of the assistance received by Kyiv.
"We have made everything available that we somehow had," he emphasised.
He added that this is only fair, as Ukraine is defending Europe's freedom.
Meanwhile, Wadephul called on other European countries to make a greater contribution to strengthening Ukraine's air defence. He reiterated calls by German Defence Minister Boris Pistorius for partners to review their own stockpiles and increase their use, noting that Germany has taken such steps on several occasions.
Background:
- Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy criticised Europe at Davos over problems with air defence missile deliveries. NATO insisted there had been no delay in the supply of Patriot missiles, contrary to Zelenskyy's remarks.
- NATO later said a number of partners would provide Ukraine with air defence missiles from their own stocks to address the shortfall in supplies from the US.
- Earlier, Alona Hetmanchuk, Ukraine's ambassador to NATO, listed the six countries that have provided Ukraine with the most support through PURL.
- On 14 February, Zelenskyy said that Ukraine had received interceptor missiles shortly before Russia's large-scale combined attack on 12 February, which made it possible to down ballistic missiles.
- On 16 February, Zelenskyy instructed the leaders of the Air Force, the Ministry of Defence and Ukrenergo, Ukraine's state-owned electricity transmission operator, to prepare additional protective measures in response to intelligence reports of a potential new large-scale strike by Russia.

Ireland launches data protection probe into Grok's deepfakes

Ireland launches data protection probe into Grok's deepfakes
February 17, 2026Ireland's data protection watchdog launched an investigation into Elon Musk's artificial intelligence chatbot, Grok, on Tuesday, in the latest step the European Union has taken in response to sexualized deepfake images.
The "large-scale inquiry" is on behalf of the European Union and will probe whether the AI tool breached the bloc's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Ireland's Data Protection Commission (DPC) said in a statement.
The EU is also running its own investigation into Grok and the social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter, under the powers of the Digital Services Act (DSA), which sets out rights and protections for EU citizens.
Why is Ireland investigating Elon Musk's X?
Ireland is taking the lead on the investigation since X's European operations are headquartered in Dublin.
As the lead authority for X in the EU, the DPC will examine the company's compliance with "some of their fundamental obligations under the GDPR in relation to the matters at hand," DPC Deputy Commissioner Graham Doyle said in the statement.
The DPC said it had notified the Elon Musk-owned company on Monday. X is yet to respond to this latest probe.
Violations can result in hefty fines of up to 4% of a company's total global revenue.
The separate EU probe, which was launched in late January, can result in fines of 6% of global revenues.
The law requires online giants such as X to proactively tackle illegal and harmful online content.
Why is Grok under fire?
An analysis of over 20,000 Grok-generated images, published by Paris-based non-profit AI Forensics in January, found that more than half the images showed individuals in "minimal attire."
Most of these individuals were women and 2% appeared to be minors.
Several governments put pressure on xAI to modify Grok after its so-called "Spicy Mode" allowed users to create sexually explicit images with simple prompts such as "remove her clothes" or "put her in underwear."
Malaysia and Indonesia went as far as blocking the chatbot completely.
In response, X announced new restrictions on the chatbot, preventing it from undressing images of real people and allowing only paid users to use the image-creation function.
EU-US tensions of enforcement of tech rules
The European Union's strong response to the sexual deepfakes has added another layer to tensions between the bloc and the US, a relationship already under stress over President Donald Trump's trade tariffs and conflicts in Gaza and Ukraine.
Ireland has moved to investigate X despite repeated US threats of retaliation against the enforcement of tech rules.
The Trump administration has accused the EU of targeting American companies and restricting free speech. Musk is an ally of the president, having spent billions to fund Trump's reelection.
The Irish watchdog has been investigating X's use of certain personal data to train its AI models since last year.

Hillary Clinton accuses Trump of Epstein cover-up, insists ‘nothing to hide’
While her husband Bill features regularly in the Epstein files, the former US secretary of state says they are being used as a distraction
Former US secretary of state Hillary Clinton has accused President Donald Trump of orchestrating a “cover-up” over files related to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, according to an interview with the BBC.
“Get the files out. They are slow-walking it,” Clinton, who is due to testify before a Congressional committee on the issue, told the British broadcaster in an interview in Berlin published on Monday.
The US Department of Justice last month released the latest cache of so-called Epstein files – more than 3 million documents, photos and videos related to its investigation into sex criminal Epstein, who died from what was determined to be suicide while in custody in 2019.
Clinton’s husband, former president Bill Clinton, features regularly in the files, but no evidence has come to light implicating either Clinton in criminal activity.
The couple has been ordered to give closed-door depositions before the House Oversight Committee, which is investigating the deceased financier’s connections to powerful figures and how information about his crimes was handled.

Representatives of Ukraine and Russia meet in Geneva on Tuesday for a fresh round of US-mediated peace talks that are likely to focus on land, the main sticking point. US President Donald Trump called on Kyiv to “come to the table fast” on the eve of the talks as both sides remain far apart on territorial concessions. Follow our liveblog for the latest updates.
Russia 'disregards peace efforts' with missile, drone strikes, says Ukraine
Russia was undermining peace efforts by launching dozens of missiles and hundreds of drones ahead of talks in Geneva, said Ukraine's foreign minister.
"The extent to which Russia disregards peace efforts: a massive missile and drone strike against Ukraine right before the next round of talks in Geneva," Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiga wrote on social media.
The Ukrainian air force said Russia had launched 29 missiles and 396 drones in attacks that local officials said targeted critical infrastructure.
Russian strike on Odesa region causes 'incredibly serious' damage to power infrastructure
A Russian strike on Ukraine's southern Odesa region caused "incredibly serious" damage to power infrastructure supplying the regional capital, Ukrainian energy company DTEK said.
"Repairs will take a long time to restore the equipment to working order," the company said on social media.
Putin aide warns European powers over seizure of vessels
Russia could use the navy to prevent European powers seizing its vessels and may retaliate against European shipping if Russian vessels are seized, Nikolai Patrushev, a close ally of President Vladimir Putin has been quoted as saying.
"If we don't give them a tough rebuff, then soon the British, French and even the Balts will become arrogant to such an extent that they will try to block our country's access to the seas at least in the Atlantic basin," said Patrushev, a senior politician and security official who has served on the Security Council of Russia as well as the FSB intelligence service in the past.
Russian delegation arrives in Geneva for talks on Ukraine, Interfax reports
The Russian delegation has arrived in Geneva for talks on Ukraine, according to Russian news agency Interfax.
Land in focus at Geneva peace talks between Russia and Ukraine
As Russian and Ukrainian teams meet in Geneva, the US-mediated peace talks are likely to focus on land, the main sticking point.
Russia is demanding that Ukraine cede the remaining 20% of the eastern region of Donetsk that Moscow has failed to capture, which Kyiv refuses to do.
Russia occupies about 20% of Ukraine's national territory, including Crimea and parts of the eastern Donbas region seized before the 2022 invasion.
More than 150 Ukrainian drones repelled overnight, says Russian state media
Russia repelled more than 150 Ukrainian drones overnight, Moscow's defence ministry has told state media ahead of talks in Geneva.
"Overnight, air defence forces destroyed 151 Ukrainian drones over Russian regions, as well as over the Black and Azov Seas," the ministry reported.
In Russian-annexed Crimea, Sevastopol governor Mikhail Razvozhayev said two dozen drones were shot down during "one of the longest attacks in recent times".
"Unfortunately, there were injuries. According to preliminary information, one child was wounded," he posted on Telegram.
Who are the lead negotiators in Geneva?
The Russian delegation in Geneva is led by Vladimir Medinsky, a nationalist hawk and former culture minister who now serves an advisor to President Vladimir Putin. The head of Russian military intelligence, Igor Kostyukov, is also on the negotiating team, while Putin’s special envoy Kirill Dmitriev takes part in a separate working group on economic issues.
Ukraine’s team is led by former defence minister Rustem Umerov, while the US team is led by special envoy Steve Witkoff and President Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner.
Ukraine made fastest battlefield gain in 2.5 years last week, data analysis shows
Ukraine recaptured 201 square kilometres (78 square miles) from Russia between Wednesday and Sunday last week, taking advantage of a Starlink shutdown for Russian forces, according to an AFP analysis of data from the Institute for the Study of War (ISW).
The recaptured area is almost equivalent to the Russian gains for the entire month of December and is the most land retaken by Kyiv's forces in such a short period since a June 2023 counter-offensive.
"These Ukrainian counterattacks are likely leveraging the recent block on Russian forces' access to Starlink, which Russian milbloggers (military bloggers) have claimed is causing communications and command and control issues on the battlefield," the ISW, which collaborates with the Critical Threats Project, another US think-tank, stated.
On February 5, military observers noted disruption of the Starlink antennas used by Moscow on the front lines, following announcements by Elon Musk of "measures" to end the Kremlin's use of this technology.
Why the Kremlin reinstated Medinsky as lead negotiator for Geneva talks
For the talks in Geneva, the Kremlin has reinstated nationalist hawk and former culture minister Vladimir Medinsky as its lead negotiator.
“This time, we plan to discuss a broader set of issues, focusing on key ones related to the territories and other demands,” a spokesperson for Vladimir Putin told reporters, explaining the personnel change.
Trump says Ukraine must move 'fast' to sign peace deal
“Ukraine better come to the table, fast,” US President Donald Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One while en route to Washington.
Zelensky claims necessity of 'sufficient pressure on Russia'
“Even on the eve of the trilateral meetings in Geneva, the Russian army has no orders other than to continue striking Ukraine. This speaks volumes about how Russia regards the partners’ diplomatic efforts,” Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky posted on social media Monday.
“Only with sufficient pressure on Russia and clear security guarantees for Ukraine can this war realistically be brought to an end,” he added.
Yesterday's key developments:
US President Donald Trump said Monday that “Ukraine better come to the table, fast,” when it comes to reaching a peace deal with Russia.
Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff and son-in-law Jared Kushner will meet with former Russian culture minister Vladimir Medinsky and Rustem Umerov, the head of Ukraine’s National Security Council, on Tuesday in Geneva.
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio affirmed that Trump was "deeply committed" to the success of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, one of Europe's biggest critics of Ukraine and a Russian ally.

Trump says he will be involved ‘indirectly’ in Iran nuclear talks
The US president’s comments come ahead of a second round of high-stakes talks in Geneva on Tuesday.
United States President Donald Trump has said that he will be involved “indirectly” in the second round of the high-stakes nuclear talks between Iran and Washington in Geneva.
Trump’s comments on Monday came as Iranian Minister of Foreign Affairs Abbas Araghchi travelled to the Swiss city for meetings ahead of the indirect talks with the US.

Tensions in the Gulf region remain high ahead of the crucial negotiations, with the US deploying a second aircraft carrier to the region and Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei warning that any attack on Iran would prompt a regional war.
Trump told reporters on board Air Force One that the discussions on Tuesday were significant.
“I’ll be involved in those talks, indirectly. And they’ll be very important,” he said. “Iran is a very tough negotiator.”
Asked about the prospects for a deal, Trump said Iran had learned the consequences of its tough approach last June, when the US joined in Israel’s 12-day war on Iran and bombed three of its nuclear sites.
The attacks came amid indirect talks between Iran and the US on Tehran’s nuclear programme and resulted in their derailment.
However, Trump suggested Tehran was motivated to negotiate this time. “I don’t think they want the consequences of not making a deal,” he said.
Despite the US president’s comments about Iran seeking an agreement, the talks face major potential stumbling blocks. Washington has demanded that Tehran forgo uranium enrichment on its soil and has sought to expand the scope of talks to non-nuclear issues, such as Iran’s missile stockpile.
But Tehran, which insists that its nuclear programme is for peaceful purposes, has said it is only willing to discuss curbs on its programme in exchange for sanctions relief. It has said it will not accept zero uranium enrichment and that its missile capabilities are off the table.
‘Fair and equitable deal’
Araghchi, who arrived in Geneva earlier on Monday, said he was in the city “with real ideas to achieve a fair and equitable deal”. He added, in a post on X, “What is not on the table: submission before threats.”
The Iranian diplomat also met with the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Rafael Grossi, in Geneva for a round of technical discussions. Tehran had suspended cooperation with the United Nations watchdog body after the US and Israel’s attacks on its nuclear sites.
The IAEA has been calling on Iran for months to say what happened to its stockpile of 440kg (970 pounds) of highly-enriched uranium following the Israeli-US strikes and to let inspections fully resume, including in three key sites that were bombed: Natanz, Fordow and Isfahan.
Tehran has allowed IAEA some access to the sites that were not damaged, but has not allowed inspectors to visit other sites, citing a potential risk of radiation.
Al Jazeera’s Resul Serdar, reporting from Tehran, said there was “optimism” in the Iranian capital ahead of the talks.
“Officials here say the Iranian delegation in Geneva includes fully authorised economic, legal, political and technical teams. This signals that the Iranian side is ready for some serious concessions, particularly regarding its nuclear programme,” he said.
But Serdar noted that the talks come in the face of a massive US military build-up in the region, which continues to grow. The Iranians, too, he said, were not “stepping back”, with the powerful Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) launching military drills in the Strait of Hormuz in the Gulf on Monday.
Iran has repeatedly threatened to close the Strait of Hormuz, a vital international waterway and oil export route from Gulf Arab states, in retaliation against any attack. The move would choke a fifth of global oil flows and send crude prices sharply higher.
Iran has also threatened to strike US military bases in the region in the event of an attack, promoting concerns of a wider war.
“This military escalation is going on in parallel with the diplomatic engagement. The regional countries are also stepping up diplomacy, because they have their concerns and they have their own fears,” Serdar said.

Smotrich, Netanyahu quarrel over law banning release of senior terrorists during exchange deals

Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich demanded on Monday that a bill to adopt the principles of the Shamgar Commission, which would impose broad restrictions on the release of terrorists in exchange deals, be brought before the Security Cabinet. In response, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu instructed Likud members to oppose it.
Smotrich sent a letter to Netanyahu demanding that a bill outlining principles for the redemption of captives and missing persons, based on the conclusions of the Shamgar Commission, be brought for approval by the Security Cabinet.
“The absence of an orderly policy by the State of Israel in facing these challenges places every Israeli citizen, at home and abroad, under a real threat of abduction and use as a strategic bargaining chip,” he wrote.
“Precisely at this time, after we have returned all of our hostages, it is possible to make a substantive and correct decision.”
Officials surprised by Netanyahu's stance
At the same time, the Religious Zionism Party raised the proposal on Sunday for discussion in the Ministerial Committee for Legislation. Prime Minister Netanyahu instructed members of his Likud party to oppose the bill, and officials in Religious Zionism were surprised by the move. In the end, the discussion was postponed.
Among the proposed restrictions are: a ban on releasing those who held command roles and directed cells that carried out or attempted to carry out terrorist offenses; those who returned to terrorist activity after being released; those who have served less than two-thirds of their sentence; and those who were Israeli citizens or permanent residents at the time of committing the offense.
The bill further stipulates that the government will prepare a closed list of terrorists who would be eligible to be released in the event of a new exchange deal. Under the proposal, no concession will be granted merely for entering into negotiations or for continuing them, and no additional concession will be given for the release of hostages beyond the release of terrorists in accordance with the limitations set by law.
In the event that the State of Israel declares war following an abduction, the government would be authorized to release up to five terrorists for each hostage only after the enemy’s defeat.

Ireland's data protection watchdog opens EU probe into Grok sexual AI imagery
France

Ireland's data protection watchdog, acting on behalf of the EU, launched a probe on Tuesday, February 17, into Elon Musk's X over AI chatbot Grok's generation of sexualized deepfake images, the latest step of an international backlash against the tool.
The "large-scale inquiry" relates to potential breaches of the bloc's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), said a statement by Ireland's Data Protection Commission (DPC). It will examine "the alleged creation and publication on X of potentially harmful, non-consensual intimate or sexualized images involving Europeans, including children," generated using the tool, said the DPC. "The purpose of this investigation is to determine whether X complied with its obligations under the GDPR ... with regard to the personal data processed of EU/EEA data subjects," it said.
As X's European operations has its headquarters in Ireland, the DPC is the lead regulator in Europe for applying EU rules on the platform.
Growing tensions between the US and the UE
DPC deputy commissioner Graham Doyle said the authority has "been engaging" with X "since media reports first emerged a number of weeks ago concerning the alleged ability of X users to prompt the Grok account on X to generate sexualized images of real people, including children."
In response to the outcry over the deepfakes, some countries announced in January that they were launching probes into Grok, increasing regulatory pressure, or even blocking it altogether.
The European Union opened its own probe into whether X had met legal obligations under the bloc's Digital Services Act (DSA), which is designed to police internet giants. Under fire, X said last month it was restricting Grok's image generation and editing to paying subscribers.
Regulation of US tech giants, including X, has been at the heart of growing tensions between the EU and Washington since Donald Trump's return to power. The Irish move comes despite repeated US threats of retaliation against enforcement of tech rules that Trump's administration seeks to frame as attacks on free speech and unfair targeting of US firms.

PARIS — Emmanuel Macron is racing to put guard rails around a potential far-right president of France.
The French leader is accelerating key personnel appointments and placing loyalists in top positions to cement his influence and prevent the National Rally from executing its populist agenda, according to four French officials and two former officials.
Polls show the far-right party is the front-runner for next year’s presidential election, and Marine Le Pen and Jordan Bardella, its potential candidates, have signaled they would try to undo Macron’s economic reforms and pull back on French commitments to the EU and NATO.

BRUSSELS — One of the most toxic culture wars in the U.K. and U.S. is being brought to Brussels.
Rights groups argue that debates about gender issues are being imported from the anglophone world into EU politics, with right-wing groups choosing to stoke arguments about transgender people in hopes of dividing the left.
Conservative Christian organizations in the U.S. “saw that there was a fight happening there,” said Neil Datta, executive director and founder of the European Parliamentary Forum on Sexual and Reproductive Rights (EPF). “A fight that could be useful to them.”

New round of Russia-US-Ukraine talks to take place in Geneva

GENEVA, February 17. /TASS/. A new round of Russia-US-Ukraine talks on resolving the Ukraine conflict will be held in Geneva, Switzerland, on February 17-18.
The first two rounds of talks took place in the Emirati capital of Abu Dhabi on January 23-24 and on February 4-5. Igor Kostyukov, head of the Main Intelligence Directorate of the General Staff, led Russia’s delegation to the Emirati consultations, which addressed security issues that directly concern the militaries. This time, the parties are expected to discuss a wide range of issues, with Presidential Aide Vladimir Medinsky, who headed Russia’s negotiating team in 2022 and 2025, once again leading the country’s delegation.
Kirill Dmitriev, Russian special presidential envoy for investment and economic cooperation with foreign countries and director general of the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), will also travel to Geneva. According to Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov, Dmitriev is "on a separate track" as a member of a working group on Russia-US economic cooperation.
According to the Kremlin spokesman, Russian President Vladimir Putin is in constant contact with the negotiators; he gave them "detailed instructions before their departure" for Geneva.
New venue for talks
Russia is going to take part in talks on Ukraine in Western Europe for the first time. "The place was chosen based on the schedule of all three parties. Everybody found it reasonable and convenient," Peskov explained. A source told TASS that Switzerland had pledged to provide safe passage for the Russian delegation to travel to Geneva.
On February 6, Swiss Foreign Minister Ignazio Cassis visited Moscow for talks with his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov. Cassis said in an interview after the trip that "Russia is really willing to take a step toward peace." He also made it clear that it was his visit to the Russian capital that paved the way for Geneva to host the next round of Ukraine talks.
Guy Mettan, Swiss politician, journalist, writer, and member of Geneva’s cantonal parliament, told TASS that the movement of talks to the heart of Europe symbolized "its return to the game," coming with responsibility. In his view, the Europeans "must work for peace." Mettan also described the move to relocate the talks to Geneva as a gesture of goodwill by Moscow.
Talks in Europe without Europe
According to a TASS source, the Medinsky-led delegation will include over 20 people, namely Kostyukov and Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Galuzin who was one of Russia’s negotiators in Istanbul in 2025.
Reports from Kiev said that Ukraine’s representatives had set off for Switzerland on the morning of February 16. Kiev’s negotiating team includes Rustem Umerov, secretary of Ukraine’s National Security and Defense Council, Kirill Budanov, head of Vladimir Zelensky’s Office (designated in Russia as a terrorist and extremist), Andrey Gnatov, chief of the General Staff of the Ukrainian armed forces, David Arakhamia, leader of the Servant of the People faction in Ukraine’s parliament, Budanov’s deputy Sergey Kislitsa, and Vadim Skibitsky, deputy chief of the Ukraine’s Main Intelligence Directorate.
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced that Washington would be represented by Special Presidential Envoy Steve Witkoff and entrepreneur Jared Kushner.
Meanwhile, the Europeans will not take part in the meeting, Peskov said.
No leaks
Just like with the UAE consultations, little information is available about the upcoming meeting in Switzerland. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said earlier that results-oriented talks were better held in private so Moscow preferred to maintain "a diplomatic silence." However, the general framework is clear.
Russia’s move to expand its delegation means that the agenda of the talks will be very busy. In Abu Dhabi, the parties focused on the technical aspects of a potential ceasefire, while Medinsky’s group discussed a wide range of political issues in Istanbul.
"This time, the plan is to discuss a wide range of issues, including the key ones, which concern territories and all other things, and are related to the demands that we have put forth. This is why the presence of the chief negotiator - that is, Medinsky - is necessary," Peskov noted.
Besides, a Western source told TASS that the issue of an energy truce "will definitely be brought up" in Geneva. Galuzin stressed in an interview with TASS that the US was aware that any forceful provocation by Kiev would reduce opportunities in terms of negotiations on resolving the conflict. He added that parties had agreed to prevent the talks from leaking.

UN experts link Guatemala’s attorney-general to illegal adoptions
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
GUATEMALA CITY - UN experts on Feb 16 called for an investigation into Guatemala’s attorney-general Maria Consuelo Porras for possible involvement in illegal adoptions of Indigenous children in the 1980s, during the country’s civil war.
The allegation came in a statement released in Geneva on Feb 16, the same day that Ms Porras, whose term as attorney-general ends in May, failed in her bid to be elected to Guatemala’s Constitutional Court.
The UN experts said they had received information about “at least 80 Indigenous children who were subjected to illegal international adoptions” after “their capture and forced disappearance between 1968 and 1996”.
The group noted that the minors were put up for adoption after being taken to the Elisa Martinez Temporary Home, where Ms Porras was director and also “legal guardian of the children from January 21 to August 30, 1982”, according to the statement.
AFP requested comment from the Guatemalan Prosecutor’s Office on the allegations against Ms Porras, but did not receive an immediate response.
The experts called for independent investigations into the allegations that public officials, including Ms Porras, were allegedly involved in the adoptions.
The group’s members criticised Ms Porras’s candidacy for the Constitutional Court – the highest in Guatemala – and urged those who elect the magistrates to exercise “caution in light of these serious allegations”.
The 72-year-old prosecutor has been sanctioned by the United States and the European Union for corruption.
Ms Porras has twice challenged President Bernardo Arevalo’s claim to power, launching an investigation into his Semilla party before his inauguration in January 2024.
The attorney-general has also been accused by the government and NGOs of protecting criminals, which she denies. AFP

Protest restrictions eased in Sydney after nearly two months

In brief
- NSW Police commissioner Mal Lanyon said he was satisfied there was no need to extend the restrictions by another two weeks.
- The organisers of a rally protesting Isaac Herzog's Australian visit are still pursuing a constitutional challenge to the laws.
Unprecedented restrictions on protests imposed in the wake of December's Bondi terror attack have been lifted.
On Tuesday, more than two months after the attack, NSW Police commissioner Mal Lanyon said he no longer needed the powers that restricted public assembly in some areas of Sydney.
The decision comes a week after police violently broke up protests against the Australian visit of Israeli President Isaac Herzog, which included demonstrators being punched and pepper-sprayed by authorities.
The state's police watchdog is investigating after receiving a significant number of complaints alleging misconduct.
The protest restrictions first came in on Christmas Eve after an emergency sitting of NSW parliament, and were extended multiple times.
The visit of the Israeli president had driven the latest extension of protest restrictions, Lanyon said, as he urged the community to be calm.
"We had the visit of a head of state; I had significant concerns about the safety of the community in managing the visit of a head of state (and) the movement of Jewish Australians who were there," he said.
"I'm satisfied the conditions that led to the extension last time do not exist now, and I'm more than happy for (police) to work with protesters."
Organisers of the 9 February rally are pressing on with a constitutional challenge in the NSW Court of Appeal to stop the laws from being used if a future terror attack is declared.
"The police commissioner was explicit that these undemocratic powers were all about "protecting" Herzog from "significant animosity" and mass protest," the Palestine Action Group said.
"Protesters who had nowhere to go were pepper-sprayed, assaulted, injured and arrested by an out-of-control police force who thought they could act with impunity."
How do the laws work?
The laws were rushed through NSW parliament after the deadly 14 December Bondi shooting and gave the commissioner the ability to limit protests after a declared terrorist incident.
The restrictions cover two-week periods, which can then be extended up to a total of three months.
Lanyon deployed his powers almost immediately, restricting protests across Sydney for two weeks from Christmas Eve.
The restrictions were later relaxed to cover areas that included most of the city centre and large parts of the eastern suburbs, including Bondi. They were extended by Lanyon multiple times.
Despite the fiery demonstration at Sydney's Town Hall, where both police and protesters were hospitalised, Lanyon argued the use of the laws had been a success.
Under the restrictions, protesters at Town Hall were not allowed to march to parliament as they had intended. The event was also policed under a major events declaration that gave authorities powers to clear the area at their determination.
No officers have been stood down due to alleged police brutality, Lanyon said.

'They want a deal': Trump says he will be indirectly involved in Iran talks

Court accepts police's appeal to remove Netanyahu's chief of staff from prime minister's office for a week
The Lod District Court extended the restrictive conditions imposed on Tzachi Braverman, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's chief of staff, and prohibited him from leaving the country or contacting members of the Prime Minister's Office until next Tuesday.
In doing so, the district court overturned for the 14th time the decision of the Magistrate's Court President, Menachem Mizrahi, who last week lifted the restrictive orders on Braverman, citing the importance of his appointment by Netanyahu as Israel's ambassador to Britain.
On Monday, Lod District Court Judge Michael Karshen said that there is "reasonable suspicion which has grown stronger" against Braverman, who is Braverman is suspected of obstructing the investigation into the "Bibileaks" case involving the leak of classified documents to the German newspaper Bild in 2024 in an attempt to influence Israeli public opinion concerning the hostages held in Gaza. Braverman allegedly met with former Prime Minister's Office spokesperson Eli Feldstein, a prime suspect in the case, and warned him that the military had opened an investigation into the leak of classified military documents to Netanyahu's office.
'They want a deal': Trump says he will be involved indirectly in Iran talks
U.S. President Donald Trump said on Monday that he would be involved "indirectly" in talks between Iran and the U.S. over Tehran's nuclear program set to begin on Tuesday in Geneva, adding he believed Tehran wanted to make a deal.
"I'll be involved in those talks, indirectly. And they'll be very important," Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One.
Tensions are soaring ahead of the talks, with the U.S. deploying a second aircraft carrier to the Middle East. The U.S. military is preparing for the possibility of a sustained military campaign if the talks do not succeed, U.S. officials have told Reuters.
Asked about the prospects for a deal, Trump said Iran sought tough negotiations but learned the consequences of such a hardened stance last summer when the U.S. bombed Iranian nuclear sites.
Trump suggested Iranians were motivated this time to negotiate.
"I don't think they want the consequences of not making a deal," Trump said.

Palestinian journalist arrested on suspicion of sending news clips to media agency designated as 'terrorist organization'
An independent journalist from East Jerusalem was arrested on Sunday on suspicion of sending news clips to a Palestinian media outlet designated as a terrorist organization.
The footage is not under suspicion for incitement, and it is unclear whether the journalist, Shireen al-Abeid, knew that AlQastal News was designated a terrorist organization. The police have charged the journalist with providing services to a terrorist organization, and on Monday morning, filed a request to extend her detention by seven days. Jerusalem Magistrate's Court Judge Gad Ehrenberg extended her detention by three days.
At the end of October 2023, then-Defense Minister Yoav Galant declared the news agency a terrorist organization, but it continued to operate based on materials collected online, reporting on Jerusalem and the West Bank. The videos that al-Abeid sent to AlQastal News were allegedly filmed in late 2025 and early January. She was taken in for questioning on Sunday while walking down the street. An ex parte arrest warrant was issued against her last month, meaning she would not be notified until police contact her to carry out the warrant, or until she is arrested.
The journalist's attorney, Mohammad Mahmoud, said at the hearing that the police prosecutor "tried to mislead the court as if the materials were published yesterday or the day before; we are talking about two and a half months ago." He added that she is not accused of incitement or support for terrorism and that "they could have summoned her and told her she was making a mistake and needed to be careful."
Mahmoud questioned why the arrest warrant issued against al-Abeid was not carried out earlier. "All this time she was not dangerous, and suddenly she is dangerous?" he asked. Judge Ehrenberg noted that al-Abeid did not deny in her interrogation that she had sent videos she filmed to the media outlet.
Trump tells New York Post that $5 billion from Board of Peace to fund stability in Gaza, 'other areas of the world'
In an interview with the New York Post, U.S. President Donald Trump said that $5 billion in funding from Board of Peace member states will go towards "making Gaza happen," but was unable to specify whether the money would go towards housing.
Trump said the funds would go to "making [Gaza] stable, and ultimately, I think, to other areas of the world that can, you know, where peace can be brought about," in an apparent reference to the board's charter, which suggests that Trump has begun to position it as a rival to the United Nations. Notably, the document does not mention Gaza by name.
The White House is advancing plans to grant a broad mandate to a proposed Board of Peace that would administer the Gaza Strip and eventually take on other global conflicts, according to three sources who spoke with Haaretz.

■ Addressing ongoing nuclear talks with Iran and the threat of U.S. military intervention, U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham said that "Trump is looking for which line can catch the biggest fish," adding that a decision on a deal or U.S. strike is a matter of "weeks – not months."
■ Speaking to the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations in Jerusalem on Monday, U.S. Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee said that there is "legitimate doubt" Iran would compromise in talks with the United States, and that he is "willing to stand in the middle" if another war between Israel and Iran is launched.
■ U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio thanked Hungary's nationalist Prime Minister Viktor Orban for the "indispensable role" he has played in U.S. President Donald Trump's Board of Peace, adding that U.S. negotiators are "on their way" to meet with Iranian officials.
■ Justice Minister Yariv Levin said he will not commit to obeying the High Court if it orders him to convene the Judicial Appointments Committee, after a show cause order was issued for Levin to explain why he hasn't convened the committee, which has delayed the appointment of around 150 judges.
■ A man was fatally shot in the northern Israeli Arab town of Tamra, police said. The killing is suspected to be revenge for the murder of Wafa Awad on Thursday. A father and son were shot to death inside a car in the northern Arab Israeli city of Umm al-Fahm, raising Israel's homicide rate to a total of 52 since the beginning of the year, with 47 from Arab society.
■ Israeli police tear-gassed an elementary school in the middle of the school day, in the Bedouin community of Tarabin in southern Israel.

Hyatt Hotels chairman Thomas Pritzker steps down over Epstein ties
Pritzker steps down as Hyatt executive chairman, effective immediately, due to his relationship with the late sex offender.
Billionaire Thomas J Pritzker has announced that he is retiring as executive chairman of Hyatt Hotels Corporation over his long association with sex offenders Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, which came to light in recently released US Justice Department files.
Pritzker, 75, who has served in the role of Hyatt Hotels’ executive chairman since 2004, also said on Monday that he will not seek re-election to the company’s board at its 2026 annual stockholder meeting.

In a letter to the Hyatt board and a related statement, Pritzker expressed deep regret over maintaining contact with Epstein, who took his own life in prison in 2019, and Maxwell, describing it as “terrible judgement”, with no excuse for not distancing himself sooner.
“Good stewardship also means protecting Hyatt, particularly in the context of my association with Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell which I deeply regret,” he said in the statement.
“I exercised terrible judgement in maintaining contact with them, and there is no excuse for failing to distance myself sooner.”
Newly released documents by the Justice Department show that Pritzker had ongoing and regular contact with Epstein for years after the financier’s conviction on sex crime charges in 2008, according to The New York Times.
Pritzker is the latest powerful figure facing repercussions after the release of millions of pages of documents showing the depth of Epstein’s network of business, political and cultural elites in the US and around the world.
Goldman Sachs chief legal counsel Kathryn Ruemmler resigned last week over her ties to Epstein. Norwegian police said they had conducted searches of properties owned by former Prime Minister Thorbjorn Jagland as part of a corruption investigation into his connections with the late sex offender.
The head of DP Ports World, the world’s largest port operator, Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem, was also replaced over his close friendship with Epstein, while economist Larry Summers resigned from the OpenAI board late last year.
Former United Kingdom ambassador to Washington, Peter Mandelson, has been asked to submit himself for an interview and answer questions as part of a US congressional investigation into Epstein.
In a letter sent to Mandelson by Democratic Representatives Robert Garcia and Suhas Subramanyam, both members of the US House of Representatives Oversight Committee, the lawmakers said it was “clear” that the former ambassador “possessed extensive social and business ties” to Epstein and requested that he make himself available for a transcribed interview.
Mandelson took up the prestigious post as the UK’s ambassador to the US in February 2025. He was removed from the role in September 2025 after UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s government said new information had come to light showing the much deeper nature of his longstanding ties with Epstein.
The Mandelson controversy has led to calls for Starmer to stand down as prime minister, with critics questioning his judgement in appointing him to the ambassador’s role.
Starmer’s chief of staff and cabinet secretary have also stood down due to the scandal .

Gateway readies rigs for 16km WA gold play
Brought to you by BULLS N’ BEARS
Gateway Mining is about to plunge the drill bit into one of its most compelling new targets yet at the company’s Yandal gold project in Western Australia, with a large-scale maiden drilling campaign set to fire up in early March at the Great Western prospect.
Detailed lithological and structural mapping has confirmed what the company describes as a “textbook” gold setting, with a differentiated dolerite unit running along the western margin of the primary Great Western shear zone.
The unit displays textural zonation and chilled margins strikingly similar to dolerite-hosted deposits in the Eastern Goldfields, including Northern Star’s famed Jundee and the Junction deposit in the prolific St Ives gold camp.
We are very excited to begin unlocking thepotential within the Great Western corridor.Gateway Mining executive chairman Andrew Bray
Gateway Mining executive chairman Andrew Bray said: “The mapping at Great Western has confirmed a textbook structural and lithological setting that is strikingly similar to some of the most significant dolerite-hosted gold camps in the Eastern Goldfields.”
Management believes that the elucidation of the shear zone in contact with a highly prospective dolerite, together with coherent gold-in-soil and nugget anomalism, all point to the possibility of a large gold system.
It is this sheared dolerite margin that will be the focus of an extensive part of the upcoming drilling, as it represents an optimal host for gold mineralisation due to the high competency contrast between different rock types.
Currently, the mapped dolerite unit spans an impressive 7km of outcrop. However, magnetic imagery indicates the unit likely extends for approximately 16km along strike - a mammoth corridor-scale feature that remains largely untested.
Significantly, gold-in-soil anomalies and nugget patches track the sheared eastern margin of the dolerite across the entire sampled length to date. The highest-tenor anomalies cluster along what the company has predictably dubbed the “Target Shear Zone,” - a structure that splays from the Horse Well Gold Camp at the Warmblood deposit before flexing north along the dolerite margin.
Structural mapping has also revealed multi-phase deformation, cross-cutting features and linking structures — geological ingredients that create dilation zones capable of channelling large volumes of hydrothermal fluids. In other words, the right plumbing network appears to be there.
To test the theory, Gateway has designed a two-pronged maiden drilling campaign deploying two aircore rigs and one RC rig. The aircore rigs will sweep across the gold-in-soil anomalies along the sheared dolerite–intermediate volcanic contact, while the RC rig will step in where outcrop prevents effective penetration.
Regional wide-spaced drilling will also probe textural zonation within the dolerite and assess splay structures diverging from the main shear zone, with additional drilling planned once northern soil assays are received.
Gateway’s Yandal project covers a stonking 1780 square kilometres of prime Yandal greenstones, 85km northeast of Wiluna and just 40km from Northern Star’s abounding multi-million-ounce Jundee operation.
The project already hosts an 8.17 million tonne resource grading 1.52 grams per tonne gold for 400,400 ounces across the company’s Horse Well and Dusk ’til Dawn deposits.
Gateway enters the Great Western drill program well-funded, holding $19.4 million in cash and $9.3 million in liquid ASX securities at the end of December.
Armed with 16km of strike in a nugget-rich shear corridor that carries all the structural hallmarks of WA’s best gold camps, Gateway now hands the story to the drill bit to see if geological promise translates into ounces.

Oscar-winning filmmaker Frederick Wiseman dies; movies comprised revelatory history of US institutions
Unknown

Frederick Wiseman, the celebrated director of “Titicut Follies” and dozens of other documentaries whose in-depth, unadorned movies comprised a unique and revelatory history of American institutions, died Monday at age 96.
The death was announced in a joint statement from his family and from his production company, Zipporah Films. Additional details were not immediately available.
“He will be deeply missed by his family, friends, colleagues, and the countless filmmakers and audiences around the world whose lives and perspectives were shaped by his unique vision,” the statement said.
Among the world’s most admired and influential filmmakers, Wiseman won an honorary Academy Award in 2016 and completed more than 35 documentaries, some several hours long. With subjects ranging from a suburban high school to a horse race track, his work was aired on public television, screened at retrospectives, spotlighted in festivals, praised by critics and fellow directors and preserved by the Library of Congress.
Wiseman was in his mid-30s before he made his first full-length movie, but was soon ranked with — and sometimes above — such notable peers as D.A. Pennebaker and Robert Drew for helping to establish the modern documentary as a vital and surprising art form.
Starting with “High School” and the scandalous “Titicut Follies,” he patented a seamless, affecting style, using a crew so tiny that Wiseman served as his own sound engineer. The results led to acclaim, amusement, head-shaking, finger-pointing and — with “Titicut Follies” — prolonged legal action.
“I don’t set out to be confrontational, but I think sometimes the content of the movie runs against people’s expectations and fantasies about the subject matter,” Wiseman told Gawker in 2013.
Wiseman’s vision was to make “as many films as possible about different aspects of American life,” and he often gave his documentaries self-explanatory titles: “Hospital,” “Public Housing,” “Basic Training,” “Boxing Gym.” But he also dramatized how people functioned within those settings: an elderly welfare applicant begging for assistance, a military trainee complaining of harassment, a doctor trying to coax coherent answers out of a dazed heroin addict, sales clerks at Neiman Marcus rehearsing their smiles.
“The institution is also just an excuse to observe human behavior in somewhat defined conditions,” Wiseman told The Associated Press in 2020. “The films are as much about that as they are about institutions.”
The bitter and the sweet
For “Titicut Follies,” which premiered in 1967, Wiseman visited the Massachusetts-based Bridgewater State Hospital for the criminally insane. He amassed footage of nude men being baited by sadistic guards and one inmate being force-fed as he lies on a table, liquid pouring down a rubber hose shoved into his nose. The images were so appalling and embarrassing that state officials successfully restricted its release, giving the film exalted status among those determined to see it.
In “High School,” released in 1968, Wiseman recorded daily life in a suburban Philadelphia school. He filmed a student being questioned about whether he has permission to make a phone call, an English teacher earnestly analyzing the lyrics of Simon & Garfunkel’s “The Dangling Conversation,” an awkward sex education class in which boys are told the more active they are, the more insecure they must be.
“What we see in Fred Wiseman’s documentary ... is so familiar and so extraordinarily evocative that a feeling of empathy with the students floods over us,” The New Yorker’s Pauline Kael wrote. “Wiseman extends our understanding of our common life the way novelists used to.”
Wiseman made movies without narration, prerecorded soundtracks and title cards. But he disputed, forcefully, that he was part of the “cinema verite” movement of the 1960s and ‘70s, calling it a “pompous French term that has absolutely no meaning.”
He also differed with how others interpreted his viewpoint. While Oscar-winner Errol Morris dubbed him “the undisputed king of misanthropic cinema,” Wiseman insisted that he was not a muckraker out to correct injustice. He saw himself as a subjective, but fair-minded and engaged observer who discovered through the work itself how he felt about a given project, combing through hundreds of hours of footage and unearthing a story — sometimes despairing, sometimes hopeful. For “High School II,” he visited a school in East Harlem in the 1990s, and was impressed by the commitment of the teachers and administrators.
“I think it’s as important to document kindness, civility and generosity of spirit as it is to show cruelty, banality and indifference,” Wiseman said when he accepted his honorary Oscar.
He was as adventurous in his 80s and 90s as he was in his 30s, making “Crazy Horse” about the erotic Parisian dance revue, the four-hour “At Berkeley,” about the California state university, and the 2 1/2 hour “Monrovia, Indiana” about an aging rural community.
Wiseman also had a long career in theater, staging plays by Samuel Beckett and William Luce among others and adapting his movie “Welfare” into an opera. In 2025, he had brief acting roles in two acclaimed movies — as a poet in “Jane Austen Wrecked My Life” and off-screen as a radio announcer in “Eephus.”
Much of his own work was made through Zipporah, named for his wife, who died in 2021. They had two children.
The poetry of life
Wiseman was born in Boston, his father a prominent attorney, his mother an administrator at a children’s psychiatric ward and a would-be actor who entertained her son with stories and imitations. His education was elite despite attending schools with Jewish quotas — Williams College and Yale Law School — and his real life experiences were invaluable for the movies he would end up making.
In the 1950s and early ‘60s, he worked in the Massachusetts attorney general’s office, was a court reporter in Fort Benning, Georgia; and Philadelphia, a research associate at Brandeis University and a lecturer at Boston Law School. Drafted into the Army in 1955 and stationed in Paris, he picked up some practical film knowledge by shooting street scenes with a Super 8 camera.
“I reached the witching age of 30 and figured I better do something I liked,” Wiseman told the AP in 2016. “It was just a few years after the technological developments that it made it possible to shoot synchronous sound ... so that opened up the world for filmmaking. And there were so many good subjects that hadn’t been filmed, as there still are.”
His new career began with narrative drama. He read William Miller’s “The Cool World,” a novel about young Black people on the streets of Harlem, called up the author and acquired rights. Wiseman served as producer of the low-budget, 1964 adaptation that was directed by Shirley Clarke, and he became confident that he could handle a movie himself.
While teaching at Boston Law School, Wiseman organized class trips to the nearby Bridgewater facility. In 1965, he wrote to officials there, proposing a film — ultimately “Titicut Follies” — that would give the “audience factual material about a state prison but will also give an imaginative and poetic quality that will set it apart from the cliche documentary about crime and illness.”
Around the time the movie was screened at the New York Film Festival, the state of Massachusetts sought an injunction, alleging that Wiseman had violated the prisoners’ privacy. For more than 20 years, Wiseman was permitted to show “Titicut Follies” only in prescribed settings such as libraries and colleges. The ban was finally relaxed when Superior Court Judge Andrew Meyer in Boston first ruled that the documentary could be shown to the general public if faces were blurred, then, in 1991, lifted all restrictions.
“I have viewed the film and agree that it is a substantial and significant intrusion into the privacy of the inmates shown in the film,” Meyer wrote in his initial opinion in 1989. “However, I also regarded ‘Titicut Follies’ as an outstanding film, artistically and thoughtfully edited with great social and historical value.
“Another observation about the film: It is true.”

Kherson State University attacked again amid ongoing Russian shelling
The photos were shared on Facebook by the university’s rector, Oleksandr Spivakovskyi, Ukrinform reports.
"Last night, Russian barbarians continued to destroy the main building of Kherson State University," the rector wrote.
According to him, the attack targeted classrooms in the Faculty of Physics and Mathematics, where physics laboratories are located training hundreds of future physics teachers.
As reported by Ukrinform, since April 2022, Kherson State University has been temporarily relocated to the campus of Ivano-Frankivsk National University.
Previous Russian strikes damaged the university building on October 12 and October 17, 2023, in Kherson.
On March 28, 2024, Russian forces again shelled Kherson State University, destroying classrooms.
Overnight on January 13, 2026, Russian invading troops carried out another drone attack on the university building.

Floods: 'The volumes of torrential rain unleashed by storms are higher today – it's the sign of a warmer climate'

France has been experiencing an unprecedented situation of "generalized flooding across the entire national territory, because all the soils are saturated everywhere," stated Vigicrues, the public agency responsible for informing the public about flood risks, on Saturday, February 14. "We have broken all our records," added its director, Lucie Chadourne-Facon. By Sunday, the Garonne river reached a "plateau," but water levels could rise again in the coming week due to more storms, according to the prefectures of Gironde and Lot-et-Garonne. Françoise Vimeux, research director at the Institut de recherche pour le développement (IRD), noted that violent storms like Nils are not new, but that their impacts have been worsened by climate change.
Are the storms affecting France the result of climate change?
Based on observations from recent decades, there has been no detectable impact of climate change on winter storms in France – not in their frequency, their path or the intensity of the winds they bring. France has faced a series of extreme weather events in recent weeks, but it has experienced similar events in the past: Lothar and Martin in December 1999, Xynthia in February 2010, to name just the most significant.
There is no long-term trend indicating that there are more storms now than before, or that storms are becoming more violent, even though wind records have been broken this week. We should not let weather alerts distort our perception. Let's not forget that the storm vigilance system was only put in place in 2001. So we only have 25 years of records for these alerts. Had such warnings existed in 1999, the storms at the time would have been classified as "red," and comparisons with current events would be put in perspective.

People are marking the Lunar New Year on Tuesday with prayers, fireworks and festivities.
The activities ushered in the Year of the Horse, one of 12 animals in the Chinese zodiac, succeeding the Year of the Snake.
The Lunar New Year is the most important annual holiday in China and some other East Asian nations and is celebrated outside the region, too.
Temple crowds at midnight in Hong Kong
Incense smoke wafted into the air at a temple in Hong Kong where people line up every year to make wishes for the new year at midnight.
Holding up a cluster of incense sticks, many bowed their heads several times before planting the sticks in containers placed in front of a temple hall.
Fireworks light up skies in Vietnam
Entertainers in Vietnam sang at an outdoor countdown event before multiple fireworks shows at several cities in the Southeast Asian nation, where the festival is called Tet.
Light shows lit up bridges and skyscrapers as the fireworks went off and crowds clapped in rhythm to live pop music performances.
Chinese street fairs in Moscow
People sampled Chinese cuisine from stalls and strolled along snowy streets decorated with red lanterns and dragons as two weeks of events got underway Monday at various venues in the Russian capital.
The third annual Lunar New Year celebration comes at at time of warming relations between China and Russia — ties that have frustrated many European governments because of the war in Ukraine.
A temple bell rings 108 times in Taiwan
The solemn peal of a temple bell rang out 108 times — an auspicious number — as people flocked to the Baoan Temple in Taipei on Tuesday morning.
They lit incense sticks, bowed their heads and left offerings of colorful flower bouquets on outdoor tables on the temple grounds in Taiwan's capital city.

Trump envoy Steve Witkoff and son-in-law Jared Kushner will meet delegates from Russia and Ukraine in Geneva. Key US politics stories from 16 February at a glance
Donald Trump has piled pressure on Ukraine to reach a deal with Russia “fast” before US-brokered talks in Geneva on Tuesday. “Ukraine better come to the table, fast,” the US president told reporters onboard Air Force One while en route to Washington.
Trump is pushing to end the conflict, which began when Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, but two previous rounds of US-mediated talks in Abu Dhabi did not yield any signs of a breakthrough.
Moscow has stuck to its demands in the talks for sweeping territorial and political concessions from Ukraine – rejected by Kyiv as tantamount to capitulation.
Trump’s top envoy, Steve Witkoff, and son-in-law Jared Kushner will be in the US delegation, while the former Russian culture minister Vladimir Medinsky will lead Moscow’s team.

Coles says ‘Down Down’ ads a ‘furphy’ as it defends discounts

Coles concedes mistake in ‘discounting’ item to make it more expensive after a week
Updated ,first published
Coles has conceded it made a mistake when it “discounted” tins of dog food to $4.50 that had been selling for $4 just eight days earlier, declaring it usually had guardrails requiring items to be at a base price for a month before putting them on special.
On Tuesday, the second day of the landmark case by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission against the supermarket over alleged illusory discounts, Coles’ legal team claimed the watchdog’s overall focus on the “Down Down” ad jingle was “a bit of a furphy”.
Coles’ lead barrister, John Sheahan, KC, noted how lawyers for the ACCC had played two TV ads promoting the “Down Down” campaign for the court to illustrate the context in which consumers viewed pricing tickets for items that were “discounted” after being briefly increased in price.
Sheahan argued evidence about the broader advertising context was irrelevant because the ACCC’s legal complaint was focused on movements in prices for a range of supermarket items.
“It’s all, with respect, a bit of a furphy,” Sheahan told Justice Michael O’Bryan.
The watchdog’s complaint alleges that Coles moved an item from its regular price, known as price one, to an artificially higher price for a deliberately short period, before reducing it to a third “Down Down” price that was often higher than it started at. The “Down Down” promotions included a “was/is” price demonstrating the difference between the third and second price.
When it opened its case on Monday, the ACCC examined price fluctuations in 1.2kg tins of chicken and vegetable Nature’s Gift Wet Dog Food, which was priced at $4 between April 18, 2022, and February 7, 2023, and then spiked to a $6 for just seven days before Coles introduced its “Down Down” price of $4.50.
On Tuesday, Sheahan said Coles acknowledged this as a “mistake” and an outlier. He said the supermarket largely relied on guardrails dictating that when a product’s price went up, it should sit at that amount for at least four weeks before a longer term “Down Down” discount applied.
This admission followed evidence from a Coles internal email on Monday showing a senior manager warned that advertising a product’s price as “Down Down” when it was cheaper just four weeks earlier was not in the spirit of the marketing campaign.
Many of Coles’ arguments that were aired on Tuesday focused on consumers’ sense of time and attention spans, while emphasising that commercial forces such as suppliers’ costs were a key influence on supermarkets’ pricing decisions.
Sheahan said the “Down Down” advertising campaign and the big red hand were not advertising a specific discount, but a broader indication the supermarket was “trying to keep prices low”.
Sheahan also conceded an argument the ACCC made on Monday that Coles, when setting a second, higher “establishing” price for a product before a “Down Down” discount, had planned and agreed on the third “Down Down” price at the time the second price came into effect.
But he suggested that while this might be true, it was not as important as market and inflation pressures on pricing. “In the end, all prices are temporary, nothing lasts forever,” he said.
Sheehan also said ACCC’s argument assumed a thought process from shoppers that was unrealistically complex.
He said that in a high-inflation environment, people understood prices would be changing, and that “Down Down” ticket labels with a was/is price were “a legitimate sign, a genuine sign, of good value today”.
“The idea of a previous regular price in the sense of one that is not relatively short … is too complex to credibly attribute to an ordinary, reasonable consumer walking down an aisle at Coles,” Sheahan said.
He said the ACCC needed to prove its claim that the second, “ephemeral price” was not genuine to prove that its subsequent “Down Down” prices were not genuine.
The case centres on a sample of items including dog food, Shapes biscuits and Coca-Cola sold between January 2021 and May 2023, which the ACCC’s lawyers said had been sold under a strategy that suggested discounts which were “utterly misleading” or a “half-truth”. The hearing will continue for the rest of this week and the next, with witnesses expected to begin appearing from Wednesday.

Next Brisbane suburb in line for increased housing revealed
Sandgate could be the next Brisbane suburb in line for taller towers and redeveloped streets, with a plan to increase housing density announced on Tuesday.
The office of Lord Mayor Adrian Schrinner said its proposal could add hundreds of new homes to the northern bayside suburb, which it identified as one of the slowest-growing areas in the city.
The proposed area for the “Suburban Renewal Precinct Plan” would run along the north side of the train line, and extend to Burnett Place.
Much of the main business area along Rainbow Street would be taken in, as would several green spaces including Einbunpin Lagoon Park and Sandgate War Memorial Park.
Precinct plans in other suburbs including Stones Corner and Wynnum have included rezoning to allow taller towers and mixed-use hubs with retail space and homes.
The council had argued these areas would develop into residential hubs well served by public transport, and go some way towards rectifying the housing shortage that sent prices skyrocketing since the COVID pandemic.
“Our plan for Sandgate is about encouraging more homes close to shops, cafes, community facilities and great public transport,” city planning chair Adam Allan said.
“We’ll work with the community to strike the right balance and protect Sandgate’s bayside character and outdoor lifestyle.”
Jared Cassidy, the leader of the Labor council opposition, represents the Deagon ward that takes in Sandgate. He has long argued the council’s approach to housing has been too narrowly focused on supply, and should incorporate aspirational affordability targets.
On Tuesday, Cassidy questioned the suitability of Sandgate for significant height increases, citing flood risk among other concerns, and said any plan for redevelopment in the suburb should include the old gasworks site.
“It’s like the LNP really don’t understand Sandgate very well,” he said.
If the new plan was approved, Sandgate would likely join Wynnum, Alderley, Mount Gravatt and Stones Corner as suburban renewal precincts.
This masthead previously revealed Stafford, Moorooka and Salisbury had also been considered as possible renewal precincts.
The plan will come before councillors on Tuesday afternoon.
The proposed area will go to community for public consultation first.

Long-time Trump adviser Steve Bannon and sex criminal Jeffrey Epstein discussed invoking the 25th Amendment to remove Donald Trump from office during his first term, according to newly released Epstein files.
In a text message exchange that began on New Year’s Eve in 2018, shortly after Democrats retook the House of Representatives in the midterm elections, the two men discussed Trump’s political position, with Bannon lamenting that the “WH,” a likely reference to the White House, has “zero plan to punch back.”
“He is really borderline,” Epstein responded. “Not sure what he may do.”
“I think it’s beyond borderline — 25 amendment,” Bannon added, a reference to the provision in the Constitution that allows the vice president and a majority of the cabinet to remove the president if they are deemed unfit for office.
Elsewhere in the conversation, Bannon suggests “we really need an intervention” regarding Trump.
Critics of Trump have frequently called for those around him to invoke the 25th Amendment, and senior officials at the FBI and Justice Department allegedly discussed the possibility during Trump’s first term.
Conservatives reacted angrily to the exchange online.
In a post on X, Trump’s first-term national security adviser Mike Flynn called on the DOJ to bring Bannon in for questioning.
“I agree completely,” former congresswoman and ex-Trump ally Marjorie Taylor Greene responded to the post. “Steve Bannon went to jail for Trump (I was there), but back on 1-1-19 (after Dems took the House) he was texting with Epstein about 25th amendment. Also, there is no excuse for having such a friendly relationship with Epstein, post conviction, 2018-19. None.”
The Independent has contacted Bannon’s representatives for comment.
Around this time, Bannon had been out of the administration for over a year and was working to make a documentary about Epstein.
In the six months before Epstein was arrested in the summer of 2019 on sex trafficking charges, Bannon also communicated with Epstein about media training, rehabilitating Epstein’s image, and even which lawyers to hire, according to an analysis of the Epstein files by The New York Times.
“I am a filmmaker and TV host with decades of experience interviewing controversial figures,” Bannon told the paper. “That’s the only lens through which these private communications should be viewed — a documentary filmmaker working, over a period of time, to secure 50 hours of interviews from a reclusive subject.”
The film was meant to “destroy the very myths he created,” Bannon added of Epstein.
Bannon has remained a loyal Trump ally, going to prison in 2024 on a contempt charge for refusing to cooperate in the congressional investigation into the January 6 Capitol insurrection.
The far-right podcaster has since advocated for Trump to seek an unconstitutional third term.

China’s companies cut back on year-end bonuses as profit margins narrow
As China heads into the Year of the Horse, its firms’ bonuses have slowed to a trot, with many employees missing out completely
Many companies have even barred employees from discussing bonus details in public. Such a collective “low-key” approach has itself become a telling footnote to the shifting workplace landscape nationwide, compared with the generous bonuses and lavish gifts showered upon employees during the tech and real estate boom.
Data corroborates this shift. According to a 2026 market outlook and salary report released in January by Randstad, a global human consulting firm, 26 per cent of respondents said they would receive no year-end bonuses for 2025, while nearly half the reported payouts topping out at the equivalent of one to two months’ salary.
She added that even among companies with growth projections, “only a few business units are planning very limited headcount increases, while the vast majority of departments have frozen hiring”.

Flashmob protesters block New York’s 5th Avenue in front of Trump Tower on Presidents Day
The profanity-packed action was one of numerous demonstrations held across the country, from New England to California’s Coachella Valley

Hundreds of New Yorkers marked Presidents Day by gathering outside Trump Tower on Monday to raise their middle fingers against Donald Trump.
According to videos and local media reports, demonstrators filled 5th Avenue just after 1 p.m. Monday and apparently blocked vehicle traffic, while banging drums, playing music, and changing "f*** Trump!"
Photos showed marchers with signs branding Trump a "TRAITOR", and a wannabe dictator, as well as a huge banner calling for him to be impeached, convicted, and removed from office.
A spokesperson for the NYPD told The Independent that "multiple people" had been arrested, but could not say how many or what they had been charged with.
The protest was organized by Rise and Resist, a direct action group, and 50501, the loose anti-Trump network behind last year's No Kings demonstrations, according to an Instagram post by Rise and Resist.
It was one of numerous small protests and rallies organized around the country for Presidents day, ranging from California's Coachella Valley to New England and upstate New York.
"He’s violating every principle that we believe he should be upholding, and that the Constitution requires," one demonstrator in Waterville, Maine, told the Morning Sentinel.
"We don’t claim Trump as our president. He’s not representing us in any sort of way that anyone would want to be represented," another in Concord, New Hampshire told InDepthNH.org.
Numerous chants and signs focused on Trump's connections to Jeffrey Epstein, his attempts to centralize power under the office of the president, and his mass detention and deportation campaign against immigrants.
On Saturday, an investigation by Reuters found more than 4,400 cases in which the Trump administration was ruled by a judge to have detained immigrants illegally.
Polls show that Trump has become deeply unpopular across a wide range of U.S. voters, with four separate polls on Monday registering the lowest approval ratings of his term so far.
Trump was not present in Trump Tower on Monday. Still, the protest there reportedly had a "party-like atmosphere", with loudspeakers playing music and some protesters dancing, according to the amNewYork newspaper.
"There’s no reason for ICE to be in the streets, for them to be undercover, for them to take citizens unwillingly and put them into camps, essentially, and stealing them from their families," protester Elaine Wong told the paper.
"It is my duty as a citizen... to protect my neighbors, my friends, and all my family. They deserve to be here just as much as anybody else."
The White House and the New York City mayor's office did not respond to requests for comment.

Ukraine's military turns Russian equipment into 'scrap metal' in newly released video
Ukraine's military intelligence agency (HUR) released video footage on Feb. 16 showing a series of attacks carried out last week by the elite Prymary ("Ghosts") unit against Russian military targets in Crimea.
Specialists from the unit "continue to methodically dismantle Russian defenses on the temporarily occupied peninsula," HUR wrote on social media.
Over the past week, the unit targeted several high-value pieces of Russian military equipment, including a Pantsir missile system, 55Zh6U Nebo-U long-range radar station—worth about $100 million—and a BK-16 landing craft.
"Equipment that costs millions is now being turned into scrap metal thanks to the professional work of (Ukraine's) military intelligence officers," the agency added.
The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims.
Ukraine regularly strikes military infrastructure deep within Russia and its own occupied territories in an effort to diminish Moscow's fighting power.
Since illegally annexing Crimea in 2014, Russia has heavily militarized the peninsula, using it as a base for regular missile and drone strikes against Ukraine, operations in the Black Sea, and ground operations into southern Ukraine.
Since 2023, Ukraine has steadily expanded its ability to strike Russian targets in Crimea, using both aerial and maritime drones depending on the target.

Trump says US in talks with Cuba, calls it a 'failed state'

The US is talking to Cuba "right now," US President Donald Trump has said.
"We're talking to Cuba right now," he told reporters en route to Washington from Palm Beach, Florida.
Trump said US Secretary of State Marco Rubio is holding the talks.
"They should absolutely make a deal," he added.
Trump called Cuba "a failed nation."
"We'll see how it all turns out. But Cuba and us, we are talking. In the meantime, there's an embargo, there's no oil, there's no money," he said.
Asked if he would consider a military operation like the one in Venezuela, Trump said he did not want to answer that question.
"Why would I answer that? If I was, it wouldn't be a very tough operation, as you can figure, but I don't think that'll be necessary," he said.
The US has reinstated its blockade of Cuba, declaring its intention to overthrow the republic's leftist government by one means or another.
Washington has imposed an embargo on fuel deliveries to the island nation, which was already facing acute shortages.
The US previously halted oil supplies to Cuba from Mexico and Venezuela, and in the latter case, US forces abducted President Nicolas Maduro.
Washington has also announced its intention to impose proportional import duties on goods from countries that “dare to” supply fuel to Cuba.

Lebanon says four months needed for second phase of Hezbollah disarmament

Lebanon sets four months for second phase of Hezbollah disarmament
Announcement comes as Hezbollah rejects calls to dismantle its arsenals north of the Litani River, describing pressure to do so as a ‘grave sin’.
Lebanon’s government has said that its military will need at least four months to complete the second phase of its plan to dismantle Hezbollah’s arsenals in the country’s south.
The announcement by Minister of Information Paul Morcos on Monday comes amid growing pressure from the United States and Israel for Hezbollah to disarm, including near-daily Israeli attacks on Lebanon.

- list 2 of 4Israel bombs Lebanon-Syria border, kills four people

- list 4 of 4Israeli forces kill nine Palestinians in Gaza, attack southern Lebanon
The bombings come despite Israel agreeing to a US-brokered ceasefire in 2024 to end more than a year of cross-border hostilities with Hezbollah.
The conflict left the Lebanese armed group badly weakened, with much of its leadership killed.
Under the ceasefire deal, Lebanon’s government committed to dismantling Hezbollah’s arsenal and tasked its military with drawing up a plan to do so.
The military said last month that it had completed the first phase of the five-stage plan, covering the area between the Litani River and the country’s southern border with Israel.
The second phase concerns the area between the Litani and the Awali rivers, about 40km (25 miles) south of the Lebanese capital, Beirut.
Morcos, Lebanon’s information minister, told a news conference after a cabinet session that the government “took note of the army leadership’s presentation” on the second stage of the plan.
“There is a timeframe of four months, extendable depending on available capabilities, Israeli attacks and hindrances on the ground,” he said.
Hezbollah, which has dismissed efforts to disarm it as a US-Israeli plan, has rejected calls to surrender weapons north of the Litani River, saying it understands the ceasefire agreement to apply “exclusively south” of the waterway.
Before the cabinet session on Monday, Hezbollah chief Naim Qassem said that “what the Lebanese government is doing in focusing on disarmament is a grave sin, because this issue serves the goals of the Israeli aggression”.
“Stop all action to restrict weapons,” he added in a televised address, saying the government’s “successive concessions” were partly to blame for Israel’s persistent attacks.
Qassem’s comments came as the Israeli military launched new raids on southern Lebanon, striking a bus in the town of Hanine and a car in the town of Talloussah, killing at least two people.
The Israeli military confirmed the attack on Talloussah, saying it had targeted a Hezbollah fighter who was trying to rebuild the group’s infrastructure in southern Lebanon.
Israel has previously criticised the Lebanese military’s progress on disarming Hezbollah as insufficient.
In addition to the regular strikes, it also continues to occupy five areas in Lebanese territory, blocking the reconstruction of destroyed border villages and preventing tens of thousands of displaced people from returning to their homes.
According to Lebanese authorities, Israeli forces have killed more than 370 people since the ceasefire, while the United Nations said Israel has launched more than 10,000 air and ground attacks in the year since it agreed to halt hostilities.
Lebanon filed a complaint with the UN last month about the repeated Israeli violations, urging the UN Security Council to push Israel to end its attacks and fully withdraw from the country.
The complaint said Israel violated Lebanon’s sovereignty at least 2,036 times in the last three months of 2025 alone.

The three men who killed a man and gang-raped two women, including one Israeli tourist, were sentenced to death in India on Monday by a court in Karnataka.
According to local media, the convicts received capital punishment for the murder and sexual assault of the two women back in March 2025 in Koppal, India.
Five people were attacked by the perpetrators that night: two Indian nationals from Maharashtra and Odisha, an American tourist, an Israeli tourist, and a Koppal local woman who owned a homestay in the area and was hosting the tourists.
The owner took the tourists on a sightseeing tour when the three convicts, identified as Mallesh (Handimalla), Saikumar, and Sharanabasavaraj, approached the group on a motorcycle, claiming they intended to resolve a "financial conflict."
After a brief fight, the men pushed the three men from the tourist group into a nearby canal and gang-raped the women. They also threw rocks towards the men to stop them from climbing back up, killing one of them in the process.
Court orders capital punishment, imprisonment until 'last breath'
According to The Times of India, the men were convicted of gang rape, murder, attempt to murder, robbery, and extortion.
"Hence, the Judge Sadananda Nagappa Naik under section 103 of the Bharatiya Nyay Sanhita gave them capital punishment. For the gang rape, the court ordered imprisonment till their last breath," the public prosecutor in charge of the case said.
According to her recall of the events, one of the men was saved by the American tourist while the other one drowned in the canal.

Ukraine war briefing: Kyiv’s forces made fastest battlefield gains since 2023, analysis finds

Ukraine recaptured 201 sq km from Russia between Wednesday and Sunday last week, taking advantage of a Starlink shutdown for Russian forces, according to an Agence France-Presse analysis of data from the Institute for the Study of War (ISW). The recaptured area (78 sq miles) is almost equivalent to the Russian gains for the entire month of December and is the most land retaken by Kyiv’s forces in such a short period since a June 2023 counteroffensive. The recaptured land is concentrated mainly to the east of the city of Zaporizhzhia, in an area where Russian troops have made significant progress since mid-2025. “These Ukrainian counterattacks are likely leveraging the recent block on Russian forces’ access to Starlink, which Russian milbloggers (military bloggers) have claimed is causing communications and command and control issues on the battlefield,” said the ISW thinktank.
-
On 5 February, military observers noted disruption of the Starlink antennas used by Moscow on the frontlines, after announcements by Elon Musk of “measures” to end the Kremlin’s use of this technology, the AFP report said. Kyiv claimed that Russian drones were using them in particular to circumvent electronic jamming systems and strike their targets with precision.

Ukraine’s anti-corruption police accused an ex-energy minister on Monday of helping launder kickbacks and stashing millions offshore, a day after he was detained while trying to leave the country, in a case that has shaken Kyiv’s wartime government. The arrest of German Galushchenko was the first major development for months in the “Midas” bribery case, which has loomed over Ukraine’s domestic politics since last year and has reached into President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s inner circle. In unveiling the accusations against Galushchenko, Ukraine’s anti-corruption agency Nabu said it was working with 15 foreign jurisdictions to expand its investigation. Galushchenko has denied any wrongdoing.
-
Donald Trump said he hoped Ukraine reached a deal with Russia “fast” ahead of Tuesday’s trilateral talks in Geneva. “Ukraine better come to the table fast,” the US president said late on Monday. Senior Ukrainian and Russian officials are to meet for the second round of talks brokered by the Trump administration days before the fourth anniversary of Moscow’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The two-day meeting in Switzerland starting on Tuesday is expected to mirror negotiations held earlier this month in Abu Dhabi, with representatives from Washington, Kyiv and Moscow in attendance, reported Luke Harding and Pjotr Sauer. Despite renewed US efforts to revive diplomacy, hopes for any sudden breakthrough remain low, with Russia continuing to press maximalist demands on Ukraine.
-
Authorities in Poland closed then reopened airports in Rzeszow and Lublin because of military aviation operations, officials said on Tuesday. Polish commanders said military aviation operations began in the country’s airspace due to strikes by Russia’s long-range air forces on Ukrainian territory.
-
Zelenskyy said Ukrainian intelligence showed more Russian attacks on energy targets lay ahead and that such strikes made it more difficult to reach an agreement on ending the war. “Intelligence reports show that Russia is preparing further massive strikes against energy infrastructure so it is necessary to ensure that all air defence systems are properly configured,” he said in his nightly video address on Monday. Zelenskyy also said Russian attacks were “constantly evolving” and resorting to a combination of weapons, including drones and missiles, requiring “special defence and support from our partners”.
-
Civilian casualties in Ukraine caused by bombing soared by 26% during 2025, reflecting increased Russian targeting of cities and infrastructure in the country, according a global conflict monitoring group. Action on Armed Violence (AOAV) said 2,248 civilians were reported killed and 12,493 injured by explosive violence in Ukraine, according to English-language reports – with the number of casualties for each incident rising significantly, reports Dan Sabbagh. An average of 4.8 civilians were reported killed or injured in each strike, 33% more than in 2024, with the worst attack taking place in Dnipro on 24 June.

Nigeria announces arrival of 100 US soldiers

Some 100 US soldiers are being deployed to Nigeria as part of increased military cooperation to fight insecurity in the West African country, the Nigerian defense ministry announced Monday, February 16. The ministry did not specify when the "US military trainers" arrived or were due to arrive.
"The Defense Headquarters (DHQ) wishes to announce the arrival of about 100 United States military personnel and associated equipment at Bauchi Airfield," the statement said.
"The arrival is planned and deliberate following a formal request by the Federal Government of Nigeria to the US government to support a clearly defined military training requirement, technical support and intelligence sharing with the members of the Armed Forces of Nigeria."
Nigeria is facing a longstanding jihadist insurgency in the northeast, a conflict between farmers and herders in north-central regions, separatist violence in the southeast, and kidnappings for ransom in the northwest.
US President Donald Trump has claimed that Christians in Nigeria are being "persecuted" and are victims of "genocide" perpetrated by "terrorists."
But Abuja and most independent experts say the violence in Nigeria indiscriminately affects both Christians and Muslims.
On December 25, the US military conducted airstrikes in Nigeria's Sokoto State. Nigerian authorities subsequently said the action was coordinated with them and it targeted Islamic State jihadists.
For the announced deployment, Nigeria's DHQ said: "The US personnel are technical specialists serving strictly in an advisory and training capacity. They are not combat forces."

Rhode Island shooting: 2 killed, 3 critically injured at Pawtucket ice rink
The attacker has also died from, likely, a self-inflicted gunshot wound after opening fire at an ice hockey rink in the US.
At least two people have been killed, and three others are in critical condition after a mass shooting at a high school ice hockey game in Pawtucket, Rhode Island.
The suspected gunman died, it appears by a self-inflicted gunshot wound, after opening fire, Pawtucket Police Chief Tina Goncalves said at a news conference on Monday.

“It appears that this was a targeted event; that it may be a family dispute,” Goncalves added, without providing more details about the suspect or the victims.
Authorities said the first emergency call reporting the shooting was received at 2:28pm local time (19:28 GMT), adding that investigators are still working to piece together the events leading up to the attack.
According to a report by the Providence Journal news outlet, video footage appears to show a rapid burst of about 13 shots over six seconds, followed by a final shot roughly 11 seconds later from an area outside the camera’s view.
Several shots were heard at the Dennis M Lynch Arena before spectators at the hockey match and student athletes began reacting, dropping to the floor to take cover, looking for shelter, and eventually fleeing towards the exits.
Support to Pawtucket
“What should have been a joyful occasion, with dozens of families, students, and supporters gathered to celebrate Senior Night … was instead marked by violence and fear,” Pawtucket Mayor Don Grebien said in a statement.
“Our prayers go out to the victims, their families, and everyone impacted by this devastating incident.”
In a post on X, FBI director Kash Patel said agents from the agency’s Boston Division have been deployed to Pawtucket to support the investigation.
The latest outbreak of gun violence comes roughly two months after a separate shooting at Brown University, a few miles south of Pawtucket. The attack killed two students, wounded nine others, and led to a days-long manhunt across the state.
Pawtucket, located just north of Providence and along the Massachusetts state border, is a city of approximately 75,000 people. It is the fourth-largest city in the state.

AFL's Opening Round 'unbelievably important' and set to stay

AFL Opening Round concept is 'unbelievably important', Tom Harley says
In short:
The AFL's Opening Round concept is here to stay, according to chief operating officer Tom Harley.
He denied having a fixture in Melbourne during Opening Round defeated the purpose by taking focus away from the Queensland and NSW markets.
What's next?
The Sydney Swans will host Carlton in the opening match of the 2026 AFL season on Thursday, March 5.
AFL chief operating officer Tom Harley insists the league's polarising Opening Round is here to stay, declaring it crucial to the competition's growth in northern markets.
Sydney will host the season opener for the third-straight year, entertaining Carlton at the SCG on March 5.
Gold Coast, GWS and the Brisbane Lions will also host matches in week one for the third successive season, while a St Kilda-Collingwood clash has been added on the Sunday night.
The former Swans chief executive, who started his new role at the AFL in October, backed the concept despite its detractors calling for a regular full round of fixtures to open the season.
"I think it's unbelievably important, and I'm looking forward to the day when we don't talk about traditional states and non-footy states," Harley said.
"The two games they (Sydney) have had to open the season have been enormous, which then leads into really strong membership and attendance, and that's just the one club.
"I see it as your classic win-win. It's a week that wasn't there. The reality is a lot of the grounds aren't available at that time of year, and it does provide enormous momentum for, let's call it, 58 per cent of the population that lives north of the Murray [River].
"If we truly want to be Australia's game, I think it's a fantastic initiative."
The Saints-Magpies clash at the MCG falls on the same day as the Australian Formula 1 Grand Prix at Albert Park.
Harley denied having a fixture in Melbourne during Opening Round defeated the purpose by taking focus away from the northern markets.
"I don't think so at all," he said.
"Everyone whetted their appetite clearly on the weekend with the [State of Origin] game in Perth.
"The game on Thursday night up in Sydney, followed by the Suns and Cats on the Friday night, they are big games with big clubs.
"I'm sure everyone will be excited by them."
Harley said the league will continue to experiment with the fixture in coming seasons, with the planned introduction of the Tasmania Devils in 2028.
"We're keen to look at events, whether they be singular games or whole rounds like Gather Round, to help grow the game and bring new fans to the game," he said.
Harley also believes State of Origin has a "really exciting future" after the Western Australia-Victoria clash attracted a sell-out crowd at Optus Stadium and a healthy television audience.
"There's clearly an appetite. In terms of what it looks like [in future], let's breathe out and assess," he said.
"What I think we can confidently say is there's a place for it."

Australia rules out repatriating citizens from Syrian camp

Australia rules out repatriating citizens from Syrian camp
February 17, 2026Australia's Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said his government wouldn't repatriate Australian citizens held for years in a Syrian camp.
Roj detention camp in northeastern Syria holds families of militants suspected of having links to the so-called "Islamic State" group (IS).
"We have a very firm view that we won't be providing assistance or repatriation," Albanese told national broadcaster ABC on Tuesday.
"We have no sympathy, frankly, for people who travelled overseas in order to participate in what was an attempt to establish a caliphate to undermine and destroy our way of life," he said.
"It is unfortunate that children are impacted by this as well, but we are not providing any support."
Australians released from Roj camp forced to turn back
Albanese's remarks come a day after a group of Australian women and children released from Roj camp on Monday were forced to return to the detention center.
The 34 women and children from 11 families were travelling from the camp to the Syrian capital, Damascus. They hoped from there to organize their journey back to Australia.
But the families were forced to return to the camp after Syrian government authorities wouldn't allow them to continue their journey, Australian media reported.
The convoy was being escorted by Kurdish security forces, ABC reported. The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) still controlled Roj camp at least up until a recent agreement to integrate into the Syrian army after losing swathes of territory to Syrian government forces in January.
Roj camp director Hakmiyeh Ibrahim stressed that the planned repatriations were being organized by the families of the women and children detained at Roj and not by Australian authorities.
He said the women and children who had been returned on Monday were the last Australians in the camp.
Who is held at Syria's Roj camp?
Roj camp holds the foreign wives, widows and children of people who have supposed links to the Islamic State extremist group.
Many have been in the camp since late 2018 and early 2019 when the SDF seized former IS territory with support from a US-led coalition.
None of those held in the camps has been charged with crimes.
The detention center held around 2,400 women and children when journalists visited in January, although it is unclear how many may have been released since then.
They come from some 40 to 50 countries, with Russians making up the largest share, camp officials told US broadcaster CNN in January.
Last month, the Syrian government said it planned to permanently close Roj, as well as al-Hol detention camp, although a large number of al-Hol residents had already left by Sunday.
Calls for repatriation of children amid worsening security
Rights groups have repeatedly warned of the dire conditions at Roj camp and called on countries to repatriate the women and children living there. Human Rights Watch has previously called the conditions in Roj and other detention camps "so dire they may amount to torture."
In 2024, Australia's High Court refused to hear an application to bring home Australian women and children held in Syria.
Save the Children, who brought the case, said at the time that Australia had a moral obligation to bring the families home.
More recently, amid reports of a breakdown of the security situation inside and around Roj and al-Hol camps, Save the Children said it was deeply concerned about the safety and well-being of children living in such camps.
"Every hour without clear protection measures increases the risk of children being harmed, exploited or coerced by armed actors," Save the Children said in a statement in late January.
"Children must never be treated as instruments of conflict or punished because of perceived family affiliation."
The Swedish rights organization Repatriate the Children has also called for governments to end arbitrary detention by taking responsibility for their own nationals through repatriations.
"Children belong in schools, in families, and in protective environments, not in camps shaped by conflict and war," spokesperson Beatrice Eriksson told news site Middle East Eye last week.
Australia, UK previously repatriated IS family members
Like Australia, few countries have been willing to repatriate the detainees.
The Times, a British newspaper, reported in January that Britain had repatriated six women and nine children from camps in recent years.
Most of those repatriated have been women who were taken or travelled to Syria when they were under 18, The Times said.
Australia's Albanese government previously repatriated 13 children along with their 4 mothers in October 2022.
Eight Australian children were brought home in 2019 by the previous government.

Billionaire Thomas Pritzker steps down as Hyatt executive chairman over Epstein ties
Thomas Pritzker, cousin to Illinois Governor JB Pritzker, had communicated with Jeffrey Epstein long after he pleaded guilty to sex crimes

Billionaire Thomas Pritzker, 75, has stepped down as executive chairman of Hyatt Hotels over his ties to the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.
Pritzker, cousin to Democratic Illinois Governor JB Pritzker, is the latest notable figure to face consequences after the Department of Justice was compelled to release millions of documents relating to Epstein, who died in his New York City jail cell in 2019 while facing federal sex trafficking charges.
Hyatt Hotels Corporation announced Pritzker’s retirement from his prominent role on the Board of Directors on Monday. Pritzker had served as executive chairman since 2004.
Pritzker, who is married to Margot Pritzker, said in a statement, “My job and responsibility is to provide good stewardship,” which he said means “protecting Hyatt, particularly in the context of my association with Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell which I deeply regret.
“I exercised terrible judgment in maintaining contact with them, and there is no excuse for failing to distance myself sooner. I condemn the actions and the harm caused by Epstein and Maxwell and I feel deep sorrow for the pain they inflicted on their victims.”
Hyatt’s president and CEO, Mark Hoplamazian, will take over as chairman of the board effective immediately.
The Epstein files revealed that Pritzker kept in contact with the disgraced financier long after he pleaded guilty in Florida to soliciting prostitution from a minor in 2008.
In an email exchange from 2018, reported by several outlets, Epstein asked Pritzker to help arrange a trip to Asia for Karyna Shuliak, who was reportedly his girlfriend.
When Pritzker asked what she was going to do there, Shuliak responded, “Going to try to find a new girlfriend for Jeffrey.” Pritzker said, “May the Force be with you,” along with a smiley-face emoji.
In 2003, Pritzker had messaged Maxwell, who is currently serving 20 years in prison for sexually exploiting and abusing girls with Epstein, about a dinner party.
Maxwell mentioned that there would be five models serving at the party, and Pritzker suggested having the guests be servers and the models be guests.
“This would be far more fun,” he wrote in the exchange, per The Wall Street Journal.
The Independent has reached out to JB Pritzker’s office for comment about his cousin stepping down from the Hyatt board.
Other prominent figures to face repercussions for their ties to Epstein are former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, top Goldman Sachs lawyer Kathryn Ruemmler and talent agency founder Casey Wasserman.
Republican Representative from Kentucky, Thomas Massie, and Democratic Representative from California, Ro Khanna, who both led the push to release the Epstein files, shared the news of Pritzker’s retirement from the Hyatt board on social media.
“Chairman of Hyatt Hotels stepping down as a result of Epstein disclosures,” Massie wrote on X.
“Tom Pritzker is part of the Epstein class & is stepping down as Chairman of Hyatt,” Khanna posted. “Will he also step down as Chairman of the Pritzker organization which manages various Pritzker family assets?”

Eileen Gu Doesn’t Appreciate Your Silver Medal Cynicism

Like other highly-publicized athletes at these Milano Cortina Olympic Games, freeskier Eileen Gu, who represents China, had hopes of winning everything. Many fans expect her, and these other global superstars, to do so. And like Lindsey Vonn, Chloe Kim, Ilia Malinin, and Mikaela Shiffrin, Gu hasn’t.
On Monday night in Livigno, Gu landed a left-side double cork 1260—three-and-a-half rotations and a couple of off-axis flips—under pressure in her third and final run of the big air competition, earning enough points to win her second silver medal of these Olympics. But she didn’t defend her big air title from Beijing; Canada’s Megan Oldham won the gold. At just 22 and with five Olympic medals to her name, however, Gu now owns more Olympic medals than any other female freestyle skier ever.
But she still hasn’t finished first in Italy. After big air, a reporter asked Gu if she views her performance at these Olympics as two silver medals gained, or two golds lost. In interactions with journalists, Gu is unfailingly polite but often returns to familiar talking points. She chose to represent China over the U.S., where she was born and raised, in order to inspire young girls there to try skiing. (There’s evidence her goal is being realized). She touts the unifying power of sport.
All well and good. But here, Gu came back with bite.
“I'm the most decorated female freeskier in history,” Gu responded. “I think that's an answer in and of itself. How do I say this? Winning a medal at the Olympics is a life changing experience for every athlete. Doing it five times is exponentially harder, because every medal is equally hard for me, but everybody else's expectations rise, right? And so the two medals lost situation, to be quite frank with you, I think it's kind of a ridiculous perspective to take.”
Gu’s a lighting rod on social media. While her suiting up for China hasn’t stirred as much chatter as it did four years ago, when the Olympics were in Beijing, critics are still calling her out: former NBA player Enes Kantor Freedom, for example, recently called her a “traitor” on X.
On the flip side, her fans come out in full force. At the big air landing, groups of fans wave Gu signs and Chinese flags. A trio of her Stanford friends showed up to cheer her on; Gu is an international relations major at the school, and plans on returning, as a junior, after the Games. One student didn’t want to be named, since he was blowing off an electrical engineering final to be in the Alps.
She has a strong support system. A world swirls around her. Supporters sought out selfies after she won her silver, and a volunteer even asked her mom, Yan, who was wearing a panda hat, for a picture with him. (Yan was born in China and grew up there before coming to the United States: Gu spent summers in Beijing as a child). So whether people agree with Gu—two silvers here are a laudable accomplishment—or view her as crafting a favorable narrative that moves the goalposts—she had visions of bettering her performance in Beijing, and sweeping all three freestyle golds—they’ll be talking nonetheless.
She was so stoked about landing that last big air trick, she says, because she only learned it last week. She raised her arms after striking the landing, and shouted “What the heck!” at one of her coaches, as if she couldn’t believe what just happened. She thought seriously about skipping big air altogether at the Olympics. Gu won her slopestyle silver on Feb. 9, and her strongest event, halfpipe, starts with qualifying on Feb. 19. “My mom called a team meeting the day after slopestyle, and she was like, ‘All right, we got the medal. Let's move on to halfpipe.’ And I was like, ‘Whaaat?’ I thought my jumps were pretty good. Maybe we could do something nice in big air.”
Yan was concerned that the big air finals were held on the same night as a halfpipe training: Gu even planned to hop over to halfpipe for some reps if she didn’t medal in big air. And Gu hasn’t competed in big air since the Beijing Olympics. Between school and sponsor commitments and other competitions, and tending to her thriving modeling career, Gu just hasn’t had time for big air. But after she did a practice run on the big air ramp in Livigno, she was all in. “She said, ‘I love it,’” says Yan. “‘We're in the Olympics.’” The opportunity to fly was just too good to pass up.
And Gu still has one more shot at that elusive—in Italy—gold. Oldham said she was going to celebrate her gold by going dancing. Gu would not be doing the same for her silver, as happy as she was with that prize. “Go have a night,” she told Oldham. “I’m going to be visualizing my halfpipe run. I’m going to lie in bed and think about my tricks.”

What next for Okinawa’s anti-base alliance after Japan election loss?
Analysts point to a shift in priorities among younger Okinawans as a possible factor in the alliance’s bruising defeat in the election
All Okinawa brings together a broad spectrum of opposition forces, including the local branches of the Japanese Communist Party, the Social Democratic Party and the Okinawa Social Mass Party.
The groups are united by a pledge to halt construction of a new US military facility in the coastal district of Henoko – planned as a replacement for the US Marine Corps’ Futenma air station – and to reduce the burden placed on the prefecture by the heavy concentration of American forces.
Ahead of the vote, members of the alliance – known locally as “Okinawa zenken” – had voiced cautious optimism. The scale of the subsequent setback has since prompted debate over whether the movement is losing its hold on voters, and why.

'The fall of the cumbersome Jack Lang is seen as providential for France's entire political spectrum, which remains paralyzed by his cultural legacy'

To be blunt, Jack Lang's fall is also his triumph. Had he served as François Mitterrand's foreign trade minister, he would have slipped, like so many others, into the trash can of history. But his impact on France's cultural landscape is so profound that, at 86, he remains a central figure – a feat in itself – fueling a torrent of commentary since his name has saturated the emails of the American sexual predator Jeffrey Epstein, ultimately forcing him to step down as president of Arab World Institute (IMA).
The courts will now determine the nature of any links between Lang and Epstein. Investigations will reveal whether he left unpaid bills at hotels or restaurants, and if so, how many. Public opinion has already weighed in – this is nothing new – and is raising a question: Why does the best culture minister in French history, respected even abroad, never convicted nor even formally charged, provoke such visceral reactions, even hatred, when not being accused outright of sexual crimes?
The answer lies in the man himself – flamboyant and exasperating, persistent and vain – who, beginning in 1981, led a swashbuckling cultural policy, upending norms and even challenging Mitterrand himself in his haste. The close partnership with his wife, Monique, left a trail of frustration, humiliation and jealousy. For the past 10 days, former culture ministers, paralyzed by the lingering presence of a "king without a crown" still acting as if though he held the culture portfolio, have unleashed vitriol against him – vitriol as intense as their own records are thin.

Ukraine presented 26 organic exporters at BIOFACH 2026 in Germany
According to Ukrinform, this was reported by the Ministry of Economy, Environment and Agriculture.
The pavilion brought together producers from across Ukraine, presenting both organic raw materials and value‑added processed products. Exhibits included berries and fruits (frozen, dried, freeze‑dried), nuts, seeds, honey, grains, juices, purée concentrates, oils, snacks, sweets, and other goods.
Over four days, Ukrainian exporters engaged with more than 1,250 visitors and held over 250 B2B meetings with potential partners from the EU, North America, and Asia. Negotiations resulted in preliminary agreements with traders, processors, distributors, and retail chains, with some discussions advancing to supply terms.
During a thematic session on the development of the organic sector in Central and Eastern Europe, the Ukrainian delegation reported on the industry’s recovery. Valentyna Liashenko, an expert from the State Institution “Entrepreneurship and Export Promotion Office,” noted that by the end of 2024, 261 operators were registered in Ukraine’s organic market.
She emphasized that more than 90% of Ukrainian organic products are exported. In 2024, Ukraine ranked third among 125 countries supplying organic products to the EU, accounting for nearly 8% of total EU imports. Export volumes rose by 17.5% year‑on‑year, reaching 243,000 tonnes (+23% compared to 2023), with a total export value of USD 141 million. The largest importers were the Netherlands (31%), Germany (25%), Austria (12%), Switzerland (6%), and Italy (6%).
Currently, Ukrainian organic products are supplied to 31 countries worldwide, with the European Union remaining the key market.
BIOFACH 2026, held on February 10–13 in Nuremberg, attracted more than 35,000 visitors from around 140 countries, reaffirming its role as the leading global meeting point for the organic value chain.

Israel’s economy picks up for the first time since war began

Israel’s economy picks up for the first time since war began

JERUSALEM – Israel’s economy accelerated in 2025, after two years of war
Gross domestic product expanded by 3.1 per cent in 2025, Israel’s bureau of statistics said on Feb 16, above projections from both the Finance Ministry and the central bank for 2.8 per cent growth.
GDP per capita is now similar to levels seen before the start of the conflict in Gaza.
The economy slowed after October 2023, when an attack by Iran-backed Hamas unleashed a two-year war that broadened to clashes between Israel and Iran, as well as other militant groups allied with the Islamic Republic.
The economic consequences – including increased military spending, reservist call-ups and business interruptions – led to a deceleration the following year.
In 2024, the economy advanced 1 per cent, its weakest pace in over two decades outside the Covid-19 pandemic.
The data is likely to solidify the government’s expectations that the country is on track to recover from two years of lackluster activity, although it has yet to return to levels before the war. Israel’s central bank projects growth will reach 5.2 per cent in 2026.
Israel’s Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich reiterated calls on the central bank to lower interest rates to help reduce mortgage payments and the cost of credit to small businesses.
“The figures speak for themselves,” Mr Smotrich said in a statement. “Inflation is being curbed, the economy is stabilising. This is the time to ease the burden on households.”
The Israeli economy still faces downside risks which, if realised, may stifle growth.
The war in Gaza is yet to come to a permanent end and negotiations between the US and Iran are not guaranteed to prevent US President Donald Trump’s administration from making good on a threat to strike the country.
Mr Trump has repeatedly warned Iran it will face military action
The US and Iran are set to meet in Switzerland on Feb 17 for a second round of indirect talks.
The economic expansion in 2025 was driven by an 8.1 per cent rise in gross fixed capital formation and a 6.1 per cent rise in exports. Public expenditure, unusually high during the war, expanded 1.7 per cent.
Data showed fourth quarter activity grew by an annualised, seasonally adjusted 4 per cent compared with the third quarter. That is slightly lower than the median estimate of 4.1 per cent in a Bloomberg survey of 12 economists.
“The breakdown shows that growth in the fourth quarter was driven by a large rebound in exports,” emerging Europe economist at Capital Economics Nicholas Farr said. Meanwhile, he noted, “domestic demand was quite weak”.
The third quarter in 2025 saw a particularly strong expansion, with the economy recovering from the impact of a military confrontation with Iran which forced many businesses to completely shut down.
Growth was revised to show GDP was up 12.7 per cent between July and September, compared with a contraction in the period prior. BLOOMBERG

Russia-Ukraine war: List of key events, day 1,454
These are the key developments from day 1,454 of Russia’s war on Ukraine.
Here is where things stand on Tuesday, February 17:
Fighting
- Ukraine recaptured 201 sq km (78 sq miles) of its territory from Russia between Wednesday and Sunday last week, taking advantage of a Starlink communications shutdown experienced by Russian forces, according to an analysis of battlefield data from the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) conducted by the AFP news agency.
-
Ukrainian intelligence believes that more Russian attacks on the country’s energy sector are in store and that such tactics will make it more difficult to reach an agreement on ending the nearly four-year war, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy warned in his nightly video address on Monday.
- Ukraine’s Air Force said Russia launched 62 long-range strike drones and six missiles of various types at Ukraine overnight.
-
Russia’s Ministry of Defence said that it took down 345 Ukrainian drones over the previous 24 hours. It also said it had captured two settlements – Pokrovka and Minkivka – in eastern Ukraine, Russian state media reported.
-
Officials in Russia’s Krasnodar region reported that a fire had broken out and was extinguished at the Black Sea port of Taman, which handles oil products, grain, coal and commodities. The port was damaged by a Ukrainian drone attack on Sunday.
Military aid
-
Ukraine has received 4.4 million rounds of large-calibre ammunition under a plan involving Czech arms producers and funding from foreign donors, the Czech Republic’s president, Petr Pavel, told a local news website.
Ceasefire talks
- Rustem Umerov, the head of Ukraine’s negotiating team, arrived in Geneva for the next round of trilateral talks with the US and Russia. In a Telegram post, Umerov said he is looking forward “to constructive work and substantive meetings on security and humanitarian issues” on Tuesday.
- Russian news agencies reported the departure of Moscow’s delegation to the talks in Geneva, which is headed by Vladimir Medinsky, an aide to President Vladimir Putin.
- Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters that the main focus of the Russian negotiating team is “to discuss a broader range of issues”, including questions about territory, “and everything else related to the demands we have put forward”.
- Peskov said Russian military intelligence chief Igor Kostyukov and Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Mikhail Galuzin would also take part in the Geneva talks, while Putin’s special envoy, Kirill Dmitriev, would engage in a separate working group on economic issues.
- Hungarian Prime Minister Victor Orban said that he assured US Secretary of State Marco Rubio that his country still backs US peace efforts in Ukraine and that Budapest was still open to hosting a peace summit.
Politics and diplomacy
- Hungary and Slovakia have asked Croatia to help them secure Russian oil following a disruption to flows through Ukraine, which the two countries have blamed on Kyiv. Hungary and Slovakia have exemptions to European Union sanctions on Russian oil that is still piped through Ukraine.
-
In response to the allegations of disrupting Russian oil flows, Ukrainian Minister of Foreign Affairs Andrii Sybiha posted a photo on X of firefighters battling what he said was a fire at the Druzhba pipeline. In the post, he accused Hungary of not publicly commenting on the incident for two weeks because its ally, Russia, was to blame for the attack on the oil pipe.
- The Kremlin said on Monday that it agreed with the statement of Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico, who a day earlier accused Ukraine of delaying the reopening of the Druzhba pipeline to try to pressure Hungary to drop its opposition to Ukraine’s potential future EU membership.
-
Ukraine’s anticorruption police accused the country’s ex-energy minister, German Galushchenko, of helping launder kickbacks and stashing millions offshore, a day after he was detained trying to leave the country. Ukraine’s anticorruption agency, NABU, said it was working with 15 foreign jurisdictions to expand its corruption probe.
- Russian oil producers could be forced to sharply cut output in the coming months as pressure from the US and European powers restricts Moscow’s exports and storage tanks fill up. Such a development could dent the Kremlin’s war chest, which funds its war on Ukraine, according to Reuters.
- France has agreed to grant safe haven to the anti-Kremlin Russian activist couple Alexei and Nadezhda Ishimov, who were both detained by US law enforcement. Nadezhda, however, was prevented from leaving the US because she was using a temporary travel permit instead of a passport. The couple left Russia in 2022 as the Kremlin ramped up a crackdown on opponents following its invasion of Ukraine.

Landmark report finds racism 'deeply embedded' in Australian universities
University students have been the subject of "jokes" about "slanted eyes", accused of using AI, and have been scared to use their names on assessments, according to a landmark study into racism at universities.
More than 70 per cent of university students and staff who responded to the study reported experiencing or witnessing racist behaviour directed at their community.
The Racism@Uni study, which surveyed more than 76,000 students and staff from 42 universities, revealed high rates of racism experienced by people from First Nations, African, Asian, Jewish, Māori, Middle Eastern, Muslim, Palestinian and Pasifika backgrounds.
Jewish (religious) and Palestinian students were the most impacted, with 90 per cent of respondents reporting experiences of racism at university.
First Nations, Chinese, Jewish (secular), Middle Eastern and North-East Asian respondents all reported experiences of racism at rates over 80 per cent.
Federal Education Minister Jason Clare unveiled the Respect at Uni report with Australia's Race Discrimination Commissioner Giridharan Sivaraman in Brisbane on Tuesday.
"This is a landmark report and what it shows is racism is deeply embedded within our universities," Mr Sivaraman said.
The report is made up of four parts; the national survey, focus groups, a literature review and a policy audit.
The report makes 47 short, medium and long-term recommendations focusing on five key areas:
- A national framework for anti‑racism in universities
- Inclusive and safe universities, free from racism
- Accountable universities with trusted, accessible complaints systems
- Inclusive curriculum and teaching
- Diverse leadership and workforce
Mr Clare said he would consider the recommendations relevant to the government.
An interim report released in December 2024 found interpersonal and structural racism were pervasive and "deeply entrenched" in Australian universities, affecting various communities including First Nations, Jewish, Muslim, Palestinian and Middle Eastern staff and students.
'Jokes', name mispronunciation, accusations of AI
Students surveyed in the report relayed harrowing stories of subtle and systemic exclusion causing harm to their academic performance.
❝
I have had a lecturer make a ‘petrol sniffing’ comment about Aboriginal people … I have had students tell me I am getting it easy as I receive an Indigenous scholarship.
— Survey participant
❝
A group of girls started 'joking' about the way my eyes are 'slanted' and that I smelled like noodles. It was obvious I was uncomfortable and it was obvious it was not a joke, but more a perpetuation of the way they actually see me, making me feel less than human.
— Focus group participant
❝
Lecturers mispronounced my name repeatedly, despite corrections. It’s painful to see how easily these moments are brushed aside, often labelled as 'misunderstandings' or 'unintentional'. But intent doesn’t erase impact. Racism doesn’t always look like shouting or slurs but it often hides in systems, habits, and silence.
— Survey participant
❝
I had a professor in the first year who thought I bought my assignment or made AI do it because she could not believe an Indian could write that good in the first year of nursing.
— Survey participant
❝
In academic settings l always feel scared to submit my assignment with my African name displayed as l fear my work will be marked with racial discrimination.
— Survey participant
Mr Sivaraman said these acts of racism had been the difference between passing or failing classes for some students.
"The thing with racism is it's often death by a thousand cuts,"he said.
"It's not just one particular thing; it can be a number of things.
"It can be that you're not culturally safe when you got to university, you're not physically safe, that affects the way in which you go in exams or assessments.
"It can be the curriculum doesn't recognise your experiences or doesn't have a diversity of experiences which disadvantages you.
"It could be that there are biases in the person that's teaching you."
He said if students were upset and depressed because of the way racism had impacted them, it was "hardly surprising" that it affected their academic results.
'Lack of faith' in complaints process
Despite the reports of racism, only 6 per cent of respondents said they were willing to lodge a complaint.
Mr Sivaraman said this was due to a lack of faith in universities' complaints processes and "a belief that nothing will happen".
"There was one story that stuck with me so powerfully," he said.
"It was from an Aboriginal student who responded to the survey who said 'I made a complaint, nothing happened for 12 months, then I was told after 12 months we can't proceed with your complaint because it's been more than 12 months since the conduct occurred.'"
Mr Clare said the complaints process was not up to scratch.
"That might mean [students] don't complain at all, or the process is so difficult that when they do complain, they don't get the outcome that they need."
Students and staff largely reported being dissatisfied with the complaint outcomes, saying that complaints made no difference, the process caused additional distress, and those who complained felt they could not trust the people involved in the process.
Lack of diversity in senior staff
More than half of the academic staff surveyed said experiences of direct racism had a negative impact on their careers, with a quarter reporting they had been denied a promotion they believed they deserved.
Some staff reported receiving racially biased student evaluations, which can influence hiring, firing and promotion decisions.
National Tertiary Education Union (NTEU) President Dr Alison Barnes said the findings were deeply disturbing for staff and students.
"This report shines a harsh light on the racism that staff experience every single day in Australian universities,"Dr Barnes said.
"When one in five academic staff report experiencing direct racism, and university leadership is implicated in nearly half of those cases, we're seeing a systemic workplace crisis.
"Our colleagues' careers are being derailed, their mental health is suffering, and they're being driven out of the sector because of racism."
Mr Sivaraman said there was also a lack of diversity in the senior levels of universities.
Greens Deputy Leader Mehreen Faruqi said the report may come as a shock to those who don't experience racism, "but for the rest of us it is business as usual".
"It lays bare the terrifying truth: racism is not an exception in our universities, it is the rule, and it is harming students and staff across racial and religious groups,"she said.
"When racially marginalised students cannot walk into a lecture theatre without fear of abuse, exclusion or discrimination, it is not just a campus problem. It is a systemic problem. The promise of education is being poisoned by racism."
She called on the prime minister to urgently adopt the report’s systemic whole-of-racism reforms, and scrap the antisemitism report cards.
"Cherry picking one type of racism over others does nothing to dismantle structural racism embedded in policy and practice. It only entrenches the systems of discrimination we should be dismantling," she said.

What about the utes and jet-skis?: Construction company donor’s spray

What about the utes and jet-skis?: Construction company donor’s spray
A Big Build contractor under scrutiny for its ties to gangland figure Mick Gatto and a donation it gave Victoria’s Labor Party has lashed out, claiming the company was merely one of many Big Build firms that bankrolled the government’s election and that focus should be on Big Build corruption.
In a message Anthony Ciccone sent to The Age after it was revealed he donated $3264 to the Victorian ALP in 2022, the veteran construction industry figure queried why there had been no reporting about a major Big Build subcontractor that he alleged had gifted expensive utes and jet-skis to project managers on the Suburban Rail Loop.
Ciccone said the contractor was removed from the rail project “for giving Toyota SR5 utes to general superintendents as gifts”, as well as three jet-skis.
The Victorian government has committed about one-third of the about $34.5 billion anticipated total cost towards the Suburban Rail Loop’s first stage. It has secured $2.2 billion from the federal government and is expected to contribute more in the May budget.
The state government plans to fund the final third through parking levies, existing land taxes and developer charges.
Ciccone, who owns Cycon Civil and co-owns labour hire firm Project Labour Solutions (PLS), also questioned why other political donors who worked as contractors on Labor’s signature infrastructure scheme had not been identified.
Where are “all the other companies that donated?” Ciccone said in his message.
Ciccone’s comments came after The Age reported on Tuesday that Victorian Labor had collected thousands of dollars in donations from firms that now face police action over suspected corrupt payments or that placed gangland, bikie or CFMEU identities on taxpayer-funded projects.
The donors include a traffic management firm on Labor’s signature $100 billion Big Build program, whose owner has been charged by Victoria Police’s anti-corruption and gangland building industry taskforce; another Big Build subcontractor facing a federal police probe for allegedly bribing a corrupt CFMEU boss; and the owners of two Big Build firms represented by gangland figure Mick Gatto.
Premier Jacinta Allan said on Tuesday that donations were a matter for the party but that she noted the donations were lawful and appropriately declared.
When asked repeatedly if she was comfortable with the donations, Allan again said they were a matter for the party.
Prime Minister Anthony Albanese also told the ABC that donations were a matter for the party.
The revelation of the political money trail from Big Build subcontractors that are the subject of law enforcement probes or have gangland links presents a fresh crisis for the Allan government.
The premier was already under mounting pressure over her refusal to back a sweeping inquiry into claims Labor turned a blind eye to wrongdoing on its signature infrastructure projects while she was the responsible minister.
The donations uncovered by this masthead would not be caught under Allan’s CFMEU donations ban – introduced in response to this masthead’s Building Bad series in mid-2024 – because they come from companies and not the CFMEU.
They would almost certainly have been uncovered by the broad-style inquiry that the state and federal opposition, along with anti-corruption advocates such as Transparency International, have demanded.
The Victorian Election Commission, corporate and other records analysed by this masthead reveal the individual CFMEU-aligned building company donors who contributed to Labor’s election campaign in 2022.
The donations came as the union’s grip over the Labor government’s Big Build scheme solidified, creating huge profit-making opportunities for some donors because the CFMEU was pushing them onto contractors.
Donation records show that Ciccone was an election-year ALP donor in 2022. Last August, Ciccone engaged Gatto to help resolve a dispute involving his Big Build operations. Gatto has also supported PLS, which Ciccone co-owns and which employs the wife of ex-union boss Derek Christopher (corruption-busting lawyer Geoffrey Watson, SC, described Christopher as corrupt in his report).
In Watson’s report, Cycon is identified as employing a union delegate with possible Comancheros connections.
Ciccone’s Big Build company also has a business partnership with a firm run by an ex-Finks bikie Tom Estcourt, who recently faced court and received a good behaviour bond after Taskforce Hawk found him possessing anabolic steroids.
Ciccone had said on Monday that he had no recollection of the donation, but on Tuesday, he queried why The Age had not identified other donors from the Big Build.
Another donor was traffic management company B K Labour, a firm that had made tens of millions of dollars supplying workers to the Big Build. B K’s founder and owner, Bernard Kearney, was charged with fraud by the police Taskforce Hawk in December, over allegedly fake Big Build invoices.
At the time of his arrest, police said the firm was being probed over alleged “corrupt payments” and that detectives would allege invoices were falsified. Police also said they were “investigating a number of other payments and cash withdrawals” as part of an operation to specifically target criminal behaviour linked to the construction industry.
Donation records reveal B K Labour donated at least $3264 to Victorian Labor in May 2022. In his landmark report last week, Watson said B K Labour was forced into the Big Build by ex-union boss Joe Myles, who warned “contractors to use B K Labour or they would suffer industrial action”. B K Labour was contacted for comment.
The donations uncovered by this masthead likely represent a fraction of the funds given by Big Build firms with links to suspected improper behaviour or gangland figures because many of them made donations directly to the CFMEU, which in turn gave the ALP more than $500,000 heading into the November 2022 election.
The CFMEU has never revealed which building firms contributed to its election war chest, although multiple Big Build and union sources said a union faction, including bikie boss Joel Leavett and ex-union boss Myles, pressured firms to donate to the union.
On Monday, Victoria’s corruption watchdog revealed it did not investigate a referral from Allan, the premier, concerning allegations of organised crime and graft on taxpayer-funded projects because it was outside its remit.
Allan’s mid-2024 referral was detailed in a letter to the Independent Broad-based Anti-corruption Commission (IBAC) released on Sunday, noting allegations of organised crime and behaviour to favour CFMEU-linked firms.
IBAC does not typically comment on its referrals, but, because the letter was released publicly, it confirmed the matters in Allan’s letter were outside its scope.
On Tuesday, Allan would not say whether she had already been informed of IBAC’s decision when her office released her referral letter on the weekend, having insisted over recent days she had referred the allegations to IBAC as the appropriate agency to investigate corruption.
At a testy press conference, Allan was repeatedly asked when she knew that IBAC had decided it could not investigate, including whether it was before her office released her referral letter, and whether she should have been aware that her referral would fail.
She said the advice had come through the department that IBAC was not investigating, and she would need to check when that occurred.
Allan said she had also written to Victoria Police and the Fair Work Commission at the same time in the days after this masthead’s Building Bad investigation – with 60 Minutes and The Australian Financial Review – broke.
Both the state opposition and the Greens have backed giving IBAC new powers to follow taxpayer money to subcontractors and labour hire for investigations.
Shadow attorney-general James Newbury said the opposition would introduce its own bill but would support the government if it chose to introduce its own.
It also referred to revelations in The Age that firms named in Watson’s report, including those subject to police action, had made donations to Labor to IBAC.
The Victorian Greens have also said it would this week release draft laws that would give the state’s corruption watchdog “follow the dollar” powers to pursue investigations into the use of taxpayer funds when they trickle down to private subcontractors.
IBAC has asked for these powers, and a parliamentary inquiry has also recommended they be provided. The construction industry is one of the biggest sectors to use subcontracting and labour hire arrangements, where much of the graft on taxpayer projects has been identified.
Allan said she had no announcements to make today on whether her government would give IBAC the follow-the-dollar powers.
Half a dozen Labor MPs from the western suburbs joined the premier and Health Minister Mary-Anne Thomas at the new Footscray Hospital for the press conference. The hospital opens on Wednesday.
Backbench MP Luba Grigorovitch, formerly secretary of the Rail, Tram and Bus Union, was asked whether she regretted prominently standing by former CFMEU state secretary John Setka.
“Look, the allegations that have been made are serious. They truly are. They are disgusting, and as the premier has said, they’re completely unacceptable,” Grigorovitch said.
She said she was “not going to back away” from the fact that she and Setka were close while they were both union secretaries, but that she had not spoken to Setka in “quite a while”. “I’ve just had two babies, I’m not exactly sure on my last phone calls,” she said.
The premier again dismissed an estimate that $15 billion had been lost to corruption on its Big Build program of work and continued to rebuff calls for a royal commission to test the figure, which was estimated by Geoffrey Watson and backed up by the Fair Work Commission.
The estimate was described as untested by the CFMEU administrator Mark Irving, but was separately backed by Fair Work Commission general manager Murray Furlong.
“Those claims have been dismissed,” Allan claimed.
She would not say how much taxpayer money lost to corruption on the Big Build would warrant action.
At one point, the gathered MPs were each asked whether they wanted the $15 billion figure tested.
Health Minister Mary-Anne Thomas said Allan had been “incredibly strong and decisive in the action that she has taken”.
She then claimed the $15 billion figure was “not worthy of further consideration”.
Pressed again whether any of the other MPs would like to speak, Laverton MP Sarah Connolly eventually conceded her western suburbs constituents had asked her about the figure.
“Yes, they do. And I talk to them about the steps that the premier has outlined that we are taking,” she said.

Trump predicts Iran nuclear deal, warns of ‘consequences’ ahead of talks
After a summer of military strikes and stalled diplomacy, indirect negotiations between Washington and Tehran are set to resume on Tuesday

US President Donald Trump has said he will be “indirectly” involved in talks between Iran and the US over Tehran’s nuclear programme set to begin on Tuesday in Geneva.
“I’ll be involved in those talks, indirectly. And they’ll be very important,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One on Monday, adding he believed Tehran wanted to make a deal.
Tensions are soaring ahead of the talks, with the US deploying a second aircraft carrier to the Middle East. The US military is preparing for the possibility of a sustained military campaign if the talks do not succeed, US officials have said.

Asked about the prospects for a deal, Trump said Iran had sought tough negotiations but learned the consequences of such a hardened stance last summer when the US bombed Iranian nuclear sites.
“I don’t think they want the consequences of not making a deal,” Trump warned on Monday. “I hope they’re going to be more reasonable.”

Albanese says he has ‘no sympathy’ for ISIS brides seeking to return to Australia

Doctor who helped re-elect Tony Burke leading efforts to bring ISIS brides back to Australia
Updated ,first published
The opposition has applied political pressure to Prime Minister Anthony Albanese over the attempt by 34 Islamic State-linked families to return to Australia from Syria, suggesting the government should not process their travel documents.
Albanese declared he has no sympathy for, and would provide no assistance to, the group trying to re-enter the country, even as a close associate of Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke is reported to be helping them leave Syria.
“We have a very firm view that we won’t be providing assistance or repatriation,” Albanese said on ABC Radio.
The effort to bring the families back to Australia is being organised by western Sydney doctor and Lebanese Muslim community figure Jamal Rifi, according to sources who cannot be identified because they are not authorised to speak publicly.
Rifi is close to Burke, and spearheaded the Friends of Tony Burke campaign to re-elect the minister in the seat of Watson at the last election. Rifi is believed to be organising the effort on the ground in the Middle East. Attempts to reach him have been unsuccessful.
The prime minister’s stated position seems to conflict with statements of the camp’s governor, Hakamia Ibrahim, who told a journalist in Syria overnight that the Australian government had “issued passports and the necessary documents for the families, and informed their relatives to receive their loved ones from the camp”. Her statement can be seen below:
The group of women and children, who have been in internment camps in Syria for almost seven years, began their journey back to Australia late on Monday. But 50 kilometres from the Roj camp, they were turned around and forced to return.
Albanese said that if the group made it to Australia they would “face the full force of the law”.
Opposition leader Angus Taylor seized on the confusion, asking: “Are any of these ISIS-linked individuals coming back to Australia? Are passports being processed, or will they be?”
“What specific security assessments have been or will be undertaken, and has the government used or even considered using its temporary exclusion order powers?”
Foreign Minister Penny Wong has not answered questions about what documents, if any, the Australian government has issued to the families. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said it cannot comment on individual cases.
But Taylor called for the government to do everything in its power to prevent the women from returning to Australia.
“These are individuals who chose to associate with a terrorist caliphate,” he said.
“This is not aligned with the values we as Australians believe in: democracy, the rule of law, the basic freedoms including freedom of religion. The door must be shut to people who do not believe in those things.”
Liberal home affairs spokesman Jonno Duniam urged the government to impose temporary exclusion orders on the women to prevent them from returning to Australia.
A spokesman for Burke said in relation to Duniam’s call that the government was “constantly receiving advice from our agencies about whether the threshold for temporary exclusion orders has been met”, and would “always act in accordance with advice”.
Albanese said in the ABC interview that: “My mother would have said, ‘If you make your bed, you lie in it’.
“These people went overseas supporting Islamic State and went there to provide support for people who basically want a caliphate … We want to make it clear, as we have to the people involved, if there are any breaches of the law, they will face the full force of the Australian law.”
He added that: “Australian law applies and there are obligations that Australian officials have.”
This is a reference to a requirement under Australian law for the government to help citizens stranded overseas by issuing a passport if they present themselves to an Australian embassy.
Advocates for the families said last year that Albanese adopted the “no assistance” stance after an earlier series of repatriations in 2022. That prompted a minor political backlash from local communities and the opposition.
Since then, wives and children of former Islamic State fighters have been required to find their own way to an embassy. The closest to Syria is in Beirut.
When two women and four children were smuggled out of al-Hawl camp in Syria and into Lebanon last year, the government gave them passports in Beirut to return to Melbourne. However, the policy has effectively trapped dozens of women and children in al-Roj camp in north-east Syria, which is harder to escape using people smugglers.
The government’s policy also precluded an offer by the US military to assist.
In an interview with Syrian media on Monday night, Ibrahim, the Roj camp’s governor, explained what had happened after the government-assisted 2022 repatriations.
“Previously there were also deportations of some families,” Ibrahim said, according to the translation provided by Kurdish media. “The deportation was carried out through coordination with the Department of Foreign Affairs, through which they were transferred to their respective countries.
“The Australian government later stated that it was facing certain policy-related issues and was therefore unable to repatriate additional families.”
She said the promised departure to the Syrian capital, Damascus, then to Australia, had been paused, saying: “It’s not cancelled, it’s postponed.”
It’s unclear what caused the delay, but local sources say there had been a disagreement between the Syrian government in Damascus, the Kurdish administration that runs the camp and the Australian families organising the repatriation.
Documents released in estimates last year say that the women and children could have been extracted by the US military without Australians having to set foot in Syria.
An August letter to Burke written by the representative of the families, Kamalle Dabboussy, and the head of Save the Children Australia, Mat Tinkler, said the families were prepared to “take control of their own destiny” by taking up the offer from the United States.
However, that offer foundered because the Australian government would not issue passports.

Facing a demographic catastrophe, Ukraine is paying for troops to freeze their sperm

Facing a demographic catastrophe, Ukraine is paying for troops to freeze their sperm
Maxim doesn't mind discussing his sperm. In fact, he wishes more in Ukraine's military would talk about their fertility – or at least think about it.
"Our men are dying. The Ukrainian gene pool is dying. This is about the survival of our nation," the soldier tells me, speaking by phone from a position somewhere near the eastern frontline.
The 35-year-old is serving with Ukraine's National Guard and when he returned on leave recently his wife persuaded him to visit a clinic in Kyiv and leave a sperm sample.
It was frozen free of charge as part of a programme to help serving soldiers.
If Maxim were killed, his wife could use the sample to try to have the child they've always wanted.
But he says his frozen sperm could be crucial to creating a family, in any case.
"Whether you are right on the 'zero point' of the frontline, or 30 or even 80 kilometres back, there is no guarantee that you're safe," the soldier says, explaining that Russian drones overhead are a constant threat.
"That means stress, and this [can have] an impact: your reproductive ability declines. So we have to think about the future and the future of our Ukrainian nation."
Private fertility clinics began offering what's known as cryopreservation to servicemen and women in 2022 at the start of Russia's full-scale invasion.
They could freeze their sperm or eggs for free in case they were injured in action or their fertility was affected.
The following year parliament stepped in to regulate the practice and provide state funding.
"Our soldiers are defending our future, but may lose their own, so we wanted to give them that chance," is how MP Oksana Dmitrieva describes the law she helped draft.
"It's to support them, so they can use their sperm later."
The politicians' initial efforts caused a public outcry though, when they stipulated that all samples should be destroyed on a donor's death. That came to light when a war widow tried to have a child using her husband's frozen sperm and was blocked.
The law has since been amended so that all soldiers' samples are preserved for free for up to 3 years after their death and are available for a partner to use with prior written consent.
The programme is also about addressing a demographic crisis which existed before Russia's invasion but has been made far worse by the large numbers of men dying in action, many of them Ukraine's youngest and fittest.
Then there's the millions, mainly women, who have left as refugees. Four years on, many are still abroad because life in Ukraine isn't getting easier.
That fact is driven home when I meet the MP in a hotel lobby and we talk without removing our coats: this winter Russia's relentless missile strikes on the power grid have left thousands of buildings in Kyiv freezing cold.
"We're also thinking about the future and all the young people we've lost. We need to replace them," Dmitrieva says. "This is one tiny step to improve the demographic situation."
On her own visits to the frontline the MP encourages soldiers to talk about their sex lives and fertility problems – and to think about freezing their sperm.
"At first they're really embarrassed, but we talk and I tell them to tell others, and then they come and they do it," she says.
"If they have this chance, then why not? It doesn't hurt!"
Kyiv's state-run Centre for Reproductive Medicine began accepting soldiers onto the "frozen sperm" programme in January.
Only a dozen or so have signed up so far but the clinic is confident that will change once word gets out.
"We expect big demand. We have high hopes," director Oksana Holikova says, leading me towards the laboratory where the "biomaterial" is collected, prepared, and then stored.
Giant vats open with a puff of what looks like dry ice to reveal long, slim tubes suspended inside, full of sperm.
Our route through quiet corridors reveals the hidden strains of this war: just one newborn gurgling in a cot, and one woman in labour. The number of pregnant patients the clinic sees has dropped by half since the start of the all-out war.
"If women are stressed, they [can] have problems with their periods. It's all linked," Holikova points out. "About 60% of my patients are on anti-depressants, including people with panic attacks because of the missiles and drones."
Others have what she terms "delayed life syndrome": putting major life decisions, including childbirth, on pause.
"Women are scared of getting pregnant if they're going to end up running to bomb shelters."
So Ukraine needs every newborn child possible.
But the legislation to help military families doesn't always work smoothly.
Katerina Malyshko and her husband Vitaly had been trying for a baby for a while. She believes their problems conceiving naturally were caused, or at least exacerbated, by the war: "all the stress and sleepless nights," Katerina says. "Every night is like a lottery: you don't know whether you'll wake up."
The young couple would have celebrated their fourth wedding anniversary this year, perhaps with a new baby. Last winter they had three viable embryos at the fertility clinic and Katerina was due to have them transferred to her womb.
Then Vitaly was killed.
"It was a direct hit with a guided bomb, he had no chance," she tells me.
Katerina talks frankly about her struggle just to go on living without her husband. Her pain was then made even more acute when the clinic said she had no right to continue treatment with the frozen embryos or Vitaly's sperm.
"They would store it," she says. "But I couldn't use it."
The MP, Oksana Dmitrieva, has intervened directly with some clinics to ensure soldiers' families get treated. But she admits the new law still needs "ironing out".
A vote on several amendments is due in Spring.
But Katerina, desperate and grieving, had to turn to the courts and it was only six emotionally exhausting months later that a judge finally decided in her favour.
"I read the ruling and sat there and cried. Because it was our family. We had waited to long for that and been through so much," Katerina recalls.
"I felt joy and grief at the same time because I'd had to fight for my rights. But I wanted to do it, to honour my husband."
Katerina isn't ready to try for a child just yet: she feels too fragile.
She also has no hopes the war will end soon, which would allow her to give birth in a country at peace.
"If we compromise now, then what did so many people die for?" is her reaction to the idea Ukraine might give up land Vitaly was killed defending, for Russia to stop its invasion.
But Katerina does want the option of having her husband's baby when she's ready for that.
"I think the children of our soldiers who've been killed should have a chance to live: they have the right to live in the country their parents died for."
Out on the frontline, in constant danger, Maxim agrees.
"That's why I did it, and it's great!" the soldier tells me over the phone. "Because maybe tomorrow, I'm suddenly gone. But my wife will have my sperm and can use it. It's one less thing for me to worry about."
The biggest problem Maxim sees is persuading men to sign up for the programme.
The Kyiv clinic director, Oksana Horlikova, recalls talking to one war veteran who told her soldiers were coming to him in tears because they were struggling to have sex with their partners or conceive.
"Men are secretive, but there are lots of psychological problems," Maxim admits.
So he suggests soldiers could be told to freeze their sperm when they're drafted, like they leave DNA samples to identify them if they're killed.
"All that's holding people back is that we need to talk about this more and explain why it's important," the soldier concludes.
"Because we men won't do anything, unless you shove it in our face – and make us."

Land in focus at Geneva peace talks between Russia and Ukraine

GENEVA - Representatives of Ukraine and Russia will meet in Geneva on Feb 17 and 18 for a fresh round of US-mediated peace talks
US President Donald Trump is pressing Moscow and Kyiv to reach a deal to end Europe's biggest war since 1945, though Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has complained that his country is facing the greatest pressure to make concessions.
Russia is demanding that Ukraine cede the remaining 20 per cent of the eastern region of Donetsk that Moscow has failed to capture – something Kyiv refuses to do.
“This time, the idea is to discuss a broader range of issues, including, in fact, the main ones. The main issues concern both the territories and everything else related to the demands we have put forward,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Feb 16.
The venue has switched to the Swiss lakeside city after Abu Dhabi hosted two rounds of talks that both sides described as constructive but which failed to reach any major breakthrough.
The Geneva round comes just days before the fourth anniversary, on Feb 24, of Russia’s full-scale invasion of its much smaller neighbour.
Tens of thousands of people have been killed, millions have fled their homes, and many Ukrainian cities, towns and villages have been devastated by the conflict.
Russia occupies about 20 per cent of Ukraine’s national territory, including Crimea and parts of the eastern Donbas region seized before the 2022 invasion.
Its recent air strikes on energy infrastructure have left hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians without heating and power during the course of a harsh winter.
Hopes are low for any significant advance
The Kremlin said the Russian delegation would be led by Mr Vladimir Medinsky, an aide to President Vladimir Putin.
However, the fact that Ukrainian negotiators have accused Mr Medinsky in the past of lecturing them about history as an excuse for Russia’s invasion has further lowered expectations for any significant breakthrough in Geneva.
Military intelligence chief Igor Kostyukov will also take part in the talks while Mr Putin’s special envoy Kirill Dmitriev will be part of a separate working group on economic issues.
Speaking at the annual Munich Security Conference on Feb 15, Mr Zelensky said he hoped the Geneva talks would prove “serious, substantive... but honestly sometimes it feels like the sides are talking about completely different things”.
Kyiv’s delegation will be led by Mr Rustem Umerov, the secretary of Ukraine’s national security and defence council, and Mr Zelensky’s chief of staff Kyrylo Budanov. Senior presidential aide Serhiy Kyslytsya will also be present.
Before the delegation left for Geneva, Mr Umerov said Ukraine’s goal of “a sustainable and lasting peace” remained unchanged.
As well as land, Russia and Ukraine also remain far apart on issues such as who should control the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant and the possible role of Western troops in postwar Ukraine.
US envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner will represent the Trump administration at the talks, a source told Reuters. They are also attending talks in Geneva this week with Iran. REUTERS

Trump prepares for more talks: 'Iran wants a deal', 'I will be involved in the talks indirectly'

U.S. President Donald Trump claimed overnight between Monday and Tuesday, ahead of the resumption of talks between the United States and Iran later today in Geneva, Switzerland, that “Iran wants a deal.”
Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One, the American president added: “I’ll be involved in the talks indirectly, and they will be very important.” When asked about the chances of reaching an agreement, he replied: “I don’t think they’re interested in the consequences of not reaching a deal.”
On the American side, envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner will participate in the talks, while Iran will be represented by Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, joined by several diplomats from Tehran. The talks are being mediated by Oman’s foreign minister, Badr al-Busaidi, after the previous round was held in Muscat, the Omani capital.
In the previous round, the discussions were conducted in such a way that Araghchi left the room where the talks were taking place before members of the American delegation arrived, though according to reports, they did shake hands.
Trump appears to be continuing to apply pressure on Tehran on both the diplomatic and military fronts, as the United States continues to deploy military assets to the Middle East. On Monday night, U.S. Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee said that Israel, the United States and Jerusalem are coordinated regarding the negotiations.
“I was in Washington last week in meetings that President Trump held with Prime Minister Netanyahu. I’m telling you that the U.S. and Israel are fully coordinated on the issue of Iran,” Huckabee clarified. “We are true allies on this issue of dealing with the nuclear program and the ballistic missile array.”
Huckabee, speaking in Jerusalem at the annual conference of the Conference of Presidents and addressing leaders of American Jewish organizations, noted that “for more than 47 years, since 1979, the Iranian regime has called for the destruction of the United States and Israel. Iran is not just a problem for the U.S. and Israel, it is a problem for the world.” Regarding the talks, he said: “I don’t know whether this round will succeed. I don’t know whether within the framework of the negotiations we will be able to remove the threat of nuclear weapons, ballistic missiles and the financing of terror.”
Also addressing the negotiations Monday night was U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican considered close to Trump. After meeting with Netanyahu, as well as former Prime Minister Naftali Bennett, he said at a press conference in Tel Aviv: “I heard from Netanyahu that there are no disagreements between the U.S. and Israel on Iran.” According to Graham, “We are weeks away, not months, from a decision on this matter. The Iranian regime is weak and at its weakest point since 1979. The economy is shattered. The military is weakened. Iranian citizens are in the streets demanding an end to the regime. The opportunity must be seized.”
On Tuesday, Iran will mark the 40th day since the deaths of many thousands during protests that erupted last month and were massacred in a brutal crackdown by the regime. Authorities in Iran are planning ceremonies to be held across the country’s provinces, and the government has invited the public to participate. Iran’s General Staff said it would be “a memorial ceremony for the victims of the American-Zionist rebellion.”
On Monday night, at a small demonstration held in Ilam province in western Iran, protesters chanted “Death to Khamenei,” referring to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
Iran’s military drill and the “economic incentives” for the US
Alongside Trump’s remarks, the U.S. military continues to significantly reinforce its air and naval assets in the Middle East. According to a CNN report, the redeployment of forces and equipment is intended both to deter Iran and to be ready for use should the talks fail. The report, citing sources familiar with troop movements, said U.S. Air Force assets stationed in the United Kingdom, including refueling aircraft and fighter jets, have been repositioned closer to the Middle East.
The United States is also continuing to send air defense systems to the region, according to an official American source. Another source familiar with the matter said that several U.S. units deployed in the region and scheduled to rotate out in the coming weeks have been ordered to extend their stay. Flight-tracking data show that in recent weeks, dozens of U.S. military cargo planes have transported equipment from the United States to Jordan, Bahrain and Saudi Arabia. Satellite imagery revealed 12 U.S. F-15 fighter jets deployed at Muwaffaq Salti Air Base in Jordan since January 25. In addition, flight-tracking data indicate that the U.S. has carried out more than 250 cargo flights to the region.
Meanwhile, Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps conducted a military drill yesterday in the Strait of Hormuz, amid the possibility of a U.S. strike if talks between the sides fail. Iranian state television reported that the naval exercise, dubbed “Smart Control of the Strait of Hormuz,” was intended to prepare the IRGC for “potential security and military threats.”
The regime-affiliated Mehr News Agency wrote that “at the center of the drill is the decisive and comprehensive response of the IRGC’s operational forces to anti-security plots in the maritime arena.” Iran has repeatedly threatened to block the Strait of Hormuz, through which roughly 20% of global oil output passes. Iranian television said the first phase of the exercise included the use of strategic weapons on the three islands in the Persian Gulf.
At the same time, two sources familiar with the matter said it appears the Trump administration still lacks a clear understanding of what would happen in Iran on “the day after” the Iranian regime, if it were indeed to fall. CNN cited sources saying the likely alternatives could prove even more problematic for the United States and its allies.
In the short term, they said, the U.S. intelligence community believes the Revolutionary Guards would fill any leadership vacuum. The sources argued that a few weeks ago, when protests were raging, there were legitimate reasons to consider a strike. At that moment, they said, there was a brief window during which strikes could have given Iranians momentum to topple the regime. The sources questioned whether President Trump may have “missed the moment,” and expressed doubt that military strikes weeks after the protests would actually lead to the regime’s collapse.
CNN also cited Middle Eastern sources who said Gulf states are highly concerned about the possibility of military action that would destabilize the region. According to them, those countries are urging that diplomacy be given more time.
“Everyone is pushing back against a strike,” a diplomat in the region told CNN. According to him, the only country in the region supporting a strike is Israel. Israel, the report said, has emerged as a potential participant in joint strikes alongside the United States. It was also reported that potential U.S. targets in Iran include IRGC headquarters and other military facilities — in addition to nuclear sites.
Regarding the negotiations, CNN noted that Iran may attempt to prevent a U.S. strike through “economic incentives.” According to one source, during talks last year the possibility was raised that alongside a nuclear agreement, Washington and Tehran could reach understandings that would grant Americans access to developing Iran’s natural resources — including oil, gas and rare minerals. The source said this issue is expected to arise again in the current contacts between the sides.

‘She always hoped for a better life’: Indigenous mother found dead in Melbourne’s east

‘She always hoped for a better life’: Indigenous mother found dead in Melbourne’s east
Warning: this story contains the name and images of an Indigenous person who has died.
An Indigenous mother found dead in her Melbourne home has been remembered as a beautiful soul who always hoped for a better life for her and her three children.
Homicide detectives are investigating after the body of Belinda Nicholls was found at a house on Mountain Highway near Dorset Road in Bayswater, in Melbourne’s outer-east, at about 11am on Monday.
A 39-year-old Bayswater man was arrested at a nearby bus stop less than one hour later in relation to her death.
Police believe he was known to Nicholls. He has not yet been charged.
Margaret Hamilton, a long-time family friend of Nicholls, said those close to her were devastated by her tragic death.
“Belinda was a beautiful soul who adored her three boys,” Hamilton told The Age. “She was a loyal friend and stayed close to all of my family.”
“There were many ups and downs for Belinda, but she always hoped for a better life for her and her beautiful boys.”
Hamilton said Nicholls was proud of her Indigenous heritage. She frequently wore clothing featuring the Aboriginal flag and her house, which is owned by Aboriginal Housing Victoria, was decorated with the ensign.
Nicholls’ loving nature touched many in her reach, including neighbour Steve Nicholls, who described her as a kind woman.
“She was always good to us – she always looked out for me, and we were always there for her,” he said.
He said police knocked on his door at about 1pm on Monday, asking whether he had heard anything unusual. He said he recalled hearing a loud noise the night before, followed by silence.
There had previously been heated arguments at the property over the years, including raised voices and doors banging, he said.
“I thought it was one of those episodes last night. It’s a shock. It’s a shame. Hopefully, she can rest in peace now.”
Other neighbours said Nicholls mostly kept to herself and they had not interacted with her much.
For help or information contact: 13YARN on 13 92 76.
Anyone who witnessed the incident that led to the woman’s death, with footage or further information is urged to contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000 or report at www.crimestoppersvic.com.au.

Trump says he will be involved indirectly in Iran talks
US President Donald Trump said on Monday that he would be involved "indirectly" in talks between Iran and the US over Tehran's nuclear program set to begin on Tuesday in Geneva, adding he believed Tehran wanted to make a deal.
"I'll be involved in those talks, indirectly. And they'll be very important," Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One.
Tensions are soaring ahead of the talks, with the US deploying a second aircraft carrier to the Middle East.
The US military is preparing for the possibility of a sustained military campaign if the talks do not succeed, US officials have told Reuters news agency.
Asked about the prospects for a deal, Trump said Iran sought tough negotiations but learned the consequences of such a hardened stance last summer when the US bombed Iranian nuclear sites.
Trump suggested Iranians were motivated this time to negotiate.
"I don't think they want the consequences of not making a deal," Trump said.
Prior to the US joining Israel in striking Iranian nuclear sites in June, Iran-US nuclear talks had stalled over Washington's demand that Tehran forgo enrichment on its soil, which the US views as a pathway to an Iranian nuclear weapon.
Iran's civil defense organization on Monday held a chemical defense drill in the Pars Special Economic Energy Zone to strengthen preparedness for potential chemical incidents in the energy hub located in southern Iran.

WASHINGTON, February 17. /TASS/. Kiev should genuinely engage in talks on resolving the Ukraine conflict, US President Donald Trump said.
"So far, Ukraine better come to the table fast. That's all I'm telling you," he told reporters aboard Air Force One, commenting on the upcoming Geneva meeting on Ukraine.
"We want them to come," Trump added.
"It's going to be very easy," the US leader said referring to the upcoming consultations.
Geneva is set to host the next round of Russia-US-Ukraine consultations on February 17-18. Russia’s delegation, led by Presidential Aide Vladimir Medinsky, will consist of about 20 members. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced that Washington would be represented by Special Presidential Envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump’s son-in-law, entrepreneur Jared Kushner. The first two rounds of talks were held in the Emirati capital of Abu Dhabi on January 23-24 and on February 4-5.

Beware excessive ‘fire energy’ in Year of the Horse: Hong Kong feng shui masters
Soothsayers warn of potential volatility in coming lunar year, with city having to navigate geopolitical tensions even as its economy improves
Hongkongers and world leaders should take a step back and be careful to avoid conflicts during the Year of the Horse, feng shui masters have warned, saying the zodiac sign contains excessive “fire energy” that could trigger aggressive action.
Soothsayers interviewed by the South China Morning Post said the coming year, which falls under the category of the “fire horse” in the lunar calendar, would remain volatile for China and be crisis-prone for the US. They also predicted that Hong Kong would remain embroiled in geopolitical tensions, even as its economy improved gradually.
The horse is one of the 12 zodiac signs in Chinese cosmology, while fire is one of the five elements – metal, wood, water, fire and earth – whose characteristics and powers affect those born that year and beyond.
Celebrity host and feng shui master Qixianyu, better known as Master Seven, urged Hongkongers to avoid conflict with others and be cautious, as fiery tempers, clashes and weapons were all governed by fire energy.
“If you engage in conflict with others, a small stressful situation could result in violence,” she said.
Astrologer Letao Wang said that while the energy of the Year of the Snake was more introspective, the image of the fire horse was forward-moving.

How Chinese people overcome challenges by ‘eating’ and ‘whipping’ the spring
Seasonal festival rituals aim to promote agricultural abundance, include consumption of special food, striking of symbolic ox
To welcome the arrival of spring, Chinese people across the nation observe a series of seasonal rituals such as Biting the Spring, Whipping the Spring and Speaking the Spring.
The customs reflect people’s hopes for renewal, good fortune and a prosperous farming year, while also marking the transition from winter stillness to spring vitality.
The SCMP explains why.
Biting the spring
Known as Yao Chun in Chinese, this is a traditional custom that involves eating seasonal foods such as spring pancakes and radishes to welcome the new year.
Rooted in the principle of using seasonal ingredients and following the natural order to maintain health, the practice symbolises hope for a bountiful harvest, prosperity for both people and livestock, and blessings of good fortune in the year ahead.
It dates back to the Han dynasty (206-220) when people ate fresh seasonal vegetables to welcome the arrival of spring.
During the Northern Wei (386–535) and Jin (265–420) dynasties, this tradition evolved into the popular practice of consuming the Five Spicy Dishes, a mix of pungent vegetables like spring onions, garlic and leeks.

The siblings who built a $537 billion giant in five years
Anthropic’s latest capital raising underscores how both the risks and rewards of the boom in artificial intelligence are ratcheting up, almost on a daily basis.
The $US30 billion ($42 billion) raising values Anthropic, founded only five years ago by siblings Dario and Daniela Amodei, and which generated its first dollar of revenue less than three years ago, at an extraordinary $US380 billion ($537 billion).
It’s even more remarkable considering that, less than six months ago, when it raised $US13.5 billion, it was valued at ‘only’ $US183 billion and a year ago, when it raised $US13 billion, at $US61.5 billion.
That’s an indication of, not just how rapidly and dramatically the AI sector and its appetite for capital have grown, but how aggressive expectations of future revenues and earnings have to be to justify the escalation in valuations and how stretched capital markets now are in providing the capital needed to fund the sector’s growth. Anthropic tapped more than 30 investment institutions to raise the funds.
The exponential growth in the group’s fundraising and valuation is validated, albeit to an uncertain degree, by similar growth in the revenues it is generating.
Three years after that first dollar of revenue was earned, Anthropic now says its current run-rate revenue is $US14 billion. Its revenue, it says, has growth at a rate of more than 10 times each year for the past three years.
Moreover, that rate has picked up sharply this year with the launch of its Claude Code coding tool last May. Claude Code’s run-rate revenue is now over $US2.5 billion, more than doubling since the start of this year, with weekly active users also doubling since January 1 and business subscriptions quadrupling.
It was the release of Claude plugins that automate a range of tasks in service industries, notably legal, data and financial services, that disrupted the entire sharemarket this month.
The perceived implications for software companies wiped 4.5 per cent off the value of the tech-oriented Nasdaq index and more than $US1 trillion off the market capitalisation of the handful of mega-tech stocks that are committing the best part of $US700 billion to AI-related spending this year.
The AI-driven demand for capital is insatiable. Anthropic, which has a more measured approach to spending than many of its AI competitors, will spend more than $US30 billion on data centres and the semiconductors to power them this year.
The capital just raised – and the $US57 billion raised previously – will be spent very quickly, which might explain why it is reported to be considering an initial public offering later this year. It’s bigger rival, OpenAI, which is seeking to raise $US100 billion at a valuation of $US750 billion, is also contemplating an IPO.
That highlights one of the challenges facing AI start-ups like Anthropic and OpenAI.
Unlike the “hyperscalers” like Google’s parent Alphabet, Facebook’s Meta, Microsoft and Amazon, they don’t have existing cashflows to fund their development and the scale of capital they need to keep up with the hyperscalers is outstripping the ability of the venture capital and private capital markets to supply it.
Even the mega-techs are having to raise new equity and, increasingly, debt to fund their commitments to AI.
Anthropic’s Dario Amodei, in a podcast hosted by technology specialist Dwarkesh Patel at the weekend, described the risk-reward equation confronting AI aspirants by saying that the escalation in the costs of the computing power now required for AI could be “ruinous” if companies got their timing wrong – if they invested too much too early.
“I really do believe that we could have (large language) models that are a country of geniuses in the data centre in one to two years,” Amodei said earlier this month.
“One question is: How many years after that do the trillions in revenues start rolling in? I don’t think it is guarantee that it is going to be immediate. It could be one year, it could be two years, I could even stretch it out to five years, although I’m sceptical of that.”
The critical challenge for the AI companies is that they are investing trillions of dollars today in data centres and chips for the “compute”, or processing power, that won’t be available for at least a year, possibly two.
If the ambitious revenue projections that underlay the decision to build the centres don’t meet expectations, the scale of the investments could, in Amodei’s terms, ruin the companies.
As he said, he could assume that Anthropic’s revenues continue to grow at ten times the previous years and he’d have a trillion dollars by the end of 2027 and could buy $US1 trillion of compute at the end of that year.
If the revenue wasn’t $US1 trillion, however – if he was even a year off in terms of the rate of growth – “there’s no force on Earth, no hedge on Earth, that could stop me from going bankrupt if I buy that much compute”, he said.
The potential for mismatches between investments and revenues is elevated because, if all the data centres on drawing boards were built, or even a significant proportion of them, they would strain to breaking point (or perhaps behind it) the capacity of economies to provide the power, water, chips, construction materials and skilled workers. At the very least, the cost of the centres will soar.
That illustrates the tightrope the AI companies, particularly the start-ups, are walking as they invest trillions of dollars in the conviction that the revenues that will justify the scale of their investments will materialise within the next few years. Even modest mismatches in their timing could spell financial disaster.
‘One question is: How many years after that do the trillions in revenues start rolling in?’Anthropic co-founder Dario Amodei
Amodei said some AI companies give the impression that they don’t understand the risks they are taking.
“They’re just doing stuff because it sounds cool,” he said.
Hopefully that’s not the case, but clearly the risks being taken in the hope of a massive pay-off are mounting as the scale of investments continually mounts up at a rate that outstrips even the extraordinary rates of AI-driven revenue growth the better-placed companies are achieving.
Can Anthropic, continue to grow at 10 times the revenue it generated in the previous year? What kinds of margins might it eventually produce on that revenue? Given the amounts of capital it is investing to hopefully achieve positive cashflows, what kind of return on investment would validate what it’s done? It would need to be very substantial.
Those are the sorts of questions being posed by increasingly nervous equity investors, worried that even if AI is the transformative technology it promises to be, the net present value of whatever the eventual earnings might be may not be sufficiently positive to justify the risks being taken – or sufficient for the raft of start-ups without access to legacy cash flows to survive.

Anderson Cooper to depart CBS ‘60 Minutes’ to focus on CNN and his family
The long-running news show has been at the center of controversy in recent weeks after CBS editor-in-chief Bari Weiss intervened in a broadcast

Anderson Cooper has declined to sign a new contract with 60 Minutes and will depart the flagship CBS News show at the end of the current season.
Cooper, who also anchors news for CNN, has been a correspondent for 60 Minutes since 2006.
In a statement shared with Deadline, Cooper said, “Being a correspondent at 60 Minutes has been one of the great honors of my career. I got to tell amazing stories, and work with some of the best producers, editors, and camera crews in the business.
“For nearly twenty years, I’ve been able to balance my jobs at CNN and CBS, but I have little kids now and I want to spend as much time with them as possible, while they still want to spend time with me.”
Cooper’s decision to depart 60 Minutes comes at a tumultuous time for the show. Last month, CBS News pushed back at a report claiming editor-in-chief Bari Weiss held one of Cooper’s stories that was critical of Donald Trump’s policies.
The disputed segment by Cooper was about the Trump administration’s plan to accept South African refugees, according to Status.
Trump has often repeated a debunked conspiracy theory that a genocide of white people was taking place in South Africa and set out plans to prioritize white South Africans' visa claims last October.
Sources told the newsletter the as-yet unaired segment was viewed by producers in December, with Weiss giving “extensive editorial feedback.”
The newsletter, produced by a former CNN media reporter, also suggested the story was “all but guaranteed to provoke Trump” and that there had been an “abnormal” level of review.
However, a source close to CBS News has denied the claims and insists the story is still being worked on.
“Bari Weiss did not hold the story,” the source said in a statement to The Independent at the time. “The story was already going through our standard, rigorous editorial review led by executive producer Tanya Simon, which led to multiple screenings.
“The story was not held, it's still in action and in reporting stages with the team,” they continued. “Tanya made the decision to have the team continue with their reporting.”
A previous 60 Minutes report critical of Trump was pulled in December, sparking backlash behind the scenes.
The other segment focused on the mistreatment of migrants sent by the United States to CECOT, a prison in El Salvador. The 13-minute clip was set to be broadcast in December before it was withdrawn before air.
Weiss, appointed as CBS News editor-in-chief last year, attempted to justify the decision in an email to staff at Christmas, arguing it was necessary to “win back” the trust of Americans disillusioned by network news.
However, Sharyn Alfonsi, the reporter who produced the CECOT segment, wrote in a leaked email that she believes the real reason for the story being axed was “corporate censorship.”
Sources at the broadcaster later told The Independent that staff were ready to “revolt” over the scandal. One person even described it as a “holy f***ing dumpster fire.”
The Independent has reached out to Cooper and CBS for further comment.

Trump’s best friend in Europe counts on White House to stay in power
Updated ,first published
London: The people of Hungary seem ready to throw out their prime minister and elect a younger alternative who is promising to stop corruption, boost the economy and mend fences with the European Union.
That prime minister, however, has other ideas. Viktor Orbán, the caustic conservative who has dominated Hungarian politics for decades, believes he has a powerful ally in his bid to retain power at an election in April. He is counting on Donald Trump.
Orbán has become Trump’s best friend in Europe at a time when the continent’s leaders are frustrated with the US president over his designs on Greenland, his shifting positions on Ukraine and his lukewarm support for NATO.
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio just made sure that Orbán feels the love. The two men stood side by side on a podium in Budapest on Monday and spoke of a “golden age” in their national ties.
There was no surprise in Rubio’s strong support for Orbán, given that Trump took to social media on February 5 to endorse his friend as the best candidate for the April 12 election. Trump also endorsed him at the election four years ago.
But Rubio gave Orbán a televised moment that the Hungarian leader can highlight on mainstream and social media in the hope of persuading voters that only he can deliver national security.
“President Trump is deeply committed to your success because your success is our success,” Rubio told Orbán at a joint press conference.
“Because this relationship we have, here in Central Europe, through you, is so essential and vital for our national interests in the years to come.
“If you face financial struggles, if you face things that are impediments to growth, if you face things that threaten the stability of your country, I know that President Trump will be very interested – because of your relationship with him.”
Rubio was explicit about the way Trump would provide assistance to Hungary if a problem arose, referring to “finances and the like” as examples of the help that might be needed.
That helps cement the message from Orbán to voters last November, when he emerged from meetings with Trump at the White House to claim he had a “financial shield” from America to safeguard the Hungarian economy.
While this was never explained in detail, Trump approved a currency swap for Argentina last October to help his friend Javier Milei, the country’s president. (US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent claimed it made money for taxpayers.)
Trump also arranged urgent help for Orbán last year by exempting Hungary from US sanctions on Russian oil and gas, a key issue for households in a landlocked nation that relies on Russian pipelines for essential energy.
Orbán looks like he needs all the support he can get. An opinion poll released last Friday by the Idea Institute showed that only 38 per cent of decided voters backed Orbán and his party, Fidesz. It found that 48 per cent backed his challenger, Peter Magyar, a former government official who leads a centre-right party, Tisza.
But those numbers only reflected voters who had made up their minds. The pollster found that 24 per cent of all voters were undecided.
Orbán is a skilled politician. He entered the Hungarian parliament upon the collapse of Communism in 1990 and was prime minister eight years later. He only lasted four years in his first term, but returned in 2010 and was re-elected in 2014, 2018 and 2022.
He shows no signs of moderating his style to win this uphill election race. As the election nears, he has stepped up his complaints about European Union leaders and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.
While others in Europe shun Russia, the Hungarian leader has visited Moscow several times, most recently in November last year and July the year before.
Russian President Vladimir Putin greeted him warmly last November. “We are aware of your balanced position on the situation in Ukraine,” he told Orbán as television cameras captured the moment.
Orbán may be an outlier in the European Union, but he could also be a sign of things to come. He is vehemently against immigration and blames Brussels for making it too hard to turn people away. When Trump issues policies that warn of “civilisational erasure” in Europe, it is safe to assume that Orbán agrees.
Others in Europe line up with him. There is Nigel Farage and Reform UK in Britain, as well as Marine Le Pen and Jordan Bardella at the National Rally in France, and Alice Weidel and the Alternative Fur Deutschland (or AfD) in Germany.
The election in Hungary cannot be used as a barometer for the public mood in other countries, but a victory for Orbán would keep a prominent Trump ally in power at a time when many other European leaders are trying to keep their distance from the US president.
And there is a lesson from the campaign long before the votes are cast. There is a common misapprehension that Trump and his MAGA movement favour American isolation and want to desert Europe. In fact, they want to change it.
Trump will engage in Europe when he sees an ally who needs his support. And he will endorse political leaders whenever he likes, as he did with Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi last week, regardless of the conventions about staying out of other nations’ elections.
The next two months will show how far Trump might go to keep a fellow populist in power. And how much his supporters would like to see Europe painted in MAGA gold.

‘Significant hostility’: Scale of racism on university campuses revealed
Fellow students competing to shout “terrorism” the loudest at a Palestinian student, being told Indigenous people should be “rounded up and shot” by a placement supervisor, “jokes” about slanty eyes and people screaming “send them to the camps” at groups of Jewish students: these are the experiences of Australian university students over the past two years, according to a landmark study.
Racism@Uni – the first national study of its kind – concluded that racism is “pervasive” across the country’s 43 universities. Taking in the views of 47,000 students and 28,000 staff, the study was commissioned by the federal government in 2024 and undertaken by the Australian Human Rights Commission.
The situation on campus worsens with external events, the report said, with First Nations students and staff seeing more racism during the failed referendum on the Voice, Asian students experiencing a spike during the COVID-19 pandemic, and antisemitic, Islamophobic, anti-Palestinian, anti-Arab and anti-Middle Eastern sentiment reaching new heights since the Israel-Hamas war began more than two years ago.
“Jewish, Israeli, Palestinian, Muslim and Middle Eastern staff and students have endured significantly heightened hostility,” the report said.
“I’d encountered antisemitism before, but I had never been scared to be Jewish. In uni, I frequently feel the need to hide my religion,” one student said.
“Many university staff are promulgating antisemitic attitudes and ideas in the classroom. I constantly hear tropes to do with money, power, control, bloodthirstiness and other antisemitic ideas in classrooms, and staff meetings,” a staff member said.
Of Jewish students and staff, 89.1 per cent said they had experienced direct or indirect racism, as did 80.6 per cent of Middle Eastern respondents, 76.3 per cent of Muslim respondents and 90.2 per cent of Palestinian respondents.
The terms of reference define indirect racism as “racist behaviour directed at others from the same racial, ethnic, cultural and/or religious group they identify with”, while direct racism is a personal experience of racist behaviour.
Middle Eastern staff and students described a pattern of intimidation from campus security, including being followed, surveillance of their social media, and security asking for identification.
The findings were completed before the December massacre at Bondi Beach that targeted a Jewish festival, in which 15 people were killed.
“The commission also recognises that such incidents of violence impacts on the broader community and are often accompanied by a heightened risk of racism and vilification … towards all communities that experience racism,” the report noted.
The conflict in the Middle East has had a significant effect on freedom of expression on Australian campuses.
A large proportion of Jewish students – 93.7 per cent of religious Jewish students and 81.1 per cent of secular Jewish students – felt they were unable to express their views on campus. Staff felt similarly – 84.6 per cent of religious Jews and 85.9 per cent of secular Jews said the same.
Similarly, 70 per cent of Middle Eastern respondents felt they could not express their views and 70 per cent of Muslim staff felt they could not express their views. Palestinian students (86 per cent) and staff (84 per cent) felt the same.
All Palestinian students to whom it applied said they did not express views because of the potential impact on their right to stay in Australia, and 90 per cent of Palestinian respondents said they had experienced racism.
Seventy per cent of the study’s respondents had experienced direct or indirect racism, including three in four international students experiencing indirect racism, and one in five academics experiencing direct interpersonal racism.
The report’s sweeping recommendations included establishing a sector-wide framework, annual independent reviews, development of specific anti-racism strategies and a strengthened complaints process.
Federal Education Minister Jason Clare said the government would consider the recommendations.
Race Discrimination Commissioner Giridharan Sivaraman said: “The insights and data from this study highlight that racism at university is not confined to isolated incidents or individual behaviour – it is systemic. Racism is pervasive across the sector.”

CORRECTION
A previous version of this story stated 85 per cent of religious Jewish staff and 86 per cent of secular Jewish staff had been physically harassed, threatened or assaulted due to an error in the report. The actual number is 10 per cent of religious staff and 3 per cent of secular staff.

‘I just want to stop hearing about it’: a weary South Korea awaits verdict on Yoon insurrection charges

South Korea is awaiting one of the most consequential court rulings in decades this week, with judges due to deliver their verdict on insurrection charges against the former president Yoon Suk Yeol and prosecutors demanding the death penalty.
When Yoon stands in courtroom 417 of Seoul central district court on Thursday to hear his fate, which will be broadcast live, he will do so in the same room where the military dictator Chun Doo-hwan was sentenced to death three decades ago. The charge is formally the same. Last time, it took almost 17 years and a democratic transition to deliver a verdict. This time, it has taken 14 months. Chun’s death sentence was later reduced to life imprisonment on appeal, and he was eventually pardoned.
Under the country’s criminal code, the charge of leading an insurrection carries three possible sentences: death, life imprisonment with labour, or life imprisonment without labour. South Korea has not carried out an execution since 1997, so in practice a death sentence would mean permanent exclusion from society with no possibility of parole.
But as the ruling approaches, there is a sense of exhaustion and division in South Korea as the months-long saga, in which 27 people have been indicted over the martial law crisis, continues.
Dowon Kim, a 32-year-old office worker in Seoul, no longer discusses politics with friends, some of whom still support Yoon. “Society is too exhausted,” he says, “and my energy feels wasted trying to persuade them.”
South Korea has now impeached two presidents in under a decade, and Kim says people simply want to move past the cycle: “Those who should be punished should be punished, and we need to move forward.”
Song Ji-won, a 24-year-old student in Incheon, west of Seoul, says what happened was a national embarrassment. “I just want to stop hearing about it.”
The K-pop light stick protests that once brought millions on to the streets have long subsided. Maga-inspired pro-Yoon rallies have dwindled to the fringes. At a recent gathering where 2,300 registered supporters were expected, about 20 appeared. The political fallout has been devastating for the People Power party, which has been unable to divorce itself from Yoon’s legacy. It polled at just 22% last week, according to Gallup Korea, against 44% for the ruling Democratic party.
From martial law to impeachment in 11 days
On the night of 3 December 2024, prosecutors allege Yoon declared martial law and attempted to use military force to paralyse the legislature, arrest political opponents and seize control of the national election commission. Yoon said he was rooting out “anti-state forces” and alleged election fraud.
Prosecutors allege he had plotted for more than a year, strategically placing loyalists in key military positions. It was the first emergency martial law declaration in the country in 44 years, shattering the assumption that military rule was a relic of South Korea’s authoritarian past.
The response to Yoon’s move was swift. Within hours, 190 lawmakers broke through military and police cordons around parliament to pass an emergency resolution lifting martial law. Parliament impeached Yoon within 11 days. The constitutional court removed him from office four months later. Three separate special prosecutors were appointed, and across their investigations more than 120 people have been indicted, from the president himself to cabinet ministers, military commanders and intelligence chiefs.
Despite the relative quiet in the build-up to this week’s court ruling, the weight of the moment is not lost on South Koreans. Over the past few weeks, they have watched as the courts established key legal findings through related cases.
On 16 January, Yoon received five years for obstructing his own arrest. Days later, the former prime minister Han Duck-soo was given 23 years in a ruling that formally found the events of 3 December constituted insurrection, describing it as a “self-coup” by elected power more dangerous than traditional uprisings. The sentence far exceeded prosecutors’ 15-year demand, signalling judicial willingness to impose severe penalties.
On 12 February, the former interior minister Lee Sang-min was jailed for seven years for his role in the insurrection, including relaying Yoon’s orders to cut power and water to media outlets.
But Thursday’s verdict rests with a different presiding judge. The insurrection findings in the earlier cases, while significant, do not bind this panel. It will make its own determination on whether 3 December crossed the criminal threshold for insurrection.
Sangchin Chun, a professor of sociology at Sogang university, said the final blow to Yoon’s movement may not be the verdict itself but whether people feel their daily lives improving under the president, Lee Jae Myung. “Ending the insurrection seems to have become less a legal matter than an everyday economic one,” he said. Lee, who has focused heavily on bread-and-butter issues such as the cost of living and housing, maintains a solid approval rating of 63%.
In Yoon’s last court appearance, he characterised the investigation as a “political conspiracy”, described martial law as having “enlightened” citizens, and offered no apology. At one point, he appeared to laugh as prosecutors demanded the death penalty. Prosecutors have cited a complete lack of remorse as an aggravating factor. Under South Korean sentencing principles, genuine repentance is a formal legal consideration.
He faces further legal battles: six additional criminal trials, two of which stem from the martial law crisis, including a treason indictment for allegedly ordering drone incursions into North Korean airspace to provoke a confrontation that could justify military rule.
For South Korea, the verdict will mark the culmination of one of the most extensive exercises in democratic accountability against a former head of state in its history, with the court also handing down judgments against seven co-defendants including senior military and police officials implicated in the plot.
Many of those watching will have lived through the authoritarian era of the 1980s that the 2024 martial law declaration so starkly echoed. The democratic guardrails they fought to build are being tested. By Thursday afternoon, the country will know whether they have held.

‘You have to be famous for something’: The retail leader reshaping Melbourne’s fashion fest
I’m early to meet Launa Inman for lunch at Supernormal, but she is even more punctual, already seated in a booth by the window.
Inman is dressed immaculately, as you might expect from the chair of the Melbourne Fashion Festival, in a royal blue Hugo Boss sleeveless dress.
She has lived and breathed fashion and retail all her working life in a career that has spanned roles as the chief executive of Target, Officeworks and surfwear brand Billabong.
Inman says she draws on all this experience as chair of the festival, which this year celebrates its 30th anniversary, but there have been a few regrets along the way.
Taking on the role of chief executive at formerly ASX-listed Billabong is one of them.
“That probably wasn’t the best decision I’ve ever made going there,” she says. “Billabong was in trouble, but I didn’t realise how much. I should have done some better due diligence in hindsight.”
Our waiter comes over to discuss the wine list, and after some discussion recommends a chardonnay from the Macedon Ranges.
“I love trying new wines,” Inman says happily. “She really sold it to me.”
While Inman enjoys a glass of wine over lunch, she asks not to be photographed with a glass in her hand.
As one of only six women to lead an ASX-listed company when she was chief executive of Billabong, Inman has learnt to be careful about the way she is perceived.
As a woman who did not surf, Inman was regarded as an outsider at Billabong and experienced extra scrutiny.
“It is like it’s tribal,” Inman says. “If you’ve got a surfboard, and even if you are in private equity, it’s a common bond how you ride those waves. I did not get that initially. I went in with a very business approach.”
Inman says Billabong staff were used to taking regular breaks to go surfing and would skateboard down the hallways.
“They would come to work in shorts and T-shirts, but I did draw the line at barefoot,” she says.
Within six weeks of arriving at the company, Inman had to announce a profit downgrade and an equity raising.
“It wasn’t my fault, but there was a lot of, ‘Why have you got a woman here who doesn’t even surf running the organisation?’” she says.
Our first dish arrives, a cucumber and radish salad topped with sprigs of mint. It’s fresh and vibrant on a hot summer day, and we both dive in eagerly with our chopsticks.
While heading up Billabong was a challenge, it wasn’t the first time Inman had experienced adversity in her career.
She was born and raised in Zimbabwe, where she majored in accounting and economics. A part-time job at a council helped Inman realise she didn’t want to be an accountant.
“It was brilliant that I did it because it has enabled me to really know my way around the balance sheet and understand the finance,” she says. “It became incredibly pertinent as I progressed up the corporate ladder.”
However, the civil war in Rhodesia, as Zimbabwe was known at the time, prompted Inman to move to South Africa with her now husband.
“It was pretty clear that the country was falling apart,” Inman says.
The only way out of the country was in a convoy to the border with armed vehicles and helicopters.
In South Africa, Inman started working in fashion and retail with roles at specialty manufacturers and department stores.
She was in the country for Nelson Mandela’s release and for the first post-apartheid elections.
“It was a very exciting time to see all these people actually eventually have a vote,” Inman says. “I remember reading in Life magazine that they anticipated a million people would die through riots, and in fact it was the most incredibly peaceful election that went on for five days.”
However, after the election, rising crime and safety concerns in South Africa led Inman and her young family to apply to immigrate to Australia.
“While we were in Johannesburg, we had a really bad incident where someone broke into our house and held our children at knifepoint, and that was it,” Inman says. “It became a question of not whether to get out, but when.”
Inman moved to Australia in 1997. All the family were able to take from South Africa was their furniture and 7000 rand, which was the equivalent of about $4000 each.
Her children were aged 11 and nine at the time and left behind their wider family, friends and pets.
“It was so stressful,” Inman says of trying to relocate to Australia. “In those days they didn’t really have work visas. You had to be a permanent resident, and to become a permanent resident you had to have a job, but you couldn’t get a job without residency.”
After a series of interviews, Inman joined Big W, which she found was a steep learning curve. She had never worked in big-box retail.
“It was a real baptism of fire,” Inman says. “It’s all about price, all about volume, and that circularity, that the more you sell, that the more you can produce and you can lower the price.”
Inman says discount retail was not a market she particularly loved because a lot had to be taken out of garments to make the price point.
“But what I walked away having learnt was phenomenal,” she says.
Our next dish arrives, a pair of fat, bronzed scallops from Shark Bay dripping in kelp butter.
I wonder aloud exactly where Shark Bay is, and Inman says it’s in Western Australia. “We went there, and we swam with the whale sharks,” she says.
‘You can’t change a business at one time, you have to work at it. An elephant, no matter how big they are, they can still only take one mouthful at a time.’Launa Inman reflects on her time at Target
Inman says she applied some of the lessons she learnt at Big W throughout her career, including at the Melbourne Fashion Festival.
“It’s not just about fashion, but it’s about having that business acumen to understand how you take that fashion and commercialise it,” she says. “I found that fascinating, and that, I think today, has been one of the reasons I was successful in retail. I always thought there might be seven trends that were being shown to us, but what is going to make the money? What’s appropriate for our consumer?”
From Big W, Inman was poached to work at Target in 2001, which she says was “going through a torrid time”.
Walking around Target’s stores at the time, Inman saw they were overstocked and now says the business was not making markdowns to preserve profit and “had gone off-piste”.
“If it doesn’t sell, mark it down, move on,” she says. “The quicker you mark it down and get rid of it the better. If it doesn’t sell within eight weeks, why would it sell in six months?”
Inman helped turn Target around from a $32 million loss to a $54 million profit in 18 months, a transformation she describes as “incredible”.
From Target, Inman went to Officeworks, which at the time was valued at about $1 billion, in her first role as chief executive. She recalls the retailer’s push into selling technology from being a stationery and filing cabinet specialist.
Then it was back to Target as chief executive, in a position, Inman says, she returned the focus to children’s wear as it was a key traffic driver for the business.
“It didn’t matter whether you earned $50,000 a year or $120,000 a year, you came to Target for children’s wear. In those days, they owned it. I knew if we wanted to turn the business around, we had to get the children’s wear right,” she says.
It’s time for Supernormal’s signature dish of lobster rolls, with the sweet, creamy lobster nestled in a soft brioche bun.
Inman tries to eat the roll delicately by dissecting it, but given I am not being photographed while eating, I have no hesitation in just biting in.
We agree it’s a signature dish for a reason.
Inman says she tried to change things gradually during her time at Target.
“You can’t change a business at one time, you have to work at it,” she says. “An elephant, no matter how big they are, they can still only take one mouthful at a time.”
Inman says she concentrated on what would make a difference and what the business was famous for: children’s wear, underwear and women’s wear.
“You have to be famous for something,” she says. “You have to have a differentiator, just like we are at the Melbourne Fashion Festival because we are the largest consumer-facing festival in Australia, and that’s our differentiator. You’ve got to have something that makes you different from your competitors.”
At Target, Inman introduced collaborations with fashion designers, including Stella McCartney and Dion Lee.
“Just because you don’t have a lot of money doesn’t mean you don’t want to look good,” she says.
As at Target, Inman has her work cut out to transform the fashion festival’s fortunes. Its most recent financial report shows the festival posted a loss of $711,390, with a revenue of $4.57 million down from $5.75 million for the 2024 financial year.
“I took over as chair during COVID,” Inman says. “That was also challenging. I always get these challenging situations.”
Inman says she is proud that the festival put on a show every year, even during COVID.
“The challenge for us was the cost of putting on the runway,” she says. “Whether you have 100 people watching it or whether you have 1500 people watching it, it’s the same cost.”
Ticket sales for the 30th anniversary year are strong, Inman says, and she is excited about hosting Nepalese-American fashion designer Prabal Gurung at the festival.
Inman wants to see fashion taken more seriously as a major economic force, and points out that in Victoria, the textile and fashion industry turns over about $8.5 billion annually.
“That’s a lot of money,” she says. “We export more fashion and textiles than we do beer and wine.”
One segment of the industry Inman is not a fan of is fast fashion.
“I feel that it brings absolutely nothing to this country,” she says. “One of the things is that we have no idea where these products are coming from.”
Inman points to discount retailers Temu and Shein, which she says are valued at more than $3 billion each but don’t pay any duty or tax or manufacture in Australia.
“They bring in planeloads every single night,” she says. “Any other retailer has to have very clear criteria of no slavery, strong quality control, no children working under an agreed age. They don’t have any of those criteria.”
Inman despairs that the fast fashion giants are taking a large proportion of trade from Australian retailers, a problem which has “massive repercussions and ripple effects” for Australian designers.
She believes the fast fashion giants should have to pay duties, as they do in the United States.
For Inman, when it comes to promoting fashion, it’s all about business.
“You can’t just say it’s beautiful fashion,” she says. “There has to be a purpose, an end game to it.”
The Melbourne Fashion Festival runs until Saturday, February 28.

Trump says he will be involved indirectly in Iran talks, Tehran likely to make deal

US President Donald Trump said on Monday that he would be involved "indirectly" in talks between Iran and the US over Tehran's nuclear program set to begin on Tuesday in Geneva, adding he believed Tehran wanted to make a deal.
"I'll be involved in those talks, indirectly. And they'll be very important," Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One.
Tensions are soaring ahead of the talks, with the US deploying a second aircraft carrier to the Middle East. The US military is preparing for the possibility of a sustained military campaign if the talks do not succeed, US officials have told Reuters.
Asked about the prospects for a deal, Trump said Iran sought tough negotiations but learned the consequences of such a hardened stance last summer when the US bombed Iranian nuclear sites.
Iran motivated to negotiate, says Trump
Trump suggested Iranians were motivated this time to negotiate.
"I don't think they want the consequences of not making a deal," Trump said.
Prior to the US joining Israel in striking Iranian nuclear sites in June, Iran-US nuclear talks had stalled over Washington's demand that Tehran forgo enrichment on its soil, which the US views as a pathway to an Iranian nuclear weapon.
Iran's civil defense organization on Monday held a chemical defense drill in the Pars Special Economic Energy Zone to strengthen preparedness for potential chemical incidents in the energy hub located in southern Iran.
Additionally, it was reported on Sunday that just days before Tuesday’s meeting in Geneva between Trump’s envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner and Iran’s foreign minister, officials in both the US and Israel assess that the chances of a deal between Iran and the US are slim.
The Iranian foreign minister, leading a delegation of representatives from political, legal, technical, and economic fields, is expected to meet with International Atomic Energy Agency chief Rafael Grossi on Monday, who would oversee any nuclear agreement to ensure compliance.
Iran’s Deputy Foreign Minister Majid Takht-Ravanchi said in an interview with the BBC that Iran is willing to consider concessions to reach a nuclear deal with the United States if Washington shows readiness to discuss lifting sanctions.

With wide open eyes, three-month-old Issa lifted his head inquisitively before resting his black hair on his father's shoulder. On Monday, February 16, the baby was brought in for his weekly check-up at the Mulhouse South Alsace Regional Hospital Group. "He is doing very well, he is developing optimally for his age (…). He feeds well, breathes without difficulty, and gives us beautiful smiles," said his pediatric hematologist Alexandra Spiegel Bouhadid during a press conference.
While Issa seemed oblivious, his parents, Sina and Viviane (whose family name has not been disclosed), along with the health team caring for him, were fully aware of the medical achievement that enabled his smooth birth and current good health. During the third trimester of pregnancy, a midwife detected an abnormality by ultrasound. Alerted, Professor Edgar Montoya, head of the Women-Mother-Child Department at the hospital group, identified a rapidly growing 9-centimeter tumor located in the head and neck area.
The team then consulted Professor Laurent Guibaud from the reference center for superficial vascular anomalies at Hospices Civils de Lyon. He recommended the use of sirolimus. Traditionally used to prevent organ rejection after transplants, since 2023, under Professor Guibaud's leadership, sirolimus has also been used to treat blood vessel malformations in utero.

Trump says he will be involved indirectly in Iran nuclear talks, warns of ‘consequences’

ABOARD AIR FORCE ONE - United States President Donald Trump said on Feb 16 that he would be involved “indirectly” in talks between Iran and the US over Tehran’s nuclear programme
“I’ll be involved in those talks, indirectly. And they’ll be very important,” Mr Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One.
Tensions are soaring ahead of the talks, with the US deploying a second aircraft carrier to the Middle East. The US military is preparing for the possibility of a sustained military campaign if the talks do not succeed, US officials have told Reuters.
Asked about the prospects for a deal, Mr Trump said Iran sought tough negotiations but learnt the consequences of such a hardened stance last summer when the US bombed Iranian nuclear sites.
Mr Trump suggested Iranians were motivated this time to negotiate.
“I don't think they want the consequences of not making a deal,” Mr Trump said.
Washington pushes Tehran to forgo enrichment
Prior to the US strikes in June, US-Iran nuclear talks had stalled over Washington’s demand that Tehran forgo enrichment on its soil, which the US views as a pathway to an Iranian nuclear weapon.
“We could have had a deal instead of sending the B-2s in to knock out their nuclear potential. And we had to send the B-2s,” Mr Trump said, referring to the bat-winged US stealth bombers that carried out the bombings.
“I hope they’re going to be more reasonable.”
The remarks contrast with those by the US President on Feb 13, when he embraced potential regime change in Iran and lamented decades of failed talks.
Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi met with the United Nations nuclear watchdog chief on Feb 16, saying in a post on X he was in Geneva to “achieve a fair and equitable deal”.
“What is not on the table: submission before threats,” Mr Araqchi said.
Questions about uranium stockpile
The International Atomic Energy Agency has been calling on Iran for months to say what happened to its stockpile of 440kg of highly enriched uranium following Israeli-US strikes and let inspections fully resume, including in three key sites that were bombed in June 2025: Natanz, Fordow and Isfahan.
Iran has repeatedly threatened to close the Strait of Hormuz in retaliation against any attack, which would choke a fifth of global oil flows and send crude prices sharply higher.
Iran held a military drill on Feb 16 in the Strait of Hormuz, a vital international waterway and oil export route from Gulf Arab states, which have been appealing for diplomacy to end the dispute.
Despite Mr Trump’s comments about Iran seeking a deal, the talks face major potential stumbling blocks.
Washington has sought to expand the scope of talks to non-nuclear issues such as Iran’s missile stockpile.
Tehran says it is only willing to discuss curbs on its nuclear programme in exchange for sanctions relief and will not accept zero uranium enrichment. It says its missile capabilities are off the table.
Speaking during a visit to Hungary on Feb 16, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said reaching a deal with Tehran would be hard.
“I think that there’s an opportunity here to diplomatically reach an agreement... but I don’t want to overstate it either,” Mr Rubio said.
“It’s going to be hard. It’s been very difficult for anyone to do real deals with Iran, because we’re dealing with radical Shia clerics who are making theological decisions, not geopolitical ones.”

Protest marches can return to city, eastern suburbs, police declare

Protest marches can return to city, eastern suburbs, police declare
Restrictions on protest marches in Sydney’s CBD and eastern suburbs enacted in the wake of the Bondi terror attack have been lifted amid a probe into police behaviour at last week’s rally.
NSW Police Commissioner Mal Lanyon announced on Tuesday that the public assembly restriction declaration had expired and would not be extended, opening the doors for protest marches to resume in previously restricted areas.
“Whilst the public assembly restriction declaration has been lifted today, can I say I want the community to consider and respect others,” Lanyon said.
Protest groups wishing to march through the streets can now resume making applications as usual, which can be challenged in the courts if police believe there is a threat to public safety.
The decision comes after the police watchdog announced an investigation into the actions of police at a protest against the visit of Israeli President Isaac Herzog last week.
Lanyon said the violent scenes had “very little” bearing on his decision not to continue with the restrictions.
“I had significant concerns about the safety of the community in managing the visit of a head of state, the movement of Jewish Australians who were there to see that head of state, but also the rights of people to protest,” Lanyon said.
“I’m satisfied the conditions that led to the extension last time do not exist now.”
The Law Enforcement Conduct Commission investigation was sparked by a significant number of complaints of heavy-handedness, including vision of police officers physically moving Muslim worshippers while they were bowed for evening prayers.
Another video captured the moment officers held a protester to the ground, punching the person at least 18 times. Police allege the protester bit an officer on the thumb.
The organiser of the rally, the Palestine Action Group, is planning another protest this Sunday at Hyde Park. Police had asked the group to hold last week’s rally at Hyde Park, which was outside the restriction area, but protesters instead insisted on gathering at Town Hall.
The protest restrictions were introduced by the state government just days after the Bondi massacre in December, giving the police commissioner the power to seal off parts of the state from protest marches up to three months after a terror attack.
Activists are mounting a legal challenge to the law arguing it is unconstitutional, and infringes upon the implied right to freedom of political communication. A hearing will be held later this month.

Iran's civil defense organisation on Monday held a chemical defense drill in the Pars Special Economic Energy Zone to strengthen preparedness for potential chemical incidents in the energy hub located in southern Iran.
Indirect nuclear diplomacy
Iran and the US resumed their indirect nuclear diplomacy in Muscat on Feb. 6 under Omani mediation, nearly eight months after talks were suspended following an Israeli attack on Iran that sparked a 12-day war.
Assessments from both sides were positive following the latest round of talks, which took place amid heightened tensions due to a US military buildup in the Persian Gulf region.
Uranium enrichment remains a key point of contention. Iran demands the lifting of Western economic sanctions in exchange for restricting its nuclear activities.
The US, meanwhile, has called on Iran to fully halt enrichment and transfer its stockpile of highly enriched uranium abroad.
Washington has also sought to expand the scope of talks to include Iran’s ballistic missile program and its support for armed groups in the region, while Tehran has repeatedly said it will negotiate only on its nuclear programme.

Former Wagner operatives help Russia organize sabotage across Europe – FT

Former Wagner operatives help Russia organize sabotage across Europe – FT
The Financial Times (FT) stated this in an article, according to Ukrinform.
The status of Wagner members has remained uncertain since June 2023, following a failed mutiny against Russia's top military leadership that led to repression and the death of the group's founder, Yevgeny Prigozhin. However, Wagner recruiters who previously specialized in enlisting men from remote Russian regions to fight in Ukraine have reportedly been given a new task – recruiting economically vulnerable Europeans to carry out sabotage operations on NATO territory, officials say.
Over the past two years, the Kremlin has expanded a campaign of destabilization and sabotage across Europe aimed at undermining Western support for Ukraine and fueling social unrest. After facing a significant reduction in covert agents following waves of diplomatic expulsions from European capitals, Russia's military intelligence agency, the GRU, and the Federal Security Service (FSB) have increasingly relied on former Wagner personnel to recruit so-called "disposable" agents for missions in Europe, Western officials said.
According to senior European intelligence officials, operatives receive assignments ranging from setting fire to politicians' cars and warehouses storing aid for Ukraine to posing as Nazi propagandists. Recruited individuals are typically paid, often marginalized, and sometimes lacking a clear sense of purpose. Wagner already had an established network of propagandists and recruiters who "speak their language," one European official noted.
Russian intelligence services usually try to maintain at least two "intermediary" layers between themselves and the agents they seek to recruit, the official added.
The FSB, meanwhile, has traditionally turned to criminal networks and segments of the Russian diaspora in neighboring countries, though these channels have proven less effective for large-scale recruitment, sources told the newspaper.
Active recruitment of Europeans has been facilitated by Wagner's significant online presence and that of its supporters on social media. The group's Telegram channels, in particular, were described as surprisingly skillfully and professionally designed, according to another European official.
Prigozhin previously oversaw Russia's most notorious "troll factory" in St. Petersburg, which began spreading disinformation to Western audiences more than a decade ago.
The role of Wagner's network in Russia's sabotage campaign has been under close scrutiny by European intelligence and security services from the outset. Social media accounts linked to Wagner were reportedly involved in recruiting a group of British nationals in late 2023 who set fire to a warehouse in East London storing aid for Ukraine.
Following that incident, European agencies uncovered a much broader network of Wagner-linked "disposable" agents across Europe. Western security officials say they currently hold an advantage: although Russian recruiters benefit from scale and lower costs by using Wagner networks to enlist amateur saboteurs, they lack professionalism and operational secrecy. More attacks have reportedly been thwarted than successfully carried out.
As previously reported, Russia continues to strengthen ties with African states, sending officials to the continent who can no longer be posted to Western countries.

US judge orders Trump administration to restore Philadelphia slavery exhibit

09:22:26 KST

A federal judge in Pennsylvania on Monday ordered the National Park Service to reinstall a slavery exhibit at a Philadelphia historic site, pending the outcome of ongoing litigation after the city sued the federal government over its removal.
The National Park Service last month dismantled and removed a long-established slavery-related exhibit at the Independence National Historical park, which holds the former residence of George Washington, in response to Donald Trump’s claims, which have been rejected by civil rights groups, of “anti-American ideology” at historical and cultural institutions.
The city of Philadelphia sued over the matter, accusing the Department of the Interior, which oversees the National Park Service, and top officials of breaking the law and asking a judge to restore the exhibit.
On Monday, a federal judge in Pennsylvania, Cynthia Rufe, granted the city’s request to temporarily block the federal government’s changes and ordered the National Park Service to restore the exhibit pending the outcome of litigation.
Rufe, who was appointed by George W Bush, began her ruling with a quote from a section of George Orwell’s 1984 which described the process by which the authoritarian party in the novel conducted a constant rewriting of past editions of newspapers – as well as “books, periodicals, pamphlets, posters, leaflets, films, sound-tracks, cartoons, photographs” – to erase any uncomfortable facts from history.
The judge then drew an explicit comparison between the world of the novel and the Trump administration in the first lines of her opinion. “As if the Ministry of Truth in George Orwell’s 1984 now existed, with its motto ‘Ignorance is Strength,’ this Court is now asked to determine whether the federal government has the power it claims – to dissemble and disassemble historical truths when it has some domain over historical facts,” Rufe wrote. “It does not.”
Rufe’s order granted the city’s request to require the federal government to “restore the President’s House Site to its physical status as of January 21, 2026”, which is the day before the exhibit was removed.
During a hearing last month, the Philadelphia Inquirer reported, Rufe called the Trump administration’s argument that a president could unilaterally order changes to exhibits displayed in national parks both “horrifying” and “dangerous”.
The judge also devoted a passage of her opinion on Monday to explaining how and why the historical exhibition on slavery was added to the site.
“At the turn of this century, historians identified the location of the first official residence of the President of the United States, where Presidents Washington and Adams lived during their terms,” Rufe wrote. “This historical research also identified information about nine enslaved Africans whom President Washington owned, brought to the official presidential residence, and rotated in and out of Pennsylvania, a practice which prevented enslaved individuals from petitioning for their freedom under Pennsylvania law.”
“Etched into a wall within the President’s House exhibit are the names of those nine enslaved individuals: Oney Judge, Austin, Christopher Sheels, Giles, Hercules Posey, Joe Richardson, Moll, Paris, and Richmond,” the judge continued. “Of those nine, Oney Judge escaped the house in 1796, eventually making her way to New Hampshire. Hercules also eventually escaped his enslavement after he was brought to Mount Vernon.”
Neither the National Park Service nor the city of Philadelphia responded immediately to requests for comment on the judge’s order.

Arizona women sue AI startup coach for allegedly using their social media images to make deepfake porn
The lawsuit names three men it claims ‘monetized’ strangers’ likenesses to create erotic chatbots — while also selling their methods to wannabe AI entrepreneurs

Three women in their 20s in Arizona have sued a network of AI entrepreneurs for allegedly using their photos to make deepfake pornography without their consent.
In a complaint filed in Maricopa County last month, the women — named only as "M.G.", "H.R.", and "H.B." in order to preserve their privacy — have accused Instagram influencer Beau Schultz and two other men of "monetizing" their likenesses by using them as the basis for sexualized AI chatbots.
The men then allegedly sold subscriptions to access these erotic chatbots while bragging on social media about the money they made and offering to teach others to do the same.
"My bosses, future employers, people that I don’t know, and people that I do know are looking at me in a different light that I don’t want to be looked in," one of the plaintiffs told local news site AZ Family.
The lawsuit names Schultz, two other men, and four companies it claims are associated with them.
Schultz did not respond to requests for comment from The Independent. The Independent has attempted to find contact information for others listed in the lawsuit.
According to the women’s attorney Nick Brand, the defendants adopted — and marketed — a simple playbook for making money from stranger's photos.
"Step one of the process is find a girl you like on Instagram. Take 8-10 of her pictures, feed it into their AI platform that they also own," Brand told Fox 4 Kansas City.
The resulting AI character would then be hosted on a subscription porn site, sending erotic messages back and forth with paying customers.
One plaintiff, who moved to Arizona from Kansas City, told Fox 4 she had simply shared "innocent, normal pictures of [herself]... doing daily stuff, selfies."
She said the use of her photos had left her "scared and defeated", giving her "a lot of anxiety" and "a lot of frustration and heartbreak."
Schultz's Instagram page features numerous AI-generated photos and videos of scantily-clad women, plus photos of sports cars and private jets, billing himself as "turning AI into income.”
One Instagram post describes his "blueprint" for how his 46,000 followers can quit their jobs if they just persuade 400 people to pay them $10 a month.
An associated Telegram channel offers users paid tools to make money using AI, plus a two week "boot camp" and a build-to-order service.
"Build a unique AI persona using the generator platform. Train your model with 8-10 high-quality reference photos. Generate hyper-realistic lifestyle and social content," says one post on Instagram.
"[Then] post daily on IG & TikTok to drive organic traffic. Funnel users to an exclusive page with tiered pricing. Use AI automation to manage your DMs and scheduling..."
"Comment 'AI' and I’ll send you the step-by-step breakdown on how to start today."
Court records do not yet list a response from any of the defendants.

New Mexico approves comprehensive probe of Epstein’s Zorro Ranch

SANTA FE, Feb 16 - New Mexico lawmakers on Monday passed legislation to launch what they said was the first full investigation into what happened at Zorro Ranch, where the late U.S. sex offender Jeffrey Epstein is accused of trafficking and sexually assaulting girls and women.
A bipartisan committee will seek testimony from survivors of alleged sexual abuse at the ranch, located about 30 miles south of Santa Fe, the state capital. Legislators are also urging local residents to testify.
Epstein died in what was ruled a suicide in a New York jail in 2019 while facing federal sex trafficking charges.
The so-called truth commission, comprising four lawmakers, seeks to identify ranch guests and state officials who may have known what was going on at the 7,600-acre property, or taken part in alleged sexual abuse in its hacienda-style mansion and guest houses.
The Democratic-led investigation adds to political pressure to uncover Epstein's crimes that has become a major challenge for President Donald Trump, weeks after the Justice Department released millions of Epstein-related files that shed new light on activities at the ranch.
The files reveal ties between Epstein and two former Democratic governors and an attorney general of New Mexico.
The legislation, which passed New Mexico's House of Representatives by a unanimous vote, could pose risks to any additional politicians linked to Epstein in the Democratic-run state, as well as scientists, investors and other high-profile individuals who visited the ranch.
The $2.5 million investigation, which has subpoena power, aims to close gaps in New Mexico law that may have allowed Epstein to operate in the state. The committee starts work on Tuesday, and will deliver interim findings in July and a final report by year-end.
"He was basically doing anything he wanted in this state without any accountability whatsoever," said New Mexico state Representative Andrea Romero, a Democrat, who co-sponsored the initiative.
Testimony to the committee could be used for future prosecutions, she said.
Victim advocates applauded the move, saying Zorro Ranch had been overlooked by federal investigations that focused on Epstein's Caribbean island and New York townhouse.
"Many of the survivors had experiences in New Mexico, and as we've learned, you know, there were local politicians and other people that were aware of what was happening in New Mexico," said attorney Sigrid McCawley, whose law firm has represented hundreds of Epstein survivors.
They include the late Virginia Giuffre, who was abused many times at the ranch, she said.
The U.S. Department of Justice passed a request for comment to the FBI. The FBI declined comment.
EPSTEIN OPERATED AT THE RANCH FOR DECADES
Several civil suits accuse Epstein of sexually assaulting girls at Zorro Ranch. He was never charged for the alleged offenses.
Romero said there was no record of federal law enforcement searching what was known locally as "the playboy ranch" where Epstein is accused of sexually abusing a 16-year-old girl as early as 1996.
Former New Mexico Attorney General Hector Balderas launched a probe in 2019 that was put on hold at the request of federal prosecutors to avoid "parallel investigation," he said in a statement.
New Mexico Attorney General Raul Torrez has assigned a special agent to probe allegations that may come through the truth commission, spokesperson Lauren Rodriguez said.
A state house committee rejected accompanying legislation to extend New Mexico's statute of limitations for childhood sexual assault to allow civil actions by Epstein survivors, said state Representative Marianna Anaya, who co-sponsored the legislation to create the truth commission. The legislation raised concerns about increased insurance costs for public institutions facing abuse lawsuits, Anaya said.
Epstein bought the ranch in 1993 from Bruce King, a three-time New Mexico Democratic governor who died in 2009. Epstein's estate sold the property in 2023 to Texas businessman and politician Don Huffines, according to the Santa Fe New Mexican. Huffines is prepared to cooperate with any law enforcement investigation of the ranch, the newspaper reported on Monday, citing his spokesperson.
Epstein flew in guests and "masseuses" to the ranch, and hired local massage therapists to work there, ranch manager Brice Gordon told the FBI in 2007, according to a report in the Epstein files.
In an unsealed 2016 court deposition, Giuffre testified Epstein's partner Ghislaine Maxwell told her to give the late former New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson a "massage" at the ranch. In Giuffre's memoir, she said an instruction from Maxwell to provide a "massage" meant a victim should provide a sexual encounter to an abuser.
Richardson's representative Madeleine Mahoney in a 2019 statement said Giuffre's allegations were "completely false."
Gordon told the FBI that most of the masseuses Epstein used at the ranch were hired locally through the spa Ten Thousand Waves, a Santa Fe institution, or by referrals.
Spa spokesperson Sara Bean said in a phone interview last Tuesday that Ten Thousand Waves neither provided nor referred masseuses to Zorro Ranch.
In the documentary "Surviving Jeffrey Epstein," former Santa Fe massage therapist Rachel Benavidez accused Epstein of sexual abuse when she was hired to work at the ranch.
Investment consultant Joshua Ramo said on Sunday he visited the ranch once for a 2014 lunch on behalf of professors from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard University, who were present. Ramo, at the time CEO of consulting firm Kissinger Associates, said he and Epstein met with business figures and scientists around 14 times in New York between 2013 and 2016.
"I deferred to the due diligence of the institutions involved, assuming that his presence signaled he had been appropriately vetted," Ramo, in a statement, said of his ranch visit and other meetings with Epstein. "I feel a deep sense of grief for the survivors of his crimes."
Emails show Epstein contacted Ramo in 2015 to tell him he was going to Ten Thousand Waves, suggesting they meet for lunch in Santa Fe. Ramo responded, "I assumed we were meeting at the pink bottom ranch." Ramo, who is currently CEO of consulting firm Sornay LLC, said he had no recollection of that comment, or whether the two met that day.
Over the years, Epstein contributed to the political campaigns of New Mexico Democrats such as Richardson and King's son Gary King, a former New Mexico attorney general. When contributions were reported in the press, the men pledged to either return the money, or give it to charity.
Gary King flew on a plane chartered by Epstein when he was running for New Mexico governor in 2014, according to emails in the Epstein files. Epstein said he would cover around half the cost of the $22,000 charter and King would pay the rest. King did not respond to a request for comment. REUTERS

3 dead, 3 critically injured in shooting at high school hockey game in Rhode Island

RHODE ISLAND - Gunfire erupted at an ice-skating rink in Pawtucket, Rhode Island, during a high school hockey game on Feb 16, leaving three people dead, including the shooter, authorities said.
The shooting, which happened around 2.30pm (3.30am, Singapore time) at the Dennis M. Lynch Arena, left three other people in serious condition.
A motive for the shooting was not known, though it appeared to arise from a family dispute, chief Tina Goncalves of the Pawtucket Police Department said at a news conference, calling it a “targeted event”.
The two people killed appeared to be adults, according to Goncalves.
The two teams set to compete on Feb 16, Blackstone Valley Schools and Coventry Public Schools, were made up of players from multiple area schools.
“It was a senior night, a time for them to celebrate and remember,” Ms Goncalves said. “And it’s very unfortunate that this happened today.”
Mr Donald R. Grebien, the Pawtucket mayor, said the chaotic scene inside the rink was a frightening ordeal.
“Of course, when you get the call, you think it’s the worst thing,” Mr Grebien said during the news conference. “These are high school kids. They were playing with their families watching, a fun time, and it turned into this. So it’s got to be traumatic.”
Law enforcement officials said that they would work with the schools to offer counselling services for the students who escaped the shooting.
“Obviously, you know, it’s going to all settle in probably later tonight or tomorrow for them,” Ms Goncalves said.
As one of the teams was trying to break out of its defensive zone with the puck, a burst of gunfire echoed inside the arena, a video stream of the game showed.
Players on the benches began ducking for cover behind the boards. On the ice, the referee blew his whistle to stop the game and skated off the ice.
Within seconds, the benches emptied, with the teams hopping over the boards and skating toward exits on the other side of the rink.
Both the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Firearms, Tobacco and Explosives said on social media that it was sending agents to the scene of the shooting. Police in Providence said they sent officers to the scene to provide help.
The neighborhood around the ice rink is blue collar Rhode Island, a neighborhood of squat residential homes built in the shadow of the Industrial Revolution.
A mural on the side of the arena where the shooting happened celebrates the growth of the American textile industry, which started in earnest in Pawtucket.
“At the dawn of a new century the most amazing improvements had still yet to be realized,” a quote above the rink’s high school hockey player entrance reads.
By sunset on Feb 16, police officers still ambled up and down the streets around the rink and helicopters circled overhead.
Mr Don Cowart, superintendent of the Coventry Public School District, said in a statement on Feb 16 that all students on the hockey team who were at the rink during the shooting were safe and had been accounted for.
“An officer from the Coventry Police Department is on scene and remains with the students,” Mr Cowart said. “We are grateful for the swift response of first responders and arena personnel.”
Representative Gabe Amo, who grew up in Pawtucket, urged people in a post on the social media platform X to avoid the area of the shooting.
“My thoughts are with the victims of the shooting in Pawtucket,” Mr Amo wrote. “Grateful to our law enforcement and first responders for acting swiftly.”
The Providence Bruins, the American Hockey League affiliate of the Boston Bruins, offered its support to the community and praised emergency responders on social media.
The shooting comes about two months after Rhode Island was rattled by a separate attack at Brown University that killed two students, wounded nine others, and set off a dayslong search.
Investigators said the assailant in that attack also killed an MIT professor before fatally shooting himself inside a storage facility in Salem, New Hampshire. NYTIMES

Trump takes aim at Democratic Maryland Governor Wes Moore over massive sewage spill in the Potomac River
Crews have still not finished repairing wastewater infrastructure after an aging sewer line burst in January

- CommentsGo to comments
President Trump said the Federal Emergency Management Agency will take on a “key role” in responding to January’s sewage spill in the Potomac River, slamming long-time critic Gov. Wes Moore of Maryland for the “ecological disaster.”
“There is a massive Ecological Disaster unfolding in the Potomac River as a result of the Gross Mismanagement of Local Democrat Leaders, particularly, Governor Wes Moore, of Maryland,” Trump wrote on Truth Social on Monday.
“This is the same Governor who cannot rebuild a Bridge,” he added, a reference to the ongoing, increasingly expensive and delayed rebuilding of Baltimore’s ruined Francis Scott Key Bridge. “It is clear Local Authorities cannot adequately handle this calamity.”
The president’s statement also argued the incident, one of the worst sewage spills in U.S. history, was a result of Democratic leaders carrying out a “War on Merit.”
Republicans have claimed without evidence that recent disasters like the Los Angeles fires were a result of people of color leading key departments. Moore is the nation’s only sitting Black governor.
Moore’s office says the federal government is responsible for regulating the Potomac Interceptor, a part of the regional sewage treatment system where a 60-year-old pipe in Cabin John, Maryland, burst last month and has since spewed an estimated 243 million gallons of wastewater into the river.
“Where the president has failed to act, Maryland has played its part to protect residents, protect drinking water, and ensure accountability,” Ammar Moussa, a spokesperson for Moore, told Politico. “Maryland officials were on site within hours of the leak to do our part to coordinate the response, and ensure the public was aware and protected.”
Moore’s office alleged that federal officials “explicitly refused” to join a legislative hearing Friday on the crisis with local and state agencies.
Local officials have completed a temporary bypass system to put wastewater back into the sewage system. They estimate full repairs could take as long as nine months.
Trump plans to deploy FEMA come as the agency’s near- and long-term future is uncertain.
FEMA is a part of the Department of Homeland Security, whose funding lapsed over the weekend as Democratic lawmakers pushed to put new restrictions on the president’s immigration crackdown, whose key agencies, like ICE and Border Patrol, are also a part of DHS.
The disaster agency has multiple pools of funding and will be able to continue operating during the partial shutdown.
The Trump administration has floated shutting down or drastically reorganizing FEMA. The agency has reportedly drafted plans to cut thousands of workers, the Washington Post reported last month.
Moore and Trump have sparred before.
The president went out of his way to exclude Democrats, including Moore, for an upcoming, normally bipartisan annual gathering of U.S. governors at the White House.
“As the nation’s only Black governor, I can’t ignore that being singled out for exclusion from this bipartisan tradition carries an added weight — whether that was the intent or not,” Moore said of the move, calling the choice a sign of “blatant disrespect and a snub to the spirit of bipartisan federal-state partnership.”
Trump later said he was inviting most Democrats to the meeting but was still excluding Moore.
The Maryland governor previously pushed back against Donald Trump’s threat to send the National Guard to Baltimore to fight crime, prompting Trump to threaten to withhold funding to rebuild the Francis Scott Key Bridge, which was destroyed in 2024 when a ship collided with it.

‘Screaming for her life’: One dead, two critical in western Sydney stabbing

‘Harrowing’ scenes as bystanders rush to aid of Sydney stabbing rampage victims
Updated ,first published
Witnesses have described a terrifying scream, pedestrians sprinting from danger and others rushing to help bleeding victims after a random stabbing attack that left one person dead and two in a critical condition in western Sydney.
Police were called to Merrylands Road, Merrylands, just after 10am on Tuesday, with witnesses saying a man had stabbed multiple people with a large kitchen knife before fleeing on foot.
The rampage spread from one end of the block to another, with the crime scene spanning about 50 metres.
CCTV footage published by Nine News showed the man running along a path next to the train tracks shortly after the alleged attacks. Terrified, a woman pushing a pram in front of him started running to get away before he passed her.
One attack occurred in or outside Bina’s Nepalese grocery store on Merrylands Road, just doors down from Granville MP Julia Finn’s office. Medical equipment and police forensic markers were dotted along the street.
Paramedics treated three people. A man aged between 30 and 40 years old died at the scene. He is yet to be formally identified. Two others, a woman aged 47 and a man aged 22, were taken to hospital in a critical condition.
Joseph Roussini, 59, called Triple Zero after hearing a woman “screaming for her life”.
“I could see a man and a lady coming out of the shop, and the man was holding the lady by the neck, and there was blood pouring out of her neck, and he was trying to stop the bleeding,” he said.
“[She] was in a terrible state.”
He said bystanders rushed to help and every “second felt like a year” waiting for paramedics.
One shop owner said he heard a scream and saw people “sprinting” down the street. Another woman, who asked not to be identified, said she saw dark police cars cruising along the street shortly after the incident, with helicopters circling above.
“It was really harrowing,” she said. “I don’t feel safe.”
None of the victims were related to the others.
Riot police scoured the area, marching through gardens and knocking on doors.
A 25-year-old man known to police for mental health incidents was arrested in a backyard on nearby Smythe Street following a nearly 40-minute manhunt. He was taken to Granville Police Station and is expected to be charged later on Tuesday.
Footage released by NSW Police showed the man, handcuffed and barefoot, being led from the police wagon into the station.
Superintendent Simon Glasser said police quickly locked down the area, but it took around 40 minutes to locate the alleged offender.
Glasser said the man was known to police for petty crime and a number of mental health incidents.
“It was highly confronting. It’s a horrible offence to have taken place,” Glasser said.
Police also located a kitchen knife with a 20-30 centimetre blade near the scene which they believe was used in the attack.

‘Everyone needs to see the faces of the rapists’: Gisèle Pelicot’s memoir reveals moment she went for public trial
Tara Cobham looks at Pelicot’s narrative ‘A Hymn to Life’, which details her ordeal in France’s most shocking mass rape case
- Bookmark
Gisèle Pelicot has opened up about the moment she decided to bravely waive her anonymity and have a public trial, paving the way for France’s most shocking mass rape case.
Ms Pelicot’s newly released memoir, A Hymn to Life, details the harrowing ordeal she suffered after discovering her then-husband drugged then raped her while unconscious, along with dozens of men he had recruited online.
In the book, written with journalist Judith Perrignon, the now 73-year-old recalls the moment her “brain shut down” as police told her what Dominique Pelicot and 51 other attackers had done.
She also speaks of the intense media coverage surrounding her case, highlighting how she was often described as “dignified” and an “icon”, words she appears to feel ambivalent about – although she feels strongly about offering “my experience as an example and my name as a battle flag” to help other women.
“Here I am, in my seventies, a martyr, the symbol of a new feminist wave that I hardly know a thing about,” she writes in the memoir, which went on sale on Tuesday.
Among the revelations in the book, Ms Pelicot goes on to explain that she still wants to visit her husband in prison in her quest for answers.
He and the other men were jailed for a total of 428 years in 2024, after 47 of them were found guilty of rape, two were found guilty of attempted rape, and two were found guilty of sexual assault.
Speaking about her decision to waive her anonymity, Ms Pelicot writes: “I didn’t want to be alone any more. So many strangers had shown me such kindness, made me feel welcome when I had nothing left. I wasn’t scared of being seen now, of people knowing.
“’Shame has to change sides’ – the words I’d first heard over a decade ago, a slogan supporting women who had survived rape and domestic violence, came into my head like a refrain, as if tiny blades were honing my thoughts. Everyone needs to see the faces of the rapists. They should be the ones to hang their heads in shame, not me.”
Rejecting a closed hearing, the norm for sexual offence trials, would “change everything”, she remembers being told by her lawyers Stéphane Babonneau and Antoine Camus.
To prepare for the trial, Ms Pelicot says she had to view the horrific videos of the attacks, taken from her then-husband’s devices, that she had so far avoided watching. She recalls seeing her body as a “corpse” and “doll made of flesh and blood”, saying: “I didn’t see my life there. They had chased it away, driven it out of my body.”
She reflects then on the world-shattering moment when she was first told by police what had happened to her. In both instances, she says she kept thinking, “It happened to me, but it wasn’t me.”
Ms Pelicot initially believed she was at the police station on 2 November 2020 because her then-husband had been summoned by police after a supermarket security guard caught him secretly taking videos up women’s skirts.
The officer gently revealed the real reason why Ms Pelicot was there and began by asking her questions such as what her then-husband’s character was like, with her describing him initially as “a lovely guy”.
He then asked whether the couple ever swapped partners. “I heard myself stammering that swinging was inconceivable for me,” she said. “I couldn’t bear other men touching me. I needed feelings.”
Then the officer warned her: “I am going to show you photos and videos that are not going to please you.” After that, her world fell apart.
She recalls: “The officer says a number. He tells me fifty-three men had come to my house to rape me. I ask for water. My mouth is paralysed.” She recalls being unable to believe the inert woman in the photos was her.
Later, she remembers lying in bed awake at night, “so angry that I hadn’t noticed anything” and going over memories, including a moment when she believes she came close to discovering the truth, back in 2013.
She says she noticed some “odd, discoloured blotches like splashes of bleach, indelible, inexplicable” on trousers she had recently bought and joked to Pelicot: “You haven’t been drugging me, have you?”
“He burst into tears. ‘How could you possibly say such a thing?’ I was instantly overcome with guilt. He was hurt. I immediately apologised.”
Ms Pelicot is still grappling with unanswered questions to this day. Her husband was found guilty on all charges and given the maximum possible sentence of 20 years in prison.
She writes: “I need answers; he owes me that much. I will talk to the man I used to think I was married to. If he is still there, he will answer me. What does he have to lose, given that he is going to spend the rest of his life in prison?
“And if, in fact, that man vanished a long time ago, if all that remains of him is his pathological need for power and manipulation, I will sense that too. Either way, it will help me move on.”
She has particular questions around two cold cases she was informed in 2022 her then-husband was a suspect in, one an attempted rape he later admitted to, and another, a murder, which he denies.
She also wants answers surrounding their daughter Caroline Darian, after Pelicot was found guilty of recording and disseminating images of a sexual nature of her.
Ms Pelicot writes: “The photographs are abject, showing her father’s unbearable incestuous gaze on his daughter while she slept.”
The case put the entire family’s relationships under immense strain, but especially that of mother and daughter. In her own book her daughter released last year, I’ll Never Call Him Dad Again, Ms Darian said she felt she was the “forgotten” victim of the trial.
Her father denied sexually assaulting or raping his daughter during the trial. Ms Pelicot declined to answer when she was asked in court if she supported her daughter’s claims.
Ms Darian went on to accuse her mother of “abandoning her” by not supporting her own allegations and in interviews last year says she no longer speaks to her mother often as a result.
But the family is slowly healing, according to Ms Pelicot, while adding she has built a wider web of supporters around her.
She describes her female friendships as being crucial during this period, while the crowds of women who cheered her on outside the courthouse in Avignon “saved me”.
The number of supporters grew and grew over the course of the trial, until the French grandmother became the symbol of a global movement, embodying her powerful message that it is the perpetrators who should feel shame for sexual crimes – and refusing to be reduced to being a victim.
In her concluding remarks, she writes: “I suppose that’s why I decided to brave the court. Everyone was expecting to see a wreck of a woman arrive. But that was not what happened.
“I still knew why I had been in love with Dominique and, as I told the court, I will probably spend the rest of my life puzzling through my memories in order to salvage a few good ones.
“I will never be reduced to my tortured body; that is not where my soul is, it’s not who I was as a girl, nor is it the woman I have become.”

Violent clashes erupt in Bnei Brak over internal Haredi dispute, one day after riots over soldiers

A day after riots erupted following the arrival of two female soldiers in the city, violent clashes continued for several hours Monday evening in Bnei Brak — this time over an internal dispute within the ultra-Orthodox community.
Watch footage from the unrest:
Ultra-Orthodox residents have for some time been criticizing the Vizhnitz Center Hasidic group, a small community that split from the larger Vizhnitz Hasidic dynasty. The group reportedly demands absolute self-nullification before its rebbe and extreme faith in him, drawing opposition from many within the broader Haredi public.
On Monday, a protest was organized against the small Hasidic faction, but it escalated into clashes, property damage, roadblocks and the throwing of objects. The disturbances began in the afternoon and continued into the evening hours. Police forces who arrived to quell the unrest were themselves attacked with objects, eggs and even a fire extinguisher sprayed at officers.
Although the protest against the faction officially ended at 3:00 p.m., youths and teenagers later exploited the gathering to intensify the violence, not necessarily directed at the same group. Rioting was reported at several locations across the city.
“In recent hours, uncontrolled and unsupervised protests and demonstrations have taken place in the city, constituting an educational disaster for the souls of our children," Bnei Brak Mayor Rabbi Hanoch Zeibert said. "These demonstrations stem from a handful of fringe individuals who drag members of the younger generation into acts whose consequences no one can foresee. At the same time, the police are operating on the ground to prevent these irresponsible events from taking place in our city. I ask every parent to take responsibility for themselves and their family and ensure that no member of their immediate family is present in these areas that are dangerous from an educational standpoint.”
He added: “Violence is not our way. Venting rage is contrary to our values, and we cannot accept actions that contradict the Torah and Jewish law. Our role is to ensure that our city remains safe spiritually and physically, with God’s help. Dear parents, guard your children — your treasures — with utmost care. The place for these treasures is not in the street.”
Defense Minister Israel Katz had planned to visit Bnei Brak Monday evening to pay a condolence call at the home of Haredi political activist Moti Babchik, whose father had died. However, security officials advised him not to come due to fears of unrest directed at him, amid the previous day’s riots.
The earlier violence erupted after two female soldiers arrived in the city to conduct a home visit as part of their welfare duties in the Israel Defense Forces. A rumor spread among residents that the soldiers were delivering draft notices, triggering the escalation. During the clashes, three police officers were injured, stun grenades were used against rioters and a helicopter was deployed. In one incident, a man pushing a baby stroller was filmed walking near officers who were throwing stun grenades and shouting at them to stop. A police motorcycle was set on fire, and a patrol car was overturned.
Tel Aviv District Police Commander Haim Sargarof criticized the military at the scene of the unrest. “The army must coordinate with us before entering the city,” he said. “When they enter without coordinating, we are left to react.” He added that police are using camera footage to identify rioters. “We reached the person who set the motorcycle on fire. We need to carry out arrests, and we need to restore calm for the residents, who need to know there will be zero tolerance for disorder,” he said.
IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir spoke Sunday with the two soldiers to express support. “I asked to speak with you to tell you that the IDF and I stand fully and clearly behind you. No one is permitted to harm your dignity or interfere with the important mission you are carrying out,” he said.
Although much of the unrest was documented on video and the faces of many rioters appear in footage, all suspects arrested were released by Tuesday morning. Nevertheless, many in Bnei Brak have criticized what they describe as a heavy-handed police response in dispersing the disturbances. Condemnations of the rioters’ violence were issued from across the political spectrum.

Met deploys drones and ebikes to help catch adolescent phone thieves

Gangs are recruiting children to go out to steal smartphones before they head to school, using Snapchat to offer rewards of up to £380 for the latest Apple iPhones, police have revealed.
The Metropolitan police said they were deploying new resources including drones and Surron ebikes to chase suspects as they step up their fight against phone snatching.
London is the area in Britain most plagued by phone theft and the Met has been criticised for its response.
The force said thefts were down 12% in the last year to 71,000, but the commissioner, Mark Rowley, wants technology companies – especially Apple – to do more to make phones harder to reactivate when stolen and shipped overseas.
Gangs are using Snapchat to advertise a menu of cash rewards for different models of stolen mobile phones, enticing children as young as 14 on bikes to act as thieves.
Gangs offer the most money for the newest Apple phones, which the Met believes are less protected and thus easier to ship overseas and to reactivate for markets in the Gulf and China.
The Met said Samsung phones were worth less because they were harder to reactivate for use overseas.
Once phones are stolen, child thieves message a “handler” on Snapchat to arrange a drop-off. Bonuses of an extra £100 are offered if 10 or more stolen phones are handed over in one drop.
In one recent case, police said a teenager was heading out on a bike early in the morning to attack commuters around a main London transport hub before heading to school.
One Snapchat flyer recovered by police offered £380 for an iPhone 16 Max, £220 for an iPhone 15 and as little as £20 for an iPhone 12.
Rowley said the courts could do more to help by stopping bailing repeat offenders. In one recent case, police said a group of 12 youths were arrested and charged with phone thefts. The next day some were bailed, and within 24 hours of their arrest they were suspected of being back stealing phones.
Rowley said: “Policing alone cannot solve this problem. Manufacturers and tech companies must do more to stop criminals being able to reset, reuse or resell stolen phones.
“We also need the courts to play their part by preventing repeat offenders being bailed only to go out and offend again, undermining the hard work officers are doing to keep communities safe.”
The Met said drones would help target known offenders and track suspects as they flee, with a particular focus on London’s West End, which is the capital’s main phone theft hotspot, with tourists seen by thieves as easier targets.
The Surron ebikes, ridden by specially trained officers, will help officers catch up with young suspects on bikes, the Met hopes.
The force also said live facial recognition technology had played a part in catching offenders and would continue to be used.
The London mayor, Sadiq Khan, said his administration was pumping in an extra £4.5m for a new command centre.
“Far too many Londoners have been the victim of phone theft and I’m determined to stamp it out,” Khan said.
“We have made real progress reducing high-volume crime – but I recognise the personal impact of mobile phone theft and how awful it is when someone’s photographs, contacts, messages and personal information is stolen.
“I’m pleased to propose an additional £4.5m to help the Metropolitan police smash the phone gangs – with a new police command cell focused on taking out gang bosses as well as robbers and snatchers.”

'You make your bed, you lie in it': Albanese's warning to 'ISIS brides' in Syria

Albanese says Australian government will not help ISIS-linked families leave Syria or return home
In short:
The federal government says it will not help Australian relatives of ISIS fighters return home from Syria, where they have been held in refugee camps for more than six years.
A group of 11 families left the Al-Roj camp last night with plans to eventually make the journey to Australia, but were forced to turn back by Syrian authorities.
What's next?
Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke says the federal government is getting advice on whether the threshold for temporary exclusion orders has been met.
Prime Minister Anthony Albanese insists the federal government will not repatriate Australian families with links to Islamic State (IS) fighters, arguing that "if you make your bed, you lie in it".
A group of 34 Australians, including 11 women and 23 children, left the Al-Roj camp in north-eastern Syria yesterday with the intention of travelling to Australia via Damascus.
The ABC was told they were forced to turn around after Syrian authorities said their journey from the Kurdish-held region had not been properly coordinated with officials.
It is not yet clear whether the families will attempt the trip again in the coming days.
Mr Albanese said Australian officials had certain "obligations" under the law, but would not confirm whether the families had been given Australian passports.
He said the government would not provide them with "any assistance or repatriation".
"My mother would have said if you make your bed, you lie in it," Mr Albanese told the ABC.
"These are people who went overseas supporting Islamic State and went there to provide support for people who basically want a caliphate."
Opposition suggests government should block adults' return
The group was among dozens of Australian women and children detained in Syrian camps and prisons since the defeat of the IS "caliphate" in 2019.
Most, if not all, of the women were married to IS fighters who were captured or killed.
Some of the women have previously told the ABC they did not choose to travel to Syria and that many of the children in the camps were born there.
Liberal Senator Sarah Henderson raised concerns about the prospect of the Australians' return, suggesting the adults should be blocked from entering the country.
"The most important task of any government is to keep Australians safe," she told the ABC.
"And if these are people who subscribed to ISIS ideology, who subscribe to this extremist ideology, then they should not be returning to Australia."
Senator Henderson argued the government had a "range of options" available, including imposing temporary exclusion orders (TEOs).
TEOs allow the government to block Australians aged 14 and above from entering Australia without a permit for up to two years if they are deemed to be a national security threat.
Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke said the federal government was getting advice on whether the threshold for TEOs had been met.
"We will always act in accordance with advice from our law enforcement, security and intelligence agencies," he said in a statement issued today.
The federal opposition said the group of ISIS-linked families posed a security risk to Australia.
"For anyone who shares, or potentially shares ISIS ideology — this is the ideology that underpinned the Bondi terrorist attack," Senator Henderson said.
"Australians must be given every confidence that for people who are linked with ISIS, that all of the appropriate security assessments have been made."
Australian citizens previously repatriated from Syria
Successive federal governments have grappled with how to respond to Australians seeking to return from the camps.
In 2019 the the Morrison government worked with an aid agency to remove eight orphaned children from a Syrian camp, including those of killed IS terrorist Khaled Sharrouf.
In 2022, the Albanese government repatriated four Australian women and their 13 children from a Syrian camp, saying at the time that the decision was informed by "detailed work by national security agencies".
But when it was revealed last year that a small group of women and children had returned home, the government insisted it had not provided support.
"If any of those people find their own way to return, our security agencies are satisfied that they are prepared and will be able to act in the interests of community safety," Mr Burke said at the time.
Loading...The director of the Al-Roj camp, Hakmiyeh Ibrahim, has previously urged all foreign governments to repatriate their citizens, warning that children were growing up surrounded by "dangerous ideas and ideologies" in the camp.
"If they are taken away from this community, perhaps [they can enter] rehabilitation programs and specialised centres, especially for children," she told the ABC earlier this month.
Mr Albanese said it was "unfortunate" that children were part of the group, but reiterated that the families would not receive government support.
"And if anyone does manage to find their way back to Australia, then they'll face the full force of the law if any laws have been broken," he said.

Stop releasing phone thieves who reoffend, Met police chief urges courts
Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley also called on phone manufacturers to make it harder for criminals to reset and re-sell stolen phones
- Bookmark
The head of Britain’s largest police force has urged courts to stop granting bail to repeat phone thieves, arguing that such decisions enable them to continue their criminal activities.
Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley also called on phone manufacturers and telecoms companies to implement measures that would make it more difficult for criminals to reset and re-sell stolen devices.
His comments coincide with figures from the force indicating that recorded phone thefts in London went from 81,365 in 2024 to 71,391 last year.
Separate data available on the Met’s crime website further details 52,820 thefts from the person where a phone was taken in 2023, alongside 14,326 robberies.
For 2024, these figures were 70,249 thefts and 11,125 robberies, and for 2025, 61,292 thefts and 10,207 robberies.
In a recent crackdown, the Met has arrested 248 individuals linked to phone theft over the past month, recovering approximately 770 stolen handsets.
Officers seized 1,000 mobile phones and 200 laptops that were due to be smuggled abroad.
Sir Mark said: “Over the past year, we’ve made hundreds of arrests and recovered tens of thousands of stolen devices.
“That work has meant 10,000 fewer people facing the stress, cost and disruption that comes with having their phone stolen.
“It is this work that is making London an even safer city.
“But policing alone cannot solve this problem.
“Manufacturers and tech companies must do more to stop criminals being able to reset, reuse or resell stolen phones.
“We also need the courts to play their part by preventing repeat offenders being bailed only to go out and offend again, undermining the hard work officers are doing to keep communities safe.”
Figures released under Freedom of Information legislation show that between 2017 and February 27 2024, a total 587,498 phones were stolen in London excluding the City, 13,998 of which were recovered, and 573,500 were not.
The Metropolitan Police said it is using drones, e-bikes and live facial recognition to help catch phone thieves.
Mayor of London Sadiq Khan has put forward proposals for £4.5 million in funding to deal with phone theft, including creating a command cell responding to thefts and robberies in the West End.
Sir Sadiq said: “Too many Londoners have been the victim of phone theft.
“Our new intensive action is putting us on the front foot when tackling phone thieves and dismantling the gangs behind the scourge of thefts here in London.”
He went on: “New drones are supporting officers to capture evidence and improve intelligence gathering and new e-bikes are helping officers outpace and outmanoeuvre criminals who use bicycles or electric motorbikes and scooters to commit phone thefts or evade police.
“But we know there is still more to do.
“Which is why as Mayor I’ll continue to prioritise neighbourhood policing and will continue to push the mobile phone industry to go much further in preventing stolen phones being used, sold and repurposed, building a safer London for everyone.”

Mapped: Topshop returns to the high street – here’s where you can find the iconic brand
The popular fashion brand will appear in all John Lewis department stores from Tuesday
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
Topshop is set to make a major return to UK high streets this week.
The popular fashion brand will open in all 32 of John Lewis’ department stores from Tuesday.
The move marks a notable comeback for Topshop, which, alongside its sister brand Topman, disappeared from physical retail spaces after its former owner Arcadia Group collapsed into administration in 2021, leading to the closure of its final standalone stores.
This reintroduction forms part of John Lewis’s strategic expansion of new brands for the upcoming spring/summer season, underpinned by the retailer’s substantial £800 million long-term investment across its store portfolio.
The partnership between the historic department store and Topshop was initially confirmed last year, beginning with successful pop-up installations in several John Lewis locations.
The brand was snapped up by current owner Asos who sold Topshop products online.
However, last year the brand returned to physical retail again with a launch in London department store Liberty before revealing its tie-up with John Lewis weeks later.
Topshop will be available across John Lewis’s 32 shops, with Topman available in seven of its stores.
The launch will cover a collection of 130 of Topshop’s “most in-demand pieces” including their signature denim items.
Topshop and Topman products will also be available across John Lewis’s online platforms as part of the launch.
Michelle Wilson, managing director of Topshop, said: “Today is about making it easier for customers to access the Topshop and Topman pieces they love.
“From our cult denim to new‑season footwear, you can see it, feel it and take it home the same day.
“Partnering with John Lewis brings Topshop back to high streets across the UK with the level of service our customers expect.”
The move is coinciding with London Fashion Week and will be followed by a “takeover” of Piccadilly Circus in London and activations elsewhere across the UK.
The launch comes amid efforts from the department store chain to drive its growth as it continues with a major transformation plan under boss Peter Ruis.
He said the brand, which is part of the John Lewis Partnership with supermarket chain Waitrose, is investing into its fashion offer to help drive its current strategy.
Mr Ruis, managing director of John Lewis, said: “This moment marks a significant acceleration of our fashion ambition at John Lewis.
“To be the exclusive home of an iconic brand like Topshop, sat alongside other exciting new brands, signals our commitment to be the definitive style authority on the British high street.”
John Lewis has said it is also introducing 14 new fashion, jewellery and accessory labels ahead of this season amid efforts to expand its fashion offer.
It also follows a major redesign of the fashion floors at the retailer’s Oxford Street flagship shop.
Topshop products will be available at the following John Lewis stores:
- Glasgow, Scotland
- Edinburgh, Scotland
- Newcastle
- Leeds
- Liverpool
- Trafford, Manchester
- Cheadle, Manchester
- Cardiff, Wales
- Nottingham, Nottinghamshire

Danny and Dani Dyer to revive caravan park for new TV show: ‘It’s a beautiful thing’
The father and daughter duo will aim to revive a holiday park for a new Sky One series
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
EastEnders star Danny Dyer, despite his long-held affection for caravan holidays, initially rejected the idea of reviving a holiday park for a new Sky One series.
However, the 48-year-old actor soon had a change of heart, enlisting his daughter, Love Island’s Dani Dyer, 29, to help transform Priory Hill in Leysdown, Kent.
Their mission, documented in the new six-part series The Dyers’ Caravan Park, is to restore the site to the kind of vibrant destination Danny fondly remembered from his 1980s holidays.
The father-daughter duo faces the challenge of revamping the park, improving its business, and winning over sceptical residents and staff, all with the aim of breathing new life into the British holiday tradition.
Ahead of the series release, both Danny and Dani have reflected on their personal experiences with caravan park holidays, the dynamics of working together, and the significant importance this project holds for them.
What is it about caravan parks the evoke such memories for you?
DANNY DYER: That’s all I ever knew as a child; that was our holiday every year. It’s a very working-class holiday. I would hang out with my nan, grandad, my aunts and uncles and cousins, it’s such a beautiful thing for me.
And it wasn’t about money. It was just very simple.
Weirdly, I went back to film in Canvey Island recently, and there was tarmac on the beach, how f****** depressing is that. So there’s tarmac and then the sea.
But when I was a kid, it wasn’t all that. It was a bit pebbly. My brother and I used to walk along the sea wall because you could see the little arcade at the seafront, and we’d have a handful of change in our hands.
They were very simple days that I really do miss. So I thought, with the might of Sky behind me, let’s see if we can make caravans interesting again to some people, with my firstborn child, of course.
Dani, why do you enjoy working with your dad so much? What was it like filming this series with him?
DANI DYER: We have worked together quite a few times. We’ve travelled around Italy, and that was one of the first main things we did together. We’ve also done Gogglebox too.
We get on so well. The filming days can be really long sometimes, but we just make each other laugh, and we get each other through it. I think we both bring something so different to the show. And like I always say, he’s like, a bit naughty. We have to rein him in a little bit.
He’s very cheeky, but the residents love him, and I think it was so lovely for them to be around him and us, and bring something different to the caravan park. It’s just easy. It doesn’t feel like work when we’re together. He would say something different.
DANNY DYER: No, we’re just two Danny Dyers trying to make the whole thing work. I needed her to calm me down a little bit because I struggle to run a business, trying to juggle a lot of jobs at once. So this was the only time we could do it.
I was in Bristol most of the week, and then came back and did the lay-downs on Saturday and Sunday. So it was sometimes quite difficult to always be happy.
DANI DYER: We always knew when he was moody.
DANNY DYER: Well, it adds to the show somewhat, because I am slightly wacky about it, but I really want to do the right thing. It was a baptism of fire because we didn’t have a f****** clue what we were doing, and it comes across. But I think we got a few things right as well. It’s a comforting show to watch.
This is a big investment. It’s quite high stakes. You really need to want to do something like this?
DANNY DYER: If you want to get involved, get involved. I’m very frivolous. S*** with money. But I was spunky and ready, which is not a good motto to have. That’s why I needed Dani by my side to rein me in slightly. I didn’t know how much these things cost, but we do talk about it in the show, how expensive everything is now. Look at how much butter is, Lurpak is seven quid.
DANI DYER: But he has two open Lurpaks in his fridge.
DANNY DYER: You can tell how much a man is earning by how many Lurpaks he has.
You are showing an aspect of British culture that isn’t always seen on screen. Why was that important to you?
DANNY DYER: I think not enough working-class voices are on television. And this is a very, very British show. People are also struggling with what being British is, at the moment. But these are real characters, and without them, this show doesn’t work. So you’ve got Dani and me trying to do the right thing.
But these characters, they take their caravans very, very seriously, as they should; they spend a lot of money on them. It’s four and a half grand a year for ground rent, but they want one of the best holidays they possibly can. So they got over having two famous people minting about pretty quickly.
DANI DYER: We would walk in with cameras, and probably some people did think, ‘Oh, what’s going to happen now?’ But they all warmed to us.
Dani, did you go on caravan holidays too?
DANI DYER: Yeah, I went with my friends. That was my first teenage holiday, and my first bit of freedom, really, being able to just go up to the clubhouse and go over to the pier, and just be with my best friend. I felt like an adult at 12.
The Dyers’ Caravan Park comes to Sky One and NOW on Tuesday, February 24

Jobcentre on Wheels to be rolled out across Britain – this is where
It is hoped the initiative will ‘break down the barriers that stop people finding good work’
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
Mobile Jobcentre vans are to be launched across the UK as a way of "breaking down the barriers that stop people finding good work".
Unveiling the expansion following a pilot, Work and Pensions Secretary Pat McFadden said the Jobcentre on Wheels service is designed around "meeting people where they are", including unconventional locations such as outside leisure centres and within municipal parks.
This initiative forms part of the government’s wider push to reform employment support, aiming to fulfil a manifesto pledge amidst concerns over a rising national unemployment rate.
“We want to break down the barriers that stop people from finding good work, and that means meeting people where they are,” Mr McFadden said.
“Jobcentres on Wheels are doing exactly that – bringing employment support into the heart of communities.
“That’s why we’re building on the success we’ve already seen, expanding the service so we can unlock opportunities for even more people across the country.”
The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) has trialled Jobcentre on Wheels vans in the Scottish Highlands, North and Mid Wales and Greater Manchester.
More vehicles will join the fleet across six areas – in Barrow-in-Furness, Blackpool, Wakefield, North Nottinghamshire, Bridgend and Rhondda Cynon Taf, and North Somerset.
According to DWP data, more than half of the visitors to the Jobcentre on Wheels service were not in receipt of benefits.
The Office for National Statistics estimated the unemployment rate for people aged 16 and over was at 5.1% between September and November last year, up from 4.4 per cent during the same period in 2024.
It comes as Tesco’s UK chief, Ashwin Prasad warned last week that Britain is in danger of “sleepwalking into an epidemic” of joblessness.
Taking aim at government policies that increase hiring costs for employers, Mr Prasad said there had been a “clear, gradual change” over the past decade in people falling out of the workforce.
He added that there are “far fewer people in work than there could be” and calling for significant change from the government in how it tackles the issue.

Investment in subsea cable network to create thousands of green jobs
The upgrade of the 113 cables linking Scottish islands is expected to support the decarbonisation of island-based industries such as distilleries.
- Bookmark
A power firm has announced a multimillion-pound investment in the subsea cable network serving Scotland’s islands, in a move expected to create “thousands of high-quality green jobs”.
SSEN Distribution is set to upgrade its network of 113 subsea electricity cables, which provide power to 60 islands, saying it will improve resilience and increasing capacity to meet growing demand.
The work is set to support more than 450 specialised jobs each year for up to eight years – which the company said equates to or more than 3,500 fixed-term roles in and around installation sites and at company bases.
SSEN said the investment – worth up to £950 million – will enable islanders to connect new technologies like electric vehicle (EV) chargers, solar panels and heat pumps to the network.
It is also expected to benefit local energy generators looking to produce and export green power, and to support the decarbonisation of island-based industries such as distilleries.
The announcement was welcomed by Energy Secretary Gillian Martin, who said it would help the country achieve its net zero target.
“This welcome investment by SSEN Distribution will help upgrade the subsea network serving Scotland’s islands, improving its resilience and supporting Scotland’s net zero ambitions,” she said.
“It will also support thousands of high-quality green jobs and drive new growth across the local, regional and national economies as part of our net zero transformation.”
Kevin Galbraith, SSEN Distribution’s subsea project director (large capital delivery), said: “Subsea connections are becoming ever more important as Scotland’s island communities seek to invest in EV charging, heat pumps, and the decarbonisation of their industries.
“In addition to providing the networks fit for supporting this growth in the use of clean power, these framework agreements will also underpin the ambitions of islanders to generate, store, and export more renewable energy.”
The work of upgrading the network will be delivered by five “contract partner” companies, with a “strong focus” on using locally-based supply chains.
The firms are Burntisland-based Briggs Marine; DOF Subsea UK and N-Sea, both of which have bases in Aberdeen; and Enshore Subsea and Jan De Nul.
Specific projects will be allocated according to each contract partner’s specialisms and resources.
SSEN said working with multiple companies will enable multiple subsea cables to be upgraded at the same time during the relatively narrow summer window, when weather conditions are more favourable.
Mr Galbraith went on: “The agreements themselves will ensure delivery of this investment will be rolled out in a seamless, co-ordinated way, and this will provide both customers and supply chains with the certainty they’re looking for.
“This multi-year investment will also provide greater job security and new opportunities for employment in this growing sector.”

Average £2,000 headache for home buyers from collapsing property chains – survey

Average £2,000 headache for home buyers from collapsing property chains – survey
Long property chains can add stress to the home-buying process, Barclays said.
- Bookmark
Collapsing property chains are adding around £2,000 to home buyers’ costs on average, according to a bank.
A survey for Barclays found about a third (32%) of people who bought or sold a home in the last three years were part of a property chain, with nearly half (46%) of this group experiencing delays or transaction breakdowns because of chain-related issues.
Those who experienced problems or a breakdown of their housing chain said they spent an additional £2,127 on average, with extra outgoings including “wasted” surveys or extra time needed from solicitors.
Among people whose property purchase or sale had fallen through in the past three years, some said they had been “gazumped” – where the seller accepts a higher offer from a new buyer at the last minute.
Others had been “gazundered” – where the buyer lowers their offer at the last minute, causing the sale to break down.
Some admitted to trying one of these tactics themselves, resulting in the transaction collapsing.
Barclays’ mortgage data indicates the average UK deposit last month was £59,057, and slightly higher among first-time buyers at £62,272.
Jatin Patel, head of mortgages, savings and insurance at Barclays, said: “Movers often face battles on two fronts as the abundance of long property chains adds acute stress into the process.”
Julien Lafargue, chief market strategist at Barclays, said: “In addition to frictions in the process, the UK housing market has also to contend with a mixed macroeconomic picture. Growth slowed in the second half of 2025 and the UK labour market is still softening.
“That said, the consumer remains broadly resilient, suggesting that growth could rebound in 2026.”
Barclays used its own mortgage data and a survey of 2,000 people across the UK in January and February carried out by Opinium Research.

David Fell, lead analyst at Hamptons, said: “Lengthening transaction times are creating particular frustration for buyers.
“They are often receiving information about the property much later in the process than they would have a few years ago, by which point more time and money have already been invested.
“As the process drags on, it is more often the buyers – rather than sellers – who choose to pull out.
“This is usually due to issues raised in surveys and searches, or simply exhaustion with delays.
“By the time a sale collapses, the sunk costs can be substantial.
“Consequently, many sellers are choosing to withdraw from the market entirely rather than relist.”

Gabriella Karefa-Johnson, a New York fashion provocateur styling Serena Williams and NYC's first lady Rama Duwaji

On January 1, outside New York City Hall, Zohran Mamdani, the city's new mayor and first Muslim to hold the position, took his oath of office on a copy of the Quran. Beside him, his wife, illustrator Rama Duwaji, 28, appeared in a long brown coat with a funnel collar and a flared, faux fur-trimmed hem. Deliberately understated, the outfit nonetheless reflected a clear political commitment. The coat, from Beirut-based label Renaissance Renaissance, was created by Palestinian-Lebanese designer Cynthia Merhej, whose aesthetic is rooted in reflections on identity, heritage and cultural resistance.
Behind this symbolic and aesthetic choice is a signature: that of American stylist and fashion editor Gabriella Karefa-Johnson. "It's a new way to approach political dressing," she explained. The process was collaborative: "We worked together on everything. Rama Duwaji's taste is inherently exquisite and she knows what she wants."

Why North Korea’s Kim is lauding Ukraine war sacrifices as key party congress looms
The new homes for families of fallen soldiers are part of a push to showcase tangible achievements before the party congress, analysts say

North Korea appears to be recasting the human cost of its involvement in Russia’s war in Ukraine as a carefully staged display of loyalty and leadership, with analysts pointing in particular to the unveiling of a new housing district in Pyongyang for families of fallen soldiers as a central part of that effort.
Several observers argue that leader Kim Jong-un is seeking not only to recast battlefield losses as patriotic sacrifice but also to head off potential unease before a key party congress later this month, where he is expected to tout his achievements and set the tone for the next five years.
On Sunday, Kim attended the completion ceremony of Saeppyol Street, a residential district redesignated for the families of soldiers deployed to the Ukraine war and killed in action, according to state media.

Accompanied by his daughter Kim Ju-ae and senior military officials, Kim used the occasion to pay tribute to the fallen and promise sustained state support for their relatives.
In a speech at the event, Kim said the new district fulfilled the “ardent wish of the motherland” to ensure that the lives of soldiers who “gave the most precious thing” would continue through their families.

Scotiabank unit sells stake in Israeli arms supplier Elbit following backlash

Scotiabank's 1832 Asset Management subsidiary has dissolved its stake in Israeli arms manufacturer Elbit Systems ESLT.TA, ESLT.O, regulatory filings showed, after the Canadian bank faced sharp criticism for the investment.
Activists angered over Elbit's role in supplying military equipment used by Israel during the war with Hamas had pressured the Scotiabank BNS.TO investment arm, which at one point was the biggest foreign investor in the weapons maker.
The investment arm no longer holds shares in Elbit, a change from its reported holding of about 165,000 shares in November, according to the filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday.
The Canadian bank did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on the stake sale.
Protests erupted at Scotiabank branches, prestigious gala
Scotiabank's exposure to the weapons maker had triggered a number of protests at the bank's branches, Reuters reported in 2023. It had also disrupted Canada's prestigious Giller Prize Gala, a literary award that was sponsored by Scotiabank.
The contract between the Giller Prize and Scotiabank ended in February 2025.
The Defense Ministry said in January that it had signed a multi-year agreement for air munitions with Elbit worth $183 million.
Elbit reported sharply higher third-quarter profit in November, fueled by sales to Israel's military during the Israel-Hamas war and by higher global defense spending.
US-listed shares of Elbit more than doubled last year.

Austrian prosecutors have filed terrorism-related and other charges against a now 21-year-old Austrian suspect arrested shortly before a 2024 Taylor Swift concert in Vienna, who they said planned to carry out an Islamic State (ISIS)-inspired attack.
The Vienna prosecutors' office plans to bring a criminal case against the unnamed suspect in Wiener Neustadt, a town near Vienna, accusing him of producing a small amount of the explosive triacetone triperoxide and attempting to purchase weapons illegally, it said in a statement on Monday.
The statement referred to the suspect's arrest in August 2024, the same month as three planned Swift concerts were canceled at short notice after Austrian authorities said they had foiled an attack.
The statement from the prosecutors' office did not name the suspect, but he was identified by Austrian media as Beran A and is the only one to have been arrested in connection with the planned attack. Beran A's lawyer was not immediately available for comment, but has previously disputed accusations made against his client.
In June 2025, German authorities charged a Syrian juvenile listed as Mohammad A for helping plan the attack by translating Arabic bomb-building instructions and putting Beran A in contact with a member of the ISIS terror group online, according to the charges against him. He avoided prison under juvenile criminal law.
Suspect spread ISIS propaganda online
The prosecutors' statement said that Beran A was a member of the Islamic State and that he is accused of carrying out online research into a type of shrapnel bomb used by that group, and of spreading Islamic State "propaganda material" online.
If convicted, he faces up to 20 years in prison, the statement added.

Guthrie family not suspects in Arizona kidnapping, says sheriff

Nancy Guthrie's family has been cleared as possible suspects in her abduction, Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos said on Monday, as the case involving the mother of "Today" show co-anchor Savannah Guthrie entered its third week.
Guthrie's family, which includes "all siblings and spouses," has been cooperative and gracious as authorities investigate the kidnapping, Nanos said.
"To suggest otherwise is not only wrong, it is cruel," he said in a statement. "The Guthrie family are victims plain and simple."
Investigators on Sunday said they had obtained a DNA sample from a glove that was found near 84-year-old Nancy Guthrie's Arizona home and appears to match the pair worn by a masked prowler seen in doorbell camera footage before she was abducted two weeks ago.
Nancy Guthrie was last seen on January 31 when family dropped her off at her home near Tucson after she had dined with them, and relatives reported her missing the following day, authorities have said.
Nanos has said the elder Guthrie was extremely limited in her physical mobility and could not have left her home unassisted, leading investigators to conclude early on that she had been taken against her will.
No known contact with suspected captors
At least two purported ransom notes have surfaced since she vanished, both of them delivered initially to news media outlets. But there has been no known direct contact between Guthrie's presumed captors and her family, or with authorities.
Traces of blood found on her front porch were confirmed by DNA tests to have come from Guthrie, officials said last week. Law enforcement and family members have described her as being in frail health and in need of daily medication to survive. She also had a pacemaker.
Savannah Guthrie, 54, co-anchor of the popular NBC News morning show "Today," has posted several video messages, along with her brother Camron Guthrie and sister Annie Guthrie, pleading for their mother's return and appealing for the public's help in solving the case.
Nanos has told Reuters that no proof of life has surfaced since the abduction, but added that "there's not been any proof of death either," saying his working presumption is that Nancy Guthrie remains alive.

3 killed, including suspect, in shooting during Rhode Island youth hockey game
Police in Pawtucket said 3 wounded victims were in critical condition and that the incident may have been a ‘targeted’ family dispute
Three people, including the suspect, were fatally shot during a Rhode Island youth hockey game on Monday, authorities said.
Pawtucket Police Chief Tina Goncalves told reporters that three other victims are hospitalised in critical condition.
“We have three deceased. The suspect, and then we have two victims, and then we have three at the hospital,” said Goncalves.
“It appears that this was a targeted event, that it may be a family dispute,” she said. Goncalves did not provide details about the suspect or the ages of those who were killed, though she said it appeared that both victims were adults.
She said investigators are trying to piece together what happened and speak to witnesses of the shooting inside Dennis M Lynch Arena in Pawtucket, a few miles outside Providence.
They are also reviewing video taken from the hockey game. Unverified footage circulating on social media shows players diving for cover and fans fleeing their seats after popping sounds are heard.

FIFA president Infantino celebrates in Beirut after receiving a Lebanese passport
FIFA President Gianni Infantino received his Lebanese passport at the Interior Ministry in Beirut on Monday, months after he was granted citizenship by the country’s president.
Infantino, who is married to Lebanese citizen Lina al-Ashkar, thanked President Joseph Aoun when he received him Monday for granting him and his family Lebanese citizenship.
The meeting with Aoun took place after Infantino visited the Interior Ministry where her performed the official process of filing documents, being photographed and having his fingerprints taken before he was handed a copy of his new blue Lebanese passport.
Infantino also has Italian and Swiss citizenship.
“I’m very proud and very happy to be here in Beirut at the Ministry of Interior to finally get my Lebanese passport,” Infantino said in a video carried by local TV stations. “I love Lebanon."
According to Lebanese law, Lebanese women cannot pass their citizenship on to their foreign husbands and children. In Infantino’s case, he got the citizenship because Aoun granted it to him.
On the contrary, Lebanese men married to foreign women automatically pass their nationality to their children while their wives take it after a certain period of time that follows the marriage.

Six Sarah Ferguson-linked companies to close after Epstein revelations

Six companies linked to Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor’s ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson, are being wound down in the wake of revelations about her relationship with Jeffrey Epstein.
According to Companies House, an application to strike off each company was filed after new details about Ferguson’s contact with Epstein came to light in the millions of documents released by US authorities as part of the Epstein files.
Ferguson, 66, was sole director of the six companies: S Phoenix Events, Fergie’s Farm, La Luna Investments, Solamoon Ltd, Philanthrapreneur Ltd and Planet Partners Productions Ltd.
In documents published last month, the former duchess appears to say to Epstein: “I am at your service. Just marry me.”
In an email exchange from 21 September 2011, she apparently wrote: “Don’t know if you are still on this bbm but heard from The Duke that you have had a baby boy.
“Even though you never kept in touch, I still am here with love, friendship and congratualtions (sic) on your baby boy. Sarah xx”
The email is then followed up with a message saying: “You have disappeared … I did not even know you were having a baby. It was soooo crystal clear to me that you were only friends with me to get to Andrew. And that really hurt me deeeply (sic). More than you will know.”
Many of the exchanges are dated after Epstein was convicted in 2008 for soliciting prostitution from a child.
Recent revelations from the Epstein files include that Ferguson thanked the convicted sex offender for being the “brother” she “always wished for” in 2009, and that she “humbly” apologised to her “dear friend” a month after publicly disowning him in 2011.
Earlier this month, Ferguson’s charity Sarah’s Trust announced it would close “for the foreseeable future” after details of her relationship with Epstein emerged, while seven other charities, including the Teenage Cancer Trust, cut ties and revoked Ferguson’s patronage.
The publication of a new book was cancelled last autumn, leading to thousands of copies being pulped, after she was stripped of her royal divorcee title of the Duchess of York.
A representative for the former duchess has been contacted for comment.

Robert Duvall Gave His Characters—and Us—Grace

Some actors melt into their roles, or at least attempt to do so, wrapping themselves in a cloak of anonymity as they slip into a character. But Robert Duvall, who died on Feb. 15 at age 95, didn’t—not quite. He was too much of a presence for that: From the silky-smooth fixer Tom Hagen in the first two Godfather movies (1972 and 1974), to Lt. Kilgore, the outlandish lover of Wagner and surfing in Apocalypse Now (1979), to the true-believer and seeker of redemption Sonny in The Apostle (1997), and beyond, Duvall vested the characters he played with a livewire crackle that was distinctively his own, a current of energy that you couldn’t divorce from his definitive physicality. His eyes could be steely; they could also dance with light and joy. The characters he specialized in weren’t always immediately likable or wholly trustworthy, but he beckoned and seduced us into believing in them. That was his gift: he didn’t so much shift shape as shift something in us, opening us up to human complexities and contradictions that made the world seem bigger, not smaller.
Duvall, born in San Diego in 1931, spent much of the 1960s as other aspiring actors of his generation did, in small roles on television. Though he made his film debut as the misunderstood recluse Boo Radley in 1962’s To Kill a Mockingbird, TV kept him working through the decade: his credits included small-screen staples like Route 66, The Fugitive, Outer Limits, and Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea. But the 1970s were truly his decade. He played plenty of memorable jerks, like the supercilious yet incompetent surgeon Major Frank Burns in Robert Altman’s M*A*S*H (1970), or the slash-and-burn TV executive Frank Hackett in Network (1976). These were characters you loved to hate: Duvall gave them the kind of jagged charisma that made you want to know what these men were going to do next. And even if you couldn't approve of the distasteful, immoral work done by Tom Hagen in the Godfather movies, Duvall knew how to wrap it all in a leather-bound slipcase. Tom made terrible, indefensible acts seem somehow socially acceptable—it is, after all, what a fixer does—and Duvall made it feel chillingly real.
Duvall’s Lt. Kilgore, of Apocalypse Now, may have had one of the most tiresomely quoted lines in all of 1970s moviedom—the one about loving the smell of napalm in the morning—but his character has a gruff complexity that can’t be encapsulated with one line. Even his very carriage seems to harbor secrets: Kilgore is a hard-ass, a walking scowl, but even so, he’s a man with a past and a future we can only guess at. A Duvall performance never stopped at a movie’s end; we could somehow imagine these characters living beyond the frame, inhabiting lives we’d never by privy to.
But if the 1970s were Duvall’s breakthrough decade, he may have done his greatest work midcareer, with The Apostle (1997), which he also wrote and directed. Duvall stars as Sonny, a Texas preacher whose life takes a violent turn when he discovers his wife (Farrah Fawcett) is having an affair. He leaves her lover in a coma and skips town, adopting a new name—he's now the Apostle E.F.—and heading for Louisiana on a kind of personal redemption tour. Duvall’s Sonny is a showman through and through. He preaches the gospel as if it were a jazz text. Even as he stands alone in an empty room, dumping his frustration into a tirade directed at the Lord, his entreaties—“Gimme a sign or something! Blow this pain outta me!”—are brimming with holy-roller vigor. You might think he’s a flimflammer, yet time and again, Sonny proves he’s the real thing. Even though he’s a sinner, grace somehow flows right through his fingertips: we see it as he lays his hands on a young man who’s just been in a car crash and is about to die. Sonny makes sure this man is saved in his very last minute on Earth. His gift is that he doesn’t hog grace for himself; he passes it around so everyone feels it, a metaphor, maybe, for the best of what great actors can give us.
The male actors we loved in the 1970s, performers who drew the contours of a new kind of sometimes-tough but often tender masculinity, are slipping away from us. Gene Hackman, Robert Redford, Donald Sutherland, Peter Fonda: at one time brash, sexy, and unpredictable, these men eventually became the old guard, often segueing into crotchety old-man roles, the handy slots generally available for male actors of a certain age. Given how rigid human standards of beauty can be, actresses may have it harder than men do as they grow old. But men face their own challenges: no one looks forward to feeling diminished or forgotten as new, younger actors crowd the space around them. It’s hard to lose these performers for good, not least because their passing reminds us how quickly 50 years can flash by for any of us. But for film and TV actors, especially—people whose work lives beyond them—death can be a kind of rebirth. The old-man roles fall away in our memories, and we find ourselves spending more time remembering how they were when they were young and on fire. Duvall has now passed into that vale, his vitality restored, leaving a trail of movies in which he is still and always very much alive. And hallelujah for that.

Using AI for money advice? You might want to read this

Using AI for money advice? You might want to read this
In one of my personal finance classes at Harvard, I asked students to use AI to help answer a simple question: would you prefer a car loan at 10 per cent for one year, or 2 per cent for ten years?
Their AI chat tools confidently responded with detailed calculations, claiming “10 per cent for one year is always best”. Only one of my forty students realised it was wrong. “I would prefer the 2 per cent loan because I could always pay it off in one year”, they correctly pointed out.
If 97.5 per cent of my Harvard advanced economics students can be fooled by AI, what hope do the rest of us have? It’s becoming a popular tool, with four in ten Australians using AI for their personal finances. For those aged 18-29, it is eight in 10.
With professional advice costing upwards of $5000 a year, it is no surprise that Australians are turning to free AI tools to help guide their financial decisions. And while AI can be genuinely useful for managing money, my Harvard undergraduates will now be the first to tell you about its many pitfalls.
But that doesn’t mean you should completely write off AI as a tool to help improve your finances. There are some scenarios where AI can be helpful, and somewhere it’s best left alone.
How you should use AI
1. Treat AI like a junior analyst, not a financial adviser. As long as you check its work, AI can be useful for delegating time-consuming tasks. Comparing different financial products can be a time-saver (for example, numerous savings accounts with different “bonus interest” rate rules).
And, given “comparison” websites often favour promoted products, AI can be a less commercially conflicted option. You can also use AI to do simple financial calculations, help keep track of and categorise your spending, and find long-forgotten subscriptions you’re still paying for. Just make sure you supervise it at all times.
2. Ask AI the questions you’re too embarrassed to ask. “Explain how an offset account works, as if I were a 10-year-old” is often an effective prompt in my experience. Or “what is a balance transfer fee, and how do I avoid getting stung by one?”
Our finances can be quite personal, and we may not feel comfortable asking our friends or family questions we think are too simple. In these cases, AI can be an effective judgment-free tutor.
Just as you wouldn’t want an AI attorney to represent you in court, don’t let AI make tax or legal decisions for you.
3. Let it help you read lengthy T&Cs. No matter whether it’s a credit card, insurance product, or superannuation account, we are constantly being asked to read hundreds of pages of terms and conditions.
Unless you’re the 6 per cent of people who read these documents every time, you might consider using AI to summarise the important points, including any ‘catches’ that might be relevant to you.
This, of course, is error-prone and does not replace reading it yourself, but an AI summary is still better than blindly ticking the “I accept” box.
How you shouldn’t use AI
1. Don’t outsource life decisions. The decision to buy a house, change jobs, or sign a prenup is uniquely personal. And while they include a financial element, they are trade-offs between competing priorities that are also informed by personal relationships and values.
Asking AI to make these decisions for you could turn them into an optimisation problem, not a life decision. It may help collate all the pros and cons, but handing these decisions over to AI entirely won’t improve them – it will just hide the judgment call behind a falsely confident computer-generated answer.
2. Don’t let AI dictate your risk tolerance. Economists generally think that people’s risk tolerance becomes more conservative as they get older, given that they have less time to recover from any setbacks.
But there is no “correct” risk tolerance for one’s investments, as it depends on your wealth, financial goals, and personal comfort with market volatility. Worryingly, there is evidence that AI often endorses higher -risk options and can have “higher assertiveness” in these recommendations.
Blindly following this advice could lead to greater investment volatility than many people are comfortable with.
3. Don’t rely on AI for legal or tax advice. Just as you wouldn’t want an AI lawyer to represent you in court, don’t let AI make tax or legal decisions for you. AI models are known to “hallucinate”, meaning that they confidently make stuff up with no factual basis.
So, for important decisions – where incorrect application of the law could lead to penalties or criminal convictions – don’t trust AI.
Don’t assume confidence equals accuracy, and don’t expect AI to take any accountability. I’m not sure how much luck you’d have suing Google because you broke Australian Tax Office rules on its AI agent’s advice.
AI is a technological marvel, and it is making many financial decisions easier and more accessible than ever before. But, of course, nothing replaces a real certified financial adviser when making important decisions.
At least in 2026, I’d still trust a well-educated human more than an overconfident algorithm.

Beyond the Headlines: What do people say after keeping shabbat for the first time? - opinion
Unknown
Unknown Publisher

08:46:47 KST

I recently had the opportunity to spend Shabbat in Jerusalem with 100 Israelis, most of whom were observing Shabbat for the first time. The Kesher Yehudi organization has been pairing charedi and secular Israelis for Torah study for many years. Lately, though, there has been a growing demand for something else: Shabbatot for those who want to experience Shabbat up close.
It was an extraordinary Shabbat of unity and holiness, filled with hugs, tears, song, and deep conversations. Here are a few comments that people shared with me:
Irit said, “For the first hour of Shabbat, I kept reaching for my cell phone and panicking that it wasn’t on me. Then I remembered - it was off. But after such a magical twenty-four hours, I enjoyed being unplugged so much that I didn’t want it to end. I just didn’t feel like turning it on again.”
Tzion told us on Shabbat morning that he hadn’t been able to fall asleep on Friday night.
“This was the first time I experienced Kabbalat Shabbat, a Shabbat meal, and then lectures and discussions, one after the other,” he said. “After so many hours of holiness, I felt like my soul was lit up. I reached such spiritual heights that I couldn’t fall asleep.” Some of the Shabbat-observant participants admitted they were envious. I felt the same way.
Rabbanit Tzili Schneider, founder and CEO of Kesher Yehudi, told me that this longing for Shabbat has become widespread. The Jewish people, she said, are returning to their roots and to Shabbat.
She offered a practical tip for Jews today: “Don’t regret what you didn’t do in the past. Be satisfied with what you’re doing now. Commit yourself to gradual progress, with guidance from people who can accompany you on your journey. The main thing is to rejoice in every small step, every aspect of Shabbat that you bring into your life.”
She added that even those who already observe Shabbat should keep striving to deepen and elevate it. We can all ask ourselves, “How can I bring a little more Shabbat into my life?”
A Guinness World Record and what it says about us
A Guinness World Record has recently been broken in Israel. It’s a record of generosity and kindness. Last week, 2,000 kidney donors posed for a group photo at the International Convention Center in Jerusalem, forming the largest gathering of organ donors in history. Here are three takeaways from this remarkable event:
“On our way to donor 3,000!”
This was the evening's slogan, chosen by Rabbanit Rachel Haber, co-founder and chairwoman of Matnat Chaim (Gift of Life). But it is not just a slogan; it is a mindset. Even as she celebrated 2,000 kidney donations, a world record, she was already looking ahead to the next goal.
Not everyone needs to donate a kidney, but everyone can give.
Rabbanit Haber told the audience: “Not everyone needs to donate a kidney, but everyone has what to give. You can lend an ear to someone in distress, smile at someone, extend a hand to help a friend or use your arms to hug them. The point isn’t that all of us should become kidney donors. The point is to live with the awareness that every limb the Creator gave us is meant to do good, all the time.”
The group photo is a counter-narrative.
I took a moment to look closely at the group photo, and I encourage everyone to do the same. It can serve as a buffer against the images and opinions we’re bombarded with day after day. The media is constantly trying to drive wedges between us, and the effort only intensifies in an election year.
But the most meaningful “election” already took place: 2,000 Israelis chose to donate a part of their bodies to save the lives of brothers and sisters they had never met, people with whom they nonetheless share a deep soul connection.
And one more detail worth noting: the modest, energetic woman behind this evening (and already focused on recruiting thousands more donors) is a charedi rabbanit. So, don’t let rhetoric and cynicism shape the way you see your people. Look again at the picture. It may be the truest picture of who we really are.
Connecting through giving
How is love created? How do we foster involvement and commitment? This week’s Torah portion, Parashat Terumah, reveals a profound educational secret.
Just a few portions ago, God brought the Ten Plagues upon Egypt, split the sea for us, and gave us the Torah. And suddenly, He asks for our contribution, on our initiative, in order to build the Mishkan. What is the purpose of all these detailed technical instructions? Why must the people volunteer and bring beams, fabrics, and precious materials?
Many commentators explain that God does not need our silver or gold; He wants our hearts, our partnership. Until now, the Israelites were largely passive, recipients of miracles and kindness. Now they become active. They take responsibility. They become part of writing the story. And the more we invest, the more we love.
This is true not only in building the Mishkan but also in relationships. The more we invest in a marriage, the more deeply connected we feel. In parenting, the effort we put in strengthens our bond with our children. In education, children need not only rights but also responsibilities in order to feel ownership and accountability. And in Torah study itself, the more we invest, the more we feel that it belongs to us.
Rabbi Eliyahu Dessler expressed this idea with a powerful statement: “More than giving is a result of love, love is a result of giving.”

Judge orders slavery exhibits restored at George Washington’s Philadelphia home
-
Click here to listen to this article - Share via
PHILADELPHIA — A federal judge on Monday ordered the Trump administration to restore exhibits on slavery that the National Park Service had removed from the President’s House last month.
U.S. District Judge Cynthia M. Rufe’s ruling requires the federal government to restore the site “to its physical status as of January 21, 2026,” the day before the exhibits were removed.
The order did not set a deadline for restoration, but required the National Park Service to take steps to maintain the site and ensure the safety of the exhibits that memorialize the enslaved people who lived in George Washington’s Philadelphia home during his presidency.
Rufe, a George W. Bush appointee, compared the Trump administration’s argument that it can unilaterally control the exhibits in national parks to the Ministry of Truth in George Orwell’s “1984,” a novel about a dystopian totalitarian regime.
“This Court is now asked to determine whether the federal government has the power it claims — to dissemble and disassemble historical truths when it has some domain over historical facts,” Rufe wrote. “It does not.”
The administration’s attempt to alter the President’s House is part of a nationwide initiative to remove content displays from national parks that “inappropriately disparage Americans past or living,” under orders issued by President Trump and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum last year. For instance, Park Service employees removed signage from the Grand Canyon about the mistreatment of Native Americans.
Philadelphia filed a federal lawsuit against Burgum, acting National Park Service Director Jessica Bowron and their agencies the day the exhibits were dismantled.
The federal government has the option to appeal the judge’s order. The Interior Department, National Park Service and U.S. Attorney’s Office did not immediately comment on the ruling, which fell on Presidents’ Day, a federal holiday.
During a hearing last month, Rufe called the argument that a president could unilaterally change the exhibits displayed in national parks “horrifying” and “dangerous.” She ordered the federal government to ensure the panels’ safekeeping after an inspection and a visit to the President’s House earlier this month.
Monday’s ruling followed an updated injunction request from the city that asked for the full restoration of the site — not merely that the exhibits be maintained safely. In response, the federal government’s brief argued that the National Park Service has discretion over the exhibits and that the city’s lawsuit should be dismissed on procedural grounds.
The federal government also argued there could be no irreparable harm from the removal of the exhibits because they are documented online and replacement panels would cost $20,000.
But the judge found the city met its burden.
“If the President’s House is left dismembered throughout this dispute, so too is the history it recounts, and the City’s relationship to that history,” Rufe wrote.
The injunction itself does not resolve the underlying lawsuit, and is in effect for the duration of the litigation.
Avenging the Ancestors Coalition, the main advocacy organization leading the fight to protect the President’s House, was a little less than an hour into its Presidents’ Day event at the site when leaders got wind of their victory.
Michael Coard, a leader of the Black-led advocacy group that helped develop the site before it opened in 2010, told the crowd of about 100 people gathered at the President’s House: “Thanks to you all, your presence and your activism, I have great news: We just won in federal court.”
But the fight is not over, advocates said, with Coard expecting the Trump administration to appeal or ignore any future rulings.
“This is a lawless administration. The people are going to have to take over to force them to do the right thing,” Coard said.

MSF’s impossible choice shows Israel’s stranglehold on Gaza aid

MSF’s impossible choice shows Israel’s stranglehold on Gaza aid
In December 2023, just weeks after a Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) evacuation convoy was bombed, killing two people, MSF released a statement substantiating that the Israeli army was responsible for the attack. They affirmed that the convoy was following the route approved in coordination with the Israeli army.
Two days later, Israeli forces attacked the area around the MSF clinic in Gaza City, destroying MSF vehicles with a bulldozer and causing a wall of the clinic to collapse. Then a few more days following this incident, an Israeli tank destroyed an MSF minibus and the cars that had been sent to evacuate MSF staff at the clinic.
Since just October 7, Israel has killed hundreds of aid workers, far surpassing the number killed in other settings of heavy violence, including Sudan, Ukraine, and Somalia.
At least 15 of the aid workers killed were affiliated with MSF. Many were killed while working, and others whilst sheltering at home with their families.
It was then understandable that aid agencies pushed back when in December 2025, Israel announced new policies for humanitarian agencies working in Gaza, including turning over personal identifying information for every employee. This also included information about funding and operations, and adhering to ideological guidelines preventing support for international legal proceedings or boycotts.
Israel announced that 37 humanitarian agencies would thereby no longer be able to operate in Gaza, including MSF and others like the International Rescue Committee, the Norwegian Refugee Council, and Mercy Corps.
At the time, 53 international NGOs wrote a statement warning that this step would ‘set a dangerous precedent by extending Israeli authority over humanitarian operations in the occupied Palestinian territory, contrary to the internationally recognized legal framework governing the territory.’ The UN called the move, ‘the latest in a pattern of unlawful restrictions on humanitarian access.’
While some groups like Oxfam rejected the arrangement, MSF released a statement saying they has initially accepted Israel’s terms. They presented their decision as ‘an impossible choice: either we provide this information or abandon the hundreds of thousands of Palestinians who need vital medical care.’
It is true that due to Israel’s two year campaign of airstrikes, raids, siege, and displacement, widely recognised as genocide, there are significant medical needs across Gaza, including injuries, maternal and reproductive health, mental health treatment, infectious disease, chronic diseases, and malnutrition.
But the choice to hand over the personal information of their workers added another layer of threat to Palestinians remaining in Gaza, and another layer of Israeli control. As such, the move led to immediate backlash, including by Dr. Ghassan Abu Sitta, who argued that the choice to provide the information was one of “moral bankruptcy.”
On January 30, MSF released a new statement indicating a change of policy—they would no longer turn over any information to the Israeli authorities after ‘months of unsuccessful engagement with Israeli authorities,’ and their inability to secure assurances of staff safety and independence.
Humanitarian dependence had long been baked into the structure of the Israeli occupation, as well as the ineffective functioning of the Palestinian Authority since the Oslo Accords.
For decades, Israel has restricted all goods that could enter Gaza, and it tightened its restrictions even further multiple times since October 7, leading to famine. With no meaningful pushback on its actions, Israel has continued to shrink and restrict the space for humanitarian action, including banning UNRWA. It also recently destroyed its compound in occupied East Jerusalem.
The humanitarian paradigm across occupied Palestine has been one of destruction, restriction, and violence by Israeli forces, and the attempt by humanitarian agencies, both international and local, to fill in subsequent gaps in housing, education, and healthcare.
These agencies, however, must work within Israeli restrictions on movement of people and goods, as well as with the understanding that their staff are at real risk while they do their job.
The choice faced by MSF, to either acquiesce to Israel’s guidelines to be able to deliver care, or to protect their staff and independence but be denied access to a vulnerable and needy population, serves as a microcosm of this entire infrastructure. With the world’s political and financial support, Israel has built a system that allows it to both create massive humanitarian need and control how the response to that need is allowed to function.
At the whim of the Israeli government, lifelines for hundreds of thousands of people, living on occupied territory, can be cut off.
From the inception of the humanitarian industry in Palestine, many Palestinians and their allies have pushed back on this paradigm, arguing that part of the humanitarian mandate to save lives should include centring Palestinians and their needs, bearing witness to the atrocities they face, and using every tool at their disposal to push for accountability and an end to unlawful actions. Cooperating within the framework of those unlawful actions, even if the stated intention is to save lives, is to ultimately accept them.
Many credible figures and organisations have argued that Israel has committed the crime of genocide in the Gaza Strip, citing Israel’s siege as one of the techniques Israel has used in that campaign. While the tightest period of the siege may be over, Israel’s control of the humanitarian response in Gaza continues to grow more entrenched.
Undoubtedly, this will continue to cause avoidable death and injury, as millions live with inadequate shelter, food, water, and healthcare.
MSF’s short-lived decision to attempt to abide by Israel’s demands, yet unable to receive the guarantees to even do that safely, demonstrates that there is no end to this cycle of destruction and control.
Ultimately, it is not solely the responsibility of MSF, or any of the organisations working to deliver aid in Gaza, to hold the Israeli government accountable for its actions. Over the past century, an entire political and legal infrastructure was built to, purportedly, protect human rights and lives.
Over time, we have seen those protections eroded and disregarded in settings around the world, including across the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Many of the countries now condemning Israel’s policies around delivering aid to Palestinians and decrying the humanitarian catastrophes those policies have caused, watched idly for decades. For years they failed to speak out as Israel ignored warnings and condemnations while its government continued its explicitly stated goal to seize Palestinian land and force the displacement of the Palestinian people.
It remains unclear if Israel will maintain its position or be pressured to loosen the guidelines, and how NGOs will work in the future if the bans are enforced. But left unchecked, this type of behaviour will not be quelled. Until there are real consequences for Israel’s illegal actions towards the Palestinians, with the denial of aid being just one of them, Palestinians will continue to pay the price—with their lives, livelihoods, and land.

Swizerland's Loïc Meillard dominates alpine skiing at Milan–Cortina Games

Switzerland's Loïc Meillard dominates alpine skiing at Milan–Cortina Games
Switzerland’s Loïc Meillard led a commanding display in men’s alpine skiing at the Milan–Cortina Winter Olympics on Monday, securing a fourth Swiss victory in five events. China’s freestyle skiing star Eileen Gu claimed silver in the big air, and Japan celebrated a historic pairs figure skating triumph.
China’s freestyle skiing superstar Eileen Gu was beaten to gold for the second time at the Milan–Cortina Winter Olympics on Monday after Loïc Meillard extended Switzerland’s domination of men’s alpine skiing.
Gu was aiming to retain her big air title, one of the two golds she won four years ago when she was the darling of the Beijing Winter Games.
The withdrawal through injury of Switzerland’s Mathilde Gremaud, who beat Gu into second in the slopestyle event earlier in these Olympics, should have smoothed her path to victory.
But Gu came up against inspired Canadian Megan Oldham, who pulled out all the stops to win at Livigno Snow Park.
Gu even risked slipping out of medal position after a poor second attempt, but she came back impressively to score 89.00 with her final effort to propel her into the silver medal position.
However, Oldham’s cleaner skiing gave her a combined score of 180.75 to finish narrowly ahead of Gu (179.00), while Flora Tabanelli won bronze for Italy.
“It feels incredible,” said Oldham. “I’m still trying to process it all. It’s been such a dream of mine.”
Gu has not competed in big air, in which competitors take off from a large ramp and perform aerial tricks, since the Beijing Games.
The Californian-born 22-year-old, who also has a modelling career and is one of the most marketable women athletes in world sport, has now won two silver medals in Italy and has a final chance of gold when she competes in her favoured event, the halfpipe, on Saturday.
Her defeat on Monday means China has still not won a gold medal at the Milan–Cortina Winter Olympics, with six days of competition to go.

Swiss ski stranglehold
Meillard’s impressive victory in Bormio gave the Swiss four of the five golds on offer in men’s skiing at these Games.
Atle Lie McGrath looked on track to redress the balance in Norway’s favour when he led the slalom after the first run in Bormio.
But in the second leg McGrath hit a gate high on the course, ending his hopes.
Disgusted, he threw his poles away and lay in the snow, later collecting his bag and wandering off into the forest next to the course to reflect alone.
Instead, it was Meillard who took control of the race, clocking a winning time of 1min 53.61sec, with Austrian Fabio Gstrein winning silver, 0.35sec behind, and Henrik Kristoffersen rounding out the podium with a consolation bronze for Norway.
The slalom gold can be added to Franjo von Allmen’s downhill and super-G titles, while Switzerland also won the men’s team combined gold.
Meillard himself now has a full collection of medals from these Games, having also won bronze in the giant slalom and silver in the team combined event.
“Every medal is special,” he said. “To win the slalom in the Olympics one year after being world champion is very special.”
And he hailed the current strength of Swiss skiing.
“We’re living in a bit of a golden era in Switzerland in skiing,” he said.
“It’s crazy what’s been happening in the last few years, and so everyone has to enjoy it as much as possible because most likely we will not stay like that for the next 10 years.”

Miura and Kihara win title for Japan
Japan’s Riku Miura and Ryuichi Kihara pulled out the best performance of their careers to move from fifth overnight to grab Olympic figure skating pairs gold on Monday.
The Japanese had been trailing after errors in their short programme but sealed gold with a rousing performance to the “Gladiator” soundtrack to give their country not only a first Olympic gold medal in the pairs event, but a first medal of any colour.
They knelt on the ice and wept after their fast-moving and dynamic skate brought the crowd to their feet in the Milano Ice Skating Arena.
Their routine earned the Japanese personal best scores in both the free skate (158.13 points) and overall, with 231.24 points.
Georgia’s Anastasiia Metelkina and Luka Berulava took silver nearly ten points behind with 221.75, as overnight leaders Minerva Fabienne Hase and Nikita Volodin of Germany took bronze with 219.09.
Miura, 24, and 33-year-old Kihara had helped Japan win team silver for the second consecutive Olympics earlier in the Games.
But the two-time world champions thought they had let gold slip through their fingers on Sunday night as they trailed 6.9 points behind Hase and Volodin.
The Germans, silver medallists behind the Japanese at last year’s world championships, paid for mistakes in their free skate to music by Max Richter, achieving just fourth best in the free skate.
Metelkina and Berulava, who teamed up in 2023, moved up from third to second, having won the European title in January.
Defending Olympic champions Sui Wenjing and Han Cong of China finished fifth with 208.64 in their skate to “A Tapestry of a Legendary Land” after struggling with their jumps.
The Chinese pair only returned to competition this season after retiring following their Olympic triumph in Beijing four years ago.

Who are the Australians with IS links seeking to return from a Syrian displacement camp?
Unknown

In Brief
- A group of so-called "ISIS brides" remain in Syria after an unsuccessful attempt to return to Australia.
- The Opposition wants a special two-year exclusion order applied to them to block their return.
Prime Minister Anthony Albanese says a group of Australian women and children who have links to the self-proclaimed Islamic State (IS) group may face the full "force of the law" if they return home and are found to have committed offences.
Thirty-four Australians who had been living in the al-Roj displacement camp in northern Syria for several years and preparing to return to Australia on Monday were instead brought back to the camp due to what local authorities said were "technical reasons".
The Australian government "is not and will not repatriate people from Syria", a government spokesperson said in a statement.
Since the IS group was toppled in 2019, Australia has conducted two successful repatriation missions.
The Morrison government brought back eight orphaned children in June 2019, while the Albanese government repatriated four women and 13 children in October 2022.
Who are the women in the group?
The women had travelled or were taken to Syria to become partners of IS group members and have been living in the displacement camp after the collapse of the IS group in 2019.
The women are often referred to as 'ISIS brides', given their perceived or real links to IS group fighters.
Among those believed to be in the group is Kirsty Rosse-Emile, a Melbourne woman who travelled to Syria with her husband, Nabil Kadmiry, who was stripped of his citizenship in 2019.
Another woman from Melbourne, Zahra Ahmad, told SBS Dateline some women "had no choice but to follow" the men in her family who chose to join the IS group.
At the camp, she and her kids and 12 other Australian mothers sleep in tents next to an oilfield.
Over a dozen children are among the cohort.
Save the Children, which launched an unsuccessful legal bid against the government to repatriate the group, has expressed concern for the children's well-being.
"These kids haven't even seen a tree," CEO Matt Tinkler told Dateline last year.
"They're innocent Aussie kids, and they deserve to be home."
Syrian government forces seized swathes of northern Syria from the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces in January. They took over prisons and camps that housed IS fighters and their families from the Kurdish forces.
This came a year after the fall of the Assad regime.
Al-Roj camp, where the Australians live amongst 2,000 others, remains in the hands of the Kurdish forces, but the US believes it too will be taken over by the Syrian government.
Is the government helping them return to Australia?
The Australian government insists it's not helping them.
"We have a very firm view that we won't be providing assistance or repatriation," Albanese told ABC News.
"My mother would have said: 'If you make your bed, you lie in it'. These people went overseas supporting Islamic State and went there to provide support for people who basically want a caliphate."
However, the government has previously said that, as Australian citizens, they have entitlements that are not discretionary under law.
Last year, a group of six women and children made their way to Australia without the support of the government, after obtaining passports from Australia's Beirut embassy.
This is the same path the latest group are believed to be planning to undertake.
Liberal senator Jonathon Duniam said it was "not good enough" to allow them return.
"These people left Australia to go and be a part of something ... that is pure evil," he said on Monday.
"It is not okay for the government just to say: 'Oh, well, they're Australian citizens, they should come back.'"
He said a temporary exclusion order would prevent their arrival.
"During the two years that these temporary exclusion orders could apply, there are further conditions that can be imposed around where people are situated, what monitoring conditions and reporting conditions are in place, relating to these people and their movement in the community."
But the Greens said the government was responsible for protecting the children in the group.
"These are kids, 6-year-olds, many of them are victims of ISIS," Greens senator David Shoebridge said.
"The fact that Albanese is instead using this moment to put kids in danger and doing his best One Nation impression is disgusting. Children should not be held responsible for their parents' actions.
"It is a testament to how far the modern Laborr Party has fallen that we are looking back at the relative moral clarity of the Morrison government who managed to get children home safely from Syria."
What will happen to them if they return to Australia?
Albanese said that, while it was unfortunate that children were caught up in the issue, Australian law would apply if necessary.
"We want to make it clear, as we have to the people involved, if there are any breaches of the law, they will face the full force of the Australian law."
A group of women and children who had been repatriated by the government in 2022 were subject to voluntary orders, but some were not required to wear ankle bracelets, nor were they subject to terrorism control orders, reportedly because there was no legal basis for it.
However, some were interviewed by police upon their return.
A government spokesperson said Australian security agencies have been monitoring, and continue to monitor, the situation in Syria to ensure "they are prepared for any Australians seeking to return to Australia".
"The safety of Australians and the protection of Australia's national interests remain the overriding priority."
The statement echoed Albanese's claims that people would be prosecuted if they had committed crimes.

Andrew Hastie, Michaelia Cash and Matt O’Sullivan will be the only West Australian in Opposition Leader Angus Taylor’s new shadow cabinet.
Hastie has been given the title of shadow minister for industry and sovereign capability and deputy leader of the opposition in the upper house while Cash will take on the role of shadow attorney general and leader of the Senate.
Senator Matt O’Sullivan will take on childcare, early childhood, child protection and prevention of family violence portfolios.
Hastie’s elevation is a boon for the Canning MP who sensationally resigned from former leader Sussan Ley’s cabinet to speak out on issues like immigration.
In a statement Hastie said he was honoured to step up and fight for Aussie industry and advanced manufacturers.
“In a competitive and dangerous world, Australia must be able to sustain itself, and its closest allies,” he said.
“That’s why we must have a robust industrial base and sovereign manufacturing capability in peace and war.
“Right now, our industrial muscle is shrinking and wasting away inside Albanese’s Net Zero strait jacket.
“Massive energy costs are killing off our heavy industry and advanced manufacturing capability.
“Why? Because of Labor’s Net Zero obsession operating at the heart of the Australian economy.”
O’Sullivan said his agenda was clear: “parental choice must drive childcare policy. Families deserve the power to pick solutions tailored to their unique situations, not have their options restricted by government mandates.”

This is following a practice whereby election observers from parties report to their parties from the polling station the names of citizens who have actually voted, allowing party representatives to know which of their supporters have exercised their right to vote.

Anderson Cooper leaving 60 Minutes programme after nearly two decades in latest CBS News shakeup
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
LOS ANGELES - Anderson Cooper is leaving CBS News’ “60 Minutes” program after nearly two decades, in the latest staffing shake-up to hit the storied news magazine and network.
Cooper has been a “60 Minutes” correspondent through a deal between Paramount Skydance-owned CBS News and Warner Bros Discovery’s CNN since the 2006-2007 season, according to his page on the CBS News website.
“For nearly twenty years, I’ve been able to balance my jobs at CNN and CBS, but I have little kids now and I want to spend as much time with them as possible, while they still want to spend time with me,” Cooper said in a statement on Feb 16.
Cooper is the latest high-profile journalist to cut ties with CBS News since the arrival of Bari Weiss as the network’s new editor-in-chief in October 2025 following Paramount Skydance’s purchase of her outlet The Free Press.
Commenting on Cooper’s exit, CBS News said: “We’re grateful to him for dedicating so much of his life to this broadcast, and understand the importance of spending more time with family.”
Ms Weiss unveiled her strategy in January, saying she would add 19 new contributors and focus on bringing a “streaming mentality” to the network, which has consistently trailed in ratings to rivals ABC and NBC.
She is trying to revive the third-placed broadcast news network, which has been losing viewers in the age of social media and online information.
Ms Weiss had expressed interest in bringing Cooper to CBS News on a full-time basis, including the possibility of him anchoring the CBS Evening News program, according to a Puck news report.
Paramount Skydance did not immediately respond to Reuters’ request for comment.
Since the launch of CNN’s prime-time television news program “Anderson Cooper 360”, Cooper has covered major global news events, ranging from US presidential inaugurations and political conventions to the Newtown, Connecticut, school shooting.
He joined CNN in 2001 and has reported on the Iraq War, Hurricane Katrina and the Gulf of Mexico oil spill. Cooper signed a new contract with CNN in 2025.
The Breaker newsletter first reported Cooper’s departure from “60 Minutes”. REUTERS

Belgium summons US ambassador over antisemitism claims

Belgium’s Foreign Minister Maxime Prévot has summoned Bill White, the U.S. ambassador to the country, over his comments accusing Belgium of antisemitism and lashing out against its health minister.
“Any suggestion that Belgium is antisemitic is false, offensive, and unacceptable. Belgium condemns antisemitism with the greatest firmness,” Prévot wrote Monday evening in a long post on X, calling White’s statements “unacceptable.”
“Personal attacks against a Belgian minister and interference in judicial matters violate basic diplomatic norms … The Ambassador has been immediately summoned for a meeting this Tuesday,” Prévot continued.
White on Monday criticized Belgium’s handling of a case in Antwerp where three mohels — Jewish men who perform ritual circumcision — were placed under judicial investigation for allegedly carrying out procedures without a doctor being present. He also appeared to pressure Health Minister Frank Vandenbroucke to intervene in the case.
“TO BELGIUM, SPECIFICALLY YOU MUST DROP THE RIDICULOUS AND ANTI SEMITIC “PROSECUTION” NOW OF THE 3 JEWISH RELIGIOUS FIGURES (MOHELS) IN ANTWERP!” White wrote in his post.
White then turned on Vandenbroucke, calling him “very rude” and claiming that at their first encounter, Vandenbroucke had refused to shake his hand or pose for a photograph together in his conference room.
“You must make a legal provision to allow Jewish religious MOHELS to perform their duties here in Belgium,” White said. “Take action NOW! The world is watching. America is counting on you to do the right thing. Frank, you should do it NOW so this case ends!”
After Prévot expressed his disapproval on social media, White responded with another long post.
“In NO way, shape or form have we ever suggested that a political person in the Gov’t should interfere in a judicial case. That said, the case should be immediately dropped,” White wrote, adding that “it is ABSOLUTELY an issue of antisemitism.”
“You either have to make a change to the procedural accreditation or you have to call prosecution of these three beautiful religiously qualified and wonderful men anti-semeitc,” he continued, misspelling the last word.
White then lashed out at Vandenbroucke again. “He was very rude and was quite obnoxious. I was told he does not like my great President,” he wrote.
Belgian legislation mandates that all medical procedures be performed by licensed doctors, while mohels are usually not licensed. Some 60 Jewish leaders wrote a letter to Commission President Ursula von der Leyen last May, urging the EU to condemn Belgium after police raided the homes of several mohels in Antwerp.

At least 3 killed in shooting at Rhode Island ice skating rink

At least three people were killed Monday evening in a shooting at an ice rink in Rhode Island, United States, and three others were wounded and taken to hospitals. The exact nature of the incident remains unclear. U.S. media reported that a 4-year-old girl and another person were killed, and that the third fatality was the suspected gunman. Conflicting reports said the two victims were adults.
The shooting took place in the city of Pawtucket and reportedly occurred during a youth ice hockey game between teams from two local schools. The gunfire began around 2:30 p.m. local time at the Dennis M. Lynch Arena. Shots were fired from behind the bleachers, and witnesses said one father at the scene acted heroically by charging the shooter and managing to wrestle a gun away from him. However, the attacker was also armed with a second weapon.
Outside the arena, family members and teenagers who had participated in the hockey game — still wearing their team uniforms — were seen distraught, crying and embracing as they boarded a bus to leave the area. Roads surrounding the venue were closed, and a heavy police presence was reported, including helicopters circling overhead.
Pawtucket’s police chief told reporters that the three injured victims were hospitalized in serious condition and addressed the circumstances of the incident. “It appears this was a targeted event, possibly involving a family dispute,” she said. She declined to provide further details about the suspect or the victims, adding that authorities are continuing to investigate and interview witnesses.
The FBI said it was aware of the incident and was coordinating with local law enforcement partners. Rhode Island Governor Dan McKee said his office was monitoring developments. “I just spoke with the mayor and Rhode Island State Police, who are working in coordination with law enforcement agencies. I am praying for Pawtucket and for all those involved,” he said.
The Rhode Island shooting is the latest in a long string of gun violence incidents in the United States. In 2025 alone, there have been no fewer than 425 mass shootings nationwide, leaving 420 people dead and approximately 1,900 injured.
The spate of shootings has reignited the long-running public debate over gun control. Republican lawmakers and many of their voters continue to defend the Second Amendment, which guarantees Americans the right to bear arms, while Democrats are calling for significantly stricter limits on gun purchases and ownership in an effort to reduce the amount of firearms on the streets and improve public safety.

Robert Jenrick to be unveiled as Reform UK’s Treasury spokesman, reports say
Robert Jenrick will be unveiled as Reform’s chancellor-in-waiting alongside several other new appointments on Tuesday

Nigel Farage is reportedly set to name Robert Jenrick as Reform UK’s pick for chancellor, despite opposition from senior figures within the party.
The former Tory, who defected in January, will be unveiled as the Treasury spokesman during a press conference on Tuesday, along with several other senior appointments.
Mr Farage’s selection is said to be an attempt by Reform to show that they are getting ready to be in power, according toThe Times.
During the party’s rally in Romford on Monday, Mr Farage said: “I think the moment to properly move away from the potential criticism that we’re a one-man band has been there now for a few weeks, and that’s why I’m doing [these appointments].
“Am I concerned? No, I’m relieved actually. I’m relieved that other people are taking up these big areas, and from [a journalist’s] perspective, on a given issue, you will know who to call.”
The Tory defector’s appointment was said to be opposed by deputy leader Richard Tice and head of policy Zia Yusuf, the newspaper reported.
His appointment comes as Mr Farage tries to fend off criticism over the inexperience of the party’s senior leadership in government.
At a press conference on Tuesday, Mr Farage will also name Mr Yusuf as home affairs spokesman, Nadhim Zahawi will be in charge of foreign policy, and Mr Tice will be given a portfolio combining business and energy, which will include the responsibility of abandoning net zero.
The Reform leader is set to appoint the four spokespeople to “great offices of state” before the local council elections in May to try and secure voters.
Tory leader Kemi Badenoch sacked Mr Jenrick from her shadow cabinet last month after she claimed she had “irrefutable evidence” that he was secretly planning to defect from the party.
Mr Jenrick, who held the position of shadow justice secretary at the time of his appointment, announced he was joining Reform in a press conference with Nigel Farage just hours later.
His defection came days after former Tory chancellor Mr Zahawi defected to the party.
Thanking Ms Badenoch for “delivering” Mr Jenrick to Reform, Mr Farage said: “You’ve handed me on a plate the man that is by far the most popular figure, 60 per cent approval rating on ConHome … You’ve perhaps today, really done more than anybody in history to help realign the centre-right of British politics.”
During his announcement that he was joining Reform, Mr Jenrick said the Tories had “betrayed its voters and members”.
“I can’t kid myself any more,” he said, adding: “I can’t in good conscience stick with a party that’s failed so badly, that isn’t sorry and hasn’t changed, that I know in my heart won’t – can’t – deliver what’s needed.”
Mr Jenrick, who was elected as the Tory MP for Newark in 2014, was exchequer secretary under Theresa May in 2018-19, as well as holding roles as housing secretary and immigration secretary.

Intelligence names Kalashnikov subsidiaries not yet under sanctions
According to Ukrinform, the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine stated this on Facebook.
The Kalashnikov Concern is traditionally associated with small arms, but in reality its production is a diversified element of Russia's military-industrial complex and is directly involved in supporting the aggressive war against Ukraine, the intelligence agency noted.
The concern's enterprises manufacture reconnaissance and strike UAVs, guided artillery munitions, high-speed landing craft, equipment for the Russian Armed Forces, as well as machine tools for other Russian defense enterprises.
Despite playing a critical role in military production, nearly half of the concern's enterprises are still not under sanctions by any country in the sanctions coalition.
Among them are LLC Design Bureau Luggard, a developer of thermal imaging sights and laser rangefinders; the Kalashnikov industrial cluster, where small arms, specialized equipment, clothing, and gear for special forces units are produced; and the Kalashnikov Academy training center, which trains specialists in robotics, artificial intelligence, and the development and modernization of UAVs for the concern's enterprises.
The concern has become the sixth holding of the Rostec corporation whose data have been published in the "Military-Industrial Complex of the Aggressor" section of the War&Sanctions portal.
The total list of Rostec enterprises already published on the portal includes nearly 500 companies, each with a complete set of data necessary for inclusion in sanctions lists and responsible business stop-lists.
Russia's military-industrial complex must be fully isolated from global markets, technologies, finances, and supply chains, the intelligence agency emphasized.
As previously reported, Ukrainian intelligence also published data on 21 Russian enterprises involved in the development and production of unmanned systems.

‘Unconscionable’: Westpac lashed by judge after dispute over $44.11

‘Unconscionable’: Westpac lashed by judge after dispute over $44.11
A NSW Supreme Court judge has accused Westpac of lacking “basic commercial morality” after he was forced to demand its chief executive Anthony Miller appear in court to fix a mortgage issue worth just $40 that left one of its customers unable to buy a home.
Fiona Vinall, who is suing Westpac-owned St George for misleading and deceptive conduct, scored a victory on Monday when justice David Hammerschlag ordered the bank to remove any adverse credit information about her from reporting agency Equifax Australia.
Vinall’s dispute with the bank began after her mortgage repayments fell last July following an interest rate decrease. She inadvertently began repaying at the reduced rate a month early based on her reading of the bank’s emails, which informed her that the new rate began “after July 10 2025.” The bank understood this to mean that the lower rate kicked in the following month. Justice Hammerschlag described St George’s emails about the rate increase “at best ambiguous, and at worst likely to mislead”.
Either way, Vinall subsequently incurred a $44.11 shortfall, which the bank reported to credit reporting bodies as “adverse repayment history information”. Under federal legislation, banks are required to inform credit rating agencies of such shortfalls within 14 days.
The court heard that this led to a substantial deterioration in Vinall’s credit rating. Later last year, Vinall bought a new home for herself and daughter in Box Hill, Western Sydney, but was unable to settle on the property because mortgage brokers said her credit rating made new lending impossible.
Even though the shortfall had been made up by August, the bank had, Hammerschlag said, been “obdurate” in refusing to remove the adverse credit notice at Vinall’s request. She then commenced legal proceedings, all over just $44.11.
At a preliminary hearing in January, nobody appeared for St George because notice of the proceedings had not reached an appropriate destination within the bank despite the Vinall’s lawyers contacting Westpac via email as authorised by the court.
“The plaintiff tried to contact the bank more than once during the day, without being able to achieve any response,” Hammershlag said. Staff for another judge overseeing that hearing, Justice Michael Slattery, also tried to contact the bank to no avail. Slattery then ordered the removal of the black mark on Vinall’s credit.
But at a subsequent hearing on February 6, when the bank eventually sent lawyers along, it was unwilling to back down and remove the adverse credit information.
“The bank arrived, represented by counsel and armed with an affidavit from a bank officer seeking to defend the indefensible,” Hammerschlag said.
Westpac argued that it was powerless to change Vinall’s adverse credit information provided to third parties. It said it could only ask Equifax for a change, which it had not done. That approach won few favours with the judge.
Hammerschlag demanded that Westpac chief executive Anthony Miller appear in court at the next hearing three days later, a step he described as “unusual but not unknown”.
Over the weekend, Westpac moved quickly. The bank’s solicitors told Hammerschlag that they had successfully taken steps to remove Vinall’s adverse payment history from credit registers. Miller was excused from appearing in court.
In his judgment, Hammerschlag was scathing about Westpac’s conduct.
“I regard the refusal of the bank to fix the problem as legally unjustifiable and short on commercial morality,” he said.
“Having regard to the de minimis [trivial] dimensions of the shortfall, the substantially unequal bargaining position of the parties, the profound adverse consequences for the plaintiff of the adverse credit reporting being maintained … not taking steps to erase the recorded event was unconscionable.”
The matter is set to be transferred to the District Court, which will hear Vinall’s claim for damages.
In a statement, a Westpac spokesperson said the bank acknowledged the judgment and would assess implications, but declined to comment further as the matter remains before the court.
“Westpac complies with mandatory credit reporting obligations under law, which require missed repayments to be reported to credit agencies,” the spokesperson said.
Equifax was contacted for comment.
Westpac was also ordered to pay Vinall’s costs, which no doubt amounted to more than $44.11.

Five women assaulted in five days as the Kimberley’s cycle of violence continues

Five women assaulted in five days as the Kimberley’s cycle of violence continues
Authorities say they are deeply concerned after five women were seriously injured in domestic violence incidents in Western Australia’s north last week.
The incidents began on February 7, when a woman was assaulted by her aunt. Not even 24 hours later, a separate woman was also assaulted by her uncle.
Two women were also stabbed in separate incidents, and a woman was run over by a man believed to be her partner in a car on Thursday, in Derby’s town centre.
The incidents mark a spike in domestic violence in the region, which often happens during the wet season.
Crime statistics also released on Monday show Derby experienced a total of 753 family violence offences last year, which is about 233 offences per 1000 people.
This is compared with the City of Perth, which is about 12.5 offences per 1000 people.
Anglicare WA provides family and domestic violence services in the Kimberley and said it was critical the situation was addressed.
“Anglicare sees firsthand the impact these incidents have on individuals, children, extended family and the whole community,” a spokesperson said.
“Anglicare WA is deeply concerned by the levels of violence that have recently occurred in the Kimberley.
“Violence is never acceptable, and it is critical that people know support is available, and we urge anyone at risk to reach out for support.”
WA Prevention of Domestic Violence Minister Jessica Stojkovski said it was crucial Derby locals knew support was available.
“It is distressing to hear about reports of family and domestic violence incidents,” she said.
“Family and domestic violence has a profound impact on communities and culturally led and community-driven responses are critical to support healing and safety.”
She said more than $700 million has been invested in addressing domestic violence in WA since 2017, with $6 million dollars going to the west Kimberley alone in the current financial year.
“This includes primary prevention, advocacy and support services, mobile outreach services, perpetrator programs, two refuges and one safe house,” Stojkovski said.
While frontline services are consistently working across the region to prevent and address domestic violence, the Aboriginal Family Legal Services and Kimberley Community Legal Services said in a joint statement the most recent incidents were illustrative of a bigger issue.
“[Both organisations] are deeply concerned about the growing number of family and domestic violence matters in Derby and across the Kimberley that are not resulting in successful prosecutions,” the statement said.
Both organisations highlighted even after incidents of domestic violence, survivors were technically still at risk due to a court system that wasn’t fit for purpose.
“In regional areas like the Kimberley, limited service capacity, cultural and community pressures, coercive control, and safety concerns can prevent victim survivors from attending court, leading to cases collapsing and people remaining at risk,” the statement said.
Kimberley Community Legal Services chief executive Matt Panayi said his organisation had experienced firsthand how difficult it could be for victims to get out of dangerous situations.
“In one matter, a woman who had fled a violent partner was not notified by police that charges had been laid, a trial date had been set, or that the matter had later been postponed,” Mr Panayi said.
“Without KCLS intervening to obtain basic information, engage victim support services to arrange special witness protections, and ensure she could give evidence safely by video link, the prosecution was at serious risk of collapsing.”
Panayi said the issue was all too common in the Kimberley, and it was leaving victims exposed.
“This experience is not unique and reflects a wider pattern where victim survivors are being left without coordinated support, communication, or advocacy at critical stages of the justice process,” he said.
Aboriginal Family Legal Services chief executive Corina Martin said the recent violence in Derby highlighted the cycle many people had found themselves in.
“Community led, culturally safe support is essential to help victim survivors stay safe and stay engaged in the justice process,” she said.

Oscar-winning filmmaker Frederick Wiseman dead at 96

Frederick Wiseman, the celebrated director of Titicut Follies and dozens of other documentaries whose in-depth, unadorned movies comprised a unique and revelatory history of American institutions, died Monday, February 16, at age 96.
The death was announced in a joint statement from his family and from his production company, Zipporah Films. Additional details were not immediately available. "He will be deeply missed by his family, friends, colleagues, and the countless filmmakers and audiences around the world whose lives and perspectives were shaped by his unique vision," the statement reads in part.
Among the world's most admired and influential filmmakers, Wiseman won an honorary Academy Award in 2016 and completed more than 35 documentaries, some several hours long. With subjects ranging from a suburban high school to a horse race track, his work aired on public television, screened at retrospectives, was spotlighted in festivals and praised by critics and fellow directors. Wiseman was in his mid-30s before he made his first full-length movie, but was soon ranked with – and sometimes above – such celebrated peers as D. A. Pennebaker and Robert Drew for helping to establish the modern documentary as a vital and surprising art form.
Seamless, affecting style
Starting with High School and the scandalous Titicut Follies he patented a seamless, affecting style, using a crew so tiny that Wiseman served as his own sound engineer. The results led to acclaim, amusement, head-shaking, finger-pointing and – with Titicut Follies – prolonged legal action.
He was as adventurous in his 80s and 90s as he was in his 30s, making Crazy Horse about the erotic Parisian dance revue, the 4-hour At Berkeley, about the California state university, and the 2 1-2 hour Monrovia, Indiana about an aging rural community. Wiseman also had a long career in theater, staging plays by Samuel Beckett and William Luce among others and adapting his movie Welfare into an opera. In 2025, he had brief acting roles in two acclaimed movies – as a poet in Jane Austen Wrecked My Life and off-screen as a radio announcer in Eephus.

Judge orders Trump administration to restore Washington slavery exhibit it removed in Philadelphia

Judge orders reversal of Trump decision to remove George Washington slavery exhibit
The exhibit's removal was a direct consequence of a Trump executive order
- Bookmark
A federal judge has mandated the immediate restoration of an exhibit detailing the lives of nine enslaved people owned by George Washington, following its controversial removal by the Trump administration. The ruling, delivered on President's Day, requires the display to be reinstated at Washington's former Philadelphia residence.
The city of Philadelphia initiated legal action in January after the National Park Service dismantled the explanatory panels at Independence National Historical Park. This site served as home to George and Martha Washington, along with nine of their enslaved individuals, during the 1790s when Philadelphia briefly held the status of the nation’s capital.
The exhibit's removal was a direct consequence of a Trump executive order aimed at "restoring truth and sanity to American history" across national museums, parks, and landmarks. This directive instructed the Interior Department to ensure such sites avoid displaying elements that "inappropriately disparage Americans past or living."
U.S. District Judge Cynthia Rufe ruled on Monday that all original materials must be restored while the lawsuit challenging the removal's legality proceeds. She explicitly prohibited officials from the Trump administration from installing any replacement exhibits that offer a different historical interpretation.
Rufe, an appointee of Republican President George W. Bush, began her written order with a quote from George Orwell’s dystopian novel “1984” and compared the Trump administration to the book's totalitarian regime called the Ministry of Truth, which revised historical records to align with its own narrative.
“As if the Ministry of Truth in George Orwell’s 1984 now existed, with its motto ‘Ignorance is Strength,’ this Court is now asked to determine whether the federal government has the power it claims — to dissemble and disassemble historical truths when it has some domain over historical facts," Rufe wrote. “It does not.”
She had warned Justice Department lawyers during a January hearing that they were making “dangerous” and “horrifying” statements when they said Trump officials can choose which parts of U.S. history to display at National Park Service sites.
The Interior Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the ruling, which came while government offices were closed for the federal holiday.
The judge did not provide a timeline for when the exhibit must be restored. Federal officials can appeal the ruling.
The historical site is among several where the administration has quietly removed content about the history of enslaved people, LGBTQ+ people and Native Americans.
Signage that has disappeared from Grand Canyon National Park said settlers pushed Native American tribes “off their land” for the park to be established and “exploited” the landscape for mining and grazing.
Last week, a rainbow flag was taken down at the Stonewall National Monument, where bar patrons rebelled against a police raid and catalyzed the modern LGBTQ+ rights movement. The administration has also removed references to transgender people from its webpage about the monument, despite several trans women of color being key figures in the uprising.
The Philadelphia exhibit, created two decades ago in a partnership between the city and federal officials, included biographical details about each of the nine people enslaved by the Washingtons at the home, including two who escaped.
Among them was Oney Judge, who was born into slavery at the family’s plantation in Mount Vernon, Virginia, and later escaped from their Philadelphia house in 1796. Judge fled north to New Hampshire, a free state, while Washington had her declared a fugitive and published advertisements seeking her return.
Because Judge had escaped from the Philadelphia house, the park service in 2022 supported the site's inclusion in a national network of Underground Railroad sites where they would teach about abolitionists and escaped slaves. Rufe noted that materials about Judge were among those removed, which she said “conceals crucial information linking the site to the Network to Freedom.”
Only the names of Judge and the other eight enslaved people — Austin, Paris, Hercules, Richmond, Giles, Moll and Joe, who each had a single name, and Christopher Sheels — remained engraved in a cement wall after park service employees took a crowbar to the plaques on Jan. 22.
Hercules also escaped in 1797 after he was brought to Mount Vernon, where the Washingtons had many other slaves. He reached New York City despite being declared a fugitive slave and lived under the name Hercules Posey.
Several local politicians and Black community leaders celebrated the ruling, which came while many were out rallying at the site for its restoration.
State Rep. Malcolm Kenyatta, a Philadelphia Democrat, said the community prevailed against an attempt by the Trump administration to “whitewash our history.”
“Philadelphians fought back, and I could not be more proud of how we stood together,” he said.

‘Like a Virgin’ and ‘Eternal Flame’ songwriter Billy Steinberg dies at 75
Together with his songwriting partner Tom Kelly, Steinberg wrote some of the biggest hits of the 1980s

Billy Steinberg, who co-wrote some of the biggest hit songs of the 1980s, has died. He was 75.
The Fresno-born songwriter, primarily a lyricist, formed a partnership with musician Tom Kelly. They were behind a string of number one hits including Madonna’s “Like a Virgin”, Cyndi Lauper’s “True Colors”, the Bangles’ “Eternal Flame”, Whitney Houston’s “So Emotional” and Heart’s “Alone.”
Steinberg died Monday after a long battle with cancer, his attorney Laurie Soriano told The Independent.
He was born William Steinberg on February 26, 1950, and grew up in Palm Springs, the son of a successful grape farmer. He studied literature at Bard College in upstate New York.
In 1980, when Steinberg was 30, his band Billy Thermal was signed to a record contract by producer Richard Perry. Although the group never released an album, one of Steinberg’s songs “How Do I Make You” was covered by Linda Ronstadt and became a top 10 hit. Two more of his songs were covered by Pat Benatar.
The following summer Steinberg met Kelly, who had also written for Benatar, at a party. They decided to form a songwriting team, with Steinberg focusing on lyrics and Kelly writing the music.
In 1983, while working at one of his father’s vineyards, Steinberg wrote the lyrics to “Like a Virgin”. Kelly recorded it as a demo which made its way to Madonna, who recorded it as the title track for her second album with producer Nile Rodgers. The single became a huge hit in 1984, spending six weeks at the top of the U.S. charts.
Neither Steinberg or Kelly met Madonna until after the song had become a huge hit. Writing on his personal website, Steinberg recalled that they were eventually introduced to her at a Hollywood party that the pop star was attending with her then-partner Warren Beatty.
“Warren Beatty started to laugh, thinking it was a joke because Madonna would have surely already known the writers of her signature song,” wrote Steinberg. “I gave her my biggest smile and said, ‘Madonna, I’ve wanted to meet you for so long.’ She said, ‘Well, now you did,’ grabbed Warren and walked away. I was devastated. Tom started to laugh... I think it’s funny now. And I’ve never met Madonna since.”
After the success of that song, Steinberg and Kelly continued to work together productively on a string of hit singles, including Roy Orbison’s “I Drove All Night”, Divinyls’ “I Touch Myself” and The Pretenders’ “I’ll Stand by You.”
After Kelly retired in the 1990s, Steinberg had further success writing or co-writing songs including Celine Dion’s “Falling Into You” and Demi Lovato’s “Give Your Heart a Break.”
Steinberg is survived by his wife, Trina; his sons, Ezra and Max; his sisters, Barbara and Mary; and his stepchildren, Raul and Carolina.
In a statement shared with The Independent, Ezra Steinberg said: “As a father, he passed down not only his love of music, but his discipline, integrity, and reverence for great songwriting. He believed in building things that last — in art, in relationships, and in legacy.”

Ukraine regains over 200 sq km in five days – AFP
Ukraine's defence forces have regained 201 sq km of territory from Russian troops between 11 and 15 February, marking the fastest advance by Ukrainian forces in more than two and a half years.
Source: AFP's analysis of data from the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), as reported by France24
Details: The area of liberated territory is said to be almost equal to the total gains made by Russian forces over the whole of December 2025.
This is Ukraine's largest territorial success over such a short period since the counteroffensive launched in June 2023.
"These Ukrainian counterattacks are likely leveraging the recent block on Russian forces' access to Starlink, which Russian milbloggers have claimed is causing communications and command and control (C2) issues on the battlefield," the ISW report said.
The main Ukrainian advance has been recorded roughly 80 kilometres east of Zaporizhzhia, where Russian forces had been making gains since the summer of 2025. Ukrainian forces have also regained control of territory on the Kharkiv, Kostiantynivka, Pokrovsk and Novopavlivka fronts.
Background:
- Earlier, Russian Shahed drones began using Starlink satellite communications to bypass electronic warfare systems and conduct more precise strikes on targets inside Ukraine.
- On 2 February, Ukraine, in collaboration with SpaceX, introduced Starlink terminal verification.
- On 5 February, military observers reported widespread disruptions to the Starlink systems used by Russian forces along the line of contact.
- On 10 February, Ukraine's Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of Prisoners of War said that Russian forces were blackmailing the families of Ukrainian POWs, forcing them to register Starlink terminals in their own names.
- On 12 February, it emerged that the 256th Cyber Assault Division, together with InformNapalm and MILITAN, had collected information on 2,420 Russian Starlink terminals and the precise positions of Russian forces in order to block them.

Two British skiers killed in French Alps named

Two British skiers who died in an avalanche in the French Alps have been named as Stuart Leslie and Shaun Overy.
The pair were part of a group of five people, accompanied by an instructor, skiing off-piste in Val d’Isère in south-east France on Friday when they were swept away by falling snow.
A French national who was skiing alone was also killed, while another British skier survived.
France’s national weather service had issued a red alert for avalanche risk on Thursday – only the third time such a warning has been given in the 25 years since the system was introduced, according to Le Monde.
Leslie, 46, who regularly posted on social media about his skiing adventures, is believed to have been friends with Overy, 51, who ran a plumbing company in Wimbledon.
Paying tribute to Leslie on social media, friend Craig Hunter said: “We have lost a true legend – our beautiful Stuart.”
“He lived life to the absolute maximum – he packed 10 men’s lives into one. He squeezed everything out of every moment.
“When we skied together, he was at his happiest. He always said there was no better feeling in life, skiing fresh powder was pure freedom.”
Benoît Bachelet, the Albertville prosecutor, said a manslaughter investigation had been launched. The ski instructor, who was uninjured, tested negative for drugs.
This incident follows the death of another British skier in his 50s in an avalanche at the nearby La Plagne resort in January.
Thirteen backcountry skiers, climbers and hikers died in the Italian mountains in the first week of February amid unstable snow conditions.
A train was derailed by a snow slide in Switzerland on Monday as large areas of the western Alps remained under a high risk of avalanche.

Almost 30 arrested after female IDF soldiers chased through the streets of Tel Aviv
- Israeli police arrested 28 people after a large mob of ultra-Orthodox men chased two female IDF soldiers through the streets of Bnei Brak, east of Tel Aviv.
- The riots, sparked by anger over military conscription orders, resulted in a police patrol car being overturned, a police motorcycle set alight, and five officers injured.
- Most of the 28 Haredi men and teenagers arrested have since been freed, with a lawyer claiming a lack of evidence, though two suspects were ordered to five days of house arrest.
- Police are continuing their search for the individuals responsible for damaging the police vehicles during the unrest.
- The violence follows a 2024 Supreme Court ruling that ended a long-standing exemption for Haredi Jews from military conscription, with opposition leader Yair Lapid condemning the government's response to such incidents.

Cuban drivers face waiting several months wait for gasoline in government app designed to reduce lines

Cuban drivers face waiting several months wait for gasoline in government app designed to reduce lines
The app only allows drivers to sign up for appointments at one gas station at a time
- Bookmark
Cuban drivers face waits of several months to refuel their vehicles, as intensifying fuel shortages, exacerbated by a US oil embargo, grip the island.
To prevent chaos at petrol stations, Cuba’s government last week mandated an app, 'Ticket', for booking refuelling appointments.
However, drivers in Havana told The Associated Press on Monday that the app is only providing slots weeks or months from now.
“I have (appointment) number seven thousand and something,” said Jorge Reyes, a 65-year-old who downloaded the app on Monday.
Reyes signed up to refuel at a gas station in Havana that is only awarding 50 appointments per day. “When will I be able to buy gas again?” he said.
The app only allows drivers to sign up for appointments at one gas station at a time. So, on WhatsApp groups some drivers are sharing information on which places might be less crowded or which gas stations have a greater capacity to serve customers, noting that some locations are awarding up to 90 appointments per day.
But that is of little comfort to those who have downloaded the app, only to find out there are up to 10,000 appointments ahead of theirs.
The Cuban government has also stopped selling gasoline in local currency at subsidized rates of about 25 cents per liter, and is now only selling more expensive fuel, priced in U.S. dollars.
A liter of gasoline currently sells for $1.30 at gas stations and can cost up to six dollars in the growing black market for gasoline. Government workers in Cuba are earn less than $20 a month, when their earnings in Cuban pesos are converted to U.S. dollars using market rates.
When drivers can finally refuel at service stations, they are only allowed to buy 20 liters of gasoline, or about 5.2 gallons.
“This will not last me long,” said Ariel Alonso, a businessman who refueled Monday at the El Riviera gas station.
“I have to leave a reserve of five liters in case anyone gets sick at home,” and has to be taken to the hospital, he said.
The Ticket app is run by XETID, a state owned software firm. Last week, the company’s commercial director Saumel Tejada, told news site Cuba Debate that more than 90,000 drivers had sought refueling appointments using the app.
Ticket has been around for three years, and was previously used by Cubans to secure appointments at notaries and at gas stations where they could pay for fuel in local currency. But now it is almost the only way for drivers to get their cars refueled — without going to the black market.
Vehicles used for the island’s tourism industry are the exception. Those cars have special license plates and are allowed to refuel at 44 service stations around the island, where long lines have formed. As with regular vehicles, tourism cars can only purchase 20 liters of fuel.
Fuels shortages and blackouts have been intensifying in Cuba this month, as the nation struggles to import oil for its power plants and refineries.
In late January, U.S. President Donald Trump threatened any nation that sold oil to Cuba with tariffs, as Washington steps up efforts to pressure the island’s communist government to make economic and political reforms.
Cuba’s president Miguel Díaz-Canel has said that he is willing to negotiate with the U.S. “as equals” and without relinquishing his nations sovereignty. Díaz-Canel has accused the U.S. of staging an “energy blockade.”
Venezuela, one of Cuba’s main oil suppliers, stopped selling crude to the island in January after the U.S. captured then president Nicolás Maduro in a pre-dawn raid and flew him to New York to face drug trafficking charges.
Mexico also cut off oil shipments to Cuba in January, after Trump issued the tariff threat.
Banks on the island have reduced their working hours in a bid to save electricity and earlier this month the Cuban government said that it will not provide fuel to planes that land on the island, prompting three Canadian airlines to cancel flights to Cuba. Other airlines will continue to fly to the island but will make refueling stops in the Dominican Republic.
A book fair and an annual cigar trade fair have also been postponed as officials look for ways to reduce fuel and electricity consumption.
Last week a group of United Nations human rights experts condemned the U.S oil siege, saying that it has “no basis on collective security and constitutes a unilateral act that is incompatible with international law.”

Minister highlights the UK areas that should take more migrants
- Denmark's employment minister, Kaare Dybvad Bek, suggested the UK should ensure areas like Somerset take their fair share of migrants, noting the disparity in diversity between southern and northern England.
- Mr Dybvad Bek, from Denmark's centre-left Social Democratic Party, criticised the segregation of towns and cities, advocating for a society where everyone has the same rights regardless of ethnic or religious background.
- He defended Denmark's radical immigration reforms, including the 'Ghetto law,' which permits the demolition of apartment blocks in areas with high 'non-Western' populations to promote integration.
- The minister explained that these measures aim to prevent social problems in detached areas and encourage residents to understand Danish society and norms.
- Mr Dybvad Bek warned that centrist parties across Europe must gain democratic control over migration flows to prevent the rise of populist governments.

US deploys 100 soldiers to Nigeria as attacks by armed groups surge
The US soldiers will not have a combat role and are to operate under the full command authority of Nigeria’s military.
The United States has sent 100 military personnel to northern Nigeria to train and advise local forces, as deadly threats rise from armed groups such as Boko Haram and ISIL (ISIS)-linked factions.
Samaila Uba, Nigeria’s Defence Headquarters spokesman, confirmed the US troops’ arrival in the northeastern area of Bauchi on Monday.

He said they will provide “technical support” and “intelligence sharing” to help target and defeat “terrorist organisations”. The US also sent “associated equipment” to support the mission.
Uba stressed that the US soldiers will not play a direct combat role, but will share technical expertise under the full command authority of Nigerian forces.
“The armed forces of Nigeria remain fully committed to degrading and defeating terrorist organisations that threaten the country’s sovereignty, national security, and the safety of its citizens,” said the military spokesman in comments carried by Nigeria’s Premium Times newspaper.
Last weekend, gunmen on motorcycles rampaged through three villages in northern Nigeria, killing at least 46 people and abducting many others. The bloodiest attack happened in the village of Konkoso, in Niger State, where at least 38 people were shot dead or had their throats slit.
Protracted fight
The US deployment follows an easing of tensions that flared between Washington and Nigeria late last year, when US President Donald Trump accused the country of failing to stop killings against Christians and threatened to intervene militarily.
The Nigerian government has rejected Trump’s accusation, and analysts say people across all faiths, not just Christians, are victims of armed groups’ violence
In December, US forces launched air strikes on ISIL-affiliated fighters in the country’s northwest. Last month, following discussions with Nigerian authorities in Abuja, the head of US Africa Command confirmed that a small team of US military officers were in Nigeria, focused on intelligence support.
Nigeria is facing a protracted fight with dozens of local armed groups increasingly battling for turf, including the homegrown Boko Haram and its breakaway faction, the ISIL affiliate in West Africa Province (ISWAP).
There is also the ISIL-linked Lakurawa, as well as other “bandit” groups that specialise in kidnapping for ransom and illegal mining.
Recently, the crisis worsened to include other fighters from the neighbouring Sahel region, including the Jama’at Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin, which claimed its first attack on Nigerian soil last year.
Several thousand people in Nigeria have been killed, according to data from the United Nations.
While Christians have been among those targeted, analysts and residents say the majority of victims of the armed groups are Muslims in the Muslim-dominated north, where most attacks occur.
Nigeria’s 240 million people are evenly split between Christians, mainly in the south, and Muslims, mostly in the north.

France and its Rafale aircraft reached another milestone on Thursday, February 12. Just days before Emmanuel Macron's official visit to India, New Delhi approved the purchase of 114 Rafale fighter jets from Dassault Aviation for 3.25 trillion rupees (€30.2 billion). Still, the deal is not yet finalized. The French president needs to negotiate the technical and commercial "details" of this key contract for the French aerospace manufacturer.
India had already ordered 36 Rafale jets for its air force in 2015 and another 26 for its navy in 2025. The Elysée hailed a "very important milestone" toward a "historic" contract, according to an adviser to the president during a briefing about the upcoming state visit from February 17 to 19. "Now, discussions [between the manufacturer Dassault and the Indian Air Force] will continue; they are very positive, but they are still ongoing," the adviser emphasized.
The world's largest arms importer, India, announced in early February yet another increase in military spending: up 15% to a total of $85 billion (€71 billion). This represents a windfall for French defense firms, whose business model relies heavily on exports. But it also poses a challenge, as Indian officials are determined to secure more investment in the country and technology transfers as part of any deal.

Oscar-winning filmmaker Frederick Wiseman dies, leaving legacy of American institutions
Oscar-winning documentary maker Frederick Wiseman is dead at age 96
- Bookmark
Frederick Wiseman, the celebrated director of “Titicut Follies” and dozens of other documentaries whose in-depth, unadorned movies comprised a unique and revelatory history of American institutions, died Monday at age 96.
The death was announced in a joint statement from his family and from his production company, Zipporah Films. Additional details were not immediately available.
“He will be deeply missed by his family, friends, colleagues, and the countless filmmakers and audiences around the world whose lives and perspectives were shaped by his unique vision,” the statement reads in part.
Among the world's most admired and influential filmmakers, Wiseman won an honorary Academy Award in 2016 and completed more than 35 documentaries, some several hours long. With subjects ranging from a suburban high school to a horse race track, his work aired on public television, screened at retrospectives, was spotlighted in festivals and praised by critics and fellow directors. Wiseman was in his mid-30s before he made his first full-length movie, but was soon ranked with — and sometimes above — such celebrated peers as D.A. Pennebaker and Robert Drew for helping to establish the modern documentary as a vital and surprising art form.
Starting with “High School" and the scandalous “Titicut Follies," he patented a seamless, affecting style, using a crew so tiny that Wiseman served as his own sound engineer. The results led to acclaim, amusement, head-shaking, finger-pointing and — with “Titicut Follies" — prolonged legal action.
“I don't set out to be confrontational, but I think sometimes the content of the movie runs against people's expectations and fantasies about the subject matter," Wiseman told Gawker in 2013.
Wiseman's vision was to make “as many films as possible about different aspects of American life," and he often gave his documentaries self-explanatory titles: “Hospital," “Public Housing," “Basic Training," “Boxing Gym." But he also dramatized how people functioned within those settings: an elderly welfare applicant begging for assistance, a military trainee complaining of harassment, a doctor trying to coax coherent answers out of a dazed heroin addict, sales clerks at Neiman Marcus rehearsing their smiles.
“The institution is also just an excuse to observe human behavior in somewhat defined conditions,” Wiseman told The Associated Press in 2020. “The films are as much about that as they are about institutions."
The bitter and the sweet
For “Titicut Follies," which premiered in 1967, Wiseman visited the Massachusetts-based Bridgewater State Hospital for the criminally insane. He amassed footage of nude men being baited by sadistic guards and one inmate being force-fed as he lies on a table, liquid pouring down a rubber hose shoved into his nose. The images were so appalling and embarrassing that state officials successfully restricted its release, giving the film exalted status among those determined to see it.
In “High School," released in 1968, Wiseman recorded daily life in a suburban Philadelphia school. He filmed a student being questioned about whether he has permission to make a phone call, an English teacher earnestly analyzing the lyrics of Simon & Garfunkel's “The Dangling Conversation," an awkward sex education class in which boys are told the more active they are, the more insecure they must be.
“What we see in Fred Wiseman's documentary ... is so familiar and so extraordinarily evocative that a feeling of empathy with the students floods over us," The New Yorker's Pauline Kael wrote. “Wiseman extends our understanding of our common life the way novelists used to."
Wiseman made movies without narration, prerecorded soundtracks and title cards. But he disputed, forcefully, that he was part of the “cinema verite" movement of the 1960s and '70s, calling it a “pompous French term that has absolutely no meaning."
Oscar winner Errol Morris dubbed him “the undisputed king of misanthropic cinema," but Wiseman insisted that he was not a muckraker out to correct injustice. He saw himself as a subjective, but fair-minded and engaged observer who discovered through the work itself how he felt about a given project, combing through hundreds of hours of footage and unearthing a story — sometimes despairing, sometimes hopeful. For “High School II," he visited a school in East Harlem in the 1990s, and was impressed by the commitment of the teachers and administrators.
“I think it's as important to document kindness, civility and generosity of spirit as it is to show cruelty, banality and indifference," Wiseman said when he accepted his honorary Oscar.
He was as adventurous in his 80s and 90s as he was in his 30s, making “Crazy Horse" about the erotic Parisian dance revue, the 4-hour “At Berkeley," about the California state university, and the 2 1-2 hour “Monrovia, Indiana” about an aging rural community. Wiseman also had a long career in theater, staging plays by Samuel Beckett and William Luce among others and adapting his movie “Welfare" into an opera. In 2025, he had brief acting roles in two acclaimed movies — as a poet in “Jane Austen Wrecked My Life” and off-screen as a radio announcer in “Eephus."
Much of his own work was made through Zipporah, named for his wife, who died in 2021. They had two children.
The poetry of life
Wiseman was born in Boston, his father a prominent attorney, his mother an administrator at a children's psychiatric ward and a would-be actor who entertained her son with stories and imitations. His education was elite despite attending schools with Jewish quotas — Williams College and Yale Law School — and his real life experiences were invaluable for the movies he would end up making.
In the 1950s and early '60s, he worked in the Massachusetts attorney general’s office, was a court reporter in Fort Benning, Georgia; and Philadelphia, a research associate at Brandeis University and a lecturer at Boston Law School. Drafted into the Army in 1955 and stationed in Paris, he picked up some practical film knowledge by shooting street scenes with a Super 8 camera.
“I reached the witching age of 30 and figured I better do something I liked,” Wiseman told the AP in 2016. “It was just a few years after the technological developments that it made it possible to shoot synchronous sound ... so that opened up the world for filmmaking. And there were so many good subjects that hadn't been filmed, as there still are.”
His new career began with narrative drama. He read William Miller's “The Cool World," a novel about young Blacks on the streets of Harlem, called up the author and acquired rights. Wiseman served as producer of the low-budget, 1964 adaptation that was directed by Shirley Clarke, and he became confident that he could handle a movie himself.
While teaching at Boston Law School, Wiseman organized class trips to the nearby Bridgewater facility. In 1965, he wrote to officials there, proposing a film — ultimately “Titicut Follies” — that would give the “audience factual material about a state prison but will also give an imaginative and poetic quality that will set it apart from the cliche documentary about crime and illness."
Around the time the movie was screened at the New York Film Festival, the state of Massachusetts sought an injunction, alleging that Wiseman had violated the prisoners' privacy. For more than 20 years, Wiseman was permitted to show “Titicut Follies" only in prescribed settings such as libraries and colleges. The ban was finally relaxed when Superior Court Judge Andrew Meyer in Boston first ruled that the documentary could be shown to the general public if faces were blurred, then, in 1991, lifted all restrictions.
“I have viewed the film and agree that it is a substantial and significant intrusion into the privacy of the inmates shown in the film," Meyer wrote in his initial opinion, in 1989. “However, I also regarded 'Titicut Follies' as an outstanding film, artistically and thoughtfully edited with great social and historical value.
“Another observation about the film: It is true."

Guthrie family not suspects in Arizona kidnapping, sheriff confirms
Two weeks since the abduction of Nancy Guthrie, police said Today show host Savannah Guthrie and her family ‘are victims, plain and simple’
Nancy Guthrie’s family has been cleared as possible suspects in her abduction, Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos said on Monday, as the case involving the mother of Today show co-anchor Savannah Guthrie entered its third week.
Guthrie’s family, which includes “all siblings and spouses”, has been cooperative and gracious as authorities investigate the kidnapping, Nanos said.
“To suggest otherwise is not only wrong, it is cruel,” he said in a statement. “The Guthrie family are victims, plain and simple.”
Investigators on Sunday said they had obtained a DNA sample from a glove that was found near 84-year-old Nancy Guthrie’s Arizona home and appears to match the pair worn by a masked prowler seen in doorbell camera footage before she was abducted two weeks ago.
Nancy Guthrie was last seen on January 31 when family dropped her off at her home near Tucson after she had dined with them and relatives reported her missing the following day, authorities have said.
Nanos has said the elder Guthrie was extremely limited in her physical mobility and could not have left her home without help, leading investigators to conclude early on that she had been taken against her will.

‘Daunting but doable’: Europe urged to prepare for 3C of global heating

Keeping Europe safe from extreme weather “is not rocket science”, a top researcher has said, as the EU’s climate advisory board urges countries to prepare for a catastrophic 3C of global heating.
Maarten van Aalst, a member of the European Scientific Advisory Board on Climate Change (ESABCC), said the continent was already “paying a price” for its lack of preparation but that adapting to a hotter future was in part “common sense and low-hanging fruit”.
“It is a daunting task, but at the same time quite a doable task. It’s not rocket science,” said van Aalst, who used to lead the climate centre at the International Red Cross and Red Crescent and is now the director general of the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute (KNMI).
The ESABCC describes current efforts to adapt to rising temperatures as “insufficient, largely incremental [and] often coming too late” in a new report that advises officials to prepare for a world 2.8-3.3C hotter than preindustrial levels by 2100.
Such a dramatic rise in temperatures – the prospect of which has left some leading climate scientists feeling hopeless – would be double the level of global heating that world leaders promised to aim for when they signed the Paris agreement in 2015. The ESABCC recommended officials stress-test even hotter scenarios.
Weather extremes in Europe in recent years have at times surprised climate scientists with their strength and adaptation experts with their lethality as rising temperatures have warped the climate.
Heavy rains supercharged by climate breakdown killed 134 people in Germany’s Ahr valley in 2021 and 229 people in the Valencia region of Spain in 2024. Across the continent, summer heat kills many tens of thousands of people each year, with studies attributing between half and two-thirds of the death toll to the rise in temperatures caused by fossil fuel pollution. Last year’s wildfires, meanwhile, torched more of Europe than scientists have ever recorded.
Last week, Portugal was urged to draw up climate adaptation plans as the country was hit by an unprecedented series of storms that killed at least 16 people and caused an estimated €775m (£675m) of damage.
Van Aalst said: “Twenty years ago, we’d have said those extremes are indeed going to be a problem, but primarily in poorer countries that cannot cope. What we’re now noticing is that Europe itself is vulnerable, especially for conditions it has not faced in the past.
“It turns out our preparedness is not so great. And we have real work to do to upgrade our early warning systems.”
The ESABCC report recommends that the EU mandate climate risk assessments, embed climate resilience into all policies and channel more money – including from private sources – into protective measures. It does not estimate the scale of investments needed to keep Europe safe.
Van Aalst, who was an author of the last Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report, said the most important message was to avoid a future in which the world heats to such an extreme degree.
“The IPCC is clear this is a very problematic future with rapidly rising risks,” he said. “And for a number of risks, we’ll reach the limits of adaptation.”

Macron eyes major Rafale fighter jet deal, AI cooperation on India visit
French President Emmanuel Macron arrives in India on Tuesday for a three-day visit focused on artificial intelligence cooperation, defence deals and strengthening strategic ties, with discussions expected on a potential multibillion-dollar Rafale fighter jet agreement.

French President Emmanuel Macron begins a three-day visit to India on Tuesday, with talks focused on artificial intelligence cooperation and a potential multibillion-dollar Dassault Rafale fighter jet deal.
France is seeking to expand its military partnership with New Delhi, with discussions expected on a potential contract for 114 additional French fighter jets.
Macron and his wife Brigitte arrived around midnight on Monday in Mumbai, India’s financial capital, for his fourth visit to India since taking office in 2017.
He is scheduled to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi later on Tuesday.
Macron will then travel to New Delhi for an artificial intelligence summit on Wednesday and Thursday.
The visit follows New Delhi’s confirmation last week that it intends to place a major order for Rafale jets, as well as the signing of a landmark free trade agreement between India and the European Union in January.

‘Contract of the century’
New Delhi has sought over the past decade to reduce its dependence on Russia, its traditional main supplier of military equipment, turning to other countries while also pushing for more domestic production.
An Indian defence ministry statement last week said the proposed purchase of Rafale jets had been cleared – with “the majority” of them to be manufactured in India.
The statement did not specify the exact number of jets New Delhi would purchase, but a New Delhi defence ministry source said that 114 was likely.
Christophe Jaffrelot, an India specialist at Sciences Po Center for International Studies in Paris, described the potential EUR30 billion ($35 billion) deal for 114 Rafales as the “contract of the century” and a potential “crowning achievement” for bilateral ties.

If finalised, the jets would add to the 36 Rafales India purchased for its air force in 2016 and 26 it has ordered for its navy.
Negotiations over the additional aircraft still need to be concluded with manufacturer Dassault Aviation, but the French presidency has voiced optimism that what it calls a “historic” agreement could be reached.

‘Good chemistry’
Modi and Macron will also inaugurate on Tuesday India’s first helicopter final assembly line via videoconference from Mumbai, a joint venture between India’s Tata Group and Airbus.
The facility in Vemagal, in the southern state of Karnataka near the tech hub of Bengaluru, will manufacture the Airbus H125, the company’s best-selling single-engine helicopter.
France has emerged as one of India’s most important defence and economic partners in the last decade.
“Through this visit, we seek to further strengthen cooperation” with India, and to “diversify” France’s economic and trade partnerships, Macron’s office said.
India, the world’s most populous country with 1.4 billion people, is on track to become the fourth-largest economy globally.
This week’s talks are also expected to address global economic uncertainty triggered by tariff policies under US President Donald Trump, as well as China’s influence in the region.
Modi’s office said discussions would focus on “cementing the strategic partnership and further diversifying it into new and emerging areas”.
Bilateral trade between France and India, driven largely by defence and aerospace – India’s commercial fleet includes a substantial number of Airbus aircraft – stands at around EUR15 billion ($18 billion) annually.
French foreign direct investment in India totals nearly €13 billion ($15 billion).
The two leaders will also be keen to nurture close personal ties.
“There is apparently a good chemistry, a good personal rapport,” Jaffrelot said.
One sensitive issue remains Ukraine: India has not condemned Russia’s 2022 invasion and has continued buying oil from Moscow.
US President Donald Trump has said India had committed to halting the purchases, though that has not been formally confirmed by New Delhi.
“If the Indians stop buying Russian oil, they won’t be blamed for abstaining at the UN,” Jaffrelot added.

Israeli judo great, Olympic medalist Sagi Muki retires at 33

Olympic medalist and former world champion Sagi Muki announced his retirement from competitive judo on Monday at age 33, bringing an extraordinary career to a close.
“This was not a career of a moment; it was a mission,” Muki said at an emotional press conference. “Today I’m not finishing – I’m building the next thing and the journey continues.”
Struggling to summarize more than two decades on the mat, he reflected: “Judo for me was never just a sport… For years, I woke up with a goal in the morning – to be the best in the world, to know that on that day no one beat me. To achieve that you need hunger from within… Judo was my life.”
Muki made clear that the decision came from peace of mind, not injury or a slip in ability.
“I’m not retiring because I can’t,” he said. “I know exactly what it takes to be a world champion. If I can’t give it everything, I don’t want to be on the mat… In recent years my life has changed. I’m a father and there are things I’m no longer willing to miss. My dreams haven’t ended, they’ve simply taken a new direction.”
He looked back to an 11-year-old boy who returned from a tournament in Holland without a medal. “I sat on the side and cried… On the way back I knew one thing – I want another chance. That’s when I understood this was my dream.”
'I love Sagi like my own son'
Under longtime coach Oren Smadja, Muki rose to the top of the sport. He won world gold in Tokyo in 2019, two European titles, and an Olympic team bronze medal in Tokyo.
Smadja recalled: “Already in the first training session, he impressed me… It’s a privilege to coach a personality and human being like this. I love Sagi like my own son.”
Muki concluded: “After years on the mat, I am ending my competitive career in judo. This is a complete decision, not of a moment and not out of pain.”

Leaders of Canada, UK discuss trade, defense cooperation
Mark Carney and Keir Starmer discuss 'growing economic and security partnerships between Canada and the UK,' says statement
HAMILTON, Canada
Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney spoke Monday with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer on economic and security cooperation.
"Today, the Prime Minister, Mark Carney, spoke with the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Sir Keir Starmer," said a statement published by Carney's office.
Carney thanked Starmer for his condolences following last week's deadly school shooting in Tumbler Ridge, British Columbia.
"The prime ministers discussed the growing economic and security partnerships between Canada and the UK, including intensified collaboration on trade," said the statement, as they highlighted the progress in digital trade, critical minerals and sovereign AI infrastructure through the Canada-UK Economic and Trade Working Group.
Ongoing discussions between the European Union and the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) bloc were also addressed, it said.
Underscoring efforts towards establishing the Defense, Security and Resilience Bank (DSR Bank), Carney emphasized "the DSR Bank's potential to unlock private capital to fund defense and security firms across the supply chain – creating massive opportunities for workers and businesses," the statement said.
"The prime ministers agreed to task their teams to work together to advance this objective and ensure alignment of Canadian and UK efforts," it added.
Carney and Starmer also agreed to remain in close contact as Canada strengthens ties globally amid frayed relations with the United States.
Relations between Canada and the US have been strained since US President Donald Trump imposed tariffs on Canadian goods and later halted trade talks because of an anti-tariff advertisement aired in the US.

3 dead, including suspect, in shooting at ice rink in US state of Rhode Island
Pawtucket Police Chief Tina Goncalves says 'targeted' shooting may have stemmed from ‘family dispute'
HAMILTON, Canada
Three people are dead, including the suspect, in a shooting Monday at an indoor ice rink in the US state of Rhode Island, according to police.
"We have confirmed that the suspect is now deceased. Also, there are two victims that have also been confirmed deceased and then we have three victims that are still at the hospital in critical condition," Pawtucket Police Chief Tina Goncalves told the reporters.
Goncalves said the shooter, who was born in 1969, was identified as Robert Dorgan. She said he also used the name Roberta and the last name Esposito.
Earlier, Goncalves said the shooting, which occurred at a high school boys' hockey game in Pawtucket, was a "targeted event, that it may be a family dispute."
"We can also tell you that a good Samaritan stepped in and interjected in this scene, and that's probably what led to a swift end of this tragic event earlier today," she added.
Rhode Island Governor Dan McKee said he is monitoring the situation closely.
"As Governor, a parent, and a former coach, my heart breaks for the victims, families, students and everyone impacted by the devastating shooting at Lynch Arena in Pawtucket," McKee said in a video message.

Naomi Campbell’s name features almost 300 times in Epstein files
- British supermodel Naomi Campbell had more extensive contacts with sex offender Jeffrey Epstein than previously known, according to documents released by the Trump administration.
- Campbell's name appears almost 300 times in the released documents, indicating continued association with Epstein even after his 2008 conviction for soliciting prostitution from a minor.
- Her lawyer stated Campbell was unaware of Epstein's criminal conduct and only met him for a few business meetings, denying any social events or knowledge of his alleged use of her name to lure victims.
- Documents show Campbell's name on a list for Epstein's prison address and Epstein arranging a business meeting involving Campbell for a potential lingerie line.
- Despite her lawyer's claims, multiple Epstein victims alleged seeing Campbell at gatherings at his New York mansion and on his private island, though her lawyer explained the island visit as a transfer stop.

UN says Israel denies, impedes nearly half of coordinated Gaza aid missions despite ceasefire
'And just today, we had 2 more denials,' says spokesperson
HAMILTON, Canada
The UN said on Monday that Israel denied or impeded nearly half of coordinated humanitarian aid movements inside the Gaza Strip despite a ceasefire deal, with only just over half fully facilitated over a six-day period.
Citing the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric warned during a news conference that humanitarian operations "continue to face significant impediments."
"Shipments from Jordan are restricted to a route that requires multiple offloading and reloading points," he said, adding that "shipments from Egypt, via Kerem Shalom/Karem Abu Salem, face high return rates: despite a recent improvement, between Feb. 4 and 10, less than 60% of consignments from Egypt could be offloaded at that crossing point."
In Gaza, Dujarric stressed that "humanitarian movements that require coordination with Israeli authorities also continue to face obstacles."
"Of nearly 50 such movements coordinated between Feb. 6 and 11, just over half were fully facilitated," he said, noting that "five were denied outright, and 11 were approved but encountered significant delays and other impediments, including two that were only partially accomplished as a result."
"And just today, we had two more denials," he said.
Dujarric said UN teams on the ground continued discussions with Israel to "clarify the constraints and seek their resolution."
A US-backed ceasefire agreement has been in place in Gaza since Oct. 10, halting Israel’s two-year war that has killed more than 72,000 people, mostly women and children, and injured over 171,000 others since October 2023.
Since the agreement took effect on Oct. 10, Israeli forces have committed hundreds of violations through shelling and gunfire, killing 603 Palestinians and injuring 1,618 others, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry.

One year on, No Other Land co-director says Israeli attacks intensifying
Oscar-winning director Hamdan Ballal says his family was attacked despite an Israeli court ruling in their favour.
Nearly a year since the Palestinian-Israeli film No Other Land won an Academy Award, its co-director, Hamdan Ballal, says Israeli settler attacks on the cluster of occupied West Bank villages known as Masafer Yatta have only gotten worse, as those involved in the documentary bear the brunt of Israeli reprisals.
The latest bout of violence came on Sunday, when Israeli settlers stormed Ballal’s hometown of Susya, despite an Israeli court ruling designating the area around his home as closed to non-residents. Israeli army officers called by the family to enforce the ruling, issued two weeks prior, sided with the attackers.

“The ruling was supposed to make things better for us, but the opposite happened,” Ballal told Al Jazeera on Monday. “Israeli authorities did nothing to enforce the decision, but joined the settlers in the attack.”
One of his brothers was held in a chokehold by an army officer and later hospitalised with breathing difficulties. Four other relatives – two brothers, a nephew, and a cousin – were detained for several hours as they arrived at the scene. They have all since been released.
The Palestinian film director said his family was ambushed by the same Israeli settler who led an attack against him as he returned from the Oscar ceremony in Los Angeles last March. Then, he had been taken away in a blindfold by a group of Israeli settlers and army officers and released a day later with injuries to his head and stomach, leading to global condemnation.
Ballal said the retaliation for the documentary has since been directed against his family, rather than himself, to avoid media attention. His relatives have been routinely prevented from grazing sheep and ploughing the land. At times, they have been arrested, questioned about his work and whereabouts, or intimidated to vacate their homes.
“My family is paying because of me; because I shared the movie and I shared the truth,” he said.
The film, which won the Oscar for best documentary on March 2, follows Palestinian journalist Basel Adra and Israeli journalist Yuval Abraham as they try to protect Palestinian homes amid tensions with settlers in Masafer Yatta in the South Hebron Hills. Israeli filmmaker Rachel Szor also shares directing credits.
Israeli settlers in the area often graze their animals on Palestinian land to assert control, signal unrestricted access, and lay the groundwork for establishing illegal outposts, cutting Palestinians off from their farms and livestock.
The Israeli army argues that it has to demolish the Palestinian villages to convert the area into a military “firing” or training zone. It did not respond to Al Jazeera’s request for comment on Sunday’s incident.
Across the occupied West Bank, Israel’s far-right coalition government, led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, has been openly promoting new measures to expand Israeli control over the Palestinian territory.
Most recently, it announced the resumption of the land registration processes for the first time since 1967, which Israeli rights groups say will accelerate the dispossession and displacement of Palestinians in violation of international law.
‘Right to live’
Ballal’s family has not been the only one to pay the price for the acclaimed documentary.
Adra, the Palestinian protagonist in the film, had his home in at-Tawani raided by the Israeli army in September, after clashes broke out with a group of Israeli settlers that trespassed in his olive grove.
In July, Awdah Hathaleen, an activist, football player and a consultant for No Other Land, was shot dead, in the chest, in the village of Umm al-Khair. The father of three was a key figure in non-violent resistance against settler violence in Masafer Yatta. His assailant, Israeli settler Yinon Levi, later said, “I’m glad I did it,” according to witnesses.
Ballal said he does not hesitate to describe these attacks as being “terrorist”, as they leave the Palestinian community in Masafer Yatta constantly fearing for their safety.
“It’s a simple right for Palestinians to feel safe in their homes,” he told Al Jazeera. “We are scared; we are in danger, and it’s been like this for a long time.”
“International law doesn’t work for Palestinians,” he continued. “But we are human, and we have a right to live.”

Nigerien president thanks Algeria for rejecting military intervention after 2023 coup
Algerian authorities showed solidarity with Niger, ‘despite futile attempts by certain powers with neo-colonial undertones,’ says Gen. Abdourahamane Tiani
ISTANBUL
Nigerien President Gen. Abdourahamane Tiani expressed gratitude Monday to Algeria for its support in the wake of the July 2023 coup, commending the country for rejecting calls for military intervention.
Algerian authorities showed solidarity with the Nigerien people, “despite futile attempts by certain powers with neo-colonial undertones, as well as international and sub-regional organizations that have been ordered and manipulated,” Tiani told a joint news conference with his Algerian counterpart Abdelmadjid Tebboune in the capital Algiers.
He said Algiers’ stance, which respected Niger’s sovereignty and “internal political choices,” honors Algeria, its government and people.
“In any case, no Algerian, no African could comprehend that Algeria would allow its territory to be used to attack an African country, especially when it concerns the same power that, for more than a century, inflicted unbearable suffering on the valiant Algerian people,” Tiani said.
He lauded Algeria’s position, comparing it with “some African countries, or their manipulated leaders,” who missed their “historical rendezvous” by responding to “French calls to wage war against the Nigerien people.”
“The peace and security that we want for Niger, we want them for our neighbors and friends as well,” Tiani said.
Following the July 26, 2023 coup in Niger that ousted President Mohamed Bazoum, the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) issued an ultimatum to the coup leaders, threatening military intervention to restore constitutional order and activating its standby force. France also expressed support for ECOWAS’s potential use of force.
Break in months of diplomatic strain
Tiani arrived in the Algerian capital on Sunday for talks with Tebboune, in a move seen as signaling an end to more than 10 months of diplomatic tension between the two countries.
On Thursday, Algeria announced the immediate return of Ahmed Saadi, its ambassador to Niger, after a reciprocal downgrade of diplomatic ties since last April. The move followed the resumption of duties by Niger’s ambassador to Algeria, Aminou Malam Manzo.
The diplomatic rift began last April when Niger, Burkina Faso and Mali, the sole members of the Alliance of Sahel States (AES), recalled their ambassadors from Algeria after Mali accused Algiers of shooting down one of its drones.
Algeria said at the time that the aircraft had violated its airspace on an offensive trajectory, marking the third such breach.
It responded by recalling its ambassadors from the three countries under the principle of reciprocity. It later said Niger’s decision stemmed from solidarity within the Sahel alliance rather than a bilateral dispute.
Ties began to thaw late last year. In November, the Nigerien president sent Tebboune a message marking Algeria’s Revolution Day. In January, Algerian Energy Minister Mohamed Arkab visited Niger to review joint oil projects, marking the first senior-level Algerian visit since the diplomatic downgrade.

Multiple companies linked to Sarah Ferguson wound down after Epstein file release
- Six companies linked to Sarah Ferguson, the ex-wife of Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, are being wound down following new revelations from the Epstein files.
- Ferguson was the sole director of these companies, which include S Phoenix Events and Fergie’s Farm, none of which had a significant public profile or appeared very active.
- Applications to strike off each company were filed after US authorities published documents detailing Sarah's contact with paedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein.
- The released documents include email exchanges from 2011 where Ferguson appears to tell Epstein, 'I am at your service. Just marry me,' and other messages sent after his 2008 conviction.
- In related developments, Sarah's Trust, a charity she founded, also announced its closure, and she officially changed her name on company documents from 'Sarah Duchess of York' to 'Sarah Margaret Ferguson'.

29% compliance in Rafah crossing reopening amid Israeli restrictions: Gaza media office
Only 811 travelers able to cross Rafah crossing in both directions out of 2,800 people expected to travel, says office
GAZA CITY, Palestine
The Gaza media office said Monday that only 29% compliance was recorded in the reopening of the Rafah border crossing between Egypt and Gaza amid strict Israeli restrictions.
In a statement, the office said that between Feb. 2 and Feb. 15, only 811 travelers were able to cross the Rafah crossing in both directions out of a total of 2,800 people expected to travel.
It said 455 travelers were allowed to depart Gaza, 356 arrived, and 26 others were turned back during the period.
According to the statement, Israel reopened the Palestinian side of the crossing on Feb. 2 in a very limited manner after controlling it since May 2024.
The media office said it was not informed of the criteria used to determine the total number of travelers scheduled to cross.
Egyptian and Israeli media had previously reported that about 50 Palestinians were expected to cross daily into Gaza and a similar number into Egypt, including patients and their companions, but the office said this was not fully implemented.
Palestinian estimates in Gaza indicate that around 22,000 wounded and sick people require travel outside the enclave for medical treatment amid the collapse of the health sector.
Semi-official figures also show that about 80,000 Palestinians have registered to return to Gaza, reflecting continued rejection of displacement despite widespread destruction.
A US-backed ceasefire agreement has been in place in Gaza since Oct. 10, halting Israel’s two-year war that has killed more than 72,000 people, mostly women and children, and injured over 171,000 others since October 2023.
Since the agreement took effect on Oct. 10, 2025, Israeli forces have committed hundreds of violations through shelling and gunfire, killing 603 Palestinians and injuring 1,618 others, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry.

Nobody should be surprised by the violent rioting that erupted throughout Bnei Brak this week over the fact that two women soldiers entered the city. Among other things, the rioters overturned a police patrol car, torched a police motorcycle, blocked roads and threw stones. In a democracy, holding demonstrations – even if they sometimes disturb the peace – is an act of legitimate protest intended to influence government policy. But the actions of the ultra-Orthodox mob don't appear to be intended as an effort to participate in decision-making processes or a display of civic involvement. Rather, the ultra-Orthodox are seeking to evade their obligations and deny that the state's laws and authority apply to them.

Russians force farmers in ‘LPR’ to hand over 30% of diesel fuel for army needs
This was reported on Telegram by Oleksii Kharchenko, Head of the Luhansk Regional Military Administration, according to Ukrinform.
“In the so-called ‘LPR,’ farmers have been ordered to hand over at least 30% of their diesel fuel reserves for the war effort. A similar decision has been made regarding local industrial enterprises. The occupation administration explains this by a shortage of diesel fuel in Russian army units operating in the Luhansk region,” the statement said.
In addition, Kharchenko said that the occupiers in the settlement of Lutuhyne failed to procure passenger transport services. The tender was announced in January, but no bids were submitted during that time.
As a result, residents of smaller settlements have been left without regular bus services. “Any travel is now only possible by private vehicle or taxi,” the head of the administration added.
As Ukrinform previously reported, tram tracks continue to be dismantled in the temporarily occupied city of Luhansk.

One can hazard a guess as to why the prime minister assigned the foreign minister, Gideon Sa'ar, to represent Israel at the Board of Peace meeting this Thursday in Washington. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will enjoy watching his political rival-turned-servant squirm as he tries to avoid a photo with his counterparts from Qatar and Turkey. Netanyahu understands that if he were to go himself, a picture of him next to Hamas' patrons would be devastating to his election campaign. He prefers that Sa'ar embarrass himself on the eve of the Likud primary.

Six indicted for posing as soldiers in West Bank jewelry store heist

Six residents of the Bedouin town of Hura in the Negev were indicted on Monday on charges stemming from the armed robbery of a jewelry store in the Palestinian town of Dhahiriya near Hebron in the West Bank.
The Southern District Attorney’s Office said the suspects planned the robbery together and decided to pose as IDF soldiers. In a request to detain them until the end of legal proceedings, prosecutors wrote that the men armed themselves with weapons, airsoft rifles, ceramic vests, uniforms resembling those of the IDF, a GMC Savana-type vehicle, face coverings, gloves and other equipment.
“They robbed the jewelry store with brutality and by instilling fear, while threatening the victims and passersby with weapons,” the request said.
The indictment, filed in the Be'er Sheva District Court, charges Yusri Abu Qa’an, Mohammed al-Qi’an, Moayed, Odeh, Hamam and Yasser Abu al-Qi’an with aggravated robbery, illegal possession and transportation of weapons, aggravated assault, kidnapping, firing a firearm and impersonating a soldier.
According to the indictment, the six organized to carry out the robbery and equipped themselves with weapons, including an M-16 rifle and five airsoft rifles resembling M-16s, along with additional military-style gear. On Jan. 13, they entered Palestinian Authority-controlled territory through the Meitar crossing and, at about 10:30 a.m., arrived outside the jewelry store, disembarking from the vehicle dressed in what appeared to be Israeli military uniforms.
The GMC Savana vehicle they used is commonly associated in Israel with undercover security units.
Several members of the group entered the store while others remained outside to secure the vehicle, with one suspect staying in the driver’s seat. Upon entering, one of the men aimed a weapon at a store employee and handcuffed him.
During the robbery, one of the suspects shouted at a Palestinian man and struck him. The robbers ordered those inside to raise their hands and claimed the jewelry belonged to Hamas and therefore had to be confiscated, according to the indictment.
After about 10 minutes, the suspects left the store, abducting one Palestinian man and forcing him into their vehicle.
Prosecutors said the six fled with about 4 kilograms (8.8 pounds) of gold jewelry, 100,000 shekels (about $32,000), 10,000 Jordanian dinars and $1,000 in cash.
Two Palestinians began chasing the vehicle, and the suspects opened fire in their direction, the indictment said. The abducted man was later released from the vehicle, and the suspects fled.
Two of the defendants were arrested later by police officers. Another was detained minutes later by a passerby. Two additional suspects were arrested by Palestinian security forces and transferred to Israeli police two days later, prosecutors said.

Why thousands of students are seeking compensation from universities
- Thousands of students are seeking financial compensation from dozens of universities across England and Wales for studies impacted by Covid-19.
- At least 36 universities, including Exeter, Imperial College London, Leeds, Bath, and Bristol, have received pre-action claim letters.
- This action follows a confidential settlement reached between University College London (UCL) and Student Group Claim, which sought compensation for periods of online teaching and closed facilities during the pandemic.
- Student Group Claim argues that universities breached contractual agreements with students by failing to provide promised in-person tuition and access to facilities.
- Following the successful settlement with UCL, Student Group Claim and its legal representatives plan to pursue similar claims against other universities.

Gold for Elana! Meyers Taylor, 41, wins Olympic monobob title at Milan Cortina Games
Elana Meyers Taylor has won her first Olympic gold in women’s monobob, and she made history as the oldest American woman to do it at the Winter Games
- Bookmark
Elana Meyers Taylor's two young sons watched her leap into the air, throw her fists skyward, wave the American flag, then fall to her knees and start to cry.
In time, they'll understand what they saw.
They saw history.
The 41-year-old U.S. bobsledder — a mother of two special-needs children, an athlete whose career was jeopardized by concussions, someone who dealt with plenty of doubt in recent years — is, finally, an Olympic champion. Meyers Taylor won the gold medal in monobob at the Milan Cortina Games on Monday night, her sixth career medal and first Olympic title.
“I thought it was impossible,” Meyers Taylor said.
She was never happier to be wrong.
She became the oldest American woman to hear “The Star-Spangled Banner” played in her honor at the Winter Games. Rallying in the fourth and final heat, Meyers Taylor prevailed with a four-run, two-day time of 3 minutes, 57.93 seconds.
Meyers Taylor had medaled five times before — three silver, two bronze. She was the most decorated Black athlete at a Winter Olympics even before this win, and her place in history got a whole lot more dazzling on a frosty night in the Italian mountains. And this medal, her sixth, tied Bonnie Blair for the most by a U.S. woman in the Winter Olympics.
“To have my name up there with Bonnie Blair, it doesn't even make sense to me,” Meyers Taylor said.
Germany’s Laura Nolte — the leader after the first, second and third runs — was second and Kaillie Humphries Armbruster of the U.S. was third.
“I’m a bit sad because now at the moment it feels like I lost gold — and not that I won silver. In a few hours I think I can celebrate it, because it’s still a great result,” Nolte said. “Elana also deserves it. She’s a super kind human and she has won silver for many times now and the gold was missing.”
It was the fifth career medal for Humphries Armbruster. She's 40 and about 18 months removed from becoming a mom — and she technically became the first woman 40 or older to clinch an Olympic bobsled medal, since she finished her competition exactly 2 minutes, 29 seconds before Meyers Taylor crossed the line to join the 40-something medal club.
“You get a lot of people that like to write you off as soon as you reach 40, it’s all downhill from there, is what you hear. I think Elana and I are both proof that that’s not true,” Humphries Armbruster said. “As soon as you become a mom, your body’s not the same, and you can never get that high performance back, and I think we were able to show that that’s not true again.”
Nolte led by 0.15 seconds going into the final run, with Meyers Taylor second and Humphries Armbruster third — 0.24 seconds off the lead. Barring big mistakes, gold, silver and bronze would be theirs in some order; nobody else was within 0.6 seconds of Humphries Armbruster, nor within about a full second of Nolte’s lead going into the final heat.
They go in reverse order in sliding. That meant Humphries Armbruster went first among the final three, then Meyers Taylor, then Nolte.
Humphries Armbruster finished in 3:58.05, knowing she was assured of her fifth career medal when she crossed the line. As the sled skidded to a stop, she was already on her feet — throwing her arms into the air, knowing at least bronze was coming her way.
U.S. coach Brian Shimer, often stoic, started punching the air in celebration. And then the scene was set for Meyers Taylor, who held on to no worse than the silver spot and wrapped herself in an American flag after hopping out of the sled.
Nolte had the lead going into the last run. She just couldn’t hold it.
Kaysha Love, the world monobob champion for the U.S. last year, had big trouble in her second and fourth runs and finished seventh with a final time of 3:59.27.
“Seeing Elana, that was iconic,” Love said.
Humphries Armbruster won the gold medal in the inaugural running of monobob at the 2022 Beijing Games, with Meyers Taylor winning silver.
This is the fifth time that Meyers Taylor and Humphries Armbruster have competed in the Olympics. Each has medaled in each of their previous four appearances; Humphries Armbruster was also on the Canadian Olympic team in 2006, but did not race in those Turin Games.
They’re now 5-for-5. And Meyers Taylor, finally, has the golden moment.
“I didn't need it,” Meyers Taylor said. “But I wanted it.”

IRGC Navy chief says Strait of Hormuz under 24-hour surveillance amid tensions with US
Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps launch massive military drill in Hormuz Strait and Persian Gulf
TEHRAN, Iran
Iran’s top naval commander said Monday that the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) maintain “full 24-hour intelligence dominance” over the Strait of Hormuz.
IRGC Navy Chief Rear Admiral Alireza Tangsiri made the remarks hours after the launch of a military drill in the strait, one of the world’s most strategically important choke points located between the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman.
The IRGC Navy’s public relations wing described the exercise as “combined, live and purpose-driven” drills.
Iran’s state media quoted Tangsiri as saying that the IRGC Navy’s surveillance in the Strait of Hormuz is “comprehensive at surface, aerial and even sub-surface levels.”
This intelligence, he said, ensures the “safe passage of vessels” through the strait, adding that more than 80 oil tankers and container ships pass through it daily, accounting for a significant portion of maritime trade.
He said the drills are being conducted in both the Persian Gulf and the Strait of Hormuz, describing the islands in the two waterways as “impregnable fortresses.”
Tangsiri said the defense of these islands and the entire Persian Gulf and Strait of Hormuz “is the responsibility of the IRGC Navy,” which conducts “routine annual exercises to ensure security” in the strategic region.
He stressed that the drills are part of the IRGC Navy’s annual program, with its uniqueness lying in the “tactical maneuvers and equipment being employed,” noting that some of them have not been officially unveiled yet.
Tangsiri said the “rapid and decisive response” of IRGC operational units to maritime security threats is at the “core of the drills.”
He further said that the IRGC Navy’s rapid-response units regularly train to intervene, inspect or seize “unauthorized vessels” in the Strait of Hormuz and Persian Gulf.
Earlier Monday, the IRGC said an exercise titled “Smart Control of the Strait of Hormuz” is being conducted under the field supervision of IRGC Commander-in-Chief Major General Mohammad Pakpour.
Among its key objectives, the statement noted, are assessing the operational readiness of IRGC Navy units, testing security plans and scenarios for reciprocal military action in response to potential security and military threats in the Strait of Hormuz region, and evaluating the geopolitical advantages of the Islamic Republic in the Persian Gulf and the Sea of Oman.
The drills come amid heightened tensions between Iran and the US following the deployment of US aircraft carriers and bombers to the Persian Gulf region.
On Friday, US President Donald Trump announced that a second US aircraft carrier would be deployed to the Middle East. The USS Abraham Lincoln and a fleet of destroyers are already stationed in the region amid simmering tensions between the two countries.
Despite rising tensions, Tehran and Washington are set to hold the next round of nuclear negotiations in Geneva on Tuesday under Omani mediation.
Indirect nuclear diplomacy resumed in Muscat earlier this month, nearly eight months after talks were suspended following an Israeli attack on Iran that sparked a 12-day war.

Looking to upgrade the family car? Your 2026 checklist for the new era of SUVs
Sponsored by BYD
Nothing’s straightforward these days, is it? And choosing a family car is no exception. Finding the right balance between space, safety, affordability and environmental performance can be harder than helping the kids with their maths homework.
If you’re trying to make sense of it all, here are a few things to consider:
Seats
Let’s be honest: you’re going to want seven. Even if you’re not planning to fill a car with your own kids, there is little doubt that you will be constantly asked to ferry your offspring and a gaggle of their friends to concerts, football matches and all-night raves (depending on their ages, obviously). You’ll want a car that can handle the load.
Storage
For the modern Australian family, there’s no such thing as “too much space”, especially in a competitive SUV market where generous boot capacity is a primary consideration for buyers.
Safety
This one’s easy. Modern safety is no longer about the frame of the car; it’s about the smart technology watching over your precious cargo. When choosing a family SUV in 2026, look for advanced features that protect every row of your vehicle, such as comprehensive airbag coverage that extends to the very back. It’s also worth considering smart systems like Child Presence Detection (CPD), which uses millimetre-wave radar to detect movement inside the cabin, ensuring no child gets accidentally left behind.
Fuel and other ownership costs
The planet, and your bank account, will thank you for filling up at the bowser as little as possible. As well as comparing manufacturers’ fuel-consumption figures (you can also use the government’s Green Vehicle Guide), take a dive into other ownership costs, such as insurance and servicing, to see how they stack up, too. If you’re buying a new car, you might also want to compare warranties.
Driveability
It’s all well and good buying a big, safe, green, efficient car for the family, but let’s not be martyrs. Pick something that’s exciting to drive, too. Even mums and dads deserve to have a bit of fun now and then.
The complete package?
What car could possibly tick all these boxes? It’s a tough ask, but the latest super hybrids are giving it a good go.
Super hybrids are essentially plug-in hybrids (PHEVs) with higher performance capabilities. They can run on electric batteries — which you charge just as you would in a fully electric car — but also include a petrol engine. This is ideal for families that want the best of both worlds: silent, spacious EV commuting for the daily school run, along with petrol-backed security for the great Australian road trip.
Super hybrids can be more fuel-efficient than older-generation PHEVs (because their bigger batteries offer longer electric range), and they can be a lot more fun, too, thanks to big motors offering that electric wow factor.
Chinese carmakers are leading the way in the super-hybrid bracket, and it should come as no surprise that super-disruptor BYD is right in the mix. The Sealion 8 super hybrid is BYD’s first seven-seat SUV, and it hopes to offer families the complete package.
Ticking boxes
This super hybrid stacks up well against our checklist. First of all, it’s big, with seven seats offering plenty of legroom, even in the back row. It also offers plenty of storage: even with all seven seats in play, you get 270 litres of volume in the rear, which ramps up to 960L with the third row folded down.
The vehicle also delivers with an impressive family-first safety range that prioritises the protection of all seven passengers. It features nine airbags including full-length side curtains that offer peace of mind for those in the rear, while for discerning parents, the inclusion of third-row ISOFIX anchor points is a game-changer, allowing child seats to be securely fastened in the back. This is also paired with the millimetre-wave radar CPD system to monitor the cabin, front and rear cross-traffic alerts with automatic braking and constant driver fatigue and distraction monitoring.
As for fuel, the vehicle comes equipped with a 1.5-litre turbo-petrol four-cylinder engine, plus a 19kWh battery on the Dynamic FWD version of the car, and a 35.6kWh battery on the Dynamic AWD and Premium AWD versions.
This translates to a claimed 103 kilometres of electric range on the smaller battery, and 152 kilometres on the bigger battery. That’s enough to cover most trips, and BYD claims fuel-consumption figures of a paltry 1 litre per 100 kilometres when the battery is over 25 per cent full.
Performance is another factor. The electric motors (one on the FWD, and two on the AWD versions) offer serious power, with the AWDs going from 0-100km/h in a rapid 4.9 seconds – perfect for when you’ve got a weekend off with your partner and you just can’t get away quick enough.
It seems the ultimate family checklist finally has an answer that doesn’t require a single compromise.
The BYD Sealion 8 is rewriting the checklist for the modern Australian family. As BYD’s first seven-seat SUV, it balances high-end tech with genuine value, starting from just $56,990*. Whether you choose the efficient Dynamic FWD or the powerhouse Premium AWD, you’ll enjoy up to 152km of pure-electric range for the daily commute and a massive 1040km total range for the weekend getaway. With a focus on safety and a 2000kg towing capacity, it’s the complete package for 2026.

Students launch legal action against universities over Covid-hit studies
Following a successful settlement with UCL, Student Group Claim will turn its attention to other universities
- Bookmark

Dozens of universities could face legal action as thousands of students seek financial compensation after their studies were impacted by Covid-19.
At least 36 universities across England and Wales have been sent pre-action claim letters, including Exeter, Imperial College London, Leeds, Bath and Bristol, according to The Guardian.
It comes after a settlement was reached between UCL and Student Group Claim, who sought to obtain financial compensation from the university for the periods when teaching was moved online and libraries were closed during the pandemic.
UCL reached a confidential settlement with the Student Group Claim. While admitting no liability the institution agreed to settle so that it could be resolved without further expense.
Shimon Goldwater, partner at Asserson solicitors, which jointly represented the claimants suing UCL, said: “I am very pleased that our clients have been able to achieve a commercial settlement of their claims with UCL. Student Group Claim will now turn its attention to claimants who attended other universities during the pandemic.”
Adam Zoubir, partner at Harcus Parker solicitors, which also represented the claimants, said: “I am delighted that this settlement provides a resolution for our clients who attended UCL during the pandemic and had their classes moved online. This is the end of the claim against UCL, but we continue to represent tens of thousands of students who were at other universities during Covid.”
The Student Group Claim has argued that universities breached contract with students, who pay course fees for in-person tuition, access to facilities and other services as set out in its contractual documents, prospectuses, and promotional materials.
Due to strikes and Covid-19, the group claims that universities breached their contracts with students from 2018 onwards as in-person classes were either cancelled or moved online, and access to libraries was restricted.
A spokesperson from Universities UK said: “The Covid-19 pandemic threw two years of unprecedented challenge at universities and their students. Institutions - like other sectors - followed government guidance to adapt to a fast changing situation.
"During some periods of lockdown, universities were not permitted to offer in-person teaching as usual and instead they adjusted quickly and creatively to allow students to complete their degrees."
The claim comes as chancellor Rachel Reeves faces backlash regarding student loans after she announced that the repayment threshold for Plan 2 loans will be frozen at its April 2026 level (£29,385) for three years, instead of increasing with inflation.
It is set to increase each year in line with RPI from April 2030, with commentators warning that this could mean a greater impact on graduate’s’s monthly earnings as the cost of living gets higher.

Malian army ‘neutralizes’ several terrorists
Malian forces seize weapons, ammunition, communication materials during operation in Segou region
ISTANBUL
Mali “neutralized” scores of terrorists during a large-scale sweeping operation in the central part of the country, the army said Monday.
The operation, conducted Sunday, targeted the villages of Toule and Akoub in the Segou region, it said in a statement.
Malian forces also seized weapons, ammunition and communication materials.
The statement did not identify the terrorist group targeted.
Mali has faced persistent insecurity for more than a decade, particularly in its central and northern regions, where armed groups linked to militant organizations and local conflicts have carried out attacks against security forces and civilians.
The army regularly announces counterterrorism operations as it seeks to reassert control over territories and curb the activities of armed groups, especially in areas near key population centers and along the Niger River corridor.

Eleni Glykatzi-Ahrweiler, prominent Byzantist and first female rector of the Sorbonne, dies at 99

Eleni Glykatzi-Ahrweiler, a prominent Greek historian of the Byzantine Empire who became the first woman rector of Paris's Sorbonne University, died on Monday, February 16, aged 99, the Athens News Agency reported.
Greek President Constantinos Tassoulas paid homage to her by saying she "illuminated through her work the timeless dimension of the Greek identity and contributed in a decisive way to international recognition of Byzantium as a fundamental pillar of European civilization".
Born in Athens in 1926 to a family of refugees from what was then Constantinople – now Istanbul – she developed an early passion for history. As a young woman she moved to Paris to continue her studies, earning two doctorates there and meeting her husband, navy officer Jacques Ahrweiler, who died in 2010.
After rising quickly through France's CNRS research body, Glykatzi-Ahrweiler moved to the Sorbonne to become a top professor of Byzantine studies, and in 1976 became the first woman rector of the famed Paris university in its 700-year history. She was then named head of the Academy of Paris, which oversees the capital's entire education system, and a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador.
She came to know famous cultural figures in France, such as Pablo Picasso and Simone de Beauvoir, and received many honorary doctorates and distinctions, including at Harvard University, and France's Legion of Honor. The wide body of scholarly Byzantine work she established remains influential today.

The 'Blade Angels' are redefining the image of US women's figure skating
The three U.S. women who will be going for Olympic gold when their figure skating competition begins Tuesday night are role models for a whole new generation
- Bookmark
The trio of U.S. women targeting Olympic figure skating gold Tuesday night are not the dainty ice princesses of yesteryear.
There's Amber Glenn, a 26-year-old powerhouse and LGBTQ+ rights activist whose career took off just when most figure skaters are contemplating retirement. The three-time and reigning U.S. champion's unvarnished opinion on everything from politics to the trading card game “Magic: The Gathering” have made her a polarizing figure at the Milan Cortina Games.
Then there's Alysa Liu, the one-time phenom who retired at 16 only to launch a comeback that resulted in the first world title for an American woman in nearly two decades. Liu's blond-and-brunette striped hair, prominent frenulum piercing and nonconformist aura have made the 20-year-old a hero of the alt, punk and emo crowd.
And there's Isabeau Levito, perhaps the closest thing to the innocent image of teen predecessors like Tara Lipinski and Sarah Hughes, right up until you get the 18-year-old away from the cameras, and her searing wit and biting sarcasm shine through.
They've dubbed themselves the “Blade Angels,” an homage to “Charlie's Angels,” after rejecting such suggestions as “Powerpuff Girls” and “Babes of Glory,” which they worried might lead to some trademark issues. (As if they needed more of those in Milan.)
They are a new kind of role model for a new generation of American girls.
They also are the last chance to salvage a disappointing Olympics for American figure skaters.
“I really like that we're all different," Levito said, “and we all have our own strengths and personalities, and our own ways we want to look and appear. I think it’s really great, because while we all have the same passion for the sport, and we have very aligned goals.”
‘I thought I would be done at 18’
Glenn grew up in Plano, Texas. Her father, Richard, is a police sergeant and her mom, Cathlene, a fitness instructor. She's represented the U.S. internationally for nearly 15 years, which happens to be how old Lipinski was when she won Olympic gold.
It's hard to get more unabashedly American. Yet some critics nevertheless questioned her allegiances on the eve of the Milan Cortina Games, when Glenn answered a question about the political climate for the LGBTQ+ community under President Donald Trump.
“I hope I can use my platform and voice throughout these Games to help people stay strong during these hard times,” she said. “A lot of people will say, ‘You’re just an athlete. Stick to your job. Shut up about politics.' But politics affect us all.”
Glenn probably wouldn't have taken such a bold stance a decade ago, when she nearly quit the sport.
But over the course of her career, she's tackled head-on an eating disorder, which is all-too common in the sport. She spent time in a mental health facility to get a handle on her depression. She learned to cope with ADHD. And she came to understand her sexuality; Glenn identifies as pansexual, meaning she is attracted to people regardless of sex or gender.
“I've been through a lot,” Glenn told The Associated Press. “It's taken many, many years to get to this point.”
Now, she has an Olympic gold medal from her Winter Games debut after helping the U.S. defend its title in the team event.
“I stepped away from the sport. I’ve come back. At one point, I hated it. Whenever people would ask me, ‘Oh, should my kids get into it?’ I would be like, ‘No, never,’" Glenn said. "But I’ve seen the people around me grow, and how the environment of figure skating has changed, and how we’re trying to change it. And in doing so, we've created an environment I like to be in every day.”
‘I hated skating when I quit’
Liu is the only member of the U.S. women's team with any previous Olympics experience. But much like Glenn, she had come to loathe the sport by the time she finished sixth at the Beijing Games, so much so that she quit entirely. She was 16 at the time.
“I really hated skating when I quit. Like, I really didn't like it,” Liu told the AP. “I didn’t care about competitions. I didn’t care about places. I didn’t care about skaters. I didn’t care about my programs. I just wanted to, like, get away. I want nothing to do with that. I hated fame. I hated social media. I didn’t like interviews. Like, I hated all of it.”
It took walking away for Liu to finally find herself.
The same kid who'd get dropped off at the rink by her father in the morning and picked up at night, and who thirsted for friends her age while living and training alone in Colorado, began to explore: Liu climbed to the base camp of Mt. Everest, ticked off items on her ever-growing bucket list, and enrolled at UCLA to study, perhaps fittingly, psychology.
“I learned so much. Met so many new people,” Liu said. “I had to exercise my free will and push myself in different ways.”
She began contemplating a comeback two years ago, after she went skiing and experienced an adrenaline rush unlike anything she'd felt since hanging up the skates. Liu didn't know where it would lead — certainly not the first world title for an American since Kimmie Meissner in 2006, and definitely not another Winter Games — but she knew that she loved the feeling of skating again.
Everything in Liu's life has meaning now, including the striking horizontal stripes in her hair. They're meant to represent the growth rings of a tree. There are three of them at present, and like a tree, Liu plans to add another ring each year.
“I used to feel like a puppet or a canvas that other people were using,” she said. “Now I do things for myself.”
‘They have no idea what you’re actually like'
Levito has always admired Russian skater Evgenia Medvedeva, perhaps the most dominant women's skater of the mid-2000s, who was heavily favored to win gold at the 2018 Pyeongchang Games but wound up with the silver medal instead.
“She was just so pretty. I just wanted to have that angelic energy that I feel like she has," Levito told the AP. “Amber and Alysa have their distinct style, and she was more like me. My style is, I don't know, put together. I don't know how to word it.
“The ice princess image,” Levito said, after a long pause, “which is silly to say.”
Mostly because it is just that — an image.
Yes, there is a sense of purity surrounding Levito, whose mother, Chiara, immigrated to the U.S. from Milan three decades ago, and whose grandmother still lives in the host city of the Winter Games. But pull her away from the TV cameras, photographers and the prying eyes of the world, and her sarcastic-bordering-on-vulgar sense of humor bubbles to the surface.
At last month's U.S. Figure Skating Championships, Levito was asked her favorite quality in Liu, who was sitting beside her. “I want to say something but I won't,” Levito said, before succumbing to a little prodding: “She keeps the hoes on their toes,” she said.
“I think it's so funny,” Levito said later, reflecting on that day. “The internet is like, ‘Our Isabeau is not a baby anymore,’ when they have no idea what you're actually like. I just don't want to say the wrong things in front of the media."
So, Levito plays it safe. She wears a sort of mask for the public, projecting the image she thinks people want to see.
Much like Glenn and Liu have people who can relate to them, there are a whole lot of people who can relate to that.

US Homeland Security Department’s funding negotiations stall
Democrats have called for a ban on immigration agents wearing masks and are pushing for increased oversight of their operations.
The United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS) ran out of funding over the weekend, leading to the third partial government shutdown of President Donald Trump’s second term, as negotiations between Republicans and Democrats remain stalled while Congress is in recess until February 23.
Democrats are calling for changes to the DHS’s immigration operations after two fatal shootings of US citizens in the city of Minneapolis last month. Alex Pretti and Renee Good were shot dead by federal officers from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Border Patrol during such operations.

On Monday, state officials in Minnesota said that the FBI has refused to share evidence with state law enforcement following Pretti’s killing on January 24.
“This lack of cooperation is concerning and unprecedented,” Minnesota’s Bureau of Criminal Apprehension superintendent, Drew Evans, said in a statement.
DHS entered a shutdown on Saturday, but will continue operations deemed essential. Cuts affect agencies under the DHS, including the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), Customs and Border Protection (CBP) – which runs Border Patrol – ICE, and the US coastguard.
At US airports, 2,933 of the TSA’s 64,130 employees have been furloughed for the duration of the shutdown. The remaining 95 percent of staff will remain on duty but will work without pay until the DHS is funded.
Earlier this month, Democrats sent Republicans a list of 10 demands to rein in immigration enforcement. In a letter, authored by House of Representatives Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, the politicians called for increased oversight of the DHS.
The letter called for DHS officers not to enter private property without a judicial warrant and to require verification that someone is not a US citizen before placing them in immigration detention. It also called for DHS to mandate that its officers do not wear masks, have visible identification, and wear clear uniforms.
Democrats are also seeking to prohibit immigration enforcement actions near courts, medical facilities, houses of worship, schools, and polling places.
They further called for increased coordination with local and state agencies after the federal government blocked state and local law enforcement from participating in investigations related to the deaths in Minneapolis.
“Federal immigration agents cannot continue to cause chaos in our cities while using taxpayer money that should be used to make life more affordable for working families,” Jeffries said in the letter.
“The American people rightfully expect their elected representatives to take action to rein in ICE and ensure no more lives are lost. It is critical that we come together to impose common sense reforms and accountability measures that the American people are demanding.”
Tom Homan, Trump’s border chief, dismissed the calls from Democrats on CBS’s Face the Nation, referring to the requests as “unreasonable”.
Republican Senator Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma, meanwhile, echoed Homan’s stance. On CNN’s current affairs programme, State of the Union, he claimed that Democrats are engaging in “political theatre”.

Six of Sarah Ferguson’s companies wound down after Epstein links revealed
According to Companies House, an application to strike off each company was filed after new revelations about Sarah’s contact with the paedophile financier came to light

Six companies linked to Sarah Ferguson are being wound down following the most recent release of Epstein files, Companies House documents show.
Ms Ferguson, the ex-wife of Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, was the sole director of all six companies, none of which have much public profile.
An application to strike off each company was filed with Companies House after new revelations about the former Duchess of York’s contact with the paedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein came to light with the publication of millions of documents by US authorities.
In documents released last month, the former duchess appears to say to Epstein: “I am at your service. Just marry me.”
In an email exchange from 21 September 2011, she apparently wrote: “Don’t know if you are still on this bbm but heard from The Duke that you have had a baby boy.
“Even though you never kept in touch, I still am here with love, friendship and congratualtions [sic] on your baby boy. Sarah xx”
The email is then followed up with a message saying: “You have disappeared.
“I did not even know you were having a baby. It was soooo crystal clear to me that you were only friends with me to get to Andrew. And that really hurt me deeeply [sic]. More than you will know.”
Many of the exchanges are dated after Epstein was convicted in 2008 for soliciting prostitution from a child.
The companies being wound down by the former duchess of York are: S Phoenix Events, Fergie’s Farm, La Luna Investments, Solamoon Ltd, Philanthrapreneur Ltd and Planet Partners Productions Ltd, none of which appear to have been very active.
According to the government website, applying to strike a company off the register is also known as “dissolving” a company, and is a way to close down a company that has not traded in three months.
Late last year, after she lost her courtesy royal divorcee title, Ms Ferguson submitted an official change to her details for all the firms from Sarah Duchess of York to Sarah Margaret Ferguson.
Days after the new details emerged about the former duchess’s friendship with Epstein, Sarah’s Trust, a charity she had founded, also announced it would close “for the foreseeable future”.
A representative for the former duchess has been contacted for comment.

Trump’s new ambassador to South Africa arrives in country amid strained ties
The US president has accused South Africa of persecuting its white minority, criticised its ties with China and imposed tariffs on exports
Reading Time:2 minutes
Why you can trust SCMP
US President Donald Trump’s pick for ambassador to South Africa has arrived in the country where he will seek to improve fraught ties between the two states.
An embassy official told Reuters on Monday that the envoy, conservative activist and writer Leo Brent Bozell III, had arrived. Bozell is expected to present his credentials to President Cyril Ramaphosa before officially taking up his post.
Relations between Washington and Pretoria have deteriorated in the past year as Trump has accused South Africa of persecuting its white minority, criticised its ties with Russia and China, imposed steep tariffs on its exports and cut all aid.

South Africa has not had an ambassador in Washington since the Trump administration expelled its last one, Ebrahim Rasool, in March.
Bozell said in his Senate confirmation hearing in October that he would approach his ambassadorship “with respect for the South African people”, and that he saw “real opportunity for a lasting partnership” despite areas of disagreement.

Bozell said his priorities would include pressing South Africa to end its genocide case against Israel at the International Court of Justice, advancing Trump’s refugee programme for white South Africans, and promoting business interests.

BHP cashes in on ‘metal of the future’
Updated ,first published
Worldwide demand for electrification, renewable energy, and the digital infrastructure needed to power AI has made copper, often labelled the “metal of the future”, the biggest earner at global mining giant BHP.
The world’s biggest miner hit a new milestone in the half-year to December after a four-year drive to boost copper production saw the red metal comprise the largest share of BHP’s underlying earnings, previously dominated by the miner’s output of iron ore from its huge Pilbara operations in Western Australia.
BHP is one of the world’s largest iron ore and copper producers.
The earnings stream from both commodities has boosted its half-year profit to December 2025 by 28 per cent to $US5.64 billion ($8 billion) as its revenue rose 11 per cent to $US27.9 billion.
BHP shares rose 4.7 per cent to $52.74. The company said it will pay investors an interim dividend of US73¢, fully franked on March 26.
The resources giant’s copper output was significantly higher, but it also reported record first-half production from its iron ore operation, a key ingredient for steelmakers in China and elsewhere that makes it Australia’s largest and most valuable export by a wide margin. BHP said it wants to lift its iron ore output to around 305 million tonnes a year.
“We have achieved around 30 per cent growth in copper production in the last four years, positioning us ahead of the strengthening copper market that we had anticipated,” chief executive Mike Henry said. “This is allowing us to maximise increased earnings from the recent run-up in copper prices as well as gold,” he said.
Off the back of strong production at its Escondida mine in Chile, and other mines including its operations in South Australia, the company increased its copper guidance to between 1.9 and 2 megatonnes.
BHP and other Australian miners are reaping the benefits of rising global commodity prices. Copper has jumped about 55 per cent over the past two years and soaring values for gold, silver and uranium – metals often found in mines alongside copper – also boosted BHP’s bottom line, delivering a $US2.1 billion jump in revenue, up 46 per cent on the previous corresponding period.
Henry said he expects global economic growth will hit around 3 per cent this year.
China’s economy is resilient, meeting its 5 per cent growth target last year, and India continues to outperform, he said. “We are optimistic that the economic backdrop is supportive for our key commodities. Against a structurally higher cost environment, these conditions reinforce the importance of productivity and cost discipline and play to the strengths of BHP’s low-cost, diversified portfolio.”
But the company is still facing tough, and as yet unresolved, negotiations with China’s largest state-owned iron ore buyer, China Mineral Resources Group, over the future price to be paid for its ore.
When asked if BHP was taking a financial hit because of the protracted negotiations, Henry pointed to the half-year results: “We remain on track to meet guidance, production-wise. And it was a super-strong half for WAIO [West Australian Iron Ore] on the production front. And in addition to that, we’ve performed better than others when it comes to price realisations for the half as well.”
Negotiations can get “tough from time to time”, he said: “I’m confident that at the end of the day, there’s a path through this, given the respect that we have for each other, to a resolution that is acceptable to both parties. But that takes time.”
Asked if BHP had any merger aspirations after Rio Tinto and Glencore earlier this month abandoned talks on a $300 billion merger, Henry said: “We are now the largest, we’ve grown by 30 per cent and we’ve got multiple large growth options already in the portfolio. We don’t feel the need to [merge].
“But for the discrete few opportunities that might come along that fit the very strict criteria that we have, we’ve got the wherewithal to pursue them, but we’re not feeling any burning need to,” he added.
BHP announced on Tuesday it has reached a $US4.3 billion long-term streaming agreement with Wheaton Precious Metals International to take its share of the silver produced at the Antamina mine in Peru, a joint venture it owns along with Glencore and Teck Resources.
The deal will allow BHP to realise the value of Antamina’s silver as a byproduct, and it will retain all the copper, zinc and lead production from its share of mine.

Wuthering Heights sparks emotional reaction as viewers break down in tears
Wuthering Heights prompted a wave of tearful reactions after its release in UK and US cinemas over the Valentine’s Day weekend.
The new adaptation, directed by Emerald Fennell and starring Margot Robbie and Jacob Elordi, opened on 13 February 2026 and quickly sparked an outpouring of emotion online. Viewers posted self-filmed videos weeping as the credits rolled, with one describing the experience as having “literally crushed my soul.”
Although early reviews were mixed, with some critics arguing that the film diverges from Emily Brontë’s original novel, audiences appeared deeply moved by its emotional intensity, many leaving cinemas visibly shaken by the tragic love story.

Cyclist police said was ‘breaching human rights act’ by riding no-handed reveals new twist in case
A cyclist who was fined for riding his bike “no-handed” has had his case dropped by the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS).
Barrister Paul Powlesland said that City of London Police had ticketed him under the Human Rights Act last July. He contested the fine, which he described as “utterly bonkers”, as he felt it was not illegal to ride whilst not touching the handlebars.
Footage taken by Powlesland which quickly went viral shows him confronting an officer about his ticket.
Sharing an update to the case on X on Thursday (12 February), Powlesland, who was due to appear in London South-Central Magistrates' Court on Friday, revealed that the case had been dropped to due insufficient evidence.
He said that whilst he was glad he did not have to go to court, he was annoyed at the force for “wasting my time and taxpayers’ money pursuing something so trivial and which is clearly not illegal”.
The Independent has contacted City of London Police for comment.

Lebanon says next Hezbollah disarmament phase to take four months

Lebanon's government has said that the army would need at least four months to implement the second phase of the military's plan to disarm Hezbollah in the country's south.
Lebanon's government last year committed to disarming Hezbollah and tasked the army with drawing up a plan to do so.
The military said last month that it had completed the first phase of the plan, covering the area between the Litani River and the Israeli border about 30 kilometres (20 miles) farther south.
The second phase concerns the area between the Litani and the Awali rivers, around 40 kilometres south of Beirut.
Information Minister Paul Morcos told a news conference after a cabinet session that the government "took note of the army leadership's presentation" on the second stage of the plan.
"There is a timeframe of four months, extendable depending on available capabilities, Israeli attacks and hindrances on the ground," he said.
Israel has kept up regular strikes on Lebanon despite a November 2024 ceasefire that sought to end Israeli war in Lebanon.
Israel has also kept troops in five south Lebanon areas it deems strategic.
Lebanon's health ministry said Israeli strikes on Monday on the country's south killed two people.

Workers raised concerns with managers at VIQ Solutions — the company responsible for the data breach — months ago and were told they were "not relevant" and were directed to stop spreading "rumours" about the issue.
The transcription of court cases in most jurisdictions in Australia is done by VIQ Solutions, which is based in Canada and employs transcribers in Australia.
An ABC investigation found VIQ Solutions subcontracted work to e24 Technologies — a company based in Chennai, India that specialises in automated voice-to-text technology — in breach of its Commonwealth contract, and without notifying the courts.
Internal VIQ documents, sighted by the ABC, showed thousands of court files were accessed by staff at e24 Technologies with Indian email addresses.
A job advertisement placed by e24 revealed the company was seeking staff to transcribe legal documents, and applicants needed to be proficient in "Australian English". The advertisement listed the job location as "remote".
VIQ staff based in Australia told the ABC that e24 staff were accessing court files outside of Australian business hours and completing transcripts at a speed that was not possible for a human. They claimed the transcripts completed by e24 contained significant errors, which then fell to VIQ staff to correct.
Access to state and federal court cases by foreign entities is a "national security risk", according to Greens senator David Shoebridge.
"Incredibly sensitive evidence from organisations like ASIO, the Australian Federal Police, is given in private court because it could be addressing links to international criminal organisations, potential foreign interference in the country," he said.
He said this information in the wrong hands could do "incredible damage".
"Not just to the national interest, but potentially to undercover police officers and members of the public in Australia."
VIQ reviewed its processes after being contacted by the ABC. It is understood compliance issues with e24 were identified as part of that review.
However, a number of concerned VIQ staff and subcontractors based in Australia told the ABC they had raised the issue of offshore transcribers with VIQ management as far back as August 2025.
In a memo to staff seen by the ABC, VIQ management claimed at the time that e24 resources were based in Sydney, not India.
"To avoid further insinuation and rumours, to be clear, e24 resources are based in Sydney. Please do not communicate information as facts unless it has been confirmed by senior leadership at VIQ," the memo stated.
During a staff meeting, VIQ vice-president of Legal, Compliance and Human Relations Crystal Oliphant told staff who raised concerns about offshore typists and poor transcript quality that: "these questions are not relevant … and they don't have impact on the employees' daily responsibilities … so we're not going to be addressing any specific questions here."
VIQ produce transcripts for the family and federal courts, the South Australian Employment Tribunal, as well as the courts and tribunals in Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria and Western Australia.
Cases heard in the federal court include critical human rights matters, industrial relations cases, taxation law and matters involving multi-million-dollar corporations.
VIQ also manage transcripts for the Federal Circuit and Family Court, which can include migration cases, and matters involving child sexual abuse, domestic violence and property settlements.
'Identities of covert operatives could be sold'
Australian staff who work for VIQ Solutions told the ABC they are required to undergo a national security check and complete a Commonwealth Courts Deed of Confidentiality.
It is unclear what security checks, if any, are required by e24 staff.
A VIQ contractor, who asked to remain anonymous, said the presence of offshore transcribers in shared work portals with foreign email addresses had caused angst amongst the Australian workforce.
"I began having anxiety attacks about what repercussions might follow for real human lives if highly sensitive matters were accessed by unvetted overseas staff,"they said.
"I was worried about how much the protocols of the Australian Border Force and police, and identities of witnesses and covert operatives, could be sold for by anonymous overseas individuals."
The ABC understands that since July last year, at least a dozen senior VIQ staff were either made redundant or quit, along with staff who belonged to the Quality and Assurance team.
"I was constantly worried we would lose our jobs," the VIQ contractor said.
"Finding out on a public holiday we had been locked out of the system was terrifying. Team leaders were fired if they questioned decisions, and no replacements filled their roles … making us scared to ask questions or raise concerns.
"When the quality team were fired, we were expected as contractors to do unpaid quality and training. This only worsened when e24 work began returning [with] poor quality, and we had to rush through retyping, knowing people spent thousands of dollars on the product and upper management didn't believe trained staff were worth having perform the work."
VIQ chief executive Larry Taylor told the ABC, "strict standards" were implemented for contractors "to ensure we protect the privacy, confidentiality and security of sensitive customer data, such as court recordings".
"When VIQ contracts work to companies like e24, they are required to adhere to the same strict privacy guidelines, service delivery standards and confidentiality as all employees," Mr Taylor said in a statement.
"All customer data is stored in Australia in accordance with the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth), for Australian clients."
Last week, Senator Shoebridge raised the issue of offshore contractors accessing court files with the chief executive of the Federal Court of Australia, Sia Lagos, during Senate estimates.
The federal court manages the contract with VIQ Solutions.
Ms Lagos acknowledged VIQ Solutions was prohibited from offshoring court data, as well as the use of AI-based software. She confirmed VIQ had not told the court about e24 Technologies.
"We are not aware of any subcontractors being engaged by VIQ Solutions," Ms Lagos said.
Names of protected persons appearing in transcripts
Another Australian transcriber who works for VIQ told the ABC when they raised concerns over the poor quality of transcripts, they were ignored.
"This has been an incredibly stressful situation, and the very real worry of losing my job overnight to an offshore entity has both angered me and caused me health problems," they said.
"When the quality department informed [VIQ] management that court work couldn't go offshore, they were made redundant, followed by near on all of the Australian management and operations staff."
The transcriber said a group of concerned Australian VIQ contractors had tried to prevent court files being accessed by e24 by "monopolising the work pools", fearing sensitive data was going offshore.
"Our duty is to the departments with which we hold security clearances," they said.
A different VIQ contractor claimed the identities and locations of protected persons had been left in transcripts produced by e24 via the West Australian Department of Justice.
"The transcript is an entitlement of the respondent to a matter. It is a criminal offence to disclose the location — these are slipping through the gaps in [the] 'merging' stage of the hearing and respondents are receiving the present locations of the protected persons," the contractor claimed.
The WA Department of Justice told the ABC it was "aware of and investigating these claims".
VIQ contract should be terminated: Shoebridge
Senator Shoebridge said the revelations that Australian court data had been accessed offshore without the knowledge of the court were grounds for an independent audit and the urgent termination of the contract with VIQ.
"This looks like it's been very much 'set and forget' from the federal court going back over years, relying on the blank assurances being given by a private operator and not having the kind of due diligence to double check," he said.
"I have had multiple whistleblowers, not one, not two, multiple whistleblowers contacting my office and each time we raise this in public, we get more whistleblowers coming forward and showing very credible evidence.
"Now, if that's not grounds to urgently terminate this contract and bring back this important public service into public hands, away from a failed privatisation, I don't know what is."
A spokesperson for the Federal Court of Australia said:
"The Listed Entity that manages the contract on behalf of the Courts takes the matters raised in relation to compliance with the transcript contract extremely seriously and is currently in the process of making enquiries in relation to these issues. As such, the Listed Entity is currently not in a position to comment any further."
The Attorney-General's Department said, "federal courts are responsible for their own operation and management".

Naomi Campbell had way more contact with Epstein than previously believed, files reveal
Supermodel continued to associate with Epstein after his 2008 sex crime conviction
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
British supermodel Naomi Campbell had more contacts with sex criminal Jeffrey Epstein than were previously known, according to documents released by the Trump administration.
Campbell has acknowledged her past associations with Epstein, whom she encountered in elite fashion circles. The British model has worked for Victoria’s Secret, the lingerie brand once owned by billionaire Les Wexner, whose finances Epstein once managed. An ex-boyfriend introduced Campbell to Epstein at her 31st birthday party in 2001, she has said.
Campbell has long maintained she had no awareness of the late financier’s misconduct at the time they knew each other.
In a 2019 video statement, she called his crimes sickening and “indefensible.”
Before this disavowal, however, Campbell appeared to be in regular touch with Epstein, even after his 2008 conviction in Florida for soliciting prostitution from a minor, according to documents analyzed by The New York Times.
Campbell’s name appears nearly 300 times in documents released by the Justice Department, though some files are duplicates, according to the Times.
The Independent has contacted representatives of Campbell for comment.
“Prior to Epstein’s 2019 arrest in New York, my client knew nothing about his appalling criminal conduct,” her attorney, Martin Singer, told theTimes. “If my client had ever encountered any young woman whom she thought was being victimized by Epstein, she would have personally taken immediate action to help her.”
The files include Campbell’s name on a document called “List of People Who Need JE’s Address!” which detailed information for how to correspond with Epstein in prison.
Campbell’s lawyer told the Times that during the late 2000s and early 2010s, when Campbell was living in Russia, she was unaware Epstein was a sex offender and had no idea who made the list or why the model’s name was on it.
In 2010, a document captured Epstein directing his assistant to invite apparel executive Linda Wachner to his house for a meeting with Campbell.
Campbell’s lawyer told the paper the meeting was because the model was “trying to do a lingerie and swimwear line” and Epstein “led her to believe that he could assist with that.” Wachner attended the meeting virtually, according to her lawyer, and no business partnership emerged.
Overall, Campbell’s lawyer said, the model went to Epstein’s home office for “3 or 4 business meetings,” but never for any “social event or gathering.”
Elsewhere that year, Epstein was invited to Campbell’s birthday party in France and a Paris event celebrating the model’s work with fashion house Dolce & Gabbana.
Campbell’s lawyer said she did not make the guest list for the former event, which Epstein did not attend, and that Epstein briefly attended the latter.
Multiple Epstein victims alleged during conversations with investigators that they saw Campbell at gatherings tied to Epstein, including a dinner party at his New York mansion and Campbell being present on Epstein’s island.
Campbell’s lawyer told the Times that the model, alongside “a group of people going to an F1 race,” stopped over on Epstein’s island “on a transfer from a commercial flight.”
A 2016 email exchange, meanwhile, captures a discussion referencing Campbell seeking to use Epstein’s plane.
Campbell’s lawyer said the model had been on Epstein’s plane “on a few occasions but she never observed any inappropriate conduct of any kind.”
The files also captured Epstein allegedly using his proximity to Campbell to burnish his own reputation.
In 2020, an unnamed victim told investigators that she met Epstein when she was 15, and that he promised to get her jobs at Victoria’s Secret and touted his relationship with Campbell and Wexner.
Campbell’s reps say she was unaware Epstein used her name in such conversations and that it was done so “entirely without her knowledge or authorization.”
Ghislaine Maxwell, the disgraced British socialite and Epstein lieutenant serving a federal prison sentence in the U.S., has said the Department of Justice interviewed her last year about Epstein’s ties to a variety of high-profile public figures, including Campbell.
Epstein courted influential friends across politics, media, business, and academia, though his ties to the fashion world may be among the most central ones to his decades of abuse.
The financier used his connections in the fashion world to lure victims into his ring, based on promises that he could connect them with high-profile figures and brands and assist in their careers.
Beyond Epstein’s ties to Wexner and Campbell, Epstein was also friends with Donald Trump during the time he owned the Miss Universe pageant and the Trump Models agency.
Another high-profile Epstein associate was French modeling agent Jean-Luc Brunel, who died by suicide in prison while being investigated for the alleged rape and trafficking of minors.
Brunel was accused of trafficking scores of women and girls to Epstein.

Immediately after the October 7 massacre, we were completely immersed in the disaster that had befallen us. Stunned and dizzied by the images and videos that Hamas took, which recorded every possible form of humiliation, mutilation and desecration of human beings, their homes and their surroundings. In the first week of the war, Israel imposed a hermetic siege on the Gaza Strip in response and gave 1.1 million of Gaza's residents one day to leave their homes. The Israel Air Force dropped nearly 1,000 bombs a day. Among the 2,215 Gazans killed in those first six days were dozens of children. It was the deadliest week of the war; hundreds of hostages in Gaza were also in danger of being killed in the bombings.

Why China is being urged to integrate commercial space tech with military systems
Appeal comes as strategic rivals such as the US are increasingly eyeing military uses for tech developed by private firms such as SpaceX
China has been urged to build dual-use satellite application systems to increase the military use of commercial technology.
The appeal by researchers from a university affiliated with the Central Military Commission – China’s highest command body – comes as space technology developed by private firms is increasingly being used for military purposes.
For example, the US military has stepped up its use of technology from Elon Musk’s Starlink network and other commercial satellite companies, carrying out tests to help it build a more advanced and efficient command system.
Musk’s company SpaceX recently applied to launch one million satellites to power artificial intelligence (AI) data centres, a move that would drastically expand its Starlink network.
The company already has around 10,000 satellites in orbit and the Chinese government recently suggested it was responsible for congestion and an increased risk of collisions.
“As commercial satellites become more deeply involved in modern warfare, the traditional boundaries between military and civilian uses are increasingly blurred. Space is rapidly shifting from a domain of strategic deterrence towards one of tactical operations,” an article by researchers from China’s National University of Defence Technology said.

Sheriff says all family members of Nancy Guthrie cleared over her disappearance: ‘victims plain and simple’

Sheriff says all family members of Nancy Guthrie cleared over her disappearance: ‘victims plain and simple’
Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos said the Guthrie family has been ‘nothing but cooperative and gracious and are victims in this case’
- Bookmark
All members of Nancy Guthrie's family, including NBC News' Savannah Guthrie, her siblings, and their spouses, have been cleared as possible suspects, according to the Pima County Sheriff’s Office.
Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos made the announcement on Monday afternoon, saying in a statement that the Guthrie family has been "nothing but cooperative and gracious and are victims in this case."
"To suggest otherwise is not only wrong, it is cruel," he said. "The Guthrie family are victims plain and simple."
The sheriff's department said in an earlier statement that there are no scheduled news conferences regarding the case today.
The memo issued by the department does not appear to have been in response to any new evidence or breakthroughs, but rather as a general statement on the status of the Guthrie family.
Nancy Guthrie, 84, was reported missing from her home in Arizona on February 1. Local investigators and the FBI have been searching for her for more than two weeks.
While law enforcement has been busy running down leads, Savannah Guthrie and her siblings have been making emotional pleas on social media asking the supposed kidnapper to reach out and provide proof of life and further instructions for how they can get their mother back.
Earlier on Monday, TMZ founder Harvey Levin announced that his publication had received a fourth letter from an individual claiming to have knowledge of who kidnapped Nancy Guthrie. The individual is reportedly refusing to reveal the information until payment is made.
Levin said he had been in contact with the FBI, posted a video telling the tipster to provide the information to him, and that he would work with the FBI to secure payment. The TMZ founder believes that the individual who sent Monday's letter is the same one who has sent three previous letters demanding payment for information about Nancy Guthrie's whereabouts.
"A fourth letter from the same person who says he knows where Nancy Guthrie is, and he wants money in return for the information,” Levin said. “Essentially, he wants the reward."
During his address, Levin also read a chilling line from the letter.
”‘I know what I saw five days ago south of the border, and I was told to shut up, so I know who he is, and that was definitely Nancy with them,’” he read.
Meanwhile, the Pima County Sheriff's Office is reportedly working with Walmart after it discovered the brand of backpack the suspected kidnapper wore on the night Nancy Guthrie disappeared was sold exclusively at the retailer.
The backpack is a 25-liter “Ozark Trail Hiker Pack." The "Ozark Trail" brand is a private, Walmart-owned outdoor brand that is only sold in its stores and on its website. However, it is possible the individual bought the pack from a private seller or from a second-hand sports retailer.
“This backpack is exclusive to Walmart and we are working with Walmart management to develop further leads,” Nanos said.
The clothing the suspect was wearing the night of the alleged abduction may also have been purchased at Walmart, but investigators noted that the clothing isn't exclusively offered by Walmart.
“This remains a possibility only," the sheriff's office said in a statement on Monday.
Investigators searching near Guthrie's home have collected several gloves and have sent them to a forensics lab for testing, according to the Pima County Sheriff's Office. Deputies noted that many of the gloves found in the area were from volunteers who were searching for Guthrie. It's unclear what kind of gloves were sent for further analysis.
The FBI and the sheriff's office are also still collecting tips about the case. According to the FBI, it has collected more than 13,000 calls about Guthrie since February 1, and the sheriff's department said it has taken at least 18,000 calls.
Investigators have not said whether any of those calls have proven helpful to the search.
Guthrie has been missing for more than two weeks, resulting in some criticism of the investigation. Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos told the Daily Mail on Sunday that he doesn't care about the "haters" who say the department released the crime scene too early.
"My officers were there for almost 20 hours, and they processed their scene, got it done, and brought in all the evidence," he told the outlet. "Then the FBI came and did their thing."
He also told the publication that claims he was blocking the FBI from accessing important evidence were wrong.
"Why would I do that?" he said. "It makes no sense."

Zelensky warns of new Russian strikes on Ukraine as Geneva peace talks resume

President Volodymyr Zelensky said Feb. 16 that Russia is preparing new large-scale attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure as Kyiv's negotiating team arrived in Geneva for another round of peace talks with the United States and Russia.
"Intelligence reports that the Russians are preparing new massive strikes on energy, and air defense must be configured properly," Zelensky said in his nightly address.
He urged partners to ensure the timely delivery of air defense support, saying delays could increase the damage from strikes.
"Any delay in supplying air defense missiles, any untimely delivery works for scaling up the damage from the strikes," he said, adding that commitments discussed at the recent Munich Security Conference should be implemented quickly.
Zelensky said his delegation had arrived in Geneva and was preparing for negotiations, but cautioned that continued Russian attacks could make progress harder.
"Russia cannot resist the temptation of the last days of winter cold and wants to inflict painful blows on Ukrainians," he said. "The more of this evil comes from Russia, the harder it will be for everyone to reach any agreements with them."
He said Ukraine has agreed to what he called realistic U.S. proposals, including an unconditional, long-term ceasefire, but said Russia has rejected the idea and continues assaults at the front and attacks on cities and energy facilities.
"We expect partners to act so that coercing the aggressor into peace truly works," he said.

Huckabee says US and Israel 'absolutely aligned' on Iran, warns diplomacy may not avert war

U.S. Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee said Monday that Washington and Jerusalem are “absolutely aligned” on Iran as nuclear talks between the United States and Tehran are set to resume Tuesday in Geneva.
Addressing leaders of Jewish groups from across the United States at the annual gathering of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations in Jerusalem, Huckabee said that he was in Washington last week for meetings President Donald Trump held with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and that “the United States and Israel are absolutely aligned on Iran. Iran cannot continue their nuclear and ballistic program. Iran is not Israel’s problem; it is the world’s problem.
“For 47 years, Iran has said death to America,” he said. “They preface that with death to Israel, but only because Israel is in the way.” He added that Iranian and Hezbollah-linked networks operate in parts of South America.
Huckabee said he did not know whether the upcoming round of talks would succeed in removing the threats posed by Iran’s nuclear program, ballistic missiles and support for regional proxy groups.
“Talks are taking place. But can anything come from the talks this week that will bring peace?” he said. “There is significant doubt as to whether the Iranian nuclear threat, ballistic program, and funding of terror will be removed. But if they were willing to do that, because they realize the consequences of not doing so, I’d be delighted.”
U.S. Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, a close Trump ally, also addressed the negotiations after meeting with Netanyahu and former prime minister Naftali Bennett in Tel Aviv. Graham said he is visiting the country “to reassure the Israeli people there is no light” between the U.S. and Israel on Iran, adding that “we’re in the weeks, not months, in terms of decision-making.”
Graham described Iran’s leadership as being at its weakest point since 1979, citing its struggling economy, weakened military and anti-government protests.
Earlier, Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baghaei was quoted by the IRNA state news agency as saying that “we can cautiously conclude that the American position on Iran’s nuclear issue has become more realistic.”
The U.S. delegation to the talks includes special envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner. It was not immediately clear whether U.S. Central Command chief Adm. Brad Cooper, who attended previous talks in Oman and drew criticism from Iranian officials, would participate.
Iran is represented by Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi and several diplomats from Tehran. Oman’s foreign minister, Badr Albusaidi, is mediating the talks.
In the previous round, Araghchi reportedly left the room before the U.S. delegation entered, though reports said the sides did shake hands. Iranian officials have not ruled out further handshakes in upcoming rounds.
Meanwhile, a small protest was held in Ilam province in western Iran, where demonstrators chanted “Death to Khamenei,” referring to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. On Tuesday, Iran will mark 40 days since the deaths of thousands of people in the regime's crackdown on street protests last month. Authorities are planning ceremonies across the country, with the Iranian armed forces describing them as memorials for “those killed in the American-Zionist rebellion.”
Iranian military drill — and footage of an aircraft carrier
Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps conducted a military exercise Monday in the Strait of Hormuz amid the possibility of a U.S. strike if talks between the sides collapse.
Iranian state television said the naval drill, dubbed “Smart Control of the Strait of Hormuz,” was intended to prepare the Revolutionary Guards for “potential security and military threats.” The semiofficial Mehr news agency, which is affiliated with the regime, reported that the exercise focused on a “decisive and comprehensive response by the operational forces of the Revolutionary Guards to anti-security plots in the maritime arena.”
Iran has repeatedly threatened to close the Strait of Hormuz, a strategic waterway through which about 20% of the world’s oil supply passes.
State television said the first phase of the naval maneuvers included the use of strategic weapons on three islands in the Persian Gulf. According to the report, a drone used in the exercise “exists in very large numbers” and is at the disposal of the Revolutionary Guards’ navy. The name of the drone and further details were not disclosed, but it was said to be capable of striking aerial and maritime targets. Not all aspects of the exercise were broadcast, the report added, citing security considerations.
The commander of the Guards’ navy, Alireza Tangsiri, issued a warning message. “For the sake of these islands and these waters, we will stand against any enemy to the fullest extent,” he said. “We have full control over the Strait of Hormuz — on the surface, in the air and underwater. We maintain full intelligence oversight of the strait around the clock to ensure the security of navigation and transit in this strategic waterway.”
BBC reported that the U.S. aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln was spotted by satellite about 240 kilometers (150 miles) off the coast of Oman. According to the report, the Lincoln had not been seen since January, when it was reported to have arrived in the region, but it had crossed open waters where satellite visibility is limited.
Late Thursday, The New York Times reported that the second U.S. aircraft carrier to be sent to the Middle East would be the USS Gerald R. Ford, along with its strike group. The Ford is arriving after its fighter jets took part in an operation to capture former Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, who was brought to the United States and is standing trial there.
With its arrival, it will mark the first time since March 2025 that two U.S. aircraft carriers are simultaneously operating in the region. At that time, the USS Harry S. Truman and the USS Carl Vinson were deployed during U.S. military strikes against Houthi forces in Yemen.

‘Unprecedented’: FBI refusing to share info from Alex Pretti investigation
- The FBI has refused to share information with Minnesota authorities investigating the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti by federal officers during the Trump administration's surge into Minneapolis.
- The Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA) described the FBI's lack of cooperation as 'concerning and unprecedented' and is pursuing legal avenues to obtain evidence.
- This decision follows a similar refusal in the case of Renee Good, another Minnesota resident fatally shot by a federal officer.
- The Department of Justice has opened a civil rights probe into the case, and a federal judge has criticized administration officials for baselessly labeling Pretti a “domestic terrorist” before an investigation was launched.
- Pretti's family has called for a joint state and federal investigation, while the killings have intensified outrage over the Trump administration's deployment of immigration officers in Minnesota.

Pod Save Australia: Why our obsession with US politics isn't going anywhere

Pod Save America and why Australians remain obssessed with US politics
An hour or so into a Friday night show at one of Melbourne's most stunning performance venues, the night's headliner turned to the hits, or at least the sort of material their legion of fans had come to expect.
"Whenever you are dealing with a budget or government funding shutdown, there's a political win and a substantive win," Pod Save America co-host Dan Pfeiffer said as the clock ticked past 9:00pm.
"So let's talk about the political win first …"
Instead of confusion — or boredom — in the face of such wonky appraisal of shutdown politics, the 2,500-capacity Hamer Hall crowd nodded in keen affirmation.
That so many Australians would give up their Friday night to listen to four American podcasters dig into the minutiae of US politics might by now be unsurprising, though it is no less remarkable.
"Australians are deeply invested in the health and continuity of American democracy," Australia Institute international and security affairs director Emma Shortis said.
"We know that it has huge consequences for us and the world."
Hope in a 'doom spiral'
After almost a decade and more than a billion downloads, Pod Save America has built the sort of reach and influence most traditional media can now only dream of.
The oft-mentioned biographies of the four hosts — Jon Favreau, Jon Lovett, Tommy Vietor and Dan Pfeiffer — as former staffers for Barack Obama remain a key part of their appeal.
Yet their "no-bullshit" conversations, which swing from progressive activism to centre-left pragmatism, have grown such a community as to be their own political force.
The entry point might be the hosts' capacity to open up insider politics to the outside, but the audience for Pod Save America and the associated Crooked Media stable of podcasts isn't just treated as listeners.
"Friends of the Pod" are encouraged to become messengers in their own communities, organisers, door knockers, phone bankers, even to run for office.
"The truth is, I couldn't be prouder of them," said former president Barack Obama, at a recent live show in November.
"They are spreading the word to a new generation about what is possible in politics."
That word has evidently spread to Australia, where Pod Save America has been on a run of packed-out live shows up the east coast.
The cheapest tickets at the Melbourne leg were just shy of $100, with $200+ for a VIP meet and greet.
"My origin story [with the podcast] is really post-Trump's win in 2016 and as many people were, grappling with what that meant for the world, and probably being in a doom spiral," said Jane Thomas, a 53-year-old from Brunswick sporting a VIP lanyard in the venue's foyer.
"I started listening to them and was absolutely hooked from that point. There's a validation of your feelings, there's a sense of insight, but they also bring a sense of hope."
Trump term 'bad' for Australia
The tour comes at a complicated moment for US–Australia relations.
The chaotic and volatile nature of the Trump presidency has sparked calls to rethink the strategic alliance with America.
A recent poll from the United States Studies Centre found a majority of Australians thought President Trump's second term had been bad for Australia.
The appetite to travel to the US is waning.
New data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics, cited by the Australian Institute, shows Australian trips to the USA dropped 3.1 per cent in the past year, and 32 per cent since before the pandemic.
The risk of becoming politically or culturally untethered from the US is nonetheless minimal, according to Jared Mondschein from the United States Studies Centre.
"We found that only about 16 per cent of Australians said the second Trump term has been good for Australia … but the percentage of Australians who want to abandon the US Alliance altogether is 17 per cent," said Mr Mondschein, who is based at the University of Sydney.
"Australians can see the US is moving in a different direction, but at the same time, they can see that Australia only has one America.
"Really, what is the alternative?"
'Australian politics is a bit banal'
The unusual sight of wand security at each stage door delayed the start of the Hamer Hall show.
It was both a requirement of the podcast team and a reminder that they existed in a culture where political podcasters have recently been murdered on stage.
An audible buzz of excitement crackled among the long lines of attendees, carrying popcorn and drinks and wearing "Friend of the Pod" merchandise.
"It's hard to imagine a similar phenomenon in Australia — like former staffers of prime minister Kevin Rudd, I guess, starting their own podcast and creating a cult of celebrity around them," said Dr Shortis.
Self-described "swing voter" Dan Williams attended the Friday night show with a friend.
"American politics is very worrying, but I think Australian politics is a bit banal," said the 52-year-old.
Earlier in the day, Sussan Ley was toppled as Liberal Party leader.
No one seemed to mind that the leadership spill — or any Australian political news for that matter — failed to rate a mention throughout the nearly 2-hour live show.
A beaming audience instead watched as the hosts dissected recent polling on the deployment of ICE agents, laughed at US cable news clips, and picked apart a performance by US Attorney-General Pam Bondi at a congressional hearing related to the Epstein files.
"This is the last thing that Trump should want attention being drawn to!" said Dan Pfeiffer.
"It's like robbing a bank and having your getaway driver light herself on fire outside the bank."
No turning away from 'mesmerising' US
Alongside the typically expletive-laden jokes was a particular strain of American earnestness.
"This is an absolute crisis. The presidency is criminalising opposition to the regime," said Jon Favreau, who US Vice-President JD Vance last year labelled a "dipshit".
Such earnest appeal tends to jar with Australian sensibilities, but here it was met with rampant applause.
"This moment is so far out of the bounds of normal, that of course it is captivating people's attention," Dr Shortis said.
"When Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said the world was facing a rupture, not a transition, he was right, and I think people feel that intuitively and know that so much of that is driven by the radically changing nature of American power."
Part of the podcast's appeal, she guesses, is its capacity to capture the rise of far-right politics and characterise the media ecosystem that supports and surrounds it.
As One Nation continues its own skyrocketing rise in the polls, that bears more relevance to Australian audiences than ever.
"There is an attempt on the far right of Australian politics to import Trumpian politics," she said.
"I think the Dutton campaign tried to do that, One Nation is doing that quite successfully on social media and its approach to the internet and meme culture."
Toward the end of the show, the hosts each picked a Democratic official's name out of a hat as part of a game to advocate for why they should be the party's presidential nominee in 2028.
The reactions of the crowd suggested an almost bizarre familiarity with the potential candidates — one that many Australian politicians would dearly covet for themselves.
Jon Lovett, who frequently serves as the podcast's comic relief, found himself spruiking for US senator Jon Ossoff.
"His mum is Australian!!!" called out several people in the crowd, which appeared to be news to the hosts.
A 2023 piece in US outlet Politico titled Why the Biggest US Politics Junkies Might Be Living Overseas suggested that "some of the Australians [the author] encountered knew more about US politics than most Americans".
Based on the local response to Pod Save America alone, the Australian obsession with US politics is unlikely to disappear anytime soon.
"There is this sense that the America that we thought we knew is gone. It's not coming back, but we don't know what emerges in its place," said Dr Shortis.
"Part of the reason it is mesmerising is because nobody knows how it ends."

US troops arrive in Nigeria on training mission

US troops arrive in Nigeria on training mission
February 16, 2026The United States has sent 100 soldiers to Nigeria, with the hopes of helping the West African country defend itself from the threat of armed groups.
Nigeria's military announced the arrival of the toops, along with equipment, on Monday.
Why is the US sending soldiers to Nigeria?
Nigeria has been plagued by violence, as its army is locked into a protracted fight with dozens of local armed groups, including Islamic extremists such as Boko Haram and its breakaway faction Islamic State West Africa Province.
Among the groups are also the IS-linked Lakurawa, and other "bandit" groups, specializing in kidnapping for ransom and illegal mining.
In a statement, the military said the Nigerian government had made a request to the US for help with training, technical support and intelligence-sharing.
Samaila Uba, spokesperson for Nigeria's Defense Headquarters, said the US troops are there for training purposes and will not engage in combat or have a direct operational role.
Nigerian forces will maintain complete command authority.
The arrival of US forces follows criticism by the Trump administration over Nigeria's security situation. In December, US forces launched airstrikes on Islamic State group-affiliated militants in the country's northwest.
How did Nigeria respond to Trump's accusations?
The troop deployment also comes after tensions between the two nations have eased, following accusations from US President Donald Trump against Nigeria over the protection of Christians.
Trump has claimed that Nigeria has failed to protect Christians in its territory from an alleged genocide against them.
The Nigerian government has maintained that claims of a systemic religious persecution of Christians are "unfounded," saying that US rhetoric had been "disparaging."
The West African nation has said its forces are waging a comprehensive counter-terrorism campaign against groups that target "Nigerians of all faiths."
Nigeria is home to more than 200 ethnic groups that largely practice Christianity or Islam, with some also following traditional religions. While the country has a history of coexistence, it has also experienced sporadic violence driven by ethnic tensions and competition over scarce resources.
Ongoing violence continues to plague central Nigeria, pitting Fulani Muslim herders against predominantly Christian farmers. However, experts say that their conflict is primarily driven by limited land and resources rather than religious differences.

Some 100 US soldiers are being deployed to Nigeria as part of increased military cooperation to fight insecurity in the West African country, the Nigerian defence ministry announced Monday.
"The Defence Headquarters (DHQ) wishes to announce the arrival of about 100 United States military personnel and associated equipment at Bauchi Airfield," the statement said on Monday.
"The arrival is planned and deliberate following a formal request by the Federal Government of Nigeria to the US government to support a clearly defined military training requirement, technical support and intelligence sharing with the members of the Armed Forces of Nigeria."
The ministry did not specify when the "US military trainers" arrived or were due to arrive.
Nigeria is facing a longstanding militant insurgency in the northeast, a conflict between farmers and herders in north-central regions, separatist violence in the southeast, and kidnappings for ransom in the northwest.
US troops won’t engage in combat
US President Donald Trump has claimed that Christians in Nigeria are being "persecuted" and are victims of "genocide" perpetrated by "terrorists".
But Abuja and most independent experts say the violence in Nigeria indiscriminately affects both Christians and Muslims.
On December 25, the US military conducted air strikes in Nigeria's Sokoto State.
Nigerian authorities subsequently said the action was coordinated with them and it targeted Daesh-linked militants.
For the announced deployment, Nigeria's DHQ said: "The US personnel are technical specialists serving strictly in an advisory and training capacity. They are not combat forces."
Major General Samaila Uba, spokesman for Nigeria’s Defense Headquarters, previously has said that the US troops won’t engage in combat or have a direct operational role, and that Nigerian forces will have complete command authority.

Spain said on Monday it will use UN channels to send humanitarian aid to Cuba, which is suffering an acute economic crisis worsened by a de facto US fuel blockade.
“Spain will provide humanitarian aid … to Cuba through the United Nations system in the form of food and essential health products,” the foreign ministry said in a statement following a meeting between the foreign ministers of the two countries in Madrid.
The announcement follows the dispatch by Mexico of 800 tonnes of humanitarian aid to Cuba, which arrived on two Mexican navy ships late last week.

Cuba’s economic straits have worsened with moves by US President Donald Trump to economically strangle the Caribbean country.
Trump has vowed to cut off oil and fuel deliveries to Cuba, following the US military operation last month to attack Venezuela’s capital, Caracas, and grab leader Nicolas Maduro. Venezuela had been Cuba’s main supplier of oil.

The United Nations said on Friday it was deeply alarmed by the crisis unfolding in Cuba.

English Premier League side Brentford has advanced to the fifth round of the FA Cup, defeating non-league club Macclesfield 1-0.
Macclesfield made history in the tournament, defeating Premier League side and FA Cup holders Crystal Palace in one of the competition's biggest upsets.
What's next?
Text will face West Ham United in the round of the FA Cup.
Non-league English football club Macclesfield's tremendous FA Cup run has come to an end, falling to Premier League side Brentford on Tuesday, AEDT.
An own goal midway through the second half by Macclesfield's Sam Heathcote ended the deadlock, and would lead to the 1-0 win for Brentford.
Sixth-tier Macclesfield, who knocked out holders Crystal Palace in the previous round, frustrated their Premier League opponents in the first half of their fourth-round tie.
Goalkeeper Max Dearnley made some fine saves, denying Brentford's Reiss Nelson from close range.
Macclesfield's James Dawson came closest to scoring for the hosts with a long-range effort that sailed just wide.
After the break, Brentford increased the pressure, forcing Dearnley to react quickly to keep out Kaye Furo's close-range header.
However, the goalkeeper was beaten when Heathcote inadvertently headed Aaron Hickey's cross into his own net while attempting to clear in the 70th minute.
The result secured Brentford a fifth-round tie against West Ham United. Macclesfield bowed out of the competition after a brilliant run and another strong performance against top-flight opposition.
The final match of the FA Cup fourth round will be played on March 4, AEDT, with third-tier side Port Vale hosting second-tier club Bristol City.
The winner of that match will play Sunderland.

A quarter of parents say their children aren’t getting mental health support

A quarter of parents say their children aren’t getting mental health support
The burden was disproportionately felt in households with homeschooled children
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
Nearly a quarter of parents in the United States say at least one of their children is not receiving the mental health care they need, according to Harvard researchers, exposing critical gaps to access around the country.
At least one child needed mental health care in one in five of the 173,000 households included in the new survey.
“Among these parents, 24.8 percent reported an unmet need, 16.6 percent reported difficulty in accessing care and 21.8 percent cited such difficulty as the reason their children did not receive care,” the researchers said in a study analyzing the 2023-2024 data.
The burden was disproportionately felt in households with homeschooled children. More than 30 percent of children in those homes had an unmet need for care.
“Our analysis provides timely evidence that, despite the increasing awareness of youth mental health needs, access to necessary mental health care remains a challenge for a large number of U.S. households,” Hao Yu, an associate professor at Harvard Medical School, said in a statement.
The burden was also greater for households with a single parent and multiple children, and in households that had no health insurance or were on Medicaid benefits.
This suggests that “Medicaid coverage may not adequately address treatment access issues,” the researchers said.
“It is concerning to see larger gaps for single-parent and multi-child households, households with homeschooled children, uninsured households and households with Medicaid,” said Alyssa Burnett, project manager at the Harvard Pilgrim Health Care Institute.
The researchers said the survey’s results provide evidence that action needs to be taken to address these barriers to access.
“Strategies such as child mental health workforce initiatives and integrating mental health care into primary care should be implemented at the state level to remove barriers to this much-needed care,” said Yu.
The findings build on previous research that showed families’ race and ethnicity, health insurance coverage, parental education and various socioeconomic factors are all blame.
“Being a member of non-Hispanic Black or non-Hispanic Asian and other minoritized populations was significantly associated with higher perceived difficulty accessing mental health care services,” researchers in Tennessee and Ohio wrote in 2024.
Mental health care during childhood - as children’s brains grow - is crucial to ensure a child is able to have a happy and healthy life. Treatment may include talk therapy, medication or school-based services.
One in five U.S. kids between the ages of three and 17 years old has a mental, emotional, behavioral or developmental disorder, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, up from one in seven in 2019.
Just 20 percent of those kids will receive treatment, the agency says.

‘ICE-style enforcement’: Nearly 70 groups slam proposed EU migration policy
Nearly 70 groups hit out on Feb 16 at EU reforms to migration currently under consideration by the European Parliament, comparing them to US policy under President Donald Trump and calling on officials to abandon the text.
“This threat is real and immediate,” the wide array of associations, including European and national rights groups, said in a letter expressing concern over police raids of public and private spaces, and racial profiling.
“They want to oblige member states to ‘detect’ undocumented people – turning everyday spaces, public services, and community interactions into tools of ICE-style immigration enforcement,” they warned.
The Trump administration has ramped up efforts to deport millions of undocumented migrants from the United States.
Trump slams energy deal between California and Britain, calls governor Newsom ‘loser’
US President Donald Trump denounced a clean energy agreement between the United Kingdom and California Governor Gavin Newsom hours after it was signed on Feb 16, media outlet Politico reported.
In an interview with the outlet, Mr Trump said it was “inappropriate” for Britain to be dealing with the Democratic governor. Mr Trump, a Republican, also branded Mr Newsom “a loser,” saying “his state has gone to hell, and his environmental work is a disaster.”
Mr Newsom is an outspoken Trump critic and has publicly mulled seeking the Democratic presidential nomination in 2028.
France opens murder probe as killing of far-right activist stokes tensions
French authorities have opened a murder probe into the death of a far-right activist last week, a public prosecutor said on Feb 16, in a killing the government has blamed partly on the hard left.
Mr Quentin Deranque, 23, died after sustaining a severe brain injury when he was attacked on Feb 12 by “at least six” people on the sidelines of a far-right protest against a left-wing politician speaking at a university in Lyon, the western city’s prosecutor Thierry Dran said at a press conference on Feb 16.
No arrests had yet been made and authorities were working to identify the masked and hooded suspects in the killing, which is being investigated as an “intentional homicide” and “aggravated assault”, he added.
Godfather and Apocalypse Now actor Robert Duvall dead at 95
Robert Duvall, who played the smooth mafia lawyer in The Godfather and stole the show with his depiction of a surfing-crazed colonel in Apocalypse Now, has died at the age of 95, his wife said on Feb 16.
His death on Feb 15 was confirmed by his wife Luciana Duvall.
“Yesterday we said goodbye to my beloved husband, cherished friend, and one of the greatest actors of our time. Bob passed away peacefully at home,” she wrote.
S’pore’s Faiz Basha battles tough conditions, places 35th in slalom at Winter Olympics
After enduring a difficult start to his Winter Olympics debut, Singaporean alpine skier Faiz Basha returned to the Bormio slopes with a vengeance on Feb 16.
On Feb 14, the 23-year-old saw his run in the men’s giant slalom ending prematurely with a DNF (did not finish) after he lost his right ski as he attempted to clear a gate.
Two days later, he had to battle through driving snow in his first slalom run at the Stelvio Ski Centre in Bormio, Italy. But he powered through the treacherous conditions to clock a time of 2 minutes and 20.45 seconds across two runs to finish 35th.

Signs are pointing to a ‘blue wave’ in the midterm elections. Here’s why Democrats shouldn’t get too cocky
The map still favors Republicans, Democratic voters see their party leaders as weak and Trump has always found ways to defy political gravity, Eric Garcia writes
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
The mid-presidential-term congressional elections typically have a rhythm: two years after a president begins their term, voters get antsy that progress has not come quick enough, or they find they dislike what the administration does.
Voters then sweep in the opposing party to take control of the legislative branch — or at least prevent it from being a rubber stamp for the White House.
And Donald Trump, now in his second, non-consecutive, term, is facing the dreaded six-year itch, which is actually a 10-year itch given that he stayed on the scene as a power player from 2021 to 2025 despite being out of the White House.
The generic ballot, which determines whether voters would vote for a generic Democrat or Republican for Congress, currently shows Democrats have a significant advantage.
But the Democrats generally do not play well with a lead, to use a sports metaphor.
Polling shows that voters disapprove of Trump’s performance on everything from immigration, the issue where he’s set the tone for the past decade, and the economy. CNN flagged that Trump is now doing worse than Joe Biden did around the same time in his presidency in four polls.
And yes, all of this is a five-alarm fire for Republicans. House Speaker Mike Johnson notably has only 218 seats in the House of Representatives and cannot afford any defections at any time. And Democrats, despite having their own internecine fights between progressives and moderates, remain surprisingly unified.
But Democrats need to be wary of past resting on laurels — or inattention to the concerns of voters beyond the drumbeat of ‘Trump and MAGA is bad’ and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries should not start measuring the drapes in the speaker’s office just yet.
Democrats still have a long way to go when it comes to whether they can take back the House, let alone win the Senate. And there are always exceptions that prove the rule. Let’s start with one uncomfortable truth: The Democratic Party remains unpopular.
Not only that, a Quinnipiac University poll showed that only 42 percent of Democrats approve of the way Democrats in Congress are handling their job. By contrast, 77 percent of Republicans approve of how Republicans are doing their job.
This can be perfectly exemplified by the fact that in New Jersey’s 11th district earlier this month, Analilia Mejia, a progressive activist, won a primary for Gov. Mikie Sherrill’s old seat, beating more establishment candidates. That simultaneously served as a warning shot for party leaders to get on the same page, but more moderate front-liners risk being roped in with the more left-wing insurgents.
Democrats face another hurdle: an unfavorable Senate map.
Last week, Sen. Susan Collins announced she would seek re-election in Maine. Democrats have long hoped to beat the moderate Republican ever since she won a seat in liberal New England. But she has continued to vex them and won despite sharing a ticket with Barack Obama in 2008 and Joe Biden in 2020.
Democrats caught a lucky break in North Carolina when Trump chased away incumbent Sen. Thom Tillis and created an opening for popular former Democratic governor Roy Cooper, who like Collins, wins over split-ticket voters.
Those are the easy ones. After that, they have to hope that Republicans in Texas nominate the embattled attorney general Ken Paxton to beat John Cornyn in the primary next month to have even a remote chance of winning. And it’s still Texas. Democrats caught a lucky break when former congresswoman Mary Peltola jumped into Alaska’s Senate race. But even though Alaska has ranked-choice voting, it’s still a state that Trump won by 13 points.
The other two options for Democrats aren’t that easy either. Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst announced her retirement, but Trump won the state by 13.3 points. Former senator Sherrod Brown, who lost in 2024, is running against Sen. John Husted, whom the governor appointed to finish JD Vance’s term. But Trump turned the state from purple to deep red in the past decade and won it by 11.2 points.
Trump defied the rules of political physics as long as he’s been on the political scene.
Democrats have long wanted Trump to have his comeuppance the way other presidents have had in their midterm elections. But almost every time there has been a vote that served as a referendum on Trump, the blue wave came with a caveat.
In 2018, when Democrats won the House of Representatives, they won 40 seats, far less than the walloping 63 seats Republicans won in 2010 in the Tea Party wave against Obama. On top of that, while Democrats flipped Senate seats in Arizona–beginning its turn to becoming a purple state–and Nevada, they lost seats in Florida, Indiana, Missouri and North Dakota.
The same thing happened in 2020.
That year, as Trump bungled the response to Covid-19, they hoped to grow their majority in the House and flip Senate seats in North Carolina, Iowa, Maine and even Kansas. Instead, they lost 13 seats and Trump actually grew his support among Hispanic and Asian-American voters. Democrats would only win Senate seats in Arizona and Colorado on Election Night and their future hinged on winning two runoff races in Georgia two months later when Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock would win their races.
Then, of course, there is 2024, when Democrats hoped to expel Trump. Instead, due to disapproval over rising costs and the Biden administration losing control of migration across the US-Mexico border, Trump won all swing states and, in fact, blue cities saw a bigger swing to Trump and he further consolidated his support among Hispanic voters.
This time may be different. There will be no impending Trump return and he can no longer be on the ballot. Whereas Joe Biden’s administration said inflation was temporary and the pain would eventually go away, the Trump administration denies Americans are even feeling the pinch from tariffs he imposed.
And midterms rarely require the minority party to craft a message other than to not be the party in power.
That being said, Democrats likely remember these painful near-victories and know they will need to fortify their offensive strategy.

Germany to back Lebanon after UN peacekeepers leave

Germany will keep supporting Lebanon after UN peacekeepers leave, the German president says
Germany moved to assure Lebanon on Monday that it will support the Lebanese government even after pulling out German troops deployed as part of UN peacekeepers along the Lebanon-Israel border when their mission ends later this year.
German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier made the announcement during a news conference at the presidential palace near Beirut.
Germany’s navy, he said, is already training Lebanese troops as they boost their presence in the country’s south following the 14-month war between Israel and the Lebanese Hezbollah group.
The mission of the multinational UN peacekeeping force in southern Lebanon, known as UNIFIL, concludes at the end of 2026, nearly five decades after it was deployed. The force has played a significant role in monitoring the security situation in the region, including during the Israel-Hezbollah war last year.
Over the past months, Beirut has said that Lebanon will need a follow-up force to fill the vacuum in southern Lebanon once the UN peacekeepers leave.
“After the end of UNIFIL’s mission, Germany will stay by the side of your country to boost state authority,” Steinmeier said, without elaborating. It remains unlikely German troops — tasked with preventing arms smuggling by sea and helping the Lebanese army monitor the country’s sea border — would remain in Lebanon.
UNIFIL currently numbers about 7,500 peacekeepers, including 179 Germans.
“The Lebanese armed Forces are, of course, the backbone of stability in Lebanon and this means that after UNIFIL’s mission we have to think how to strengthen” the army, Steinmeier said.
Steinmeier added that the process of disarming Hezbollah — which was part of a November 2024 US-brokered ceasefire that halted the fighting — should move ahead and that Israel should fully withdraw from Lebanese territory.
Lebanese President Joseph Aoun said Lebanon paid a high price for the Hezbollah-Israel war, which Hezbollah started by firing rockets into Israel a day after the Palestinian group Hamas attacked southern Israel on October 7, 2023, triggering the war in Gaza.
Israel expanded its attacks that included bombardment and a ground operation in September 2024, severely weakening Hezbollah.
The Israel-Hezbollah conflict killed more than 4,000 people in Lebanon, including hundreds of civilians, and caused an estimated $11 billion in damage and destruction, according to the World Bank.
In Israel, 127 people died, including 80 soldiers.
“We were forced to live through violent conflicts we did not choose and we bore their burdens. We are no longer able to do so,” Aoun said of the Israel-Hezbollah war.
Aoun also said he had asked Steinmeier to have Germany assume a “main role” after UNIFIL, without elaborating what that would entail, and to also ask Israel to abide by the ceasefire and withdraw from Lebanon. He made no mention of Hezbollah's withdrawal from southern Lebanon.

Drone attack on busy market in Sudan kills at least 28
Drone-fired missiles have hit a market in central Sudan’s Kordofan region, killing at least 28 people and wounding dozens of others, a rights group says.
Emergency Lawyers, a group tracking violence against civilians, said in a statement on Monday that drones bombed the al-Safiya market in the town of Sodari in North Kordofan state.

The bombing on Sunday occurred when the market was packed with people, “exacerbating the humanitarian tragedy”, it said, adding that the number of casualties is likely to rise.
“The attack occurred when the market was bustling with civilians, including women, children and the elderly,” the group said.
“The repeated use of drones to target populated areas shows a grave disregard for civilian lives and signals an escalation that threatens what remains of daily life in the province. Therefore, we demand an immediate halt to drone attacks by both sides of the conflict,” the statement said.
The area is currently the fiercest front line in the three-year-old war between the Sudanese army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF).
Sodari, a remote town where desert trade routes cross, is 230km (132 miles) northwest of el-Obeid, the capital of North Kordofan, which the RSF has been trying to encircle for months.
The Kordofan region has seen a surge in deadly drone attacks as both sides fight over the country’s vital east-west axis, which links the western RSF-held Darfur region, through el-Obeid, to the army-controlled capital, Khartoum, and the rest of Sudan.
After consolidating its hold on Darfur last year, the RSF has pushed east through the oil- and gold-rich Kordofan in an attempt to seize Sudan’s central corridor.
Emergency Lawyers said on X that the drones targeting the market on Sunday belonged to the army.
Two military officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorised to brief the media, told The Associated Press news agency that the army does not target civilian infrastructure and denied the attack.
A week ago, a drone close to the city of Rahad in North Kordofan hit a vehicle carrying displaced families, killing at least 24 people, including eight children. A day before the attack, a World Food Programme aid convoy was also hit by drones.
Violence ‘shocking in scale and brutality’
Fighting between the RSF and the Sudanese military erupted into a full-blown war across the country in April 2023. So far, at least 40,000 people have been killed and 12 million displaced, according to the World Health Organization.
Aid groups say the true death toll could be many times higher, as the fighting in vast and remote areas impedes access.
The United Nations human rights chief recently said that the Kordofan region remains “volatile and a focus of hostilities” as the warring parties vie for control of strategic areas.
Both sides have been accused of atrocities.
The UN Human Rights Office issued a report on Friday saying that more than 6,000 people were killed over three days when the RSF unleashed “a wave of intense violence… shocking in its scale and brutality” in Darfur in late October.
The RSF’s offensive to capture the city of el-Fasher, which used to be a military stronghold, in late October included widespread atrocities that amounted to war crimes and possible crimes against humanity, according to the UN.
The war has created the world’s largest hunger and displacement crisis. It has also effectively split the country in two, with the army holding the centre, north and east, while the RSF controls the west and, with its allies, parts of the south.

With gold medal win, Elana Meyers Taylor is the most decorated U.S. female bobsledder
Elana Meyers Taylor won the Olympic gold medal for Team USA in women's monobob on Monday, making her the most decorated U.S. female bobsledder out there.
She beat Germany's Laura Nolte. Fellow American, Kaillie Armbruster Humphries, who's won gold three times, took home the bronze.
Meyers Taylor, a 41-year-old five-time Olympian, previously won silver three times and bronze twice. She also has more medals to her name than any Black athlete in Winter Olympics history, according to Team USA.
With Monday's gold, she's also tied speed skater Bonnie Blair for the most medals by a female U.S. Winter Olympian. Speed skater Apolo Anton Ohno, who earned eight medals across three Winter Olympics, holds the overall top spot for U.S. Winter Olympians.
Meyers Taylor is also now the oldest American woman to ever win gold at the Winter Games.
"I love going fast and I love being able to control this thing that should be out of control, that should be uncontrollable," she told CBS News before the race. "It's just so much fun to me and when you hit the curves right and when you're gliding, it feels like being a superhero."
Meyers Taylor also competes in two-woman bobsled.
Last year, she took home bronze in the world championships. Overall, she's earned 10 medals across her years competing in the world championships.
Meyers Taylor originally had hopes of competing in the Summer Olympics as a football player, but told CBS News she "had a disaster of a tryout." Her parents, who'd seen bobsledding on TV, suggested she give it a shot.
Husband Nic Taylor is a former Olympic bobsledder.
A mom of two, Meyers Taylor is also an advocate for children who have disabilities. Both of her sons, Nico and Noah, are deaf and Nico also has Down syndrome. In addition to training for the Olympics, she's also juggled normal parenting responsibilities and learning sign language.
In November, Meyers Taylor told CBS News that when all the training is done and she's in race mode, "I don't think about anything. My mind goes completely blank, and I'm just fully in the moment, fully present. And I think that what keeps bringing me back is there's very few times in life that you can be that present."

Remembrances poured in Monday in honor of Robert Duvall, the Oscar-winning actor known for roles in “Apocalypse Now,” “Lonesome Dove,” Tender Mercies" and as the intrepid consigliere of the first two “Godfather” movies.
Duvall died Sunday at age 95 at at his home in Virginia, according to an announcement from his publicist and a statement posted on his Facebook page by his wife, Luciana Duvall.
Viola Davis
“I’ve always been in awe of your towering portrayals of men who were both quiet and dominating in their humanness. You were a giant … an icon … Apocalypse Now, The Godfather, To Kill a Mockingbird, Tender Mercies, The Apostle, Lonesome Dove … etc … Greatness never dies. It stays … as a gift. Rest well, sir. Your name will be spoken.” — the actor, Duvall's co-star in “Widows,” on Instagram.
Adam Sandler
“Funny as hell. Strong as hell. One of the greatest actors we ever had. Such a great man to talk to and laugh with. Loved him so much. We all did. So many movies to choose from that were legendary. Watch them when you can. Sending his wife Luciana and all his family and friends our condolences.” — the actor, who starred with Duvall in “Hustle,” on X.
Michael Keaton
“another friend goes down. acted with and became friends. shared a great afternoon on my front porch talking about horses. he was greatness personified as an actor.” — the actor, Duvall's co-star in “The Paper,” on Instagram.
Robert Patrick
“We talked horses, dogs, Clemson football, dancing the tango and Marlon Brando. At one point he told me to go find the letter Marlon had sent him after they worked together on The Godfather. It was typed and perfectly composed. Bobby was more proud of that letter than his Oscar. Marlon was the actor he looked up to.” — the actor, remembering a recent visit at Duvall's home in Virginia, on Facebook.
Rob Schneider
"Powerful yet gentle as a bird in his unforgettable turn in “The Lonesome Dove,” Bob had the ability to make you forget instantly the conceit that you were watching a performance and gripped us with the sincerity and emotion of a consigliere as Tom in “The Godfather.” Equally hilarious as the surfer loving Army Officer in “Apocalypse Now,” he never gave a moment for the audience to not believe." — the actor, on Facebook.
Jamie Lee Curtis
“The greatest consigliere the screen has ever seen. Bravo, Robert Duvall” — the actor, on Instagram
SAG-AFTRA
“We celebrate the legacy of Robert Duvall, a true acting legend whose work shaped generations. Twice honored with SAG-AFTRA Actor Awards, his influence on the craft will endure. Our thoughts are with his wife, Luciana, and all who loved him.” — the union that represents actors and broadcasters, on X.
Mike Huckabee
“One of my best days was spending a full day with Robert Duvall & his lovely wife at his ranch — interviewed him for my then Fox News show. He was gracious, hospitable, & humble. Truly a gentleman & one of the greatest actors of all time. He didn’t ‘play’ a role— he WAS the role.” — the U.S. ambassador to Israel, on X.

Touching moment Ohio high school student who was homeless is gifted a car
Daron Webb hopes to become a licensed electrician
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
An Ohio high school graduate who navigated homelessness, mental health struggles and taking care of his little brother on top of going to class has been gifted a car by his local community.
Video shared by WTVG showed Daron Webb covering his mouth with his hands and exclaiming, “What!” as he was surprised with a red Honda Civic in Rossford, a suburb of Toledo, last Thursday.
While finishing senior year at Waite High School in Toledo, Webb was experiencing homelessness and depression — and was also responsible for the care of his younger brother — when he fell behind in credits and was unable to graduate on time.
“The main thing was getting Daron to graduate. He fell credit-deficient. He fell behind, and then, finally, he kind of divulged that he was living in a not-so-common situation,” Toledo Public Schools Superintendent Dr. Romulus Durant told WTVG.
With Durant’s help, Webb attended summer school and graduated from Waite High School in the fall of 2025. Soon after, he was connected with the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, and the labor union took him on, according to the report.
“He had a vision of wanting to be in IBW, so working with some of the brotherhood and sisterhood of the IBW family, they immediately took him in,” Durant said.
When Durant learned that Webb had been walking over a mile to work every day, regardless of the weather, he knew he had to step in again.
The superintendent reached out to Yark Automotive Group, State Farm and other local organizations to rally behind Webb and get him a 2018 Honda Civic, according to the report.
Emily Yark, of Yark Automotive Group, said her family-owned business was more than happy to help.
“We believe in supporting the success of our community and our neighbors,” Yark said. “We cannot wait to see the look on Daron’s face when he gets the keys to his new car and hope it provides him with the continuing drive toward success.”
Webb, who hopes to become a licensed electrician, was completely surprised by the gift. “Man, I don’t even know what I’m feeling right now…It’s just I don’t even, haven’t had time to process everything ‘cause I did not expect it,” Webb said.
“Don’t get caught up in what other people think. It’s important that you stick to what you truly believe and what you truly think that’s going to benefit you, and it’s going to go from there,” Webb said.

Female troops are under assault, and not just in Bnei Brak

Female troops are under assault, and not just in Bnei Brak
More and more young women, including religious ones, are choosing army service, proving their worth on the battlefield even as conservatives launch a new campaign to push them out
It is impossible to know exactly what motivated the violent mob that converged upon two soldiers in Bnei Brak on Sunday, forcing them to run and hide in fear for their lives before being rescued by police.
Authorities have indicated that the uniformed squad commanders from the Education and Youth Corps were in the ultra-Orthodox stronghold to visit a recruit who was set to enlist in their unit next month, a standard practice.
Their presence, though, set off false rumors that they were there to arrest a draft dodger or forcibly draft a young religious man. Such hearsay has sparked rioting elsewhere in the past.
So the fact that both soldiers were female may not have been a central factor egging their attackers on.
Yet Sunday’s melee was more than just the most recent battle in a war being waged by an ultra-Orthodox community seeking to cut itself off from the rest of society.
With the place of women in the military under fresh assault from some corners of society, as the ranks of female soldiers, including those from religious backgrounds, continue to swell, the riot was also a manifestation of the toxic fraying of the consensus around the Israel Defense Force’s push for gender equality.
More women joining up
Since the establishment of the State of Israel, young women, from the age of 18, have been obligated to enlist in the IDF. Those claiming a religious lifestyle are exempted, though they also have the option of serving the nation’s civilian needs as part of what is known as National Service.
According to data provided by the IDF to the Movement for Freedom of Information, the recruitment rate among female graduates of secular schools has remained stable over the last decade, standing at approximately 92 percent.
However, the last several years have seen young women coming from national-religious backgrounds increasingly joining their secular counterparts, rather than signing up for the civilian corps.
According to the data, between the years 2018 and 2025, the rate of women identified as part of the national-religious community enlisting in the IDF rose from 25% to 31%. This upward trend began even earlier, despite aggressive campaigns by conservative rabbis against women serving – especially in combat roles.
Though there is some overlap in belief and practice, the national-religious community is distinct from the ultra-Orthodox community in several key ways. While both are God-fearing, those who count themselves as national religious are usually more willing to engage with secular society, including in education, employment, and culture. As a whole, the community is ardently Zionist and supports the military.
The ultra-Orthodox, by contrast, generally seek to separate themselves from the rest of society to protect their religious mores, including strict adherence to gender roles. Many parts of the community reject Zionism, prize the study of Jewish texts over gainful employment, and refuse military service, including when that means, for men, ignoring the requirement to serve.
According to official data, only 0.3% of women who graduated from the Haredi educational system serve. Among men, the number is only slightly higher.
Woman warriors
The Bnei Brak skirmish followed a wave of media attacks against female combat service in recent weeks. For the detractors, the problem is not merely the draft itself, but the fact that more and more young women are staffing combat units.
The question of combat service has been at the heart of public discourse since the landmark 1995 High Court ruling in the case of Alice Miller, which stated that the IDF must allow women equal rights in applying for pilot training in the Israeli Air Force.
Miller, an aerospace engineer with a civilian pilot’s license, did not pass the screening for the pilot’s course following her legal victory, but she opened the door for dozens of women who have since marched into prestigious pilot and naval officer courses. Simultaneously, women began integrating into combat roles in the Border Police and the Ground Forces.
Data provided by the IDF to The Times of Israel shows that in 2015, 7.2% of combat soldiers were female. By 2025, that had skyrocketed to 21.2%.
It was not until October 7, 2023, however, that most Israelis were exposed to instances of female soldiers engaging in combat, as troops from the Border Defense Corps, Artillery Corps, Border Police, and the Home Front Command’s Search and Rescue battalions fought off invading Hamas-led terrorists across southern Israel. Many paid the ultimate price for their heroism.
A total of 32 female soldiers, not all of them on duty, were killed during the October 7 onslaught. They include 16 female surveillance soldiers killed at the IDF’s Nahal Oz base.
For five hours during the onslaught, from 8 a.m. to 1 p.m., the female commander of the Caracal mixed-gender light infantry battalion, Lt. Col. Or Ben Yehuda, was the most senior officer on the ground.
Ben Yehuda, 37, rushed with the fighters under her command early on October 7 to the Sufa military post and helped hold the line against hundreds of terrorists, while repelling infiltrations into the outpost and nearby kibbutz of the same name. Only in the afternoon did commando units link up with her, and together they rescued about 30 Nahal Brigade soldiers who were besieged in the Sufa outpost’s mess.
Elsewhere along the border, Caracal’s all-female tank crew won plaudits as what may have been the first such unit worldwide to engage in active combat.
Many more stories are less well-known:
At the Zikim base, female officers and staff commanders were among those who partook in the fight, saving 90 recruits. Three were killed.
At the Urim base, female soldiers and officers from the Home Front Command and the Combat Intelligence Collection array also engaged terrorists. Six were killed while attempting to fight them off, including the operations room officer.
A female officer, the commander of an Iron Dome battery, helped shoot down hundreds of rockets that morning and was killed alongside two of her soldiers while trying to retrieve more interceptors.
An officer in an elite Artillery Corps drone unit protected unarmed female soldiers in a bomb shelter at the Nahal Oz base, shooting at a terrorist and saving those inside.
And though they have gotten little attention, hundreds of women from various units also filled combat roles inside of Gaza during the ensuing war.
In the tank
Despite this reality, conservative opinion leaders view Ben Yehuda specifically as a symbol of everything they believe is “incorrect” in the modern IDF.
Recently, a number of features against Ben Yehuda were published in media outlets identified with the right-wing, including Channel 14 — a network staunchly aligned with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu — and “Olam Katan,” a religious pamphlet distributed at synagogues on Shabbat. Both are owned by Yitzhak Mirilashvili.
Channel 14 aired a 40-minute “special investigation,” in which Naama Zarviv, chairwoman of Shovrot Shivyon, a female-driven organization that advocates against gender equality, claimed that Ben Yehuda was promoted solely because she is a woman. Zarviv claimed that male company commanders who served under her reported to the organization that the officer “does not meet the operational standard.”
The claim is baseless. When Ben Yehuda was leading the Caracal battalion, only female company commanders served under her, not men. As for her supposed lack of qualification, Ben Yehuda was decorated with a citation from the chief of the Southern Command back in 2014 for her performance under fire on the Egyptian border.
Another figure starring in these publications is Aviad Gadot, a Haredi Zionist rabbi who leads far-right religious nationalist organizations that are working to remove women from combat service and from the IDF entirely. Gadot claims that joint service in tanks pushes religious men away from military service.
Reality tells a different story. The IDF does not operate mixed-gender tanks. Moreover, there is only one all-female tank company in the Border Defense Corps’ Caracal Battalion; it is not in the Armored Corps.
On October 7, 2023, Col. Shemer Raviv, the regional brigade commander and originally a paratrooper, joined the tank commanded by company commander Karni Gez, and was assisted by the female fighters inside. In an interview this reporter conducted with Raviv for a book on women in warfare, he recounted that the female soldiers saved his life while he tried to fight a large group of terrorists south of Route 232.
The false attacks forced IDF Spokesperson Brig. Gen. Effie Defrin to publish an unusual tweet featuring a photo of himself and his daughter, a recently released combat soldier, in which he rebuffed the claims against Ben Yehuda.
הבת שלי, אלה, שירתה כלוחמת בחיל הים. עוד לפני גיוסה לא הייתה לה התלבטות, היא ביקשה שירות קרבי ומשמעותי, ואני ליוויתי את הבחירה הזו בגאווה גדולה. גאווה על הדרך, על המאמץ, על הרצון לתרום למדינה ועל העשייה המבצעית לאורך השירות כולו.

— דובר צה״ל אפי דפרין – Effie Defrin (@IDFSpokesperson) February 2, 2026
The battle over the Armored Corps comes on the heels of a claim, also in Olam Katan, that female fighters have “taken over” the Artillery Corps, where they constitute about 20% of the force, and have “ruined” it for religious men.
But unlike tanks, activity in the Artillery Corps is mostly conducted in open spaces rather than closed confines; therefore, the integration of female fighters in that force is more extensive and poses fewer religious issues.
Those waging war against female troops are not stopping, though. Recently, an AI-generated video was distributed purporting to show that female paramedics serving alongside male soldiers in APCs in Gaza harms “family sanctity” for religious men in fatigues.
These campaigns resurface every few years, but have yet to make much headway: The rate of young women – both secular and religious – seeking combat roles remains on the rise, and they are proving their necessity on the battlefield each and every day.
If so, we have a request.
Every day during the past two years of war and rising global anti-Zionism and antisemitism, our journalists kept you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention. Millions of people rely on ToI for fact-based coverage of Israel and the Jewish world.

Teacher banned after lying about graduating from Cambridge and claiming to be five years younger than he was
Nicolas Martin claimed he was trying to pass himself off as ‘more dynamic and more fun’

A teacher has been banned from the profession indefinitely after he lied about going to the University of Cambridge and told his school he was five years younger than he was.
Nicolas Martin, who was the head of sixth form at St Edwards School in Cheltenham, admitted to lying on his job applications and fabricating documents.
Following an investigation by the school, he was also found to have lied about being a magistrate.
Mr Martin told a disciplinary hearing that he was trying to pass himself off as “more younger, more dynamic and more fun”.
The 43 year old qualified as a teacher in 2006 and started working at St Edmund's in September of that year. In 2024, he successfully applied to be the head of sixth form, and later in 2025, he applied for the deputy head position.
Discrepancies between the applications led to him being investigated and later referred to the teaching regulation agency.
A professional conduct panel heard that Mr Martin said his date of birth was 1987 in his application in 2025, despite previously saying it was 1982.
When asked about the discrepancy, he initially said that someone must have confused his handwriting, but in follow-up emails, he stated that the earlier 1982 date was incorrect and he had been seeking to correct it for several years.
The 1982 birth date was shown on employment records, including his passport and driver's licence, but Mr Martin said that the issue related to an error on an old passport.
The school then made further checks with the Department for Education, which only found records under the 1982 date.
Mr Martin then provided updated passport and driving licence documents, which showed the 1982 birth date.
As part of an investigation, the school also reviewed the job application he made in 2024, in which he said his date of birth was November 2012, which would have made him 12 years old.
He also claimed to have a master's degree in history from the University of Cambridge in his 2025 application, but told the school he had a master's degree in history from Lancaster University in his 2024 application.
When asked to see the Cambridge degree, Mr Martin provided what he said was a copy of the certificate, and claimed the original was at his home, as he “liked to show it off to friends on weekends”.
The University of Cambridge later confirmed the details on the certificate were not true.
Mr Martin had used the post-nominals “MA (Cantab)” and “JP” in his signature, and stated he sat as a magistrate around once a month in both applications.
HM Courts and Tribunals Service confirmed there was no record of him sitting as a magistrate in recent years.
During a disciplinary hearing in March, Mr Martin admitted to acting dishonestly, and accepted he had provided a false date of birth, had fabricated a certificate and had not sat as a magistrate for several years.
The panel report said: “Teachers must have proper and professional regard for the ethos, policies and practices of the school in which they teach, and maintain high standards in their own attendance and punctuality.
“The panel finds that the conduct of Mr Martin fell significantly short of the standards expected of the profession.”
He has been banned indefinitely from the classroom, and must wait two years before he can apply to have his prohibition order set aside.

Guthrie family members not suspects in Arizona kidnapping, sheriff says
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
TUCSON, Arizona, Feb 16 - Nancy Guthrie's family members have been cleared as possible suspects in her abduction, Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos said on Monday, as the case involving the mother of "Today" show co-anchor Savannah Guthrie entered its third week.
Guthrie's family, which includes "all siblings and spouses," has been cooperative and gracious as authorities investigate the kidnapping, Nanos said.
"To suggest otherwise is not only wrong, it is cruel," he said in a statement. "The Guthrie family are victims, plain and simple."
Investigators on Sunday said they had obtained a DNA sample from a glove that was found near 84-year-old Nancy Guthrie's Arizona home and appears to match the pair worn by a masked prowler seen in doorbell camera footage before she was abducted two weeks ago.
Nancy Guthrie was last seen on January 31 when she was dropped off at her home near Tucson by her family after she had dined with them, and was reported missing by relatives the following day, authorities have said.
Nanos has said the elder Guthrie was extremely limited in her physical mobility and could not have left her home unassisted, leading investigators to conclude early on that she had been taken against her will.
NO PROOF OF LIFE HAS SURFACED
At least two purported ransom notes have surfaced since she vanished, both of them delivered initially to news media outlets. There has been no known direct contact between any suspects and Guthrie's family or authorities.
Traces of blood found on her front porch were confirmed by DNA tests to have come from Guthrie, officials said last week. Law enforcement and family members have described her as being in frail health and in need of daily medication to survive. She also has a pacemaker.
Savannah Guthrie, 54, co-anchor of the popular NBC News morning show "Today," has posted several video messages, along with her brother Camron Guthrie and sister Annie Guthrie, pleading for their mother's return and appealing for the public's help in solving the case.
Nanos has told Reuters that no proof of life has surfaced since the abduction, but added that "there's not been any proof of death either," saying his working presumption is that Nancy Guthrie remains alive.
In an interview with the New York Post on Sunday, U.S. President Donald Trump demanded that Guthrie's kidnappers immediately release her unharmed, suggesting he would want the U.S. Justice Department to seek the death penalty if Guthrie is found dead.
Authorities would first need to find and convict a suspect before considering sentencing. REUTERS

MOSCOW, February 17. /TASS/. The situation near the city of Gulyaipole in the Zaporozhye Region is difficult for Kiev’s forces, Alexander Syrsky, the Ukrainian army's commander in chief, said.
"The operational situation in the area remains difficult," he wrote on Telegram after visiting several command posts in the Alexandrovka and Gulyaipole areas.
Russia’s Defense Ministry reported on February 15 that Lancet loitering munition units of Battlegroup East had thwarted the rotation of Ukrainian troops near the city of Gulyaipole. In addition, drone operators had identified Ukrainian drone control points hidden in forests in the Zaporozhye Region, providing their coordinates to howitzer crews. Artillery forces hit the drone control points and enemy troops.

Opinion | How the BNP’s Bangladesh election victory will shape policy trends
While the BNP’s margin of victory should help ensure stability, its roots in the old order could limit the speed and reach of reforms
Reading Time:3 minutes
Why you can trust SCMP
On February 12, Bangladesh held its first official general election since the fall of the Sheikh Hasina government. Compared with previous elections marred by violence and turmoil, this one was relatively calm. Although there were scattered allegations of irregularities, international observers generally praised it as one of the most transparent elections in Bangladesh’s history.
With voter turnout at nearly 60 per cent, the Bangladeshi people showed strong enthusiasm for change through democratic means. The results confirmed a sweeping victory for the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), whose alliance secured a large parliamentary majority. Jamaat-e-Islami leader Shafiqur Rahman accepted the outcome. BNP leader Tarique Rahman is expected to become prime minister.
The BNP’s win reflects the underlying realities of Bangladesh’s socioeconomic structure. The election also ratified major constitutional reforms via a simultaneous referendum, marking a new phase in the country’s democratic transition.

After the formation of the interim government in August 2024, expectations for reform were high, especially among the youth. However, the government only made limited adjustments in the following year without addressing deeper issues. With Bangladesh set to graduate from “least developed country” status this year, the public had hoped for a brighter future.
Yet under interim rule, the country saw political instability, economic decline, and rising youth unemployment and business costs, all of which hindered growth and preparations for the 2026 transition. Some began to view the interim government as lacking legitimacy and the authority to tackle national problems, with only an elected government able to restore stability and confidence.

With Hasina’s Awami League banned from participating, this election contest centred on the BNP and Jamaat-e-Islami. The National Civic Party (NCP), formed by student activists involved in the 2024 anti-Hasina protests, lost popular support amid student leaders’ weak organisation.

Budanov: Ukraine needs neo-industrialization
He reported this on Telegram, according to Ukrinform.
"Ukraine needs neo-industrialization. We must gain access to modern technologies and have a highly skilled workforce. This is one of the main tasks of today, and this is exactly what we discussed this past weekend at the forum 'Resilient Economy: Leadership Challenges 2026' in Kyiv. The event was organized by The Aspen Institute Kyiv in partnership with CEO Club Ukraine and the Frontier Institute," Budanov said.
He noted that no matter how heroic and professional the Ukrainian army is, without a strong economy, the military cannot protect the country.
"Back in the early 1990s, Ukraine was among the top ten countries in the world with the best economic indicators. However, decades of corruption and inefficient governance, plus 13 years of total war, have undermined our industrial capacity. We must restore our capabilities. This is a matter of national and state survival," Budanov said.
The forum brought together strong representation from business and government, parliament and local authorities, the army, and civil society, with everyone seeking answers on the path Ukraine should take after achieving sustainable peace.
"I was glad to exchange ideas with proactive citizens who strengthen our country daily, develop it across various sectors, and have a vision for the direction the country must move to achieve shared success," Budanov said.

New online casinos UK: Updated list for February 2026
- Bookmark
New online casinos entering the UK market face a lot of stiff competition from the brands who have dominated the space for decades.
Yet new casino sites such as Pub Casino, 7Bet and Kachingo are well capable of holding their own when compared with the best casino sites.
Top new casino sites UK
In this article, we rank the best new UK casino sites based on traits that are most sought-after by casino players – slot games, roulette, blackjack, welcome offers and mobile gaming.
Find the best new UK casino for you
Our rankings may chop and change as new online casinos emerge, or if existing new casinos up their game with better welcome offers, promotions, free-to-play games and other key selling points.
Best new UK casino for slots: O’Reels Casino
Launched in UK: 2025
Welcome Offer: Deposit £20, Get 20 Free Spins on Big Bass Splash
Key Features: Several banking options and a large games library, including Megaways and Drops and Wins.
Review
The luck of the Irish is a tried and tested slot game theme, but O’Reels Casino has taken that to a whole new level with an entirely Irish-themed casino.
Launched in the UK last year, they specialise in slots, with over 40 Irish-themed slots alone.
Yet there’s hundreds of alternative slots too, including video slots, Drops and Wins, Megaways and slingo.
The ‘New Games’ section is regularly updated, while customers can get a sense of what other gamers are playing via the ‘Popular’ and ‘Hot Slots’ sections.
Granted, the O’Reels welcome offer isn’t the strongest on the market – see below for the best casino sign up bonus this month – but it’s still worth taking up, and slots fans will find better ongoing offers for existing customers in the promotions section.
Pros
✓ Wide variety of games from all the top providers
✓ Many payment options including Pay By Mobile, PayPal, Google Pay, Trustly
✓ Strong customer support, including 24/7 live chat and email
Cons
✗ Low value welcome offer
✗ Withdrawals of less than £30 are subject to a £1.50 processing fee
Our Verdict:
Slots fans should look beyond the fairly limited welcome offer and focus on the extensive games library, plus the ongoing promos.
Best new UK casino for roulette: 7Bet Casino
Launched in UK: 2024
Welcome Offer: Deposit and Wager £20 and Get 100 Free Spins
Key Features: Integrated casino and sportsbook gaming, with standout live casino options.
Review
We’ve been busy testing out roulette offerings from the newest casinos in the UK and 7Bet stands out thanks to the wide variety of options.
There are now 38 different roulette games in 7Bet’s live dealer casino section alone.
If you navigate to the table games section, you’ll find further variations of roulette, including American First Person Roulette and European Roulette.
In each case, the gameplay was pretty immersive, especially on the mobile version of the site.
All-in-all, I counted 62 different roulette options, with the sports-themed versions our personal favourites – Football Auto Roulette, Horse Racing Auto Roulette and Sport Auto Roulette.
Pros
✓ Secure site with encrypted data for deposits/withdrawals
✓ Games by top providers including Evolution, NetEnt, Pragmatic Play, Big Time Gaming
✓ No fees charged for deposits or withdrawals
Cons
✗ Welcome bonus limited to selected games
✗ Lack of ongoing casino promos
✗ Heavy sports theme may not appeal to everyone
Our Verdict:
A great new option for roulette players, particularly those who are also interested in sports betting.
Best new online casino UK for blackjack: QuinnCasino
Launched in UK: 2025
Welcome Offer: Wager £10, Get 50 Free Spins
Key Features: Dedicated blackjack section with multiple variants and live dealer options from top providers.
Review
QuinnCasino has carved out a niche as the go-to destination for blackjack enthusiasts since launching in the UK market last year.
What sets them apart is their dedicated focus on providing the most comprehensive blackjack experience available at any new UK casino.
The live blackjack section features 15 different tables, including Speed Blackjack, Infinite Blackjack and VIP variants with higher betting limits.
We were particularly impressed by the Free Bet Blackjack and Lightning Blackjack options, which add exciting twists to the traditional game.
Beyond live dealer games, QuinnCasino offers 22 RNG blackjack variants, including Classic Blackjack, Atlantic City Blackjack and European Blackjack.
The side bet options are extensive, with Perfect Pairs and 21+3 available across most tables. Stakes range from 50p to £10,000, catering to all bankroll sizes.
Pros
✓ Largest selection of blackjack variants among new UK casinos
✓ Professional live dealers with multiple camera angles
✓ Comprehensive betting limits from casual to high roller
Cons
✗ Welcome bonus relatively modest compared to bigger brands
✗ Limited ongoing promotional offers
Our Verdict
Casino players will struggle to find a better brand new casino for blackjack, making QuinnCasino the clear choice for 21 enthusiasts.
Best new UK casino sign up offer: Kachingo
Launched in UK: 2025
Welcome Offer: 100% up to £188 + 88 Spins
Key Features: Market-leading welcome package with excellent ongoing promotions and cashback offers.
Review
Kachingo has launched with arguably the strongest new player incentive in the UK market right now.
Their welcome package combines substantial bonus money with an impressive free spins allocation that challenges any established competitor.
The 100 per cent match bonus up to £188 doubles your initial deposit, while the 88 free spins are available on the slot game Fire Joker.
With reasonable wagering requirements and a seven-day timeframe to clear, the terms are more player-friendly than most.
What really impressed us was the ongoing promotional calendar. Weekly reload bonuses, cashback offers up to 20 per cent, and their 'Lucky Friday' free spins promo ensures prolonged value beyond the welcome offer.
Pros
✓ Highest value welcome package among new UK casinos
✓ Fair wagering requirements with reasonable time limits
✓ Extensive ongoing promotions and loyalty rewards
Cons
✗ Game selection smaller than some established competitors
✗ Customer support limited to email and live chat only
✗ Some payment methods excluded from bonus eligibility
Our Verdict
For pure welcome bonus value, Kachingo currently leads the new casino market by a decent margin.
Best new casino app: Virgin Bet
Launched in UK: 2024
Welcome Offer: Play £10, Get 100 Free Spins - No Wagering
Key Features: Native mobile apps for iOS and Android, plus seamless mobile browser experience and exclusive mobile promotions.
Review
The Virgin Bet app stands out as a polished and reliable UK casino app with plenty to like, and this is backed up by the overwhelmingly positive reviews in the Apple App Store and Google Play Store.
Players consistently praise the clean design, fast load times and smooth navigation, making it easy to switch between slots, betting and promotions.
Virgin is a fast withdrawal casino and free games are regularly available, while the simplicity of the app is something we appreciated.
That said, you may find occasional technical glitches, particularly in live casino games and certain slots.
Pros
✓ Fastest loading times and smoothest gameplay among new casino apps
✓ Exclusive mobile promotions and tournaments
✓ Intuitive app design with simple navigation
Cons
✗ Welcome offer requires wagering rather than traditional deposit match
✗ Desktop site feels less polished compared to mobile experience
✗ Limited live dealer games available through the app
Our Verdict
Overall, Virgin Bet delivers a new, enjoyable mobile casino experience that comfortably ranks among the top UK casino apps.
How we rate new casino sites UK
Licensing
We will only recommend new online casinos that carry a licence to trade which has been awarded by the UK Gambling Commission (UKGC).
The UKGC exists to enforce the rules set by independent review bodies such as eCOGRA, so any new UK casinos that are not regulated by the UKGC are considered unsafe and should be avoided.
Security
Our recommended new casinos will all use up-to-date security features to protect customer details and data. Examples of such features include SSL encryption and two-factor authentication.
Reputation
We judge casinos by reputation and our impressions after using them. We consider established brands that are new to the UK market, such as Bally Casino and BetMGM, and brand new casinos that have caught our eye.
Game variety
The best new casino sites will provide plenty of variety for their users, whether that be slot games and roulette options or table games such as online poker. These games must be provided by a range of quality operators, such as NetEnt and Playtech.
Customer experience
What is the customer getting out of the casino? Are there enough games, such as slots, table games and live casino? Does it have a reputation as a high payout casino? There should be a variety of options and themes to satisfy all users.
Usability
How easy is the new casino and app to use? We only recommend sites that offer sound usability and functionality across the board, whether you’re using the desktop site, Apple or Android app, or a mobile browser.
Payment methods
Along with standard debit card, users should have access to a variety of payment options to reflect modern transactions. We want to ensure that newer methods are available, such as e-wallets, pay by mobile casinos and Apple Pay.
Welcome bonus
New customers should be rewarded with a quality casino sign up bonus. If we’re not satisfied with the casino bonuses on offer we won’t recommend the new casino.
Promotions
Promotions should not end after the welcome bonus. Users should have options such as free spins, free play games, free bets and prize draws, among others.
Payout rates
When recommending new casino sites, we check that their games have a reasonable volatility and RTP, and chances for users to win fairly.
Why choose a new UK casino?
At first glance, it can seem safer to stick with established names like Grosvenor, MrQ or 888.
However, many new UK casinos now offer clear advantages over long-standing operators.
New casino sites are often quicker to adopt emerging trends, whether that’s hybrid games like slingo, innovative bonus mechanics or modern slot formats.
They also tend to run on newer technology, delivering faster-loading websites, smoother mobile experiences, improved security and more efficient customer support, including AI-assisted help tools.
Crucially, newer casinos are competing hard for players. That competition usually translates into better-value welcome offers, with simpler terms and fewer restrictions than those found at older brands.
In many cases, new operators provide no deposit free spins or no wagering bonuses, allowing players to access winnings more quickly.
If you’re looking for stronger incentives, modern features and a fresher playing experience, new UK casinos are well worth considering.
Please gamble responsibly on new casinos
Remember that gambling is only a form of entertainment, not a way to make money.
Gambling sites can be addictive, so never wager more than you can afford to lose and take steps to remain in control of your budget.
If necessary, you can make use of responsible gambling tools offered by the best casino sites, such as deposit limits, loss limits, self-exclusion and time-outs.
The same applies whether you’re playing online slots, betting sites, bingo sites or any other form of gambling.
Should you wish to seek help for gambling-related issues, there are several charities, organisations and healthcare providers who offer support and information:

Shooting at Rhode Island youth hockey game leaves 3 dead, including shooter, and 3 more wounded
Shooting at Rhode Island youth hockey game leaves 3 dead, including shooter, and 3 more wounded
PAWTUCKET, R.I. (AP) — A shooting during a Rhode Island youth hockey game left three people dead, including the shooter, and three more hospitalized Monday night in critical condition, authorities said.
Pawtucket Police Chief Tina Goncalves told reporters that someone helped bring a swift end to the violent scene Monday afternoon by intervening and trying to subdue the shooter, who was at an arena to watch a family member’s hockey game. The shooter died from an apparent self-inflicted gun wound, she said, noting that authorities were still investigating.
“It appears that this was a targeted event, that it may be a family dispute,” she said.
Goncalves identified the shooter as Robert Dorgan, who she said also went by the name Roberta Esposito and was born in 1969.
The police chief did not provide further details about the shooter or the victims, except for saying it appeared that both victims who died were adults.
She said investigators were trying to piece together what happened and have spoken with scores of witnesses who were there inside Dennis M. Lynch Arena in Pawtucket, a few miles outside Providence. They also were reviewing video taken from the hockey game. Unverified footage circulating on social media shows players diving for cover and fans fleeing their seats after popping sounds are heard.
Outside the arena, tearful families and high school hockey players still in uniform were seen hugging before they boarded a bus to leave the area.
Monday’s shooting came nearly two months after Rhode Island was rocked by a gun violence tragedy at Brown University, where a gunman killed two students and wounded nine others. That shooter went on to also fatally shoot a Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor. Authorities later found Claudio Neves Valente, 48, dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound at a New Hampshire storage facility.
“The fortunate thing is that the two incidents are not related, but it is very tragic,” Pawtucket Mayor Don Grebien said. “These are high school kids. They were doing an event, they were playing with their families watching, a fun time, and it turned into this.”
Pawtucket is nestled just north of Providence and right under the Massachusetts state border. A city of just under 80,000, Pawtucket had up until recently been known as the home to Hasbro’s headquarters.

This story has been corrected to show that the shooting occurred on Monday, not Tuesday.

Billionaire Trump donor and tariff advocate is moving his Ohio manufacturing plant to China: report
John Paulson, who is worth an estimated $4 billion, previously spoke out against offshoring American manufacturing jobs
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
Cue the sad trombone: Hedge fund billionaire John Paulson — a major Trump donor and advocate of tariffs — is shuttering his Ohio brass instrument plant and offshoring work to China, according to a new report.
Paulson’s company Conn Selmer, the nation's top maker of orchestral and brass instruments, notified employees it will shift most of its East Lake plant operations to Asia by July, triggering about 150 layoffs, The Guardian reported.
Employees were informed of the decision last month, when they expected to negotiate a new union contract, according to United Auto Workers Local 2359, which represents the workers.
The employees said the company unveiled a new plant in China in 2025, and that work has slowly shifted to that location. However, workers in Ohio had previously been told their jobs were not in jeopardy.
Workers there expressed deep dissatisfaction with the decision, with one saying, “It really pisses me off,” while another said they felt “betrayed.”
A representative for Conn Selmer confirmed that, should a “tentative decision” be finalized, the firm will move some production out of the country, according to the outlet.
A company spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Independent.
Paulson — who is worth an estimated $4 billion, according to Forbes — has been a major backer of the Republican president for years.
During Trump’s first presidential campaign, Paulson served as an economic advisor, and he raised $50 million for the president at a 2024 fundraiser in Florida. He was also shortlisted to serve as treasury secretary, a position that was ultimately given to another hedge fund investor: Scott Bessent.
Paulson has also expressed support for Trump’s tariff agenda. Shortly before the 2024 election, he told Semafor that a 10 to 20 percent tariff to boost American manufacturing would be reasonable.
“It would result in higher import prices,” he said. “But on the other hand, it supports domestic manufacturing, so you get more jobs, more investment in the US, more taxes.”
Two months earlier, Paulson told CNBC that Trump’s tariff plans were “well-founded.”
He’s also publicly opposed moving jobs overseas. “We can’t have American producers closing American factories and offshoring,” he told the outlet. “We need to protect American jobs and protect American manufacturing,”
Robert Hines, president of UAW Local 2359 and a worker at the Conn-Selmer plant in Ohio, said Paulson’s latest decision smacks of hypocrisy.
“To go publicly on CNBC to support the Trump administration’s positive views on tariffs and all that stuff, and then you turn around and [say you] want to go send the work right over to China,” Hines told The Guardian. “It’s a slap in our face.”
Overall, U.S. manufacturing jobs have declined since last spring, when he first implemented his aggressive and wide-ranging tariffs — which he promised would lead to a renaissance of blue-collar jobs, according to Reuters.
The industry shed 8,000 jobs in December, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported. And since April employment in the sector has fallen by more than 70,000 to about 12.69 million as of December, marking the worst reading since March 2022.

Gloria Steinem pays tribute to Gisele Pelicot
Pioneering feminist Gloria Steinem has paid tribute to Gisele Pelicot, the woman at the centre of France's largest rape trial.
During a moving Newsnight interview broadcast on Sunday (15 February), Ms Steinem made a video appearance where she explained how “grateful” she was to survivor Ms Pelicot.
In December 2024, her husband Dominique Pelicot was found guilty and imprisoned for drugging and raping her and allowing other men to assault her while she was incapacitated.
Ms Pelicot bravely waived her right to anonymity, with the trial therefore held in public.
Social-political activist Steinem praised: “You have become a symbol of strength, of endurance, of kindness, of honesty, and we will be forever grateful to you”.

UK confirms parachute force to be cut to one battalion
United Kingdom

The Ministry of Defence has confirmed that the UK’s airborne parachute capability will be retained but narrowed in scope, with future capacity focused on specialist forces and a single battalion group.
In a written parliamentary answer published on 16 February 2026, minister Al Carns said the Strategic Defence Review (SDR) “considered all aspects of Defence, including military parachuting capabilities” and concluded that “airborne parachute capability and capacity should remain focused on specialists and a single battalion group.”
The response was issued after Conservative MP Ben Obese-Jecty asked what assessment had been made of the potential negative impact of removing parachute infantry deployment as a capability. Carns said the government had accepted the SDR’s recommendations in full and that implementation details would be outlined in the forthcoming Defence Investment Plan.
“The Government accepted the recommendations of the SDR in full and will publish the Defence Investment Plan as soon as possible to set out the plan for its implementation,” he said.
The statement comes amid reports that the Army is restructuring its airborne forces, with indications that 2nd and 3rd Battalions of The Parachute Regiment may lose their routine parachute jumping qualification. Under the emerging model, parachute insertion would remain a specialist capability, rather than a mass infantry deployment method held across multiple battalions. While supporters of the change argue this reflects modern operational realities and could generate cost savings, critics have warned it risks eroding a key rapid-entry capability and could represent a long-term decline in conventional airborne forces.

UN chief urges dialogue amid worsening fuel shortage in Cuba
Guterres 'very concerned about situation in Cuba, which is worsening as oil needs continue to be unmet,' says spokesperson
HAMILTON, Canada
UN chief Antonio Guterres continues to follow the situation in Cuba as the island nation grapples with a worsening fuel shortage, his spokesperson said on Monday.
"The Secretary-General has been following the situation in Cuba extremely closely, and I can tell you that he's very concerned about the situation in Cuba, which is worsening as oil needs continue to be unmet," Stephane Dujarric said during a news conference.
Recalling the UN General Assembly's repeated calls for an end "to the embargo imposed by the United States on Cuba," Dujarric said that Guterres "would like to see all parties pursue dialogue and respect for international law yet again."
"But our teams on the ground are working with the Government to help support the humanitarian relief for the people of Cuba," he added.
Cuba’s fuel crisis has worsened after the US cut off oil supplies from longtime ally Venezuela, which had been shipping tens of thousands of barrels daily to the island.
The disruption followed a US operation that captured former Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and the seizure of oil tankers, effectively halting key fuel deliveries.

Austria wins gold in 1st Olympic men's super team ski jump as event is shortened due to weather

Austria wins gold in 1st Olympic men's super team ski jump as event is shortened due to weather
Austria has won the first Olympic men’s super team ski jumping event
- Bookmark
Austria won the Olympic debut of the men's super team ski jump on Monday, capturing its first medal in the sport in the Milan Cortina Games as heavy snow and wind canceled the final round of the event.
Poland took silver and Norway got bronze.
The new format replaced the former four-man team contest on the large hill with teams of two. Seventeen nations jumped in the first round and the top 12 made the second round. The best eight moved on to the final.
But as a snow squall held up competition with only a few skiers left to make their final jump, the round was canceled and the second round standings determined the winners.
The result was redemption for the Austrian team that had won the men’s team event in Beijing in 2022, but had not reached the podium in this Olympics.
Jan Hoerl, who was part of the 2022 winning team, was paired with Stephan Embacher, who was in his first Olympics, for the victory.
Austria led Slovenia, Poland, Germany and Japan after the first round.
Poland moved into second and Norway moved into third in the second round as Slovenia slid into fifth place.
Poland's Kacper Tomasiak, a rookie in his first year on the World Cup circuit, has been the surprise of Olympic ski jumping, winning a silver on the normal hill and a bronze on the large hill. He was paired with Pawel Wasek, whose best Olympic finish was sixth in a team event in 2022.
The Norwegian team was made up of Johann André Forfang, who had won gold on the large hill and silver on the normal hill in Pyeongchang in 2018 but had not had a good Olympics before Monday, and Kristoffer Eriksen Sundal, who won silver in the mixed team event in these games.
Forfang was suspended last yea r in a jumpsuit-tampering scandal that brought shame to the country that invented the sport.
Forfang and teammate Marius Lindvik were suspended for three months last year after their coaches and a staff member were caught on camera tampering with their suits.
Stitching was added to the suits to stiffen the crotch area, allowing the athletes to fly farther.
Neither Lindvik nor Forfang was charged with knowing about the manipulation, but the international ski federation, FIS, the governing body for ski jumping, said the jumpers “should have checked and asked questions about the nighttime adjustments.”
The team leaders involved were recently banned from the sport for 18 months.
The U.S. team of Kevin Bickner and Tate Frantz made it to the final round but ended up in eighth place.

FIFA President Infantino celebrates in Beirut after receiving a Lebanese passport
FIFA President Gianni Infantino has received a Lebanese passport after Lebanon’s president granted him citizenship
- Bookmark
FIFA President Gianni Infantino received a Lebanese passport at the Interior Ministry in Beirut on Monday, months after he was granted citizenship by the country’s president.
Infantino, who is married to Lebanese citizen Lina al-Ashkar, thanked President Joseph Aoun at a meeting at the Interior Ministry where Infantino filed documents and had a photograph and fingerprints taken before being handed his new blue Lebanese passport.
Infantino also has citizenship in Italy and Switzerland.
“I’m very proud and very happy to be here in Beirut at the Ministry of Interior to finally get my Lebanese passport,” Infantino said in a video carried by local TV stations. “I love Lebanon."
Lebanese women normally cannot pass their citizenship to their foreign husbands and children under Lebanese law. But Aoun made and exception for Infantino and granted him and his family members citizenship.
Lebanese men married to foreign women automatically pass their nationality to their children, while their wives become eligible for citizenship after being married for a certain period of time.
FIFA is the international soccer governing body.

Former NRL star shot multiple times in Sydney drive-by shooting

Former NRL star shot in ‘brazen ambush’, police probe son’s gangland links
Updated ,first published
Police investigating the drive-by shooting of former NRL star Matt Utai outside his family home in Sydney are probing his son’s links to a notorious crime family, saying the former Bulldogs and West Tigers winger is an innocent casualty in an escalating gang war.
The 44-year-old was found severely wounded on the front lawn of his Greenacre property in the city’s south-west after being shot in the chest and leg on Tuesday morning.
Emergency services were called to Macquarie Street about 6am after reports of multiple gunshots being fired by occupants of an SUV.
Four ambulances were dispatched to Greenacre, where they discovered Utai conscious and in a “fair amount of pain”, according to Bankstown Police Area Command Superintendent Rodney Hart.
Utai was rushed to hospital in a serious condition, and was undergoing surgery hours after the attack.
Police say he was walking to his car outside the home he shares with his wife and children when the “brazen ambush” began.
“He was able to speak to police upon their arrival, before ambulance took over, did a fantastic job of stabilising him and getting him to the hospital where he’s undergoing the care that he needs,” Hart said.
Police were then called to nearby Samuel Street in Wiley Park, where they found a burnt-out SUV suspected to have been used in the shooting. The car was seized for forensic examination after the fire was extinguished by Fire and Rescue NSW.
Crime scenes have been established at both locations. Bankstown detectives are treating the incidents as linked.
Matt Utai has no criminal history and is not believed to be involved in criminal activity, according to Hart.
Police from the anti-gang squads believe the former NRL player was an unintended target of the shooting, and are investigating his son Iziah’s links to the Alameddine crime family and arson attacks on a barbershop under Iziah Utai’s name.
Iziah was described as an Alameddine associate after he was charged over gun and drug offences in 2023 by police investigating drug supply around Parramatta.
In June that year, he pleaded guilty and was sentenced to at least nine months in prison without parole for possessing guns and ammunition, including a shortened pump-action .22 rifle.
He had been arrested at his Toongabbie townhouse by the anti-bikie police squad Raptor, who are now investigating his father’s shooting.
In 2025, Iziah opened Merrylands Barbershop on Merrylands Road and posted on Google “new management, open 6 days a week” along with a five-star review of his new business.
Business records confirm Iziah registered the business in August 2024 under his own name.
In May last year the shop was torched twice in two nights. CCTV captured an unknown male setting himself on fire as he tried to light accelerant.
Police chased a car with cloned plates through the city’s west shortly after the second attack. Weeks later a 16-year-old boy was charged with allegedly lighting the fires.
The investigation into the barbershop arson attacks was taken up by the anti-gang squads who became Taskforce Falcon, tasked with stamping out warring gangs.
In December, several shots were also fired at a house in a Guildford West street linked to Iziah Utai. Two women and a child in the home were uninjured in the attack.
It’s unclear whether Iziah Utai was at his father’s home when Tuesday’s shooting took place. Nine News reported he is understood to be overseas.
Multiple bullets appeared to have struck the door of a work ute out the front of the Greenacre home. A nearby truck was covered in fingerprinting dust from forensic officers. Syringe and medical wrappers were scattered on the lawn where Utai was treated by paramedics.
Former teammate Brent Sherwin, the halfback during Canterbury’s 2004 grand final win against the Roosters, said he was devastated by the news.
“My heart goes out to his partner and kids. We’re praying he comes through. I wish him all the best and hope he is OK. We’re praying he’s all right,” Sherwin said.
Sherwin said the Bulldogs’ 2004 premiership wouldn’t have been possible if not for the two tries Utai scored in the decider.
“He was a massive part of our team, not just scoring tries, but taking the hard carries on our own line,” Sherwin said.
“He never shirked away from any of it, he put his hand up and took it all. He had a big heart. We’re praying he will be OK.”
Premiership-winning prop Mark O’Meley said that Utai was “breathing OK” as he continues to receive treatment.
“Everyone has been on the group chat all morning, we just hope he’s OK,” he said.
Another Bulldogs teammate, Reni Maitua, said he had spoken with one of Utai’s best friends, who had spent time at the family house early on Tuesday.
“He’s breathing on his own, and they’ve said he’s ‘critical but stable’,” Maitua said.
“I’m just really shocked and saddened by the news. I know it’s shaken up all the boys.”
The Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs said they were “deeply shocked and saddened” to learn of the incident.
“Matt is a beloved part of the Bulldogs family,” the club statement read. “Our thoughts are with Matt and his family during this extremely difficult time. We are hoping and praying for his full recovery.”
Utai, born in Auckland in 1981, burst onto the rugby league scene for the Bulldogs in 2002, earning the Dally M Rookie of the Year award after a first-season return that included 13 tries and 15 line-breaks.
Utai represented New Zealand on the international stage, earning a call-up following his debut first grade season. He played for the Kiwis on four occasions, before representing Samoa at the 2008 World Cup, at which he scored two tries in three matches.
He left the Bulldogs in 2009 after several years marred by injury. A move to Super League side Celtic Crusaders was aborted in 2010 amid concerns about an injury. He signed for the Wests Tigers in 2011, and stayed until the end of his playing career in 2013.
He scored 85 tries across 167 games for the Canterbury Bulldogs and Wests Tigers.

Eileen Gu wins silver in freestyle big air at Winter Olympics, Canada's Megan Oldham takes gold
Defending Olympic champion Eileen Gu took silver in freeski big air at the Milan Cortina Games as Canada's Megan Oldham won the gold medal on Monday night.
Oldham topped the 10-woman final with a combined score of 180.75 points from two jumps. Gu was next with 179. Italy's Flora Tabanelli took bronze, four months after she tore an ACL.
This is the second medal for the 24-year-old Oldham at these Winter Games. She won bronze in slopestyle last week.
In 2022, Gu became the first freestyle skier to win three medals in a single Games after taking gold in big air and halfpipe and silver in slopestyle at age 18.
Gu, who was born in the United States but competes for her mother's native China, has collected five medals in two Olympic appearances. She also won silver in slopestyle last week, and she has a chance at a sixth medal on Saturday, when she tries to defend her halfpipe gold.
Gu hadn't competed in a big air contest since triumphing at the Beijing Games, concentrating on her other events. But there are enough similarities between big air and slopestyle that she found her rhythm quickly.
Oldham locked up gold with her first two jumps. She had an inconsequential fall on her third jump, the last of the final, which became a victory lap.
Oldham and Gu embraced before they stepped onto the medal podium.
The initial final field of 12 was reduced by two after Mathilde Gremaud and Anouk Andraska, both of Switzerland, got hurt practicing jumps before the final. Gremaud, who defended her slopestyle gold last week, hurt her hip and needed to be stretchered off. Andraska hurt her wrist.
In big air, skiers get three jumps and must land two. Their scores include points for difficulty and execution.
Monday's final was delayed by more than an hour because of a snowstorm.

French President Macron arrives in India for bilateral talks, AI summit
Indian Prime Minister Modi to host Macron for talks in financial hub of Mumbai on Tuesday
NEW DELHI
French President Emmanuel Macron arrived in Mumbai, the financial hub of India, around midnight on Monday, beginning his three-day visit to the South Asian nation, according to an official statement.
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi will host Macron for talks on Tuesday as the two sides strengthen bilateral trade and defense ties, Modi's office said in a statement.
They “will focus on cementing India-France strategic partnership and further diversifying it into new and emerging areas,” it added.
Macron and Modi will also exchange views on issues of "regional and global importance,” the statement said, adding they will also inaugurate the "India-France Year of Innovation."
Marcon, who visited India last in 2024 as the chief guest for India's 75th Republic Day, will also visit New Delhi this week to participate in the AI Impact summit hosted by India.
India and France established diplomatic relations soon after India’s independence in 1947, and their bilateral trade volume reached $15 billion in 2024.
The two nations have strengthened their ties, particularly in defense, as the Indian Defense Ministry last week approved the fresh acquisition of Rafale jets from France.
India first inducted the French defense industry company Dassault's twin-engine, multirole fighter aircraft into its Air Force in 2020.
The defense chiefs of India and France will also hold their annual dialogue in the southern city of Bengaluru, where they are expected to renew a 10-year defense pact which includes joint manufacturing of Hammer missiles.

At least two killed and several others injured in mass shooting at Rhode Island ice rink
The suspected shooter also died during the incident at Dennis M Lynch Arena in Pawtucket, police say
- Bookmark
A mass shooting at an indoor ice rink in Rhode Island has left at least two dead and multiple others injured, according to authorities.
Chaos erupted at the Dennis M Lynch Arena in Pawtucket, near Providence, on Monday afternoon, as gunfire rang out during a high school hockey game.
Aside from the victims who had died, three more were injured, police said. The suspected shooter has also died, according to authorities. It wasn’t immediately clear what led to the shooting or the condition of those injured.
The Pawtucket mayor’s office said a young girl was killed in the shooting in a statement shared by local outlet WJAR. Local officials said authorities are not searching for any other suspects in the shooting.
“It seems that this is a targeted event and it may have been a family dispute,” Pawtucket Police Chief Tina Goncalves told reporters Monday.
The Providence Police Department announced on X that it was “monitoring the situation” and had officers at the rink “providing assistance.”
State police officers were seen outside the ice rink behind crime scene tape.
There were also FBI agents at the scene, according to the agency’s field office in Boston.
“At this time, there is no imminent threat to public safety and there has been no request for FBI assistance. However, the public should continue to avoid the area,” FBI Boston wrote on x.
The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives also responded to the shooting, according to its Boston Field Division.
The shooting happened during a hockey game between two local co-op teams: Coventry-Johnston and St. Raphael-Providence Country Day-North Providence-North Smithfield.
A Walgreens employee told WPRI that panicked patrons came into the nearby pharmacy saying there was a shooting. The police were called, according to the employee.
One hockey player from Coventry Public Schools told reporters that the shooting was “very scary.”
The student was on the ice when shots rang out. He then rushed into the locker room.
"We pressed against the door and just tried to stay safe down in there. It was very scary. We were very nervous," he said, per CBS Boston. "It was a lot of shots."
Goncalves asked for the public’s help in the investigation by giving information to the Pawtucket Police Department.
“Any recordings that they may have, because obviously people were recording, their kids were on the ice...provide those to the police department,” the chief said.
Coventry and Johnston school districts said that all of their students are believed to be safe.
"We have been informed that students are secured in multiple locations. At this time, we are still working to confirm the status and location of all individuals,” Coventry's superintendent, Don Cowart, said in a message shared by WJAR.
Johnston Public Schools said, per WJAR, “We have confirmed that our Johnston High School student-athlete who was participating in the game is safe. We are also aware of another Johnston student who was in attendance, and that student is safe as well.
“At this time, to the best of our knowledge, no Johnston High School students were harmed during this incident."
Providence Country Day School wrote on an Instagram story that it was “shocked and saddened” by the shooting, adding that all students, parents and staff who were at the game are safe.
Joseph Goho, the superintendent of North Providence Public Schools, said in a statement shared by NBC10 Boston, “All students involved in the game are safe.”
"Our thoughts and prayers go out to those involved in this tragic incident," Goho said.
Rhode Island Governor Dan McKee wrote on X that he was “actively monitoring the shooting,” adding, “I am praying for Pawtucket and everyone involved.”
The Providence Bruins, the American Hockey League affiliate of the National Hockey League’s Boston Bruins, said their “thoughts are with all those affected by the tragic events at the High School Hockey game at Dennis M Lynch Arena in Pawtucket today.”
The shooting comes two months after a mass shooting at Brown University in Providence that left two students dead and nine others injured.

Greece will seek to obtain Nazi execution photos offered for sale on eBay
The images that appeared over the weekend allegedly show 200 Greek men being led to their deaths on May 1, 1944, at an Athens shooting range
Greece said on Monday it will seek to obtain a series of photos that appear to show the final moments of 200 Greeks who were executed by a Nazi firing squad in Athens during World War II, after the previously unknown pictures appeared on an online sale site.
The images that appeared on eBay over the weekend allegedly show the men being led to their deaths on May 1, 1944, at a shooting range in the Kaisariani suburb of the Greek capital. Although the executions were well known, there were no known photos or film documentation of the event.
Greece’s Culture Ministry said on Monday that “it is very possible that these are authentic photographs”, adding that it will seek to obtain them as historical archives after they were put up for auction on eBay on Saturday by a collector in Belgium of German military memorabilia.
The series of pictures shows men being led through a gateway and down a path. They stand straight as they are lined up in front of a wall.
The Kaisariani executions of 200 communist political prisoners were one of the worst atrocities during the Third Reich’s occupation of Greece and remain a seminal moment for the country.
As World War II ended, a vicious civil war between Western-backed government forces and communist fighters broke out and lasted until 1949. Its wounds have still not entirely healed.

UN experts urge probe into Epstein files, warn crimes against humanity possible

UN human rights experts have called for independent and impartial investigations into the Epstein files, warning that the alleged abuses documented in the disclosures could amount to crimes against humanity.
In a statement on Monday, the experts said the files contain "disturbing and credible evidence of systematic and large-scale sexual abuse, trafficking and exploitation of women and girls."
They said the acts described could constitute sexual slavery, reproductive violence, torture, and other grave violations under international law.
"So grave is the scale, nature, systematic character, and transnational reach of these atrocities against women and girls, that a number of them may reasonably meet the legal threshold of crimes against humanity," they said.
Under international criminal law, crimes against humanity involve widespread or systematic attacks against civilians, including sexual slavery, rape, enforced prostitution, trafficking, and murder.
The disclosure process follows the Epstein Files Transparency Act signed in November 2025. On Jan. 30, the US Department of Justice released more than 3 million pages of material, along with thousands of videos and images.
The experts also raised concerns over what they described as serious redaction failures that exposed sensitive victim information, in some cases before records were withdrawn.
“Not above the law"
They stressed that states are obligated under international human rights law to prevent, investigate, and punish violence against women and girls.
"Any suggestion that it is time to move on from the ‘Epstein files’ is unacceptable," they said, adding: "No one is too wealthy or too powerful to be above the law."
The experts urged US authorities and other governments to ensure full accountability and reparations for victims.
"Failure by governments to effectively investigate, and prosecute those responsible for these crimes, including by complicity or acquiescence, where jurisdiction exists, risks undermining legal frameworks aimed at preventing and responding to violence against women and girls," they warned.
Convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein was found dead by suicide in a New York City jail in 2019 while awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges involving underage girls.

More third-country nationals have been deported by the US to Cameroon, lawyers tell AP
Lawyers say a new group of third-country nationals has been deported by the United States to Cameroon
- Bookmark
A new group of third-country nationals was deported by the United States to Cameroon on Monday, lawyers told The Associated Press, days after it came to light that the Trump administration sent nine people to the Central African nation last month as part of its secretive program to remove immigrants to countries they have no ties with.
Lawyer Alma David of the U.S.-based Novo Legal Group said that a group of migrants who were not Cameroonian citizens arrived on a deportation flight that landed in the capital, Yaounde, on Monday.
David and Cameroon-based lawyer Joseph Awah Fru said they believed there were eight third-country nationals on the plane but had not spoken to them yet. The two lawyers said they are giving legal advice to some of the nine migrants — five women and four men — from other African countries who were deported from the U.S. to Cameroon last month.
The lawyers also expected to offer counsel to the new group of deportees, they said.
“For now, my focus is handling their shock,” Fru said.
A White House official, who was not authorized to comment publicly about the matter and spoke on condition of anonymity, acknowledged the second deportation flight to Cameroon but gave no details.
The New York Times first reported Saturday on the group of nine sent secretly to Cameroon last month. Two of them have since been repatriated to their home countries, David said.
Most of the deportees had protection orders
Eight of those nine previously deported migrants had protection orders granted by a U.S. immigration judge that prevented them from being deported to their home countries for fear of persecution or torture, David said, some of them because of their sexual orientation and others because of political activity.
Deporting them to a third country like Cameroon, from where they could ultimately be sent home, was effectively a legal “loophole,” David said.
“That is why the United States did not send them directly to their countries,” Fru said. “Because there is cause for concern that they might be harmed, that their lives are threatened.”
David said none of the nine sent to Cameroon last month, which included migrants from Zimbabwe, Morocco and Ghana, had criminal records apart from driving-related offenses. She had no details yet on the eight who arrived on Monday.
African nations are being paid millions
Cameroon, where 93-year-old President Paul Biya has ruled since 1982, is the latest of at least seven African nations to receive deported third-country nationals in a deal with the U.S. Others that have struck deals with the Trump administration include South Sudan, Rwanda, Uganda, Eswatini, Ghana and Equatorial Guinea.
Some of them have received millions of dollars in payments to take deported migrants, according to documents released by the U.S. State Department. Details of some of the other agreements, including the one with Cameroon, have not been released by the Trump administration.
The Trump administration has spent at least $40 million to deport roughly 300 migrants to countries other than their own in Africa, Central America and elsewhere, according to a report compiled by the Democratic staff of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and released last week.
According to internal administration documents reviewed by the AP, there are 47 third-country agreements at various stages of negotiation. Of those, 15 have been concluded and 10 are at or near conclusion.
Immigration policies are a ‘top priority’
The U.S. State Department said Monday in a statement to the AP on the Cameroon deportations that it had “no comment on the details of our diplomatic communications with other governments.”
“Implementing the Trump Administration’s immigration policies is a top priority for the Department of State,” it said, adding “we remain unwavering in our commitment to end illegal and mass immigration and bolster America’s border security.”
Cameroon's Foreign Ministry didn't respond to a request for comment.
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security confirmed there had been deportations to Cameroon in January but didn't give specific information on third-country migrants. It did not comment on the second plane.
“We are applying the law as written. If a judge finds an illegal alien has no right to be in this country, we are going to remove them. Period," the department said. “These third-country agreements, which ensure due process under the U.S. Constitution, are essential to the safety of our homeland and the American people."
The Trump administration has used third-country deportation deals as a deterrent to force migrants who are in the U.S. illegally to leave on their own, saying they could end up “in any number of third countries" if deported.
It has also defended the practice as part of a crackdown to remove what it refers to as dangerous criminals and gang members.
Activists and lawyers say the U.S. should know that sending migrants to third countries with poor human rights records risks them being denied due process and exposed to abuse.
Last year, the U.S. deported five nationals from Vietnam, Jamaica, Cuba, Yemen and Laos to the southern African nation of Eswatini. The deportees had all been convicted of serious criminal offenses, including murder, attempted murder and rape. They had all served their criminal sentences in the U.S.
Four of them have been held at a maximum-security prison in Eswatini for more than six months without charges and have not been allowed to meet in person with a lawyer. Their detentions are the subject of two legal challenges in Eswatini.
Eswatini, which is ruled by a king as Africa's last absolute monarchy, will be paid $5.1 million to take up to 160 third-country deportees, according to details of the deal released by the State Department. The Eswatini king, Mswati III, has long been accused of clamping down on pro-democracy protests in a country where political parties are banned while using public money to fund his lavish lifestyle.

BUDAPEST, February 16. /TASS/. Western European leaders continue to live in a world of illusions, believing that Ukraine will emerge victorious from the conflict with Russia, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said.
He noted that Western European politicians are set to continue providing Ukraine with military support "until Russia is exhausted." "But who can believe that the Russians will run out of steam before Ukraine? That's something from the world of illusions," the M1 television channel quoted him as saying at a meeting with the parliamentary faction of the ruling Fidesz - Hungarian Civic Alliance party.
"Russia's reserves significantly exceed Ukraine's, even taking into account the support it receives from Europe," he stated. According to Orban, in 1944-1945, people also said that Russia would soon be destroyed, but since then Russia has become a nuclear power, while the Germans are only now beginning to arm themselves."
He slammed Western European politicians’ actions as irresponsible because they are seeking to protract the conflict in Ukraine and are hampering its peaceful settlement.

Russian Poisonings Aim to Kill – and Send a Message

Polonium, Novichok and now dart frog poison: the finding that Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny was killed with a rare toxin has revived the specter of Moscow’s use of poisons against opponents – a hallmark of its secret services, according to experts.
The neurotoxin epibatidine, found in Ecuadoran frogs, was identified in laboratory analyses of samples from Navalny’s body, the British, Swedish, French, German and Dutch governments said in a joint statement released on Saturday at the Munich Security Conference.

“Only the Russian state had the means, motive and opportunity to deploy this lethal toxin,” said Britain’s Foreign Office, with the joint statement pointing to Russia as the prime suspect.
The Kremlin on Monday rejected what it called the “biased and baseless” accusation it assassinated Navalny, a relentless critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin, who died on Feb. 16, 2024, while serving a 19-year sentence in a Russian Arctic prison colony.
But the allegations echo other cases of opponents being poisoned in connection – proven or suspected – with Russian agents.
In 2006, Russian defector Alexander Litvinenko was killed by polonium poison in London. Ukrainian politician Viktor Yushchenko, campaigning against a Russian-backed candidate for the presidency, was disfigured by dioxin in 2004. And the nerve agent Novichok was used in the attempted poisoning of former double agent Sergei Skripal in the UK in 2018.

“We should remain cautious, but this hypothesis is all the more plausible given that Navalny had already been the target of an assassination attempt (in 2020) on a plane involving underwear soaked with an organophosphate nerve agent, Novichok, which is manufactured only in Russia,” said Olivier Lepick, a fellow at the Foundation for Strategic Research specializing in chemical weapons.
Toxin ‘never been used’
“To my knowledge, epibatidine has never been used for assassinations,” Lepick added.
Until now, the substance was mainly known for its effect on animals that try to attack Ecuadoran poison dart frogs.
“It’s a powerful neurotoxin that first hyperstimulates the nervous system in an extremely violent way and then shuts it down. So you’ll convulse and then become paralyzed, especially in terms of breathing,” said Jerome Langrand, director of the Paris poison control center.
But to the scientist, using this substance to poison Navalny is “quite unsettling.”
“One wonders, why choose this particular poison? If it was to conceal a poisoning, it’s not the best substance. Or is it meant to spread an atmosphere of fear, to reinforce an image of power and danger with the message: ‘We can poison anywhere and with anything’?” he said.
Russian “calling card”
For many experts, the use of poison bears a Russian signature.
“It’s something specific to the Soviet services. In the 1920s, Lenin created a poison laboratory called ‘Kamera’ [‘chamber’ in Russian], Lab X. This laboratory grew significantly under Stalin, and then under his successors Khrushchev and Brezhnev... It was this laboratory that produced Novichok,” said Andrei Kozovoi, professor of Russian history at the University of Lille.
“The Russians don’t have a monopoly on it, but there is a dimension of systematization, with considerable resources put in place a very long time ago – the creation of the poison laboratory, which developed without any restrictions,” he added.
Even if a poisoning can fail – some targets survived, such as Yushchenko and Skripal – it also serves to send a message, and acted as “a calling card” left by the Russian services, according to Kozovoi.
“Poison is associated in the collective imagination and in psychology with a terrible, agonizing death. The use of chemical substances or poisons carries an explicit intention to terrorize the target and, in cases such as Litvinenko, Skripal or Navalny, to warn anyone who might be tempted to betray Mother Russia or become an opponent,” said Lepick.
“A neurotoxin, a radioactive substance, or a toxic substance is much more frightening than an explosive or being shot to death.”

The Ethiopian National Defense Forces have likely received Russian KamAZ-53949 Typhoon-K armored vehicles.
This was reported by OSINT analyst Rich Tedd, who posted a video on social network X.
The footage, shot in Ethiopia, shows two trucks carrying two olive-colored Typhoon-K armored vehicles on trailers.
The history of the Typhoon line began in 2010 as part of a program to develop a new generation of armored vehicles for the Russian army.
The 53949 model was designed as a more compact and maneuverable version of the heavy three-axle vehicles in this series.
The vehicle has a V-shaped bottom that effectively dissipates the energy of an explosion, and special energy-absorbing seats. The vehicle’s armor consists of steel plates and ceramic inserts, providing protection against armor-piercing bullets and artillery shell fragments.
The armored vehicle can carry up to 10 people, including two crew members and eight paratroopers. The total weight of the vehicle is about 15 tons, and the 350 horsepower engine allows it to reach speeds of up to 105 km/h on the highway.

Greece moves to obtain newly discovered photos of Nazi executions

05:49:00 KST

Greece announced Monday it will attempt to acquire photographs believed to capture the final moments of 200 Greeks executed by Nazi forces in Athens during World War II, after the previously unseen images were listed for sale online.
The images that appeared on eBay over the weekend allegedly show the men being led to their deaths on May 1, 1944, at a shooting range in the Kaisariani suburb of the Greek capital. Although the executions were well known, there were no known photos or film documentation of the event.
Greece's Culture Ministry said Monday that "it is very possible that these are authentic photographs," adding that it will seek to obtain them as historical archives after they were put up for sale on Saturday by a collector in Belgium of German military memorabilia.
The series of pictures show men being led through a gateway and down a path. They stand straight as they are lined up in front of a wall.
The Kaisariani executions of 200 communist political prisoners were one of the worst atrocities during the Third Reich's occupation of Greece and remain a seminal moment for the country.
As World War II ended, a vicious civil war between Western-backed government forces and communist fighters broke out and lasted until 1949. Its wounds have still not entirely healed.
Shortly after the photos were posted for sale, a memorial at the site to those killed was vandalized, with plaques listing their names smashed.
"Historical memory will not be erased, no matter how much it bothers some people," Kaisariani municipality said in a statement posted on its Facebook page, adding that it would repair the monument. The photos, it said, had caused "a chill of emotion for the heroic, valiant stance of the 200 communist heroes who stood up against the firing squad."
The Culture Ministry said there were "quite a few legal complications" to lay claim to the pictures. It said experts from the ministry were already in touch with the collector who put them up for auction and would be visiting him in Ghent, Belgium, to examine "the authenticity and legality of origin."
A ministry committee also was to convene Wednesday to determine whether to classify the photographs as being part of Greek heritage.
If the images are determined to be both authentic and legally obtained, "the Culture Ministry will immediately finalize the measures for their acquisition through the appropriate legal means," it said.

Pentagon ‘close to cutting ties’ with AI firm Anthropic amid frustration over restrictions
Anthropic wants to safeguard its Claude AI tool from being used for mass surveillance or advanced weapons development, Axios news reported
The Pentagon is close to cutting ties with Anthropic and may label the artificial intelligence company a supply chain risk after becoming frustrated with restrictions on how it can use the technology, Axios news website reported.
Anthropic’s talks about extending a contract with the Pentagon are being held up over additional protections the artificial intelligence company wants to put on its Claude tool, a person familiar with the matter said.
Anthropic wants to put safeguards in place to stop Claude from being used for mass surveillance of Americans or to develop weapons that can be deployed without a human involved, the person said, asking not to be identified because the negotiations are private.
The Pentagon wants to be able to use Claude as long as its deployment does not break the law. Axios reported on the disagreement earlier.
AI’s use cases for developing weapons and gathering personal data are a burgeoning risk for powerful models. Anthropic, which positions itself as a more responsible AI company that aims to avoid catastrophic harms from the technology, built Claude Gov specifically for the US national security apparatus and aims to serve government customers within its own ethical bounds.
Claude Gov has enhanced capabilities for handling and interpreting classified materials and intelligence and for understanding cybersecurity data.

At least three people are dead and three more hospitalized in critical condition in a mass shooting at an indoor ice rink in Pawtucket, Rhode Island, during a high school hockey match on Monday afternoon, the police said.
The Pawtucket police chief, Tina Goncalves, told reporters at a news conference that the suspect is one of the dead.
“We’re putting all the pieces together,” Goncalves said, adding that one of the shooting victims died at the Dennis M Lynch arena and a second succumbed to their wounds later at a hospital.
The attacker appears to have died from a self-inflicted gun wound,” Goncalves said.
Goncalves also said that the shooting appeared to have been a targeted event, possibly connected to a “family dispute”, but did not provide further details. Officials are not releasing names of any of the victims yet.
The Providence Journal reported that video acquired from a service that livestreams sports events captured audio of a burst of roughly 13 shots, fired in rapid succession, and showed panicked players and spectators rushing away.
A Rhode Island high school sportswriter, Eric Rueb, shared a video clip on social media with the caption: “You cannot see anything – the noise is unmistakeable – but the reaction and chaos that follows the follows tells the story.”
The shooting took place during a boys’ hockey game with students from multiple local schools, Pawtucket’s mayor, Don Grebien, said.

Epstein files: Inside a depraved transatlantic elite and the institutions that protected it
Finland

The release of millions of pages linked to Jeffrey Epstein has expanded scrutiny of political, financial and cultural elites in the United States and Europe. Congress ordered the disclosures under the Epstein Files Transparency Act.
After months of pressure from the media and some lawmakers, finally the Department of Justice and the FBI published millions of highly redacted emails, investigative files, financial records, flight manifests, photographs and videos tied to Epstein and his network.
The material spans decades and includes records from before and after his 2008 conviction in Florida for soliciting prostitution from a minor. The files present a record that extends beyond Epstein himself.
They contain documents, testimonies, logs and emails that chart his contact with presidents, prime ministers, billionaires, senior bankers, media executives, academics, intelligence-linked figures and members of royal families. The records show that after his 2008 plea agreement, and after he became a registered sex offender, he maintained contact with prominent figures across sectors.
PBS NewsHour reported on 14 November 2025 that newly released emails revealed how Epstein continued to communicate with political, business and academic figures after his conviction. The broadcaster said many correspondents were aware of his status.
Emails cited by PBS show invitations to meetings, requests for introductions, discussions of donations and exchanges about conferences and travel. Large sections remain redacted or withheld, including grand jury transcripts and certain surveillance materials. There is still millions of unreleased files which analysts beleive incriminate more political figures and elite including and espcially Donald Trump who is one of the most mentioned political figures in the files.
Even in redacted form, the files identify recurring names. Political figures cited across analyses include Donald Trump, Bill Clinton, Prince Andrew, Ehud Barak, Peter Mandelson, Bill Richardson and George Mitchell.
Business and technology leaders listed include Bill Gates, Elon Musk, Reid Hoffman, Peter Thiel, Les Wexner, Glenn Dubin and Jes Staley.
Lawyers and figures from media and entertainment also appear, including Alan Dershowitz, Steven Tisch, Casey Wasserman, Woody Allen, Naomi Campbell, Courtney Love and Noam Chomsky. The files also reference employees and intermediaries within Epstein’s circle.
Appearance in the documents does not in itself establish criminal conduct.
A New York Times analysis reported Trump is mentioned more than 38,000 times across over 5,300 individual files in the DOJ’s Epstein database. Other reporting has cited “over 1,000” or “around 1,800” hits when searching just the most recently released 3 million‑page tranche. The records range from contact books and flight logs to internal notes gathered by investigators.
”Trump's name appears more times in the Epstein files than God's name appears in the book about God. Trump's name also appears more times in the Epstein file than Harry Potter's name appears in the seven books about Harry Potter,” said Representative Jared Moskowitz of Florida, during a House hearing where he was grilling former Attorney General Pam Bondi about the Epstein files and the Trump administration’s handling of their release.
Bondi, who was defending her office’s lack of action against alleged offenders, refused to turn and face the victims of Epstein’s trafficking of minors seated in the hearing room. A photograph of the dossier in front of her during testimony later revealed that her department, working with the FBI, had monitored members of Congress who accessed the unredacted files and had secretly logged their search terms.
Trump has denied wrongdoing and has said he cut ties with Epstein years before his 2019 arrest.
NPR reported on 12 November 2025 that political factions in Washington sought to emphasise or downplay references to Trump and other public figures as batches of documents emerged.
The scale of the release has also renewed attention to the 2008 plea agreement in Florida, which allowed Epstein to avoid federal prosecution at the time. The deal was highly unusual, granting Epstein and both named and unnamed associates sweeping immunity for a wide range of known and potential future charges arising from the investigation.
CBS News reported that law enforcement agencies had received warnings from victims years before his arrest in 2019. Internal correspondence in the newly released files includes discussions among prosecutors about strategy and exposure.
In the United Kingdom, newly released DOJ documents and bank records prompted a criminal inquiry involving Peter Mandelson.
Al Jazeera reported on 14 February 2026 that records suggest Epstein sent about 75,000 dollars in three payments in 2003 and 2004 to accounts linked to Mandelson or his partner. Mandelson said he does not recall the payments and is seeking to verify the transactions.
Emails cited in the reporting show Mandelson passing what he described as “political insights”. One 2010 message referred to a 500-billion-euro bailout as “nearly finalized” shortly before European governments announced such a package. Another note referred to the expected resignation of then prime minister Gordon Brown in terms of the effect on the value of Epstein’s “chapters” in a book project.
UK officials allege Mandelson may have misled vetting authorities about post-2008 contact, gifts and hospitality linked to Epstein. British authorities referred him for possible misconduct in public office charges. He was dismissed as ambassador to Washington. He resigned from the House of Lords and from the Labour Party.
Members of the United States Congress have asked him to cooperate with their investigation. Mandelson has denied wrongdoing.
PBS reported in February 2026 that related disclosures in Europe contributed to political fallout in several countries, including scrutiny of former leaders and senior officials over travel, gifts and financial arrangements connected to Epstein.
The files show that Epstein continued to host meetings at his properties in New York, Florida and on his private island. Flight manifests list politicians, executives and public figures travelling on his aircraft. Banks maintained accounts connected to him for years after his conviction. Universities accepted donations. Regulators and public institutions engaged with him in professional contexts.
Victims’ representatives have called for full disclosure of the remaining sealed material. An attorney for several accusers said, “The public deserves to know who enabled Jeffrey Epstein and who looked the other way.” Federal prosecutors have not announced new charges directly tied to the 2025 and 2026 releases.
The Justice Department has stated that it continues to review evidence. As further tranches appear, congressional committees have scheduled additional hearings. Investigators and journalists continue to review the material as disclosures proceed whle lawmakers from both parties have demanded more unsealing of court records. The publication of the archive has broadened the public record. Beyond the individual names, the files outline a deeper pattern in which Epstein functioned as a broker within a transnational network of political and financial power, rather than as an isolated offender.
The correspondence and travel records suggest that his homes, jets and island operated as informal meeting points where business, politics, philanthropy and intelligence interests intersected, with social events and alleged exploitation occurring in the same spaces.
The archive shows how institutions often treated the scandal as a reputational management problem instead of a structural failure: prosecutors negotiated limited deals, universities and cultural bodies weighed reputational risk against donations, and banks balanced compliance concerns against lucrative relationships. The documents also illuminate long-standing questions about oversight and capture, as regulators, law enforcement and security services repeatedly encountered warning signs yet failed to intervene decisively while Epstein remained useful to well-connected clients and interlocutors.
The reactions to the releases in the United States and Europe highlight contrasting capacities to hold elites accountable. In several European states, the new material contributed to resignations, formal inquiries and, in some cases, criminal charges against former senior officials, whereas in the United States the fallout has so far focused on political argument over transparency, redactions and the treatment of a small number of public figures.
The disclosures prompted renewed debate over whether existing legal frameworks are adequate to address cross-border exploitation networks that rely on secrecy jurisdictions, complex financial structures and social venues designed to blur lines between private indulgence and public responsibility. They also intensified discussion of how concentrated wealth and influence can shape prosecutorial discretion, media coverage and legislative priorities, especially when those same elites are the subjects of potential investigation.
Taken together, the files underscore that the Epstein case is not only a record of individual crimes but also a lens on how a narrow, interlocking elite across the United States and Europe has been able to operate with a high degree of impunity. The term ”Epstein Class” has been used to describe the corrupt elite rulling with impunity.
The documents show that reputational risk, rather than ethical red lines, often determined when institutions chose to distance themselves, and that serious allegations could coexist for years with invitations, board seats and philanthropic partnerships.
As the remaining sealed materials come under pressure and more connections are mapped, the disclosures continue to raise questions about where responsibility lies—not only with Epstein and his immediate accomplices, but with the wider systems that enabled, protected and then only partially exposed them.

Police identify suspected gunman who targeted family members in Rhode Island hockey rink shooting which killed two
The suspected shooter also died during the incident at Dennis M. Lynch Arena in Pawtucket, police say
- Bookmark
Local police have identified a gunman suspected of targeting family members in a mass shooting at an indoor ice rink in Rhode Island that has left at least two dead and multiple others injured.
Chaos erupted at the Dennis M. Lynch Arena in Pawtucket, near Providence, on Monday at around 2:30 p.m. local time, as gunfire rang out during a high school hockey game.
“It appears that a lone individual, the suspect, entered the arena to watch the hockey game of a family member, and unfortunately during that time, a shooting occurred,” Pawtucket Police Chief Tina Goncalves told reporters Monday evening.
Goncalves identified the suspected shooter’s birth name as Robert Dorgan. The suspect goes “by the name of Roberta, also uses a last of Esposito,” and was born in 1969, Goncalves added.
Goncalves said a “good samaritan stepped in and interjected in this scene and that’s probably what led to a swift end of this tragic event.”
Aside from the victims who died, three more were injured and are currently in critical condition, police said.
“An act of senseless violence has taken the lives of two innocent victims with the suspect taking his own life,” Pawtucket Mayor Don Grebien told reporters Monday night.
The suspected shooter died of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound, according to authorities. It wasn’t immediately clear what led to the shooting.
“It seems that this is a targeted event and it may have been a family dispute,” Pawtucket Police Chief Tina Goncalves told reporters earlier Monday. She later added that a family friend was also involved in the incident.
Local outlet WPRI reported that the father of a North Providence High School senior shot five family members. A woman told WCVB-TV that the suspected shooter was her father.
Authorities said firearms were recovered at the arena but wouldn’t confirm how many firearms the suspect had.
State police officers were seen outside the ice rink behind crime scene tape earlier Monday.
There were also FBI agents at the scene, according to the agency’s field office in Boston.
FBI Director Kash Patel wrote on X that FBI Boston was responding to the shooting, adding, “We will provide state and local law enforcement any and all resources necessary and keep the public updated as we are able.
“In the meantime please pray for the victims and their families.”
The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives also responded to the shooting, according to its Boston Field Division.
The shooting happened during a hockey game between two local co-op teams: Coventry-Johnston and St. Raphael-Providence Country Day-North Providence-North Smithfield.
A Walgreens employee told WPRI that panicked patrons came into the nearby pharmacy saying there was a shooting. The police were called, according to the employee.
One hockey player from Coventry Public Schools told reporters that the shooting was “very scary.”
The student was on the ice when shots rang out. He then rushed into the locker room.
"We pressed against the door and just tried to stay safe down in there. It was very scary. We were very nervous," he said, per CBS Boston. "It was a lot of shots."
WJAR shared a clip from a livestream that it says was taken during the hockey game at the Dennis M. Lynch Arena. In the video, gunshots were fired, prompting players to quickly skate off the ice to safety.
The Independent has reached out to authorities to verify the video. A representative for the City of Providence confirmed to The Independent that the video was taken from the arena.
Goncalves asked for the public’s help in the investigation by giving information to the Pawtucket Police Department.
“Any recordings that they may have, because obviously people were recording, their kids were on the ice...provide those to the police department,” the chief said.
Coventry and Johnston school districts said that all of their students are believed to be safe.
"All students from the Coventry Boys Hockey team who were present at an incident at Lynch Arena in Pawtucket have been accounted for and are safe,” Coventry's superintendent, Don Cowart, said in a message shared by WJAR.
Johnston Public Schools said, per WJAR, “We have confirmed that our Johnston High School student-athlete who was participating in the game is safe. We are also aware of another Johnston student who was in attendance, and that student is safe as well.
“At this time, to the best of our knowledge, no Johnston High School students were harmed during this incident."
Providence Country Day School wrote on an Instagram story that it was “shocked and saddened” by the shooting, adding that all students, parents and staff who were at the game are safe.
Joseph Goho, the superintendent of North Providence Public Schools, said in a statement shared by NBC10 Boston, “All students involved in the game are safe.”
"Our thoughts and prayers go out to those involved in this tragic incident," Goho said.
St. Raphael Academy, North Smithfield and North Providence officials also said their students were safe, per WJAR.
The Providence Bruins, the American Hockey League affiliate of the National Hockey League’s Boston Bruins, saidtin an online statement their “thoughts are with all those affected by the tragic events at the High School Hockey game at Dennis M. Lynch Arena in Pawtucket today.”
Rhode Island Governor Dan McKee said in a video message posted to X, “Our state is grieving again. As governor, a parent and a former coach my heart breaks for the victims, families, and everyone impacted by the devastating shooting at Lynch Arena in Pawtucket.”
The shooting comes two months after a mass shooting at Brown University in Providence that left two students dead and nine others injured.

'If this isn’t a massacre, what is?': Ex-hostage decries removal of 'massacre' from Oct. 7 bill

Former Gaza hostage Or Levy spoke out against an Israeli government decision to remove the term “massacre” from official legislation regarding Hamas’s October 7 terror acts during an interview with KAN Reshet Bet on Monday.
Levy was held in captivity by terrorists in Gaza for nearly 500 days before his release in February 2025, and his wife, Einav, was murdered by Hamas during the massacre.
He stated that when he saw headlines about the government's push to remove the word from a bill establishing a national day of commemoration for the attack, he thought it was a mistake.
“I heard ministers talking about how we shouldn’t portray ourselves as victims and that we weren’t massacred, so it’s important for me to say, I was there. They massacred me and my wife,” Levy stated.
“There is no other way to describe it. If this isn’t called a massacre, then what is? Soon they’ll say the Holocaust didn’t happen.”
Levy 'enraged' at government 'trying to change history'
Levy additionally commented on government attempts to block the establishment of a state commission of inquiry into the October 7 massacre and related national security failures.
He recounted visiting the bomb shelter from which he was kidnapped on October 7 with IDF investigators. “I sat with two incredible investigators, but they told me, ‘We don’t know,’ ‘There’s no information,’ ‘We assume.’ It’s the year 2026. We’re supposed to know everything, apparently, they don’t want to.”
The words of the investigators and the government's reluctance to greenlight a probe did not make Levy feel reassured that such an attack wouldn’t happen again, he said, adding, “feeling that they are disgracing my wife’s memory enrages me. Feeling that they are trying to change history enrages me.”

The IDF thwarted an attempt to smuggle hundreds of kilograms of tobacco disguised as canned food products into the Gaza Strip, the military confirmed on Monday.
The tobacco was concealed inside dozens of cans labelled as containing grape leaves, which smugglers attempted to transfer via the Kerem Shalom Border Crossing.
All of the truck's contents were seized and transferred for further handling by customs and other authorities.
In response to the incident, the newly promoted Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT), Chief Maj.-Gen. Yoram Halevi ordered the immediate suspension of the company's permit to bring aid into the Gaza Strip until further notice, the IDF confirmed.
Halevi's decision was made in light of "the severity of the case and in order to preserve the integrity of the aid entry mechanism, while preventing its exploitation for prohibited purposes," the military stated.
Shin Bet chief's brother indicted for aiding Hamas during wartime in Gaza smuggling case
Bezalel Zini, the brother of Shin Bet (Israel Security Agency) David Zini, was indicted on February 5 along with two other men in a wide-ranging wartime security case in which prosecutors allege that a network of Israeli reservists and civilians smuggled prohibited goods - primarily cigarettes and tobacco - into the Gaza Strip during Israel’s war with Hamas.
According to an indictment filed at the Beersheba District Court, Zini was charged with aiding the enemy during wartime, prohibited dealings in property for terror purposes under the Counter-Terrorism Law, aggravated fraud, and accepting bribes while serving as a public official.
Prosecutors allege that the operation generated millions of shekels in revenue and materially benefited Hamas by strengthening its economic control inside the enclave.

‘We Will Restore Justice’: Zelensky Sanctions 10 Russian Athletes

President Volodymyr Zelensky has announced sanctions on 10 Russian athletes whom Kyiv says have actively supported Russia’s aggression in Ukraine.
According to the President’s Office, the measures will apply to sports figures who visited occupied Ukrainian territories, publicly defended Russia’s invasion and occupation, raised funds for Russian forces, or organized events for Ukrainian children forcibly abducted by Russia.

“This Ukrainian sanctions package should be a signal to others around the world – a signal that one cannot simply turn a blind eye to support for aggression,” Zelensky said.
“When Ukrainians at the Olympics are forbidden to even mention the victims of Russian aggression, that is clearly a global rollback of justice. We will restore justice,” he added.
The sanctions list was created following a petition from Ukrainian skeleton racer and National Olympic Team member Vladyslav Heraskevych.
Ukrainian media reports identified the 10 figures as: Arkady Dvorkovich, president of the International Chess Federation (FIDE); wrestler Yevgeny Baydusov; wrestler Imam Ganishov; taekwondo athlete Vladislav Larin; taekwondo athlete Maksim Khramtsov; archer Svetlana Dashanimaeva; sabre fencer Yana Egoryan; Gymnast Angelina Melnikova; judoka Madina Taymazova; and boxer Fedor Chudinov.
The President’s Office did not detail the exact sanctions, though Ukrainian outlets suggest they may include asset freezes.
Russian Poisonings Aim to Kill – and Send a Message
Praising the sanctions on X, Heraskevych said: “A very important step to significantly reduce the spread of Russian propaganda in international sports. Reducing the spread of Russian narratives = saving lives.”
Last week, Heraskevych was barred from competing in the Winter Olympics after refusing to remove a helmet honoring 24 Ukrainian athletes and children killed by Russia. He called the IOC ruling “purely discriminatory.”
Zelensky at the time also condemned the decision, saying: “Sport shouldn’t mean amnesia, and the Olympic movement should help stop wars, not play into the hands of aggressors.”
He also hit out at the inclusion of 19 Russian athletes in the games under a “neutral” banner.
“They compete under ‘neutral’ flags at the Games, while in real life publicly supporting Russian aggression against Ukraine and the occupation of our territories. And they are the ones who deserve disqualification,” he said.
Following the Olympic controversy, Heraskevych launched a fundraising initiative for families of Ukrainian athletes killed by Russia and submitted a petition urging the government to sanction Russian sports figures who support the invasion.
“The introduction of sanctions by Ukraine against Russian athletes will be the first step toward the introduction of sanctions against them by Ukraine’s partner countries,” he said at the time.
“This will make their performances on the international stage impossible, which they use to support the war against Ukraine.”
According to Andriy Sybiha, the foreign minister, over 650 Ukrainian athletes and coaches have been killed and more than 800 sports facilities have been destroyed over the course of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

NEW YORK, February 16. /TASS/. Elon Musk’s companies, SpaceX and xAI, have entered a closed Pentagon technology competition to develop a technology for controlling drone swarms using voice commands, Bloomberg reported citing sources.
The participation of two of Musk's companies in the development of AI-supported weapons marks a new and potentially controversial stage for the businessman, the agency writes. Musk’s companies are among a select few participants in the competition launched in January with a $100 million fund. The initiative aims to create a technology capable of translating voice commands into digital instructions for simultaneously controlling multiple drones in the air and at sea.
The development under this defense initiative will proceed in five phases ranging from software creation to field testing. The organizers are the Defense Innovation Unit and the Autonomous Battle Group, established under the second administration of Donald Trump.
Musk has previously advocated for a ban on the use of offensive autonomous weapons capable of independently selecting and engaging targets.

Cuba’s Havana piles with rubbish as US chokehold halts garbage trucks
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
HAVANA - Garbage has begun to pile up on street corners in the Cuban capital of Havana, attracting hordes of flies and reeking of rotten food, in one of the most visible impacts of the US bid to prevent oil from reaching the Caribbean’s largest island
State-run news outlet Cubadebate reported in February that only 44 of 106 rubbish trucks in Havana were able to keep operating due to fuel shortages, slowing garbage collection.
Cardboard boxes, used bags, plastic bottles and rags piled up on street corners across the seafront capital, as some residents sorted through the waste looking for scraps they could reuse, while motorists, pedestrians and bikers are forced to circumvent the imposing heaps.
“It’s all over the city,” said local resident Jose Ramon Cruz. “It’s been more than 10 days since a garbage truck came.”
In other towns on the island – home to around 11 million people – residents took to social media to warn of the risks to public health.
Cuba’s government has implemented rationing measures to protect essential services in a country that was already suffering from severe shortages of food, fuel and medicine.
The country’s oil supply has fallen off dramatically in two months.
Venezuela – once Cuba’s top supplier – effectively stopped sending shipments in mid-December. Mexico’s government also said it was halting shipments after Washington threatened tariffs against countries that send supplies to Cuba.
A Russian newspaper last week reported that Moscow was preparing to send crude and fuel cargoes to the Communist-run island in the near future, without giving a specific date.
The United States has maintained an embargo on Cuba since the 1960s, but in recent months the administration of President Donald Trump has hardened its stance, sanctioning vessels shipping oil to Cuba and threatening tariffs on suppliers.
It argues the measures will pressure a political change in Cuba. The United Nations has long voted for the US to end its embargo, and leaders from Mexico and Venezuela said blocking fuel could have serious humanitarian impacts. REUTERS

Israel's approval of West Bank land registration sparks outrage

Israel's government has approved a process to register land in the West Bank as "state property," drawing condemnation from Arab nations and critics who said it would accelerate annexation of the Palestinian territory.
Israel's Foreign Ministry said the measure, approved late on Sunday, February 15, would enable "transparent and thorough clarification of rights to resolve legal disputes" and was needed after unlawful land registration in areas controlled by the Palestinian Authority.
Arab nations Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Qatar and Jordan criticized the move as illegal under international law. The measure is "aimed at imposing a new legal and administrative reality in the occupied West Bank" that would undermine peace efforts in the region, Saudi Arabia's Foreign Affairs Ministry said in a statement. Jordan's King Abdullah II said the actions "undermine efforts to restore calm and threaten to exacerbate the conflict," according to a statement released by the royal court.
The European Union called on Israel to reverse the move. "This constitutes a new escalation after recent measures already aimed at extending Israeli control," EU foreign affairs spokesman Anouar El Anouni said. "We reiterate that annexation is illegal under international law."
UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres echoed that point and called the move "destabilizing," warning the "decision could lead to the dispossession of Palestinians of their property." He also called for the decision's immediate reversal, adding in a statement from his spokesman that "the current trajectory on the ground is eroding the prospect for the two-State solution."
The Ramallah-based Palestinian Authority called for international intervention to prevent the "de facto beginning of the annexation process and the undermining of the foundations of the Palestinian state."
'Mega land grab'
Israeli anti-settlement watchdog Peace Now called the measure a "mega land grab." Jonathan Mizrachi, the NGO's co-director, told Agence France-Presse that the move would attribute new resources for land registration. The process will take place only in Area C, which constitutes some 60% of the West Bank's territory and is under Israeli security and administrative control.
"There was a lot of ambiguity regarding the land, and Israel decided now to deal with it," Mizrachi said, adding that the grey area over Area C land ownership is likely to be used against Palestinians. "A lot of land that Palestinians consider theirs, they will find out it's not theirs under this new registration process," he said, believing the move would further the Israeli right's annexation agenda.
Palestinians see the West Bank as foundational to any future Palestinian state, but many on Israel's religious right want to take over the land.
Last week, Israel's security cabinet approved a series of measures backed by far-right ministers to tighten control over areas of the West Bank administered by the Palestinian Authority under the Oslo accords, in place since the 1990s. Those measures, which also sparked international backlash, include allowing Jewish Israelis to buy West Bank land directly and allowing Israeli authorities to administer certain religious sites in areas under the Palestinian Authority's control.

FBI refuses to share evidence about Alex Pretti’s killing at hands of fed agents with Minnesota investigators
Officials warn against Justice Department’s ‘concerning and unprecedented’ refusal to support local authorities
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
The FBI will not share information with Minnesota authorities investigating the killing of Alex Pretti, who was fatally shot by federal officers during the Trump administration’s surge into Minneapolis last month.
The Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension said Monday it formally received notice from the bureau that it will not provide the state agency with “access to any information or evidence that it has collected” in connection with Pretti’s death.
“While this lack of cooperation is concerning and unprecedented, the BCA is committed to thorough, independent and transparent investigations of these incidents, even if hampered by a lack of access to key information and evidence,” Superintendent Drew Evans said in a statement.
“Our agency has committed to the FBI and Department of Justice that should its stance change we remain willing to share information that we have obtained with that agency and would welcome a joint investigation,” he added. “We will continue to pursue all legal avenues to gain access to relevant information and evidence.”
The FBI’s decision to withhold evidence from Minnesota authorities follows a similar decision in the case of Renee Good, another Minnesota resident who was fatally shot by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer last month.
A spokesperson for the FBI declined to comment but referred The Independent to remarks from Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, who previously announced that the Department of Justice had opened a “standard” investigation into the case.
Hours after the Pretti’s killing, Minnesota law enforcement agencies sued to block Homeland Security officials from destroying or altering any evidence from the scene, and a federal judge appointed by Donald Trump granted the order later that night.
But earlier this month, the judge said inflammatory statements by top administration officials and a potentially compromised crime scene were not enough to block federal law enforcement agencies from handling evidence, for now.
Though the administration has repeatedly rebuffed attempts for local authorities to investigate the killings, the Justice Department has opened a federal civil rights investigation into Pretti’s death. Blanche has sought to downplay the Justice Department’s inquiry, describing it as a “standard investigation by the FBI.”
Homeland Security is separately reviewing the case.
Administration officials “decided the day Mr. Pretti was killed that the federal officers who shot him did nothing wrong,” District Judge Eric C. Tostrud, a Trump-appointee, wrote this month.
On X, White House deputy chief of staff for policy Stephen Miller baselessly labeled Pretti a “domestic terrorist” who “tried to assassinate federal law enforcement.” Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said Pretti “committed an act of domestic terrorism” and intended to “inflict maximum damage on individuals and to kill law enforcement.”
“These statements are troubling,” Tostrud wrote. “They reflect, not a genuine interest in learning the truth, but snap judgments informed by speculation and motivated by political partisanship.”
Miller later claimed that the statements were based on reports from Customs and Border Protection personnel “on the ground.”
Last week, Trump administration’s top immigration enforcement officials testified that such characterizations did not come from them or anyone who reports to them.
Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty has also demanded evidence in the killings of Pretti and Good from Homeland Security and the Department of Justice, and the state has launched a website to collect evidence from the public.
Pretti’s family, meanwhile, has urged the FBI and Minnesota authorities to jointly investigate the death of the 37-year-old intensive care unit nurse.
“Justice and accountability requires a thorough and impartial investigation to establish the facts,” the family said in a statement. “A truly joint state and federal investigation would be a welcome development.”
An initial investigation into Pretti’s killing was led by Homeland Security Investigations, the agency’s investigative arm, which is required to “preserve all evidence collected, including physical evidence collected by other federal entities, which are then properly transferred” to homeland custody, according to a sworn declaration in court documents from Mark Zito, the agency’s Special Agent in Charge for the St. Paul office.
All evidence was “collected and transported back to the FBI Minneapolis Field Office,” according to a sworn statement from an FBI official whose name is redacted in court filings.
That evidence includes body-worn camera footage, which has been “preserved,” according to Jeffrey Egerton, the executive director for the Investigative Operations Directorate within Customs and Border Protection’s Office of Professional Responsibility.
“There’s a lot of other video, there’s body-cam video that’s all being looked at, and until all that evidence is evaluated, I can’t jump to a conclusion” about the case, Customs and Border Protection commissioner Rodney Scott testified to the Senate Homeland Security committee last week.
“I would ask America to do the same thing, but I am committed to transparency, to making sure all the information we have is made public when it’s appropriate,” he said.
Border Patrol agents were filmed shooting 10 rounds at Pretti after tackling him to the ground January 24, two weeks after an ICE officer fatally shot Good.
Their deaths have fueled outrage against the Trump administration’s weeks-long surge of immigration officers into Minnesota, where agents have been accused of brutally targeting immigrants and citizens alike during protests and violent arrests.
White House border czar Tom Homan, who was deployed to the state in the wake of Pretti’s killing and the apparent removal of Border Patrol “commander-at-large” Greg Bovino, announced last week that “a small footprint of personnel” will remain in the state to supervise the transfer of “full command and control” of immigration enforcement back to the ICE field office in Minneapolis.

Wes Moore won’t call Trump racist over Obama apes post but doesn’t say he’s not: ‘I know his actions hit Black folks’
Democratic Maryland governor says president’s ‘actions’ speak for themselves, even amid Trump’s denials of racist intentions
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
Maryland Gov. Wes Moore, the nation’s only current Black governor, addressed the now-deleted post from Donald Trump’s account depicting Barack and Michelle Obama as apes at a town hall that aired Sunday.
Moore sat down with CBS News’ Norah O’Donnell and declined to say directly whether he thought the president was a racist, calling it a question for Trump himself. But the governor did smile quickly, almost to himself, as O’Donnell described how Trump claimed he was the “least racist” president in history after an uproar over the post began.
“I think that’s a question for President Trump,” Moore said. “I can tell you I know how his actions hit Black folks, and how they hit people of color.”
He added: “I think his actions probably give the answer before he even has a chance to answer it himself."
Moore pointed to the video as well as the policy priorities of the Trump administration as evidence that the president may hold animus towards Black Americans.
Maryland is home to tens of thousands of federal workers, and was hit particularly hard by the White House’s wild cost-cutting spree led by Elon Musk’s DOGE initiative. Moore’s office claims that an estimated 24,900 Marylanders lost federal employment during the first year of Trump’s presidency, something the governor’s office has noted hit Black communities and women particularly hard.
During the CBS town hall, he referred to it as the “greatest assault on Black female employment that we’ve seen in our nation’s history”.
The video was posted from Trump’s Truth Social account and appeared to have been created originally by another user. It was deleted from Trump’s personal account hours later.
The video depicted the former president and his wife as apes in the jungle, imagery that aligned with historical racist depictions of Black people. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt initially defended the video and denied those connotations, but later the White House declared that it had been posted by a staffer by “mistake”.
Trump himself has refused to apologize directly for the video post being spread by his acount.
The president’s critics haven’t bought that explanation. Republican Sen. Tim Scott, the only Black senator in the GOP, called it the “most racist thing” he’d seen emerge from the second Trump administration, and the video was roundly condemned by lawmakers on both sides in Capitol Hill. Mike Johnson, the speaker of the House, echoed the statement calling it a “mistake” and claimed that Trump himself had never seen it.
Obama responded to the video on a podcast with Brian Tyler Cohen that aired Sunday. The former president said that a majority of Americans find the White House’s conduct “troubling”, and added: “[T]here’s this sort of clown show happening in social media and on television, and what is true is that there doesn’t seem to be any shame about this among people who used to feel like you had to have some sort of decorum and a sense of propriety and respect for the office. So that’s been lost.”
“But the reason I point out that I don't think the majority of the American people approve of this is because, ultimately, the answer is going to come from the American people,” he continued.
Fallout from the video comes at a time when the White House cannot afford to lose further political capital on the Hill. The Republican House caucus is facing its thinnest majority yet as it hurtles towards the 2026 midterm elections, while Trump also continues to face defections in the Senate from moderate GOP senators.
The Maryland governor has repeatedly expressed his disinterest in running for president and did so again in his town hall with CBS, telling O’Donnell: “I’m not running for president...I don’t see a reason. I love my job. I love what I’m doing.”
But his prominence within the Democratic Party and the fact that Moore, if re-elected this November in a race he is widely expected to win, would be halfway through his second and final term as governor in 2028 has continued to stoke speculation about his potential future in national politics.
Moore is heavily favored to win re-election in deep-blue Maryland, and in recent days former Gov. Larry Hogan announced that he would not challenge him for the seat. Hogan is seen as one of the few Republicans in Maryland with statewide appeal, partly due to his anti-Trump stance.

In Munich, Ukraine and Europe face collapse of post-Cold War order

In Munich, Ukraine and Europe face collapse of post-Cold War order

The U.S.-Europe dynamic was more cordial at the Feb. 13-15 Munich Security Conference than last year, with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio delivering a conciliatory speech.
But the substance of the relationship remained unchanged, despite the softer rhetoric.
U.S. President Donald Trump's foreign policy upheavals, from Ukraine to Greenland, were fresh on everyone's mind – as well as the confrontational address by U.S. Vice President JD Vance during last year's conference.
European leaders made it clear: the post–Cold War global order is ending — or at least undergoing profound change — and Europe can no longer afford to remain in Washington’s shadow.
"If there had been a unipolar moment after the fall of the Berlin Wall, a unipolar moment in history, it has long passed," German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said in his speech, heralding the return of "power politics" and warning that the U.S. cannot "go it alone."
French President Emmanuel Macron, in turn, urged Europe to become a “geopolitical power,” while hinting at reforms to France’s nuclear doctrine as Paris weighs extending its nuclear umbrella over the continent.
With Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in attendance, Russia’s invasion was still on the agenda, though partly overshadowed by broader global turbulence and a transatlantic rupture.
The Munich Security Conference also painted a bleak picture of peace prospects for Ukraine, contradicting the recent optimism from U.S. officials. Furthermore, some officials and analysts cast doubt on whether the U.S. and Europe could provide Kyiv with NATO-style security guarantees.

The transatlantic wake-up call
Despite the bold calls for European autonomy, there was clear relief when Rubio, the most senior U.S. official present, delivered a speech markedly different in tone from Vance's.
"So in a time of headlines heralding the end of the transatlantic era, let it be known and clear to all that this is neither our goal nor our wish – because for us Americans, our home may be in the Western Hemisphere, but we will always be a child of Europe," the U.S. diplomat said in a speech met with a standing ovation.
Nevertheless, some noted that Rubio was delivering a familiar Trumpian message, simply packaged in more diplomatic language.
"Secretary Rubio said exactly the same things (as Vance), just in a more polite way," Estonia's Foreign Minister Margus Tsahkna told the Kyiv Independent on the sidelines of the event, referring to the American's calls for a stronger Europe.
The Estonian official acknowledged that some U.S. criticism is warranted — and even useful — and described Europe as a former athlete “getting fat” from inactivity.
"We just need to start training… We have more strength to act on defense, but also on an economic level," Tsahkna said. "And also Ukraine is part of our future — a huge opportunity."
In fact, few European officials have challenged Washington’s call for Europe to rearm, as reflected in last year’s pledge by NATO members to raise defense spending to 5% of gross domestic product (GDP).
But the U.S. message has been muddled by a simultaneous push for a weaker EU, Washington's support for far-right and populist parties, and a brief threat to impose U.S. tariffs on countries that opposed Trump's bid to annex Greenland.
Notably, after his appearance in Munich, Rubio traveled to Slovakia and Hungary — arguably the two most Kremlin-friendly EU member states, both heavily reliant on Russian energy.

No high hopes for Ukraine talks
Despite recent optimism from U.S. envoys, the Munich Security Conference cast a gloomy picture regarding progress toward peace in Ukraine.
As the conference took off, Trump called on Zelensky to "get moving" with peace talks ahead of trilateral negotiations in Geneva on Feb. 17-18, claiming that "Russia wants to make a deal."
But Moscow has dismissed key elements of a peace framework drafted by Ukrainian and Western officials, refusing to compromise on its territorial and political demands.
In Munich, Rubio's message was out of step with his boss's.
"We don't know if the Russians are serious about ending the war," the U.S. diplomat said, while Zelensky asked the attendees: "Can you imagine (Russian President Vladimir) Putin without war?"
"No one in Ukraine believes he will ever let our people go. But he will not let other European nations go either – because he cannot let go of the very idea of war," the Ukrainian leader said, warning that carving up Ukraine through territorial concessions would not bring a lasting peace.
In contrast with his scathing remarks about Europe in Davos, Zelensky thanked European allies for stepping up military support as the U.S. withdrew. He also said that it is a "big mistake" that Europe is absent from the negotiating table.
Many echoed this message. In an interview with Bloomberg in Munich, Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski complained that Europe is being sidelined from negotiations even though it – not the U.S. – foots the bill for Ukraine's defense.
Last year, the U.S. halted nearly all new aid allocations, while European military support surged by 67%, including through purchases of American hardware for Ukraine. The Munich conference also followed U.K. Defense Secretary John Healey's announcement of $35 billion in fresh allied assistance this year.

Missing answers
Zelensky and Rubio met on the sidelines of the event to discuss air defenses, Russia's escalating attacks on Ukraine's energy grid, and the upcoming round of peace negotiations.
"We also touched on the sequence of steps. It's important to make progress on issues of security guarantees and economic recovery," Zelensky said after the meeting.
At the conference, the Ukrainian leader called for 20-year security guarantees to be signed before a potential peace agreement, a sequence that clashes with Washington's push for the fastest possible end to hostilities.
Although the West has previously signaled readiness to provide Ukraine with “Article 5-like” security guarantees, backed by a post-war European-led multinational force, officials who spoke with the Kyiv Independent were cautious.
"The primary security guarantee is strong Ukrainian armed forces," Latvian Defense Minister Andris Spruds told the Kyiv Independent in an interview.
The deployment of forces led by the Coalition of the Willing would additionally demonstrate Europe's engagement, the Latvian defense chief said. He declined to speculate on what would happen if a Russian missile struck the said troops.
Lithuanian Foreign Minister Kestutis Budrys warned against offering "hollow" promises and "fake guarantees" to Kyiv. In an interview with the Kyiv Independent, he dismissed the concept of Article 5-like guarantees, calling them mere "rhetorical expressions."
"There can be nothing similar to Article 5… Because Article 5 means that if you are in trouble, I promise you that I will come and if it is needed, I will die for you," he added.
Instead, he underscored financial support for Ukraine's Armed Forces or Ukraine's future EU membership as more realistic guarantees.
The question remains: what security guarantees — short of direct Western military involvement — would deter Russia, given that extensive security aid and sanctions have failed to end the war?
U.S. political scientist Ian Bremmer said he does not consider the proposed security guarantees credible.
"Trump has shown that he is willing to throw Ukrainians under the bus, repeatedly," Bremmer told the Kyiv Independent.
He added that the U.S. president appears determined to end the war and claim political credit — without putting American lives at risk.
But even if Europe — backed by Washington — were to formally commit to military intervention, the expert said he "can't see the Russians accepting that today."
Bill Browder, an American-born British financier and sanctions advocate, expressed skepticism that Moscow would relent in 2026, despite mounting economic woes.
"I think if we just were to watch the pressure that they're under right now, going into 2026, I don't think that's enough to stop them in the war in Ukraine," he told the Kyiv Independent.
Comparing Putin to North Korea, Browder said: "He will always have enough money for his war, even if he has to starve his population. So, you need to make sure that he just doesn't have enough money for anything."

Zelensky on Russia's preparation for massive strike: Enemy attacks 'evolve'
In his traditional nightly video address, he emphasized that the Russians understand exactly what they are trying to destroy when they hit Ukraine, Ukrinform reports.
"Air defense must be configured properly. Russian attacks constantly – if you can put it that way – 'evolve.' Evil also develops. Unfortunately. These are combined strikes that require special protection and corresponding support from partners," Zelensky said.
He expressed confidence that any delay in missile response for air defense or any untimely supply "works for scaling up the damage from the strikes."
"Everything we discussed in Munich with our partners must be implemented fast. It is important that partners do not remain silent," he said.
Zelensky stressed that peace will be the reward for those who know how to wield strength.
"No one should have any illusions: if Russia is not held accountable for this aggression, it will not live in peace with you – with anyone in the world who expects cooperation with it. Russia must be held accountable for everything. Justice must prevail," he said.
Zelensky said that right now everyone was awaiting the continuation of trilateral meetings. "Our delegation is already in Geneva and preparing for the negotiations. Russia cannot resist the temptation of the last days of winter cold and wants to inflict painful blows on Ukrainians. The more of this evil comes from Russia, the harder it will be for everyone to reach any agreements with them. Partners must understand this. First and foremost, this concerns the United States," he said.
"Ukraine can become a truly important element of European and Euro-Atlantic security. It is important that our state's partners understand Ukraine's capabilities just as our common enemy does," Zelensky said.

China Wants 203,000 Satellites in Low Earth Orbit, Compared to SpaceX’s Current Leadership of 10,000

China has submitted applications to the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) to deploy super-large satellite groups. The documents mention a potential fleet of up to 203,000 devices in low Earth orbit.
The declared scale significantly exceeds the current global market figures. This has attracted the attention of analysts and the space industry, according to Bloomberg.
The news agency also provides statistics: for comparison, SpaceX’s Starlink network already has nearly 10,000 active satellites. The system remains the largest active constellation in LEO (Low Earth Orbit).
Bloomberg also notes that Chinese applications may be regulatory in nature. This refers to the reservation of frequencies and orbital positions without guaranteed implementation.
Submissions to the International Telecommunication Union allow countries to fix spectral resources. Such applications are taken into account during international coordination.
This practice creates technical limitations for competitors. Operators are forced to take potential radio interference into account in advance.
The context for these decisions is the rapid growth in the number of devices in orbit. Since 2020, the numbers have increased several times over.
Experts warn of the risks of LEO overload. This refers to both spectral conflicts and the threat of cascading collisions.
The Falcon 9 rocket remains a key factor in SpaceX’s dominance. The reusable system ensures low launch costs and a high rate of satellite deployment.
Analysts emphasize the technological gap between operators. The lack of similar launch capabilities limits the scalability of competitors.
Despite China’s ambitious plans, Elon Musk retains market leadership. It is the pace of launches that currently determines the balance of power in low orbit.
WMilitarnyi recently mentioned the topic of satellite telecommunications space as it relates to Ukraine in the article Starlink – a new story of protecting SatCom sovereignty.

Zelenskiy warns of new Russian strikes ahead of Geneva peace talks
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
Feb 16 - President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Monday that Ukrainian intelligence showed more Russian attacks on energy targets lay ahead and that such strikes made it more difficult to reach an agreement on ending the nearly four-year war.
"Intelligence reports show that Russia is preparing further massive strikes against energy infrastructure so it is necessary to ensure that all air defence systems are properly configured," Zelenskiy said in his nightly video address.
Ukrainian, Russian and American delegations are gathering in the Swiss city of Geneva for a third round of U.S.-brokered talks on Tuesday focused for the first time on the thorniest question of the war — the fate of Ukrainian territory occupied by Russia.
Zelenskiy said Russian attacks were "constantly evolving" and resorting to a combination of weapons, including drones and missiles, requiring "special defence and support from our partners".
"Russia cannot resist the temptation of the final days of winter cold and wants to strike Ukrainians painfully," he said. "Partners must understand this. First and foremost, this concerns the United States."
Reuters was not able to immediately reach Russian officials for comment.
The head of Ukraine's delegation, Rustem Umerov, said on Telegram that his team was already in Geneva looking forward "to constructive work and substantive meetings on security and humanitarian issues".
Moscow wants Ukraine to cede the entirety of the Donbas area.
Russian news agencies quoted aviation sources as saying that the Russian delegation had left for Geneva, headed by Vladimir Medinsky, an aide to President Vladimir Putin.
"This time, the idea is to discuss a broader range of issues, including, in fact, the main ones. The main issues concern both the territories and everything else related to the demands we have put forward," Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters.
He said military intelligence chief Igor Kostyukov would also take part in the talks and that Putin's special envoy, Kirill Dmitriev, would engage in a separate working group on economic issues.

FBI won’t share Alex Pretti shooting evidence, Minnesota authorities say

Minnesota law enforcement authorities have said the FBI is refusing to share any evidence on its investigation into the death of Alex Pretti, the man killed by federal immigration authorities in late January.
Pretti was shot on 24 January by Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officials in Minneapolis during the Trump administration’s surge of immigration enforcement operations in the city. His killing came just two weeks after an immigration official shot and killed Renee Good and 10 days after the shooting of Julio C Sosa-Celis.
On Monday, Minnesota’s bureau of criminal apprehension (BCA), a state-level criminal investigative law enforcement agency, said the FBI had formally notified it that it would not share any information or evidence related to Pretti’s shooting.
The Minnesota governor, Tim Walz, has demanded an “impartial” investigation into the shootings in Minneapolis.
“Trump’s left hand cannot investigate his right hand,” he said on Monday in response to the FBI’s refusal to share evidence. “The families of the deceased deserve better.”
The BCA’s superintendent also expressed frustration.
“While this lack of cooperation is concerning and unprecedented, the BCA is committed to thorough, independent and transparent investigations of these incidents, even if hampered by a lack of access to key information and evidence,” added Drew Evans.
He added that the agency remained committed to a joint investigation and said it would “continue to pursue all legal avenues to gain access to relevant information and evidence”.
The FBI did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The agency has also previously refused to share any information related to the shootings of Good or Sosa-Celis, a lack of cooperation that led the BCA to stop its investigation into Good’s killing.
“As we’ve previously said, full access to evidence, witnesses and information is necessary to meet the investigative standard that Minnesota law and the public demands; without it, we cannot do so,” the BCA said back in January, after the FBI boxed it out of the investigation.
The Trump administration in December deployed federal officials to the Minneapolis area for an aggressive roundup of immigrants dubbed “Operation Metro Surge” that has seen a series of violent incidents as masked officials arrest people they claim to suspect lack proper residency documentation.
Democrats and Republicans have both called on independent investigations into the Minneapolis shootings.
Pretti, a nurse at the Department of Veterans Affairs, was observing immigration enforcement operations in Minneapolis when he was killed. Good was similarly an observer in Minneapolis, who was shot in her car by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officer. Homeland security officials initially accused Good, 37, of “weaponizing” her vehicle, but local officials have disputed those claims.
Both Pretti and Good were US citizens and video footage of their shootings has circulated widely, leading to mass protests.
Sosa-Celis was shot by an ICE official in the leg last month. Trump administration officials initially claimed Sosa-Celis and two other men had “ambushed” the ICE officer who then “fired a defensive shot to defend his life”. But last week two ICE officials were placed on leave while they are investigated for allegedly lying under oath about the interaction.

‘The whole state is still a tinderbox’: Victoria braces for extreme fire conditions

‘Take shelter now’: Bushfire threatens central Victorian towns as firefighters brace for wind change
Updated ,first published
An out-of-control bushfire is threatening lives in three central Victorian towns, as firefighters brace for a wind change in coming hours.
The fire started in inaccessible terrain around Tallarook State Forest, on a day on which emergency services warned Victorians to stay alert to extreme fire danger.
Residents of Kerrisdale, Tallarook and Trawool – about 15 kilometres south of Seymour – are being urged to take shelter immediately from the blaze.
“You are in danger and need to act immediately to survive,” the warning read. “The safest option is to take shelter indoors immediately. It is too late to leave.”
Further south, a watch and act warning is in place for people who live near King Parrot Creek Road from Tehans Road to Strath Creek Road. Residents are being urged to leave now.
Residents of Granite, Dairy Creek and Homewood are being advised to stay informed and plan for what they will do if the situation changes.
State Control Centre spokesperson David Nugent said the fire was burning in a south-westerly direction towards Flynns Road.
The CFA says a wind change is predicted between 6pm and 8pm, which will change the fire’s direction and send it north-east.
“The change will … create additional challenges for us,” said Nugent.
Nugent said it was important for people to monitor the fire’s movement if they were in that area, and to regularly check the VicEmergency app.
As of 5pm, the fire had burnt 116 hectares and had more than 96 firefighters tackling it, as well as five choppers and one fixed-wing aircraft. There are no reports of property losses at this stage.
VicEmergency sent emergency warnings to 1000 phones earlier on Tuesday.
The fire is burning around 15 kilometres from the western edge of the Longwood fire, which was one of the worst blazes in the state during what was a devastating January for Victoria.
A 78-year-old man died and hundreds of homes were lost when the Longwood fire burned through more than 100,000 hectares of land, with firefighters only able to contain it last Friday, five weeks later.
Police are still investigating that fire’s cause.
Parts of Melbourne and Victoria reached tops around 35 degrees on Tuesday afternoon, lower than the forecast top of 37 for Melbourne.
A total fire ban remains in effect for the rest of the day for the Central, North Central, South-west, West and South Gippsland and Wimmera fire districts, meaning no fire can be lit in the open air or allowed to remain alight on February 17.
Extreme fire danger is forecast in each of these areas, and also in Victoria’s north-east.
The Bureau of Meteorology’s Morgan Pumpa said a cool change would not reach Melbourne until the late afternoon or evening, as a south-westerly wind change pushes an ocean breeze across Victoria.
“That’s in the east that we’ll see a little bit of cooler air … for the most part, everyone should just expect winds to be hot, and they’re going to be dry,” Pumpa said.
Thunderstorms were possible in a large swath of Victoria, stretching from Echuca-Moama to Mount Baw Baw to Traralgon, Pumpa said.
Parts of the state have not had meaningful rain for weeks, leaving abundant dry fuel despite major blazes already this season.
The dangerous weather predicted follows a January during which fires burnt more than 400,000 hectares of Victoria.
One person was killed and nearly 1600 structures were damaged or destroyed after fires began in the first week of the year, and were then aggravated by extreme heat peaking on January 9.
A major bushfire in the Otways flared up later in the same month, prompting evacuations and causing property losses.
On Monday, Wiebusch said the Otways fire would hopefully be contained next week.

I remember my economics teacher (from 40 years ago) telling a story from his junior working days where a product wasn't selling at a price of $1. So they increased the base price to $2 and then put a sale ticket with a price of $0.99. They sold out almost instantly.

Santos responds to court victory
The landmark greenwashing case against gas giant Santos was dismissed this morning. The company welcomed the judgement from Justice Markovic in the Federal Court of Australia, and says it's committed to "transparent, accurate and compliant reporting".
The Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility sued the fossil fuel company for allegedly misleading investors over their roadmap to net zero by 2040. The case was dismissed with costs.
Santos says it has since developed a plan for its transition to zero emissions, and a majority of shareholders supported the transition at the company's last general meeting.
Earlier, Brynn O'Brien of the ACCR said it will review the ruling to determine its next steps.
Mobil to pay $16m in penalties
It's not just Coles in the sights of the ACCC.
Mobil Oil Australia has been found guilty of breaching Australian Consumer Law and ordered to pay $16 million in penalties for making false or misleading representations about the fuel sold at nine petrol stations in Queensland.
In a release from the ACCC, it was reported that Mobil made the claims leading up to July 2024 to consumers at the stations in the north and central regions of the state.
Branding and signage indicated that the fuel being sold was 'Mobil Synergy Fuel' containing certain additives.
But Mobil Synergy Fuel was not sold at these nine sites, the ACCC said, and the fuel supplied at these sites was the same as unadditised fuel at other non-Mobil retail sites.
"Petrol is an essential good for most households, and there is no way of knowing what you're putting in your tank other than relying on the signage provided by the retailer," ACCC Deputy Chair Mick Keogh said.
"We considered it very likely that some people chose to fill up at these petrol stations because they thought they were getting a different quality of petrol with particular benefits for their car engine."
Cooperating with the ACCC, Mobil admitted liability and agreed to make joint submissions with the ACCC to the Federal Court about proposed orders, including penalties.
The ACCC said that the nine Mobil petrol stations were in the Queensland towns and suburbs of Aitkenvale, Barcaldine, Berserker, Biloela, Guthalungra, Proserpine, Rasmussen, Rural View and Yeppoon.
Coles downplays meaning of 'Down Down' price tags
If you're just joining us and missed the ACCC v Coles proceedings for today, never fear — national consumer affairs reporter Michael Atkin has wrapped it all up for us.
Today we heard from the supermarket giant, which downplayed what shoppers understood when they saw its "Down Down" price tags, on the second day of a bombshell federal court case.
The ACCC is suing Coles in a lawsuit described as "the case of the century" by a former ACCC boss.
In evidence on Tuesday morning the judge overseeing the case, Justice Michael O'Bryan, asked Coles to explain what it was telling customers with its prominent marketing campaign, featuring giant red hands pointing down.
"It's really asking a bigger question about what ordinary consumers understand about the Down Down program," Justice O'Bryan said.
"I don't know if I've seen a statement from Coles which directly answers that question."
In response, legal counsel for Coles John Sheahan KC said, "In terms of what consumers would take from the advertising campaigns and the red hand — not much.
"It's an indication that Coles is trying to keep prices low."
Justice O'Bryan probed further, asking if Coles would accept that "Down Down" was a promotion and showed a discount.
"Yes," Mr Sheahan responded.

BHP shares hit record high on profit jump
Shares in mining giant BHP touched a record high this session, rising as much as 7.2% at one point.
As we head closer to the close, the stock is up 4.8% to $52.79, helping keep the broader market above water no doubt.
It comes after BHP reported a stronger-than-expected profit result and increased its interim dividend more than anticipated as well.
Union boss slams Crown Resorts
A summit next Wednesday to be attended by Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, Victorian Premier Jacinta Allan and the state's opposition leader Jess Wilson is shaping as the next potential battle site in a long-running industrial war between Crown Resorts and the United Workers Union.
UWU members at Crown's Melbourne casino started a 24-hour strike at midnight to coincide with the Lunar New Year, one of the gambling venue's peak periods.
Speaking outside the casino today, the UWU's slightly hoarse casinos director Andrew Jones got snaky at Crown management.
He said that without a new offer from the Blackstone-owned Crown, workers would take further industrial action.
"Next week this casino sponsors and hosts Victorian Future Summit. That event will be attended by the prime minister, the premier and the opposition leader here in Victoria.
"It's really important that those political leaders send Crown a strong message to say that secure, well-paid jobs are the future for Victoria, not wage cuts and offshoring of jobs as Crown currently proposes."
The event he's referring to is the Future Victoria summit, to be held next Wednesday.
He also expressed frustration at Crown for not coming up with a new offer after a proposal that would have slashed wages for new starters was overwhelmingly rejected by workers before Christmas.
"They turn up but their position hasn't changed in eight weeks.
"We made it clear yesterday to Crown that today's action didn't need to go ahead, that all they needed to do was walk away from a two-tier wage system which sees new workers $10,000 to $30,000 a year worse off, and a 3.5 per cent wage increase for existing Crown workers. The company rejected that offer and that's why we're here today.
"They gave us no offer."
Crown has been contacted for comment.
Junk food trader
The readers of this blog might make up a biased sample when looking at the Coles/Woolies/ACCC cases. A pure value investor is supposed to look at the value they are receiving from a share, and not price history. A pure trend trader or chartist is supposed to look at the price history without considering value. Maybe we should all consider which we are, both in the market and the supermarket. And, yes, I do allow the duopoly's discount cycle to dictate variety in my junk food intake.

Bof, you and me both.
For me, it's chocolate and laundry products— my kids' clothes are cleaner during the regular fortnightly half-price stain remover sale.
Day 2 of ACCC vs Coles is over
Well, that was quick.
After a little more than 30 minutes following the lunch break, Justice O'Bryan has adjourned the ACCC hearing on Coles at the Federal Court of Melbourne until tomorrow.
It was all very technical (and not very interesting) in the afternoon session as Emma Bathurst, of the ACCC, and Coles' lawyer Andrew Barraclough, addressed Justice O'Bryan.
On day 1, the ACCC, represented by Garry Rich, claimed that Coles 'Down Down' promotions were misleading and not true discounts, with the supermarket allegedly manipulating prices to give the impression of a bargain.
But the supermarket's lawyer John Sheahan said that setting grocery prices was "complex" and often difficult for the regular shopper to understand.
The hearing will resume at 10:15am ADST on Wednesday with the first witness from the ACCC.
In the meantime, do you have an experience with Coles or any other major supermarket you'd be willing to share?
We'd love to hear from you. Reach out to my hard-working colleague, Emilia Terzon.

Workers are customers, too
Can I point out before people demonise the workers that we are customers too and we are not the enemy.
- Brad
Thanks for reading Brad. You make a good point — Woolworths and Coles are among the largest employers in Australia, so it makes sense that supermarket workers also make up a not-so-insignificant part of their customer bases.
So the people changing those tickets on the shelves are also paying the prices advertised.
Shareholder group responds after Santos case dismissed
The Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility has lost its landmark greenwashing court case against gas giant Santos, but says it will carefully review the ruling to determine its next steps.
"Goliath won this round," Brynn O'Brien of the ACCR said in a statement about the ruling in the case.
The shareholder activist group sued Santos over allegedly misleading claims about the company achieving net zero by 2040.
Justice Markovic dismissed the case with costs this morning in the Federal Court of Australia.
But the ACCR remains optimistic, saying the case "shone a powerful spotlight" on the fossil fuel giant's conduct.
The Judge's reasons for the ruling numbered over 250 pages and took over a year complete. The full judgement won't be made public until next week.
"This ruling is disappointing," Will van de Pol of Market Forces, an environmental advocacy group, told us, but he said that other companies that are allegedly greenwashing are "far from off the hook".
The case comes amid a crackdown from the ACCC on greenwashing, as well as a handful of civil lawsuits from environmental advocacy groups against some of Australia's biggest companies.
The ABC has reached out to Santos for comment.
Coles staff changing millions of price tags weekly
Emilia Terzon here from the Federal Court of Australia in Melbourne. We've just resumed session for the ACCC vs Coles case where so far it's feeling pretty technical.
(In fact, looks like I'm one of the only journalists who has physically stuck around!)
While I'm here, I thought I'd run you through something we heard from Coles legal counsel before lunch break, about how many price decisions are being made instore.
John Sheahan KC told the court, that Coles staff are changing around 5,500 tickets on grocery items in every supermarket every Wednesday.
If you times that by the number of supermarkets run by Coles - 840 nationally - you get a staggering 4.6 million tickets being swapped over manually every week. Obviously this is a back of the envelope calculation, but it gives you an indication of the scale we are discussing in court.
The ACCC has been arguing that Coles was deceptive in its famous 'Down Down' campaign, and that it would jack up prices on products for shorter periods of time, as low as one week, before lowering them again with an "illusory" discount.
What have you been making of this case? I've really been enjoying all your emails about your shopping habits! Send us a note in the comments or email me on terzon.emilia@abc.net.au.
And while you're here, check out my TV story from last night.
Loading...Coles vs ACCC is underway after lunch
It's started again after lunch at the Federal Court in Melbourne.
Emma Bathurst, of the ACCC, and Andrew Barraclough, representing Coles, are addressing Justice O'Bryan on day two of the hearing.
The proceedings are putting the Coles 'Down Down' promotions in the spotlight.
Before lunch, John Sheahan from the Coles's legal team presenting the supermarket giant's case, arguing that the frequent changes in the price of items were totally justified in 2022 and 2023 -- the period in question -- when Australia's inflation was as high as 8%.
Slightly more balanced Reserve Bank: RBC Capital Markets
Returning to the Reserve Bank's February meeting minutes, released today.
RBC Capital Markets has offered its take, and macro rates strategist Robert Thompson felt the minutes presented a more patient RBA than he had thought.
"Today's RBA board meeting minutes read to us as slightly more balanced than the original Feb meeting statement, [quarterly] forecasts and the subsequent run of RBA speeches & parliamentary testimony from the Governor, Deputy Governor and Chief Economist which had a more stridently hawkish tone," he wrote.
"Most of the rest of the minutes were broadly consistent with other communication. They still lean 'hawkish' overall, e.g. via the reframing of financial conditions as easier than previously thought, and growth/labour market risks as having diminished, but none of this was particularly new information."
Mr Thompson did note two lines in particular — one which emphasised the board's strategy of preserving labour market gains.
"This commitment to preserving labour market gains was also a feature of the last hiking cycle, in contrast to the more aggressive approach of others (e.g. RBNZ and BoC) in taking rate above 5% to squash inflation more quickly with less regard to near-term growth and labour market outcomes.
"The board's reaffirmation of their alternative, softer strategy suggests back-to-back hikes are highly unlikely," he noted.
The other was a line referring the recent uptick in inflation being down to temporary factors.
"The bank has referred to uncertainty in the balance of temporary versus underlying factors quite a few times recently," the strategist noted.
"While two consecutive quarters of unsustainably high inflation was ultimately enough to trigger a reaction, we find it interesting the board still falls on the side of the 'larger part' of factors driving inflation as sitting in the 'less-persistent' bucket."
ACCC vs Coles resuming soon
It should be a fascinating afternoon session when the hearing at the Federal Court in Melbourne resumes shortly.
We're likely to hear more from Garry Rich SC from the ACCC who has claimed that Coles has been misleading customers with its 'Down Down' discounts.
Before lunch, we heard a vigorous defence from John Sheahan from the Coles's legal team before Justice O'Bryan.
No witnesses will be called until tomorrow, but it's likely that Mr Rich will continue to make the ACCC's case for the rest of the second day of the hearing.
It is due to start at 2:15pm AEDT and you can watch here.
Get your popcorn ready!

Arizona officials may sue EPA over its rollback of greenhouse gas regulations: Report
At Friday morning press conference criticizing EPA’s decision, head of environmental protection unit in Arizona Attorney General’s Office says pursuing legal action among options considered
ISTANBUL
Environmental advocates warn that the Trump administration’s decision to halt regulation of greenhouse gas emissions could severely harm the US state of Arizona, a state already experiencing increasingly extreme heatwaves, local media reported on Monday.
While it remains uncertain how Arizona will respond, at least one elected official has not ruled out suing the federal government.
On Thursday, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Lee Zeldin announced that the agency’s 2009 endangerment finding had been terminated, according to Tucson Sentinel website.
The finding originated from a 2007 US Supreme Court ruling that affirmed the EPA’s authority to regulate greenhouse gases that endanger public health.
It has long served as the legal basis for emissions standards governing cars, airplanes, power plants, and other major sources of pollution.
US President Donald Trump’s move to scrap the finding aligns with his broader agenda to roll back climate regulations affecting the auto and fossil fuel industries.
During the 2024 campaign, Trump told fossil fuel executives he would eliminate environmental rules to increase their profits if they helped raise $1 billion for his presidential campaign.
Legal challenges are widely expected once the repeal is finalized, and Arizona could be among the states that file suit.
At a Friday morning press conference criticizing the EPA’s decision, Kirsten Engel, head of the environmental protection unit in the Arizona Attorney General’s Office, said pursuing legal action is one of several options being weighed.
She said Attorney General Kris Mayes considers eliminating the endangerment finding both unlawful and contrary to the EPA’s mission to protect public health.
“The attorney general opposes it and considers that every option that her office has is on the table in response,” she said.
The repeal of what had been a cornerstone of federal climate regulations has unsettled environmental advocates. Pita Juarez, Arizona field organizer for Moms Clean Air Force, which has 1.6 million members nationwide, including 28,000 in Arizona, called the decision reckless and cautioned that it would carry serious consequences.
“Our children and future generations will pay the price for this unprecedented attack on public health protections,” she said.
Juarez emphasized that Arizona is likely to be among the states most affected if greenhouse gas regulations are further weakened.
Despite Trump’s assertions that climate change is a hoax, decades of scientific research have concluded that greenhouse gas emissions are raising global temperatures and will continue to do so without major reductions.
The past four years have been the hottest ever recorded in the US, with Arizona particularly impacted.
In Phoenix, summer 2025 brought 113 consecutive days of triple-digit temperatures. Statewide, extreme heat contributed to or caused as many as 427 deaths last year.
Rep. Mariana Sandoval, whose district includes rural and agricultural communities, said farmworkers and other outdoor laborers cannot afford for the federal government to step back from addressing climate change.
She warned that placing workers who spend most of their time outdoors, including those harvesting crops, at greater risk would have wide-ranging consequences.
“Rescinding the endangerment clause is like taking all the road signs and the highway patrol off of the interstate,” Sandoval said.
“It puts everyone at risk.”
Sandoval, who has consistently advocated for stronger state-level heat mitigation policies with limited success in the Republican-controlled Legislature, said she is uncertain how Arizona can step in if federal protections are withdrawn.
With the legislative session nearly over, introducing new proposals is unlikely this year, but she plans to meet with the governor’s and attorney general’s offices to discuss possible strategies.
Last month, the state’s Workplace Heat Safety Task Force, established by Gov. Katie Hobbs, released recommendations aimed at improving worker protections as temperatures rise.
The proposals urge employers to provide water, shade, and rest breaks during periods of extreme heat.
However, critics and workers argue that the guidelines lack enforcement measures.
Sandoval agreed that worker protections need stronger enforcement to ensure compliance.
An advisory committee to the Arizona Division of Occupational Safety and Health is scheduled to take a final vote on the proposed rules on March 3.

UK government drops plans to delay May council votes, adding to pressure over policy U-turns
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
LONDON - British Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s government on Feb 16 abandoned plans to delay 30 local council elections due in May after being advised it could lose a legal challenge, piling fresh pressure on him after a series of policy U-turns.
Mr Starmer survived a leadership crisis last week the rise of Mr Nigel Farage’s populist Reform UK party
The government had permitted some councils to postpone their elections ahead of an upcoming reorganisation of local government, but political opponents had said that move was designed to minimise potential losses.
Days before the decision was due to be scrutinised in court, in a legal case brought by Reform UK, the government issued a statement abandoning its plans, citing legal advice.
Mr Steve Reed, the minister responsible for local government, said all elections would now go ahead as originally scheduled in May.
Around 4.5 million voters would have been affected by the postponements. Councils oversee services such as housing, social care and waste collection.
Starmer’s judgment in the spotlight
Since winning a landslide election victory in July 2024, Mr Starmer has struggled to implement his agenda and has had some important decisions challenged in court.
The government has reversed course on a number of big-ticket budget measures under pressure from voters, industry and from within Labour. Courts ruled last week that a decision to ban a pro-Palestinian group was unlawful.
Mr Starmer’s leadership came under threat last week over his decision to appoint Mr Peter Mandelson as US ambassador after new disclosures showed the depth of his ties to the late US sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.
The May elections could prove the next flashpoint for Labour figures who believe Mr Starmer should be replaced.
Political opponents seized on the latest U-turn.
“We took this Labour government to court and won,” Mr Farage wrote on X on Feb 16, describing the decision as a “victory for democracy”. Court papers showed his party argued the postponements constituted an abuse of power.
The leader of the opposition Conservative Party Kemi Badenoch said the move was “predictable chaos from a useless government that cannot make basic decisions”. REUTERS

Switzerland To Receive the SAMP/T Air Defense System in 2029 if It Declines the Patriot

SAMP/T air defense missile systems may enter service in Switzerland as early as 2029, becoming an alternative to American Patriot systems.
France came up with this initiative after Switzerland acknowledged that delivery times from the US had become unpredictable, according to NZZ.
The Swiss Ministry of Defense emphasizes that it currently has no reliable information about the terms and dates of arrival of the American systems.
The country has been without modern long-range ground coverage since 1999, when the British Bloodhound systems were decommissioned.
Although Swiss air defense during the Cold War was considered one of the most robust in Europe, today these capabilities have been lost, and plans to restore them are in jeopardy.
Defense Ministry spokesman Robert Scheidegger notes that the Swiss side is in an information vacuum regarding contracts with Washington. The US does not provide guarantees that orders will be fulfilled within the previously specified deadlines, which effectively paralyzes the country’s defense planning.
In this context, the French proposal regarding SAMP/T is seen as a real chance to close the “hole” in the sky much faster than the expected American deliveries.

The patience and the poker face: Iran’s wily diplomat set to face the US in nuclear talks
Unknown
Unknown Publisher
2026-02-16
20:10:48 UTC
05:10:48 KST

If the US and Iran are to avoid a regional war, both sides need to start to make concessions at talks in Geneva on Tuesday, and also to accommodate one another’s very different bargaining styles.
The Iranian foreign minister Abbas Araghchi, steeped in almost 15 years of Iranian nuclear talks, is a near lifelong diplomat who has written a book on the art of negotiations that reveals the secrets of the Iranian diplomatic trade – the feints, the patience, the poker faces.
He has a bachelor’s degree from Iran’s faculty of international relations, a master’s degree in political science from Islamic Azad University and a doctorate in political thought from the University of Kent in the UK.
Donald Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff studied law at Hofstra, a university on Long Island near New York, before making his fortune in property development.
While Araghchi, much more a consensus figure inside Iranian politics than his famous predecessor Javad Zarif, will have gameplanned the parameters of what Iran can offer in endless consultations across the spectrum of government, including the supreme leader Ali Khamenei, Witkoff works to a shifting brief devised by one man.
Trump sees diplomacy as a branch of pro-wrestling. The Iranian foreign ministry regards it as a branch of chess, almost an art form.
Indeed, for those in the US who claim Iran loves to play for time and spin a negotiation out, Araghchi’s book, The Power of Negotiation, provides some support.
“The main principle of bargaining is practice: repetition, repetition, and repetition – combined with steadfastness and persistence. Insisting on positions and repeating demands is a necessity that must be done each time with different rhetoric and reasoning,” he writes.
Born into a family of merchants – his grandfather was a carpet trader – he argues Iranian diplomacy reflects the country’s bazaars.
“The Iranian negotiation style is generally known in the world as the ‘market style’, which means continuous and tireless bargaining. It requires a lot of time and energy, and he who gets tired and bored quickly will lose.”
More theoretically, he argues in the book – written when out of office in 2014 – that when a negotiator enters the room, their true power rests on the level of national cohesion back home and the country’s military strength.
If there is not at least a balance of power with your adversary, he argues it is best to decline talks until there is equilibrium, something Iran did after the bombing of its nuclear sites in June last year.
Nevertheless, the Iranian tendency to say “Yes, but” can go far. Famously, Araghchi reduced his US counterpart Wendy Sherman to tears of frustration – something he regrets.
Araghchi, who has already had six rounds of direct and indirect talks in two phases with Witkoff also discloses how vital it is to remain opaque.
“The face of a skilled diplomat is inscrutable, and it is impossible to catch any emotion from it. The ability to control the expression of emotions on the face is not easy and requires continuous work and practice.”
Providing your adversary with a graceful way out, he argues, is integral to diplomacy, describing this as providing “the Golden Bridge”, a term he has picked up from China (Araghchi spent four years as ambassador to Japan).
This suggests that if Trump ends up accepting a version of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal from which he walked out in 2018, Araghchi will not be triumphalist. “Diplomacy is not a game that you must necessarily win, but a process where you must necessarily understand the other side,” he writes.
Married twice, and with five children, Araghchi is a veteran of the Iran-Iraq war and maintains close relations with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps IRGC, unlike his predecessor, Zarif, who criticised the elite forces’ power.
“Araghchi is much more technocratic and careful in walking the tightrope necessary to survive,” said Ellie Geranmayeh from the European Council on Foreign Relations. “Zarif was more political and outspoken, and willing to test the boundaries of what was digestible for the regime.”
Indeed, some thought Araghchi was put in the nuclear talks with Washington by Iranian conservatives to act as a check and balance on Zarif.
Geranmayeh expects the US to make clear demands on diluting, or removing Iran’s stockpile of highly enriched uranium, but such an irreversible step by Iran would require parallel irreversible steps by the US, such as releasing many of Iran’s large assets frozen abroad.
The scope for a compromise on enrichment exists on the basis that the bombing of its nuclear sites makes it impossible to enrich for 3 to 5 years. But this would require the return of the UN nuclear inspectorate, the IAEA, to be able to visit the bombed sites, an issue that was probably at the centre of talks on Monday between Araghchi and Rafael Grossi, the IAEA director general.
Outside the nuclear aspects of the deal, Geranmayeh says: “In this Trumpian world, do not expect every agreement to be written down on paper. There could be a series of not verifiable understandings, including a non-aggression pact between Iran and the US and its allies.”
Ali Ansari, professor of modern history at the University of St Andrews, said Iran may offer concessions “to keep the discussions going, but Trump is in no rush at present anyway”.
Bringing in US oil companies – an economic concession that has been floated – would be a significant change in Iran’s anti-US revolutionary doctrine.
Either way, Araghchi knows that whatever the outcome, he faces domestic criticism.
Araghchi recalled once meeting with Zarif in the lift of Hassan Rouhani’s residence after the latter’s 2013 presidential election victory. At the time, Zarif had not yet accepted Rouhani’s offer to serve as his foreign minister. Araghchi asked him why. Zarif replied: ‘In the end, we’ll be found wanting, and we will be the victims.”

Man faces terrorism charges for plot against Taylor Swift’s Eras show
A 21-year-old man has been charged in Austria for allegedly planning an attack on a Taylor Swift concert scheduled for Vienna in 2024.
Prosecutors state the defendant declared allegiance to the Islamic State group, sharing propaganda and obtaining instructions to build a shrapnel bomb, of which he produced a small amount.
The man also reportedly made several attempts to illegally acquire and import weapons into Austria.
The suspect, identified by Austrian media as Beran A., was arrested in August 2024 and remains in custody.
Austrian authorities cancelled the planned concerts in August 2024 after the plot was foiled, with intelligence provided by the United States.

What we know about the IS-linked families who want to return to Australia

The question of whether — and how — to help the Australian families of Islamic State fighters return home has been one that governments have grappled with for years.
Despite pressure from aid agencies and some politicians in Australia, successive governments have been reluctant to facilitate their return.
Citing safety issues in and around the camps, and security concerns back home, Australia has made limited progress in clearing a passage for the Australian women and their children.
Now, these families are attempting to make their own way to the Syrian capital, Damascus, to begin the long journey home.
A group of 11 families left the Al-Roj camp in north-eastern Syria on Monday but were forced to turn back shortly afterwards.
And while it's unclear when they will attempt to leave again, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has warned they will get no help from the Australian government.
Who are they?
The group comprises 34 Australians, and local reports suggest there are 11 women and 23 children in the convoy.
Most — if not all — of the women were married to Islamic State group (IS) fighters who were captured or killed when Kurdish forces, backed by the United States, helped to defeat IS in 2019.
Some of the Australian children who have been detained in Syrian camps were brought there, but others were born in Syria.
The women are not currently accused of any crimes in Syria, but the Australian government says they will face close scrutiny from police and intelligence agencies if they return.
Where have they been living?
Australian families of IS fighters are known to have lived in two camps in north-eastern Syria, Al-Hawl and Al-Roj.
The UN says most of the people in the larger Al-Hawl camp, which was captured by advancing Syrian forces, have now left and that Syria plans to relocate those who remain.
It's not clear if any Australians still live in Al-Hawl.
The women and children now trying to leave Syria have been living in Al-Roj camp, which is still controlled by the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF).
It is home to more than 2,000 people of dozens of nationalities.
Amnesty International says the conditions in the camp are dangerous, with inadequate access to food, water and health care.
How many Australians have already left?
In 2019, the Morrison government — working with an aid agency — completed the repatriation of eight Australian orphans from Syrian camps, including the children of Islamic State fighter Khaled Sharrouf.
At the time, Mr Morrison said it was "despicable" that their parents had put them in harm's way.
"However, children should not be punished for the crimes of their parents," he said.
"Repatriating these children was not a decision the Australian government made lightly.
"As I have said repeatedly, my government would not allow any Australian to be put at risk."
In 2022, the Australian government repatriated four Australian women and their 13 children from a Syrian camp.
Then-home affairs minister Clare O'Neil said the government sought intelligence advice prior to that operation.
"The decision to repatriate these women and their children was informed by individual assessments following detailed work by national security agencies," she said in 2022.
Last year, six women and children escaped Syria without Australian government assistance and made it to Beirut, where they were issued Australian passports.
They have since returned to Australia.
Will the government help this group home?
In a statement issued late on Monday, a government spokesperson said it "will not repatriate people from Syria".
"People in this cohort need to know that if they have committed a crime and if they return to Australia they will be met with the full force of the law,"it said.
That aligns with Foreign Minister Penny Wong's evidence to a Senate estimates hearing last week, when she said no repatriation operations were being planned.
However, she also anticipated some of the Australians in Syria would try to make their own way back, without the government helping to coordinate logistics.
"Australians in these situations may seek to return, in what we've described as a self-managed return," she told a Senate estimates hearing.
When Liberal senator Sarah Henderson asked her to guarantee no "ISIS brides" would be granted passports, she said Australia had certain obligations.
"Australian citizens have various entitlements which are not discretionary under law and no government is able to make them discretionary," Senator Wong said.
However, she said the government had the option of applying temporary exclusion orders (TEOs) to people returning from Syria.
TEOs allow the government to block Australians aged 14 and above from entering Australia without a permit if they are deemed to be a national security threat.
The minister for home affairs can apply conditions to such permits, like requiring the subjects to notify authorities about their movements and communications.
"Our first priority is to keep the Australian community safe," Senator Wong said.
Who is helping the Australians try to leave?
It is not clear who is coordinating the extraction efforts on the ground, or who will fund the group's transport to Australia once they reach Damascus.
Save the Children has long campaigned for the Australian government to repatriate the families from Syria.
In 2023, it took the Albanese government to the Federal Court on behalf of 20 children and 11 women who wanted to come to Australia.
That case was unsuccessful and, in 2024, the High Court refused the charity special leave to appeal.
Despite its long-term advocacy, Save the Children says it hasn't been involved in any operation to extract the Australians.
"Save the Children does not fund or conduct repatriations, nor do we ever intend to play such a role," CEO Matt Tinkler said.
"These reports, if true, underscore what national security experts have repeatedly said: that the unmanaged return of Australian citizens would inevitably happen in the absence of federal government action to repatriate them."
He said Australians should never be left without a safe or viable way home.
"These innocent children have already lost years of their childhood, and deserve the chance to rebuild their lives in safety at home, and to reintegrate into the Australian way of life."

Robert Duvall, Oscar-winning actor and star of The Godfather, dies aged 95
The legendary US actor was nominated for seven Oscars and won for his role as a washed-up country singer in Tender Mercies.
Oscar-winning actor Robert Duvall, best known for his work in The Godfather and Apocalypse Now, has died aged 95, his wife has announced in a Facebook post.
“For each of his many roles, Bob gave everything to his characters and to the truth of the human spirit they represented,” Luciana Duvall said in a statement on Monday.
Duvall was best known for playing forceful roles such as his depiction of Tom Hagen, consigliere to the Corleone Mafia family in The Godfather.
He also played Lieutenant Colonel Bull Meechum in The Great Santini and the title character in Stalin, as well as broken-down and fallen characters in Tender Mercies and The Apostle.
Tributes have poured in for the Hollywood great. Former co-star Adam Sandler said Duvall was “one of the greatest actors we have ever had”, whilst Sopranos star Michael Imperioli paid tribute to “one of the best ever”, who was “an actor’s actor”.
Duvall, the son of a US Navy admiral and an amateur actress, grew up in Annapolis, Maryland in the United States. After graduating from Principia College in Illinois and serving in the US Army, he moved to New York City, where he roomed with Dustin Hoffman and befriended Gene Hackman when the three were struggling acting students.
After working on a variety of television shows, Duvall made a strong impression in his first forays onto the big screen, such as his first movie part as the mysterious recluse Boo Radley in To Kill a Mockingbird.
Duvall got the part at the suggestion of the film’s screenwriter, Horton Foote, who had liked Duvall’s work in one of his plays. Foote later wrote Tender Mercies, a 1983 film for which Duvall won the Academy Award for best actor as a washed-up country singer.
Duvall was nominated for another six Oscars, including for his work in Frances Ford Coppola’s 1979 Vietnam epic Apocalypse Now. Duvall played the off-kilter, surfing-obsessed Lieutenant Colonel Bill Kilgore.
The character’s famous line, “I love the smell of napalm in the morning”, became legendary.
In all, Duvall appeared in almost 100 movies. And when he grew weary of Hollywood, he made his own films. He wrote, directed and won an Oscar acting nomination for The Apostle, the story of a conflicted preacher.
Duvall did the same with Assassination Tango, a movie that allowed him to exhibit his passion for the tango and Argentina, where he met his fourth wife, Luciana Pedraza.
In later life, Duvall split his time between Los Angeles, Argentina and a farm in Virginia, where he converted the barn into a tango dance hall.

TBILISI, February 16. /TASS/. Representatives of the Georgian government and opposition are holding the first-ever televised debates on the country’s potential membership in the European Union.
The debates, aired live by the Rustavi 2 television channel, were initiated by Vakhtang Shakarisjvili, leader of the United Neutral Georgia party, which claims that European integration presents a danger to the nation. The party insists that there will be no peace inside the country until it drops the idea of joining the European Union and NATO.
The ruling Georgian Dream - Democratic Georgia party is represented by leader of its parliamentary faction Irakli Kirtskhalia. The ruling party insists that the course toward European and Euro-Atlantic integration is committed to paper in the country’s constitution and cannot be revised.
Taking part in the debates are also Georgy Khaindrava, a film director and former minister of state for conflict settlement, German Sabo of the Girchi opposition party, Guram Macharashvili, a lawmaker with the opposition People’s Power party, and other politicians.
Georgia’s constitution of 2017 has a provision on the need for taking all necessary measures to ensure the country’s full-fledged integration into the European Union and NATO.

Federal politics: Ley backers demoted from shadow cabinet as Taylor unveils new front bench — as it happened
Opposition Leader Angus Taylor has unveiled his new-look front bench, promoting key allies and relegating backers of deposed Liberal leader Sussan Ley.

Paul Scarr issues statement after being dumped from frontbench
Paul Scarr, who was dumped from the frontbench following the leadership spill, has wished his successor well in his former positions.
The Queensland senator was shadow minister for immigration, citizenship and multicultural affairs under Sussan Ley's leadership.
In a statement, Scarr thanked the groups he dealt with during his time as shadow minister, and congratulated Angus Taylor on his appointment as leader.
"To the many stakeholders and community leaders I have met over the last nine months, thank you for sharing your knowledge and insights. It is deeply appreciated," Scarr says.
"It has been a privilege to engage with you. I have been inspired by the work that you do, especially for the people in need," he says.
Leeser returns to Indigenous Affairs portfolio
Opposition Leader Angus Taylor has reshuffled the position of Shadow Minister for Indigenous Australians, replacing Arrernte senator Kerryanne Liddle with Julian Leeser.
Leeser was shadow attorney-general and shadow minister for Indigenous Australians in 2022.
He quit the frontbench in April 2023 over the Liberal Party's opposition to an Indigenous Voice to Parliament, allowing him to campaign for the 'Yes' vote.
Jacinta Nampijinpa Price was then appointed to the role and was a leading figure in the Coalition's 'No' campaign.
Taylor said Leeser would work closely with Senators Jacinta Nampijinpa Price and Matt O'Sullivan.
Analysis: Angus Taylor wants 'healthy competition' to lift shadow ministry team
As expected, Angus Taylor has used his first shadow ministry to reward supporters at the expense of Sussan Ley's lieutenants, but his shakeup came with a warning.
In thanking the ousted frontbenchers for their work, Taylor also noted "healthy competition" would lift his whole team.
Shadow ministry inertia both this term and last was a huge source of tension among Liberals unhappy with their lot.
Many MPs have harked back for the days where the party room was a rather larger and the threat of a reshuffle served as a motivator to do the work or get booted to the back bench.
Another challenge for Taylor's recent appointees will include a newfound appreciation for the realities of shadow ministry solidarity.
Several Liberals bumped into assistant roles were key agitators during Ley's reign, but will now have to adjust to the limitations on public commentary that is supposed to come with being inside the tent.
It'll be up to Taylor whether he opts to enforce discipline or follows through with moving poor performers out of the shadow ministry.
His leadership could well depend on those decisions.
Shadow ministers react to appointments
The reaction from newly appointed shadow ministers is coming in thick and fast following Angus Taylor's shadow cabinet announcement.
Newly appointed Shadow Defence Minister James Paterson says he's "honoured" to be appointed to the role, and will push to lift defence spending.
Shadow Attorney-General Michaelia Cash has thanked Taylor for his confidence in her, and says the portfolio "holds a very special place" for her.
Maria Kovacic, the newly appointed shadow minister for productivity and deregulation, says she will tackle productivity in her new role.
Reappointed Shadow Home Affairs Minister Jonno Duniam has thanked Taylor for his confidence in him, and says he'll focus on border protection and social cohesion.
Andrew Bragg, who will be continuing in his role as shadow housing minister, says he's "pleased" to continue serving in the position.
Shadow Social Services Minister Melissa McIntosh says she'll be focused on lifting participation and reducing long-term unemployment in her new role.
Angus Taylor unveils shadow ministry
Angus Taylor has elevated a new generation of right-faction Liberals into his new-look shadow ministry and reinstated the suspended Nationals to the Coalition front bench.
The federal opposition leader unveiled his senior team on Tuesday afternoon in Sydney, confirming the promotion of prominent figures like West Australian MP Andrew Hastie and Northern Territory senator Jacinta Nampijinpa Price.
Read the full story from chief digital political correspondent Clare Armstrong in the link below.
Who's been dumped?
We're wading through the shadow cabinet list and noticing a few names missing — mostly supporters of Ley.
Among those sent to the backbench are Alex Hawke, Andrew Wallace, Paul Scarr, Melissa Price and Scott Bucholz.
James McGrath was also dumped from the shadow cabinet but will keep a job in the outer ministry.
It's the same story for Angie Bell and Kerryanne Liddle.
Anne Ruston has retained her shadow health portfolio but lost NDIS and sport.
Taylor keen to see more women in Liberal ranks, but maintains opposition to quotas
Finally, Angus Taylor has been asked whether he would support introducing gender quotas to boost the number of women in the Liberal Party's ranks.
The opposition leader has sidestepped that question and says he wants to see more women in Liberal Party branches and in the parliamentary party.
But he says he doesn't believe in gender quotas.
"The job of all of us is to encourage great women to do that. I can understand the reticence in the past but we have to change that, that's our job and that is how we fix the problem," Taylor says.
And that's the end of that press conference!
Liberal leader says 'it's time to move on' from Nampijinpa Price's comments on migration
Angus Taylor has defended Shadow Skills Minister Jacinta Nampijinpa Price's elevation back into the shadow ministry.
Asked if her previous comments on migrants could clash with her work, given migrants play a large role in that space, Taylor has deflected and says Nampijinpa Price is passionate about small businesses.
"She is passionate about small business and we all are as Liberals, we believe the best way to have a strong community is to have strong businesses in the community," Taylor says.
"They employ and deliver services and goods to customers. They are the very essence of a strong community and a strong country in Australia," he says.
But pressed on whether Nampijinpa Price should apologise for her comments on Indian migration, Taylor says "it's time to move on".
Taylor responds to Hanson's comments about Muslims
Angus Taylor has been asked about comments on a Sky News interview from Pauline Hanson taking aim at Muslims.
In the interview, the One Nation leader reportedly said she didn't know a good Muslim.
The opposition leader says he knows many good Muslims, some who reside in his electorate of Hume in New South Wales.
"I know many, and we had a wonderful man waiting for us at Werriwa next to my seat last election," Taylor says.
"People who want to come to this country who do not share the core beliefs, who don't believe in our way of life, who want to bring hate and violence from other parts of the world, will not be welcome and it doesn't matter what the race or religion," he says.
Angus Taylor says elevation of Nationals to frontbench signals 'strong reset'
Angus Taylor says bringing three Nationals who voted against official Coalition policy on hate laws back into the shadow ministry signals a "strong reset" with the country party.
Former opposition leader Sussan Ley accepted the resignations of Bridget McKenzie, Ross Cadell and Susan McDonald after they voted against Labor's hate laws.
The resignations triggered the second Coalition split in under 12 months.
The opposition leader says the leadership of both parties have agreed to "get on with it".
He says he's spoken to Nationals leader David Littleproud "many times" over the recent days.
"It's time to get on with it and get back to the unified Coalition we know has been such a strength for our side of politics and such a strength for this nation," Taylor says.
Asked if they've signed a new Coalition agreement, Taylor says "over time" the parties will align and fight for Australians.
Hume wants Liberal Party's policies to reflect Australians' 'hopes and dreams'
Deputy Liberal leader Jane Hume has been asked whether her colleagues have listened to a review she conducted into her party's 2022 election loss.
Hume's review of the federal election loss to Labor found the party was not popular with women and multicultural communities.
The deputy leader says those recommendations have been adopted, but they are not "easily implemented overnight".
"We have a lot of work to do as a team to make sure we have a policy platform and positions that reflect the hopes and aspirations and dreams of all Australians, not just sectional interest," Hume says.
"We want to make sure our policies and our positions reflect their hopes and dreams," she says.
Funding boost to intelligence agencies flagged by Taylor
Angus Taylor has flagged that he'd be willing to boost the resourcing to intelligence agencies to screen people coming to Australia more closely.
The opposition leader says there are people who want to come to Australia who don't believe in Australia's way of life.
"That has got to stop," Taylor says.
Taylor says leaked draft immigration policy wasn't put through shadow cabinet
Angus Taylor on 7.30 last night distanced himself from a draft opposition immigration policy that would prevent people from some countries from migrating to Australia.
The opposition leader says the plan wasn't put through shadow cabinet and that he's not sure what the source of that plan was.
"I tell you what my plan will be to raise standards, reduce numbers and make sure the door is shut to people who do not share the core beliefs of Australians," Taylor says.
Taylor says he wants economic growth to exceed government spending
The opposition leader and shadow treasurer have been asked whether they'll be focused on reducing bureaucracy as a share of the economy and job market.
Angus Taylor says he wants to ensure growth of the economy exceeds growth of government spending.
"Under Labor what we are seeing is an economy not growing in any meaningful way, and government spending that is growing at a rapid rate," Taylor says.
Shadow Treasurer Tim Wilson says the opposition is opposed to any changes to the capital gains tax discount on investment properties.
He says it will harm investment and won't create any more homes.
Taylor says immigration policy will ensure 'door is shut' to hate and violence
Angus Taylor has been asked when he'll be releasing the Coalition immigration policy.
The opposition leader says the Coalition has already been releasing its priorities since being elevated to the leadership role.
He says any future policy will ensure the "door is shut" to people who bring hate and violence to Australia.
"It is about restoring Australians standard of living but also about detecting our way of life and immigration," Taylor says.
Chandler says she'll focus on fiscal discipline in finance portfolio
And new Shadow Finance Minister Claire Chandler says she'll be focusing on fiscal responsibility in her portfolio.
The shadow minister says the government has abandoned fiscal discipline during its time in government.
"Fiscal responsibility is one of the fundamental principles of the Liberal Party, in fact it is one of the reasons I joined the Liberal Party, because I believe in a small government that within its means and spends money wisely," Chandler says.
Tim Wilson says Liberals will chart a 'pathway forward'
Newly-minted Shadow Treasurer Tim Wilson has started by pointing out the cost-of-living crisis impacting people around the country.
The shadow minister says the government is responsible for the issue impacting families and small businesses.
"We're going to do everything we can over the next two years ... so that you see the pathway forward and that you want to see a change of government," Wilson says.
"The pathway forward for achieving economic hope in Australia is a change of government and the end of the Albanese government. We are going to deliver that," he says.
Shadow cabinet the 'right people' to take Liberals to the next election, Hume says
Deputy Liberal Leader Jane Hume says she's extraordinarily honoured to take on the employment and industrial relations portfolio.
She says her shadow cabinet colleagues have a depth of experience in both the government and private sectors.
"I know they are very much the right people that we put together to hold this terrible government to account but also to develop those policies and those platforms in those positions that will take to the next election," Hume says.
Nationals senators who voted against hate laws elevated back into shadow cabinet
Tony Pasin, Garth Hamilton, Leah Blyth, Aaron Violi, Simon Kennedy, will also be elevated to the Coalition frontbench.
The Nationals frontbenchers who voted against the Coalition's official position on hate laws have been elevated back into shadow cabinet.
A condition of the Nationals rejoining the Liberals was that the shadow ministers who voted against Labor's hate laws sit out of shadow cabinet for six weeks.
That doesn't seem to be the case now. Bridget McKenzie, Susan McDonald and Ross Cadell have been elevated back into shadow cabinet.
"This is a team prioritises and restores Australia's standard of living, and protect its way of life," Taylor says.

US military airlifts a nuclear reactor across three states after Trump pushes for more of the energy source
The ‘next-generation’ reactor could potentially power up to 5,000 homes, the Pentagon announced
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
The U.S. military has successfully transported a small nuclear reactor by air, advancing the Trump administration’s plan to deploy the energy source across the nation.
The “next-generation” Valar Atomics Ward 250 nuclear reactor — comparable in size to a large truck — was loaded onto a C-17 transport plane at the March Air Reserve Base in California on Sunday.
It was then flown about 700 miles to the Hill Air Force Base in Utah. It will eventually be sent to an energy lab in the state for evaluation and testing, the Pentagon announced.
The compact, 5-megawatt reactor could potentially power up to 5,000 homes or ensure reliable and secure energy for a military base.
The reactor’s flight aligns with President Donald Trump's plan to modernize America's nuclear power infrastructure — a goal bolstered by a series of executive orders he signed in May.
“It is the policy of the United States to expedite and promote to the fullest possible extent the production and operation of nuclear energy to provide affordable, reliable, safe, and secure energy to the American people,” one of the orders states.
Michael Duffy, the undersecretary of defense for acquisition and sustainment, lauded the operation — which was jointly carried out by the Defense and Energy Departments.
“Powering next generation warfare will require us to move faster than our adversaries, to build a system that doesn't just equip our warfighters to fight, but equips them to win at extraordinary speed,” Duffey said. “Today is a monumental step toward building that system. By supporting the industrial base and its capacity to innovate, we accelerate the delivery of resilient power to where it's needed.”
Secretary of Energy Chris Wright added that the administration’s goal is to have a trio of small reactors online by July 4.
"The American nuclear renaissance is to get that ball moving again, fast, carefully, but with private capital, American innovation and determination," Wright said.
Currently, there are 94 operable nuclear reactors in the U.S., which generate about 20 percent of the country’s electricity, according to the World Nuclear Association.
Polls show that the American public is broadly on board with nuclear power in spite of several major accidents throughout the past decades.
According to a Gallup survey conducted last year, 61 percent of Americans favor using nuclear energy, marking a near-record high. Republicans were significantly more likely to support nuclear energy than Democrats.

Pro-Assad singer killed in shootout with Syrian security forces

Syrian singer Jamal Assaf, a staunch supporter of ousted president Bashar Assad who was known for praising his forces and was sometimes referred to as “Assad’s singer,” was killed over the weekend in an exchange of fire with security forces of Syria’s new government led by Ahmad al-Sharaa.
After reports of Assaf’s death circulated overnight between Saturday and Sunday, Syria’s Interior Ministry issued an official statement Sunday afternoon saying Assaf was part of a smuggling network targeted by government forces and was killed during the operation.
According to authorities in Damascus, internal security forces had been tracking the smuggling ring and launched a raid at a location in the al-Fardous neighborhood of Aleppo where one of its members was believed to be staying. That individual was later identified as Assaf.
The Interior Ministry said that during the raid, the wanted suspect opened fire on security forces, who returned fire at the source of the shooting and “neutralized” him. One member of the Syrian security forces was seriously wounded in the operation.
During Assad’s rule, Assaf gained prominence for inflammatory rhetoric against the former president’s opponents. He publicly called for the use of military force against cities where rebels were active and urged attacks on Idlib, a major rebel stronghold in northwestern Syria, including the use of so-called barrel bombs, improvised explosives dropped from aircraft that became a hallmark of the conflict.
According to SyriaTV, Assaf on several occasions boasted that he had taken part in fighting alongside Assad’s forces. The channel cited two of his songs, “Your Revolution Is a Revolution of Thugs” and “Idlib Will Pay the Price,” as examples of his pro-government messaging.
Some reports said that after Assad’s government fell, Assaf attempted to portray himself as having changed his position and claimed to support the uprising that led to Assad’s removal, though few appeared convinced by the shift.

India seizes three Iran-linked US-sanctioned tankers
India has seized three US-sanctioned oil tankers linked to Iran this month and stepped up surveillance in its maritime zone to curb illicit trade, Reuters news agency reported on Monday, confirming a post on X by Indian authorities earlier in February that had been deleted.
India aims to prevent its waters from being used for ship-to-ship transfers that obscure the origin of oil cargoes, Reuters reports, citing a source with direct knowledge of the matter.
The seizures and heightened surveillance follow an improvement in US-India relations. Washington earlier this month announced it will cut import tariffs on Indian goods to 18% from 50%, after New Delhi agreed to stop Russian oil imports.
The three sanctioned vessels - Stellar Ruby, Asphalt Star and Al Jafzia - frequently changed their identities to evade law enforcement by coastal states, the source said, adding that their owners were based overseas.
VESSELS SEIZED OFFSHORE MUMBAI
Iranian state media cited the National Iranian Oil Company as saying that the three tankers seized by India had no connection to the company. It said that neither the cargoes nor the vessels were linked to the company.
Indian authorities had said in a post on X on February 6 that they intercepted three vessels about 100 nautical miles west of Mumbai after detecting suspicious activity involving a tanker in India's exclusive economic zone.
The post was later deleted, but the source confirmed that the vessels had been escorted to Mumbai for further investigation.
The Indian Coast Guard has since deployed about 55 ships and between 10 and 12 aircraft for round-the-clock surveillance in its maritime zones, according to the source.
The U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control said last year it had sanctioned three vessels, called Global Peace, Chil 1, and Glory Star 1, with IMO numbers identical to the ships lately captured by India.
Two of the three tankers are linked to Iran, with Al Jafzia having carried fuel oil from Iran to Djibouti in 2025 and Stellar Ruby flagged in Iran, according to LSEG data.
The Asphalt Star mostly operated on voyages around China, the data show.
Sanctioned oil and fuel are often sold at deep discounts due to the risks involved, with intermediaries moving cargo through complex ownership structures, false documentation and mid-sea transfers that complicate enforcement.

Remains of legendary ‘guerrilla priest’ identified decades later
The search unit used public and classified records to locate his remains

The Colombian state entity tasked with finding and identifying more than 135,000 people who have disappeared during the country's six decades of civil conflict announced on Monday the identification of Camilo Torres' remains.
Torres was a Catholic priest famous for his membership in the National Liberation Army (ELN) rebel group and was killed in combat in the 1960s.
The Search Unit for Disappeared People (UBPD) was created by a 2016 peace deal between the government and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) guerrilla group.
Its role is to take charge of archival and forensic efforts to find disappeared people, including those forcibly disappeared by right-wing paramilitaries, rebel groups and state security forces, those forced to join armed groups, soldiers missing in action and others.
The ELN, founded in 1964, remains active and is itself accused of forced disappearances.
It has held sporadic peace talks with various governments and said in December it was willing to resume negotiations.
Torres, son of a well-connected Bogota family, was an adherent of liberation theology, a Catholic, anti-imperialist social justice movement.
He joined the ELN some four months before his death and was killed in February 1966 in eastern Santander province in a skirmish with the army.
UBPD Director Luz Janeth Forero told journalists the search unit used public and classified records, including from the military justice system, to find where Torres' remains had been interred by the military after his death.
DNA samples from bones found in 2024 in the military section of a cemetery in Bucaramanga were compared with a sample taken from the remains of Torres' father Calisto, which were exhumed for testing from a cemetery in Bogota.
"After 60 years of disappearance, the search unit found, identified and completed a dignified handover of Father Camilo Torres," Forero said.
The unit, which began work in 2017, has found nearly 5,000 remains, identifying and handing over some 700 to loved ones so far, Forero added. It has also found 500 living people who were reported as disappeared.
Torres' remains were handed over to Javier Giraldo, a Catholic priest well-known for his activism on behalf of conflict victims, on Sunday, the 60th anniversary of Torres' death, Forero said.
Giraldo, who recognised the efforts of Torres' mother Isabel Restrepo to find her son while she was alive, said Torres will be buried at Bogota's National University, where he studied and worked as a chaplain.
Though the Catholic Church has historically rejected Torres' involvement with the ELN, there is now more openness to discussing his legacy as a chaplain, activist and social justice thinker, Giraldo added.

‘A European Moment:’ E.U. Leaders Push Back Against U.S. ‘Civilizational Erasure’ Claim

E.U. leaders are pushing for increased European sovereignty in the midst of frayed relations with the United States.
“We want to cut through knots, we want to find solutions always with the goal of strengthening Europe's sovereignty and making Europe strong. This is a very European moment,” said German Finance Minister Lars Klingbeil on Monday.
“I believe what happened at the beginning of the year with Greenland, woke up everyone who cares about Europe, and it is leading to the fact that we are not getting bogged down in national interests or hiding behind them, but ready to make compromises," he continued, referencing President Donald Trump’s push to acquire Greenland, which saw him briefly threaten to tariff European countries who opposed his efforts.
Klingbeil made the comments before a meeting of E.U. finance ministers in Brussels, according to Reuters.
His encouragement towards Europe’s self-reliance comes after Kaja Kallas, the European Commission's high representative for foreign affairs, hit back at remarks made by the U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio at the Munich Security Conference over the weekend.
In her own address on Sunday, Kallas told the audience: “Contrary to what some may say—woke, decadent Europe is not facing civilizational erasure.”
“In fact, people still want to join our club. And not just fellow Europeans. When I was in Canada last year I was told that over 40% of Canadians have an interest in joining the E.U.,” she claimed. “The waiting list is getting long. I just hope those who have been waiting for quite some time would not have to wait for longer.”
“Those who are already members want their union to take a stronger role in the world: To defend our values. To take care of our people. To push humanity forwards,” she said, later adding that “European bashing” is currently “very in fashion.”
Kallas’ remarks appeared to be in response to Rubio’s speech from the day before, during which he said the U.S. will always be “a child of Europe,” but also issued a warning about perceived incoming threats.
He claimed that “acting together” will “restore to us a clearer sense of ourselves. It will restore a place in the world, and in so doing, it will rebuke and deter the forces of civilizational erasure that today menace both America and Europe alike.”
The notion of “civilizational erasure” in Europe was also put forward in a U.S. national security strategy report in November, which claimed that policy decisions, including those on migration, from E.U. nations was having a detrimental impact.
European policies are “creating strife, censorship of free speech and suppression of political opposition, cratering birthrates, and loss of national identities and self-confidence,” the report claimed.
In Munich, although Rubio offered a more conciliatory tone in comparison to Vice President J.D. Vance’s speech from last year’s conference, he repeatedly warned of the dangers of “mass migration” and said “we must gain control of our national borders.”
“If at times we disagree, our disagreements come from our profound sense of concern about a Europe with which we are connected—not just economically, not just militarily. We are connected spiritually and we are connected culturally. We want Europe to be strong,” said Rubio, encouraging a united approach moving forward.
European leaders, meanwhile, expressed concern over transatlantic relations throughout the conference.
Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen expressed her belief that Trump’s interest in Greenland “is not over.”
“Unfortunately I think the desire is the same… I would also add that I think the pressure on Greenland is totally unacceptable. We are talking about threats, but the people of Greenland have never been threatened before by anyone,” she said, maintaining that there are “red lines that will not be crossed,” with a solution still being discussed.
Prior to Rubio’s speech, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz warned of a “deep rift” between the U.S. and Europe.
Merz argued that the U.S. “will not be powerful enough to go it alone” in the future and urged everyone to “repair and revive transatlantic trust together.”
Referencing Vance’s address from last year’s conference, in which the Vice President targeted Europe’s idea of free speech, Merz told the Munich audience: “The culture war of the MAGA movement is not ours… Freedom of speech ends here with us when that speech goes against human dignity and the constitution. We do not believe in tariffs and protectionism, but in free trade.”

LONDON — World powers are deep in a fight over critical minerals.
It has driven Donald Trump eyeball to eyeball with NATO over the future of Greenland. Western allies are scrambling to strike deals which would freeze China out of the global minerals market it currently dominates.
But for a clutch of lawmakers in quiet Cornwall, southwest England, critical minerals play a different role. They are all about votes.

In the wake of the Munich Security Conference, we ask: what happens now? With Russia’s war on Ukraine still raging, do the grand words of Munich mean anything to those struggling to feed themselves, stay warm, or survive under Vladimir Putin’s ongoing missile and drone attacks?
On European security, tensions are rising. Germany is pressing France to increase its defence spending, with Foreign Minister Johan Wadephul essentially telling Emmanuel Macron to put his money where his mouth is. But with France facing a massive public debt crisis, finding the 5% of GDP required for NATO commitments is far from simple.
Meanwhile, US Senator Marco Rubio is visiting Budapest, delivering a message of support from President Trump to his ally Viktor Orbán — Europe’s most outspoken admirer of Putin. Rubio’s words at Munich suggested conciliation, but standing side by side with Orbán raises questions: is the gap between the US and the EU widening, just when unity is needed most for Ukraine?

NHS ’clearly failing’ to ensure children get measles vaccine, experts warn

Children are at risk of measles because the NHS is “clearly failing” to ensure they get the MMR vaccine and its system needs an urgent overhaul, MPs and health experts have warned.
Calls are growing for major reform of how MMR jabs are delivered as it emerged that vaccination rates in some parts of England are now on a par with those in Afghanistan and Malawi.
More outbreaks of measles like the one in north London are inevitable, public health specialists believe, given that fewer than 60% of five-year-olds in some places have had both the recommended doses of MMR.
In Enfield, where 60 children have recently contracted measles, of whom 15 have been hospitalised, the MMR vaccination rate is only 64.3%. That is lower than the 69.3% rate in Malawi and just above Afghanistan’s 62% rate. The World Health Organization advises a 95% rate.
The outbreak in Enfield has reignited public and medical anxiety about unvaccinated children getting measles, which can damage the brain and lungs and in some cases lead to meningitis, blindness or even death. Five “catch-up clinics” have been set up in local community centres to vaccinate children who got either one or no doses of MMR when it was offered to their parents.
NHS England has been accused of displaying “complacency” for its failure to halt a relentless decline over the last decade in the number of five-year-old children who are fully vaccinated, from 88.2% to 83.7%.
Ministers are under pressure to let pharmacies start administering MMR jabs to infants so that they can supplement the immunisation programmes that GP surgeries and schools already run.
In England, GP staff, mainly practice nurses, deliver the first and second doses of MMR to children when they are 12 and 18 months old. Schools also play a key role by hosting catch-up events at which unvaccinated and under-vaccinated pupils can get covered.
Ben Coleman, a Labour MP on the Commons health and social care select committee, said: “The long-term decline in uptake of MMR and growing number of very worrying measles outbreaks, like the one in Enfield just now, show that that system is clearly failing.
“That means that children are at risk of hospitalisation and even of dying from measles. Given that undervaccination poses real risks to public health, it’s time for the NHS to accept that GPs and schools on their own appear not to be able to provide the 95% coverage the WHO rightly insists on. Pharmacies are somewhere families often visit and they’re being wasted as a resource. We can’t afford complacency.”
A child died of measles last summer in Alder Hey children’s hospital in Liverpool amid an increase in cases in the city.
The Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, which represents specialist children’s doctors, said pharmacies should be handed a role in offering vaccines. Prof Steve Turner, its president, said the change would help “make it faster and easier for parents and guardians to get their children vaccinated”.
He said: “With appropriate training and support, enabling pharmacists to deliver MMR vaccines could be particularly helpful for families who have missed routine appointments or need to catch up on their children’s vaccinations.”
The National Pharmacy Association also backed the call. “The decade-long reduction in uptake of MMR vaccinations among children is a sign that the current system is simply not working and needs urgent reviewing by the NHS,” said Olivier Picard, the trade body’s chair. “We need to work across the whole health service to perform this vital public health role, not leave it to one small part of it.”
Helen Bedford, a vaccination expert and professor of child health at University College London, said pharmacies could help supplement existing NHS efforts to ensure better MMR uptake, especially as some schools – including some faith schools – do not take part in catch-up campaigns.
“That may be because of disruption to studies or that they don’t see it as a priority. Or it may be about [their] views about vaccination generally,” she said.
Coleman said MPs on the health committee sensed “complacency” among NHS bosses over falling MMR take-up when they gave evidence last week about trends in vaccination.
At the hearing, Dr Mary Ramsay, the UK Health Security Agency’s director of public health programmes, admitted under questioning by Coleman that opposition among GPs to pharmacies being paid to perform a role currently undertaken by family doctors made that change difficult.
The MP asked: “GPs might be annoyed if pharmacies can do it?” Ramsay replied: “That is an element.”
The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) did not indicate if pharmacies might start delivering MMR jabs. Superdrug has said it would start providing MMR jabs if asked.
Prof Andrew Pollard, the director of the Oxford Vaccine Group at Oxford University, said of the Enfield outbreak there was “a real risk of further spread both locally and in other parts of London”, since the virus could easily spread in communities where less than 95% of people were vaccinated, as is the case in many parts of London.
“When ‘enough’ people have been infected, the outbreak will die down, only to return again later when more unvaccinated children are born and the number who are susceptible has re-accumulated; there will be another explosive outbreak,” he said.
A spokesperson for the DHSC said: “It is vital for anyone not yet vaccinated against MMR to do so as soon as possible. Not only does this ensure that you are protected, but also those around you.
“To improve uptake and provide earlier protection against measles, from January children can have their second dose of MMR sooner. We’ve also introduced chickenpox protection into the childhood programme with the MMRV vaccine.
“Low vaccination rates leave communities vulnerable, and we are taking urgent action with partners across London to boost MMR uptake and safeguard children’s health.”
The government launched a campaign on Monday encouraging parents to ensure their children were up to date with all their vaccinations. It said childhood immunisations prevent about 5,000 deaths and 228,000 hospitalisations each year in England alone.

Morocco, Albania, Greece expected to join International Stabilization Force in Gaza

Morocco and Albania will join the International Stabilization Force (ISF) in Gaza, which will handle aspects of peacekeeping in Gaza during the Trump administration's Phase II of the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, The Jerusalem Post has learned.
In addition, KAN News reported on Monday night that Greece will also join the ISF.
The leaks and public announcements have been timed to coincide with Sunday's announcement that Indonesia will be the first country to join the ISF mission, and ahead of the Board of Peace summit, which is set to take place in the United States on Thursday.
On Sunday, the Associated Press additionally reported that Indonesia's contribution to the ISF will begin in April, with a primary deployment of Indonesian forces targeted for June.
The same report set the number of Indonesian soldiers to be deployed in April at 1,000 and the full June force at around 8,000, which is higher than some earlier figures the media had speculated about.
There is still no specific information on the timing of deployments for the three additional countries, but by mid-January, reports indicated that Morocco would join Indonesia as the two largest peacekeeping forces.
Morocco has maintained special defense relations with Israel since signing the Abraham Accords in 2020.
Indonesia selecting ISF soldiers
According to the AP report, aspects of Indonesia's process for selecting and clearing soldiers to join the force are underway.
However, Indonesia also said that if conditions in Gaza were not suitable for deployment when it comes to any possible conflict with Hamas, the force might postpone travel to Gaza.
In previous months, Indonesia was mentioned as a possible contributing country to the ISF, along with the United Arab Emirates, Morocco, Egypt, Italy, Azerbaijan, Pakistan, Qatar, Turkey, and others, but to date, no country has progressed past general promises to concrete readiness to send troops.
Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto will be visiting Washington for Trump's Board of Peace summit on February 19.
Neither the ISF in general, nor Indonesia in particular, is expected to seek direct confrontation with Hamas or to proactively disarm them.
Rather, they are expected to supervise current ceasefire lines and possibly handle other border-related issues.

Pentagon faces backlash after using AI model Claude for offensive measures in Maduro capture - WSJ

The US Defense Department used AI company Anthropic's Claude model during the operation to capture former Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro and his wife in Caracas last month, the Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday.
This led to disagreements between the Pentagon and Anthropic, as Claude is not meant to be used for offensive measures, per Anthropic's public usage policies.
These policies include prohibiting the model from facilitating violence, developing weapons, or conducting surveillance, per WSJ's report.
An Anthropic spokesperson said the company could not comment on whether Claude or any other model was used in any specific operation and that any development must comply with its usage policies.
Deployment of Claude occurred through Anthropic's partnership with data company Palantir Technologies, whose tools and models are used by the Pentagon.
The Pentagon then questioned its future relationship with Anthropic, with chief Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell saying that the Defense Department requires "our partners to be willing to help our warfighters win in any fight."
Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said at an event in January announcing that the Pentagon would work with xAI that the department would not "employ AI models that won't allow you to fight wars."
WSJ also reported that tensions over Anthropic’s constraints on military use have prompted officials to consider canceling a contract worth up to $200 million. The contract was awarded last summer, the report said.
WSJ added that Anthropic was the first AI model developer to be used in classified Defense Department operations, and that other tools could have been used for unclassified tasks. AI models can support activities such as summarizing documents, generating reports, and assisting with research, while the most contentious debates center on autonomous lethal uses and surveillance.
Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei has publicly called for stronger regulation and guardrails around advanced AI, the report said, putting the company at odds with officials who want fewer restrictions on wartime applications.
The Journal reported that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth previously said the Pentagon would not employ AI models that “won’t allow you to fight wars,” referencing discussions involving Anthropic.
How the US captured Nicolas Maduro
The operation to capture Maduro began with overnight US strikes across Venezuela, with multiple explosions reported in Caracas and a loss of power in parts of the capital’s southern districts, followed by a rapid assault that ended with Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, being taken into custody and flown out of the country.
Venezuelan authorities declared a national emergency and, in the immediate aftermath, senior officials said they did not know the couple’s whereabouts, while Washington said Maduro would be brought to the United States to face prosecution.
In the days that followed, the humanitarian and political fallout widened: Cuba announced that 32 of its citizens, described as members of its armed forces and intelligence services assigned to security duties, were killed during the raid and declared two days of national mourning, while Venezuelan officials later cited a death toll of roughly 100 and said both Maduro and Flores were injured during the operation, as competing accounts continued to emerge over casualties, damage, and the scope of the strikes.

Fertility patients win high court battle to save embryos after consent error

More than a dozen fertility patients have won a high court battle to save their embryos, eggs and sperm from destruction after errors meant they did not renew consent to store them within the 10-year window required by law.
Ruling that the material could be kept, the judge said they should not “have the possibility of parenthood … removed by the ticking of a clock”.
Lawyers for 15 groups affected by the errors – some of them former cancer patients – asked the court in London to declare it would be lawful for the embryos or cells to remain in storage, despite the consent expiring in June last year. In some cases this was because fertility clinics failed to notify those affected.
In an unusual situation, the move was unopposed, with no objections from the clinics, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority or the health secretary.
Mrs Justice Morgan ruled that it would be lawful in 14 of the 15 cases for the material to continue to be stored and used. She said laws around human fertilisation and embryology were “unbending” but “the rigidity of the scheme is not rigidity for its own sake”.
She continued: “It is surely consent that is important, not consent by an immutable date. I find it hard to conclude that parliament intended the possibility of parenthood should be removed by the ticking of a clock, not in the cliched phrase, the ticking of the biological clock, but by the ticking of the clock beyond midnight of the day when existing consent expires, whatever might be the circumstances.”
Under the law, fertility clinics need written consent from clients every decade to continue storing biological material. The rules are intended to prevent cells being kept or used without people’s knowledge or permission.
Owing to delays and issues accessing fertility treatment during the pandemic, the law allowed for a two-year extension, meaning people using the service on 1 July 2020 were granted extra time.
Confusion caused by the extension meant some clinic users were not notified when they needed to renew consent, so it lapsed.
In the one case where the judge ruled against, the circumstances were legally different. Morgan said the pair involved had not originally consented to an embryo being stored but one had been retained accidentally and they now wished to use it.
She said: “There was never, on their case, a consent to renew. To be permitted to take advantage of the storage of the embryo which they say ‘contradicted’ their express wishes because the clinic acted on the wrong consent form to change their mind is not in my judgment renewing consent. It is a change of consent.”

Finance Minister Smotrich says he won't educate his daughter to enlist in the IDF

Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich does not want his daughter to serve in the IDF, he said Monday.
“I will educate my daughter not to enlist in the army,” the chairman of the Religious Zionist Party (RZP) said during his party’s press conference in the Knesset.
“I respect anyone who thinks differently from me. This is the ruling of my rabbis, and I hope the liberals will respect my position. Mixing men and women in tanks is, in my view, delusional.”
Smotrich also discussed efforts to lower the cost of living in Israel and combat monopolies to strengthen the economy.
The controversial haredi conscription bill
In recent months, the government has been fast-tracking a controversial haredi (ultra-Orthodox) conscription bill. A haredi protest in Bnei Brak on Sunday against serving in the IDF turned violent. Two female soldiers were attacked by a haredi mob before being rescued by police.
“We cannot continue like this,” Smotrich said. “We must, simply must, pass a draft law that will truly lead to the enlistment of our haredi brothers and their integration into bearing the burden of security and national existence.”
Critics of the draft bill say its current version fails to enforce haredi conscription and instead aims to appease the haredi parties in the Knesset.
The IDF has repeatedly said there is an urgent need for additional manpower, especially after more than two years of war.
Smotrich has not said whether he would support the bill in its current form. His indirect stance, however, has led to speculation that he might vote in favor.
Developments with the haredi draft bill have also become intertwined with the government’s passage of the 2026 state budget. The haredi parties have threatened to vote against the budget unless progress is made on the draft bill.
Smotrich said the draft bill and the state budget should not be linked.
Support from Religious Zionist Party MKs is considered crucial to whether the bill can pass its second and third readings in the Knesset plenum and become law.
Aliyah and Integration Minister Ofir Sofer (RZP), a growing number of coalition MKs, and opposition MKs have strongly criticized the current draft bill's outline.

US blogger calls London’s idea of allowing children to change gender identity madness

MOSCOW, February 16. /TASS/. The British government'’s initiative to allow children as young as four to change their gender identity (propaganda of gender reassignment and the operation itself are banned in Russia) is insane and leads to the destruction of the country, Jozef Schutzman, an American blogger and IT specialist, told TASS in an interview.
"We should not be surprised in the slightest about the insane idea of the British government planning to allow children as young as four years old to change their gender identity. The British government hates their country anyways. And they have been trying to destroy it for decades, and they're doing a really fine job at it. This is why more and more families from Western countries are moving to Russia, where family values and children are protected by law and the government," he said.
On February 13, the Daily Mail newspaper reported that the UK Department for Education has released new guidelines for schools on working with "gender-questioning children" (propaganda for gender reassignment and the operation itself are banned in Russia), which allow for the possibility of "full social transition" for primary school students, including children as young as four. According to its information, under these guidelines, teachers and students will be able to refer to children using pronouns that do not correspond to their sex but rather reflect their gender. For example, a girl could be addressed as "he" and a boy as "she."
In the United States, Schutzman built a successful career in the IT sector, holding high positions at corporations such as Microsoft, Oracle and Red Hat. He and his wife are raising eight children and advocate for traditional values. When their state passed a law allowing minors to change gender without parental consent, the family decided to move to Russia. In 2023, they sold all their property in the United States and relocated to the Moscow Region, as Schutzman told TASS in an interview. Together with fellow American Eddie Gonzalez, Schutzman runs a blog popular in the West called Russia Up Close. Their mission is to convey the truth about Russia to residents of Western countries.

Nancy Guthrie kidnapping investigators work with Walmart after identifying suspect’s backpack
Nancy Guthrie kidnapping investigators work with Walmart after identifying suspect’s backpack
Investigators working on the disappearance of “Today” show host Savannah Guthrie’s mother are consulting with Walmart management to develop leads because a backpack the suspect was wearing is sold exclusively at the stores, the Pima County, Arizona, sheriff said Monday.
Nancy Guthrie, 84, was last seen at her Arizona home on Jan. 31 and was reported missing the following day. Authorities say her blood was found on the front porch. Purported ransom notes were sent to news outlets, but two deadlines for paying have passed.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation released surveillance videos of a masked person wearing a handgun holster outside Guthrie’s front door in Tucson the night she vanished. A porch camera recorded video of a person with a backpack who was wearing a ski mask, long pants, a jacket and gloves.
Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos said in a text message to The Associated Press on Monday that the 25-liter “Ozark Trail Hiker Pack” backpack was the only clothing item that has been “definitively identified.”
“This backpack is exclusive to Walmart and we are working with Walmart management to develop further leads,” Nanos said.
The suspect’s clothing “may have been purchased from Walmart but is not exclusively available at Walmart,” the Pima County Sheriff’s Department said in a statement Monday. “This remains a possibility only.”
Investigators on Sunday announced that a glove discovered near the Guthrie home has been sent for DNA testing. The FBI said that it received preliminary results Saturday and was awaiting official confirmation. The development comes as law enforcement gathers more potential evidence and as the search for Guthrie’s mother heads into its third week. Authorities previously said they had not identified a suspect.
The FBI said the suspect in the surveillance footage is a man about 5 feet, 9 inches tall with a medium build.
Nanos said on Monday that members of Guthrie’s family, including siblings and spouses, are not suspects.
“The family has been nothing but cooperative and gracious and are victims in this case,” Nanos said in a statement.
Authorities have expressed concern about Nancy Guthrie’s health because she needs vital daily medicine. She is said to have a pacemaker and have dealt with high blood pressure and heart issues, according to sheriff’s dispatcher audio on broadcastify.com.

Czech Initiative: Ukraine Already Received 4.4 Million Shells

Ukraine has already received 4.4 million large-caliber shells under the Czech Initiative program, which accounts for more than 50% of all large-caliber ammunition provided.
This was announced by Czech President Petr Pavel in an interview with Odkryto.
As part of the Czech initiative to purchase ammunition for the Ukrainian Armed Forces in third countries, nearly 4.4 million large-caliber shells have been delivered to Ukraine.
“If we look at the past period, since the initiative was launched, it has delivered about 4 million 400,000 units of large-caliber ammunition to Ukraine. Last year alone, it was almost two million. Without this supply of ammunition, the Armed Forces of Ukraine would not have been able to conduct effective defense, because if you do not have a secure and predictable supply of ammunition, you cannot plan your defense effectively,” he said.
Pavel emphasized that the Czechia not only initiated this project, but also contributed its know-how on how to bring together partners, finances, resources, routes, and logistics to collect ammunition from all over the world, wherever it is available, and deliver them to Ukraine “under reasonable conditions and at reasonable prices in the shortest possible time.”
The Czech Initiative has been in place since early 2024, with the first deliveries of shells beginning in the summer of that year. The program involves purchasing ammunition in third countries and delivering it to Ukraine.
The program provides for the purchase of not only 155 mm shells, but also other types of shells with a caliber of 100 mm and above. In particular, there were reports of deliveries of 122 mm, 152 mm, and 155 mm artillery shells.
After the change of government in Czechia at the end of 2025, there was uncertainty about the continuation of this initiative, but the new government decided to continue it, provided that Czechia itself would not financially support it, but would only coordinate it.
It is known that as of mid-December 2025, partner countries had already secured funding for the purchase of 760,000 artillery shells for Ukraine in 2026 under the Czech Initiative.

21-year-old man facing terrorism charges in Taylor Swift concert attack plot

Man faces terrorism charges in foiled Taylor Swift concert attack plot in Vienna
Austrian public prosecutors filed terrorism-related charges Monday against a 21-year-old defendant who they say planned to attack one of superstar singer Taylor Swift's concerts in Vienna in August 2024.
Vienna public prosecutors said in a statement that the unnamed defendant had declared allegiance to the Islamic State group by sharing propaganda material and videos via various messaging services.
Vienna prosecutors also accuse the defendant of having "obtained instructions on the internet for the construction of a shrapnel bomb based on the explosive triacetone triperoxide" typically used by IS, and of having produced a small amount of the explosive.
Prosecutors also say that the defendant had made "several attempts" to buy weapons illegally outside the country and to bring them to Austria.
Omar Haijawi-Pirchner, head of the Directorate of State Security and Intelligence, said at the time of the suspect's arrest that he wanted to kill "as many people as possible using the knives or even using the explosive devices he had made."
Vienna public prosecutors plan to proceed with a criminal case against the unnamed suspect in Wiener Neustadt, a town near the Austrian capital.
The spokesperson for the Vienna public prosecutors' office confirmed to The Associated Press that the defendant is in custody. Austrian media identified the suspect as Beran A. and said he was arrested in August 2024.
A total of three suspects had been arrested and charged in connection with the plot, including a teenage boy who was convicted in a German court last year of preparing a serious act of violence and supporting a terrorist act of violence abroad. The Berlin court gave Mohammad A., a Syrian national, a suspended 18-month sentence.
Austrian authorities canceled three planned Swift shows in Vienna in August 2024 after they said they foiled an apparent plot to target the Eras Tour performances.
The U.S. provided intelligence that fed into the decision to cancel the concerts. The move left tens of thousands of Swift's fans, many of whom had traveled to Vienna from elsewhere in the country or abroad specifically to see a show, devastated. Concert organizers in Austria said they had expected up to 65,000 fans inside the Ernst Happel Stadium at each concert and as many as 30,000 onlookers outside.
"The United States has an enduring focus on our counterterrorism mission. We work closely with partners all over the world to monitor and disrupt threats. And so as part of that work, the United States did share information with Austrian partners to enable the disruption of a threat to Taylor Swift's concerts there in Vienna," then-White House national security spokesman John Kirby said in August 2024.

YouTuber facing federal charges after taking drone footage of top-secret ‘underground Pentagon’, FBI claims
Stuart Dale Bennett accused of violating airspace above the Raven Rock Mountain Complex, a secure facility where top US officials will be whisked in the event of nuclear war
- Bookmark
A YouTuber is facing federal charges after he flew a drone over a highly sensitive military installation known as the “underground Pentagon,” capturing footage of the ultra-secure compound that he later posted online, according to an FBI probable cause affidavit reviewed by The Independent.
Stuart Dale Bennett, who runs the “Area 82 Surveillance911” YouTube channel, is accused of gathering aerial recordings of the Raven Rock Mountain Complex, which has been described as one of the nation’s “most closely guarded secret military facilities, roughly comparable to ‘Area 51’ in southern Nevada.”
The self-contained 650-acre subterranean city, hidden deep within a hollowed-out mountain on the Maryland-Pennsylvania border and known as the “underground Pentagon,” is meant to serve as an emergency relocation site for top U.S. officials and vital military operations in the event of a nuclear attack or other catastrophe.
The affidavit, filed February 12 in support of a criminal complaint against Bennett, alleges the videos appeared to depict “critical infrastructure of importance to national security” – specifically, two clips titled, “Raven Rock Mountain Complex COG Site (2nd Pentagon),” and “Blue Ridge Summit / Former Fort Ritchie Communications Site with lots of secret squirrel antennae.”
“Notably, the Area 82 Surveillance911 YouTube channel actually included video titles that in some cases identifies sites as being considered ‘classified’ or ‘Top Secret,’” the affidavit states.
“Additionally, Area 82 Surveillance911 had a folder titled, ‘Classified Secret Sites’ which contained approximately seven videos of UAS overflight of U.S. Government facilities,” the affidavit continues.
The investigation into Bennett, from Maryland, began on September 8, 2025, when an unidentified U.S. military official contacted the Naval Criminal Investigative Service, made famous by TV series NCIS.
Theofficial flagged a YouTube channel that had posted drone footage a week earlier of what the probable cause affidavit describes as “an identified sensitive U.S. national defense facility.”
Ten days later, the FBI joined the investigation, the affidavit states. Agents reviewed the channel, “Area 82 Surveillance911,” maintained by a user going by “mtsxhacker,” and flagged multiple videos of Raven Rock, which “appeared to have been taken from an Unmanned Aircraft System,” according to the affidavit.
The agents traced the account’s IP address, and subpoenaed YouTube for the associated email and recovery phone numbers, identifying mtsxhacker as Bennett, who had used them previously to “submit unrelated complaints to the FBI,” the affidavit continues.
On September 24, a federal magistrate judge approved a trio of search warrants allowing the FBI to search Bennett’s residence, vehicle, and person, along with any electronic devices discovered along the way, the affidavit goes on. The following day, it says agents seized a Potensic Atom drone, four micro-SD cards, and an HP Z240 Tower Workstation, from Bennett’s bedroom.
“During the execution of the search warrant, FBI agents observed that Bennett’s computer monitor (connected to his HP Z240 Tower Workstation) displayed that the Area82 Surveillance911 YouTube channel was logged into and appeared to have a video processing for upload to the channel,” the affidavit states.
A U.S. Customs and Border Protection unit specializing in advanced drone forensics, the Center for Air and Marine Drone Exploitation, (CAMDEx) extracted the contents of one of the micro-SD cards, revealing off-limits footage of Raven Rock, according to the affidavit. It showed an area of the facility called “Site C,” reportedly a key communications site at Raven Rock, and had been taken on September 6, 2025, the affidavit alleges.
The airspace surrounding Raven Rock is restricted, and the affidavit says Bennett “did not seek, nor was granted by the relevant U.S. Government authorities, authorization to conduct such overflight.”
A separate review of Bennett’s computer turned up queries to Google Maps for directions between his home and the Raven Rock complex, as well as visits to websites about the facility, according to the affidavit.
Investigators also located a photo Bennett saved to his files, titled, “2 hf antenna and microwave towers on top of Raven Rock,” along with four videos of off-limits drone footage taken there, the affidavit states. Additionally, it says, Bennett’s search history showed that he visited his own YouTube channel on September 7, 2025 and watched the “Raven Rock Mountain Complex COG Site (2nd Pentagon)” video.
On November 10, 2025, the FBI and NCIS interviewed Bennett at the FBI Baltimore Field Office. Bennett told agents “that he owned and flew UAS,” but was not properly licensed to do so, and admitted to being behind the Area 82 Surveillance911 YouTube channel, the affidavit contends.
“Bennett admitted that he knew he was not permitted to fly UAS over military bases,” it says, adding that Bennett claimed someone named “Elliott” had given him “a list of interesting government sites to fly over,” including Raven Rock.
Bennett, who does not have an attorney listed in court records and was unable to be reached for comment Monday is charged with the knowing and willful violation of national defense airspace. He is set to make his initial appearance in court on February 20.
If convicted, he faces up a year behind bars.
Strategically set about six miles north of the Camp David presidential retreat, Raven Rock is the alternate command center for the North American Aerospace Defense Command and the United States Northern Command, or, NORAD and USNORTHCOM.
In a doomsday-type scenario, a helicopter squadron from Joint Base Andrews would immediately fly a “small number” of senior government officials to Raven Rock and a handful of other hardened bunkers to ensure the continuity of essential government functions, according to historian and journalist Garrett Graff’s 2017 book, Raven Rock: The Story of the U.S. Government's Secret Plan to Save Itself – While the Rest of Us Die.
Among others, Paul Wolfowitz, the deputy secretary of defense under President George W. Bush, was reportedly evacuated to Raven Rock on 9/11.

The frog poison that killed Alexei Navalny likely lab-made

The frog poison that killed Alexei Navalny likely lab-made
February 16, 2026A poison found in threatened frog species in the Ecuadorian foothills has been named as the cause of Alexei Navalny's death in prison.
Scientists from Germany, France, the Netherlands, Sweden and the UK performed a postmortem analysis of the Russian pro-democracy campaigner and opposition leader, who died on February 16, 2024.
In a joint statement, released during the Munich Security Conference, they declared traces of the chemical epibatidine had been detected in Navalny's tissue samples and that "poisoning was highly likely the cause of his death."
As Navalny died while imprisoned in Siberia, the five nations accused Russia of having deliberately administered the poison.
Frogs with a poisonous skin
Epibatidine is a poison contained within the skin of certain poison dart frogs and, as noted by the five nations, is not found naturally in Russia.
The frogs that produce the toxin live in the Ecuadorian foothills and include Anthony's dart frog (Epipedobates anthonyi) and the phantasmal dart frog (Epipedobates tricolor). According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources, the phantasmal dart frog is threatened.
These frog species feed on insects. Alkaloid chemicals that emerge during digestion are concentrated into toxins that are stored within the frogs' skin, which is brightly-colored as a warning to predators. The frogs have evolved to tolerate the lethal substances.
There are many varieties of frog skin toxins, including the paralysis-causing batrachotoxin.
Of course, dart frogs are so named for their historic use by indigenous South American peoples, who were known to coat their arrowheads in the deadly secretions before going hunting. Epibatidine-producing frogs were not known to be used in this practice.
A deadly chemical, not a viable painkiller
Epibatidine, as identified in Navalny, was first identified by American chemist and pharmacologist John W. Daly when he extracted and analyzed less than a milligram of the toxin from phantasmal poison frogs in the 1970s.
Many animal and plant toxins have been formulated into beneficial drugs, painkillers and continue to be researched for potential treatments for hard-to-treat illnesses like cancer.
So it was that epibatidine was investigated for possible human benefit as a potential non-addictive painkiller.
But the toxin is so powerful, with little difference between its lethal to non-lethal doses, that pharmacists have been unable to develop it into a feasible painkiller for humans.
It is known that epibatidine:
- Is about 200 times more powerful than morphine.
- At toxic levels, causes seizures and paralysis of the lung muscles, leading to asphyxiation.
Did Russia go to Ecuador to get dart poison?
Scientists regularly extract animal venoms and toxins for research and to develop medical drugs and antidotes.
But it's unlikely that Russia would have flown to Ecuador to extract a sample of dart frog poison.
Instead, authorities believe that the poison would have been synthesized in a lab.
Vil Mirzayanov, a Russian analytical chemist who has lived in the United States since the 1990s and revealed his involvement in the development of new Novichok (or newcomer) agents after the fall of the Soviet Union, said it was "not new" that Russia's State Research Institute of Organic Chemistry and Technology (or GosNIIOKhT) worked with natural toxins, pointing out that ricin and fentanyl agents had also been developed at the institute.
He agreed that it was more likely that any toxin used was likely lab-made.
"I think this dart frog poison was synthesized because it's very tough to imagine that they brought kilograms, maybe even 100 grams, from somewhere, from South America," Mirzayanov told DW.
Mirzayanov said it was likely that Russia's security services, which have their own advanced laboratories, would have been responsible for administering any poison.
Five nations refer Russia for treaty breach
Though the five nations have claimed their results as proof Navalny was deliberately poisoned, Russia has denied the allegations.
Navalny had previously been flown to Germany in 2020 with a life-threatening illness from nerve agent poisoning. Russia also denied responsibility on that occasion.
Navalny's widow, Yulia Navalnaya, described the five nations' findings as "science-proven" evidence of his murder, saying on social media that "[Vladimir] Putin killed Alexei with a chemical weapon".
The five nations involved in the analysis have referred Russia to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons for breaching the Chemical Weapons Convention.

Pentagon threatens Anthropic over AI model use in military operations: Report
Anonymous Pentagon official tells Axios disentangling system will be ‘an enormous pain,’ saying department will ‘make sure they pay a price for forcing our hand'
WASHINGTON
The Pentagon has threatened to designate artificial intelligence company Anthropic as a “supply chain risk” as it presses the firm to loosen restrictions on the military use of its Claude AI model, according to a report published Monday.
Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is close to severing the Pentagon’s relationship with Anthropic over the dispute, Axios reported. If the designation is imposed, all Defense Department contractors would be required to either stop doing business with Anthropic or end their ties with the Pentagon.
"It will be an enormous pain in the * to disentangle, and we are going to make sure they pay a price for forcing our hand like this," an anonymous Defense Department official told the online news outlet.
Claude is currently the only AI model authorized for use within the Defense Department’s classified systems and has been deployed in sensitive military operations, according to the report. The Pentagon and Anthropic have been negotiating the terms governing the model’s use for several months.
Anthropic is willing to relax some of its usage restrictions for the Pentagon but has drawn firm limits on the use of its software for mass surveillance of Americans and for the development of weapons capable of firing without human oversight, Axios reported. It was not clear which party provided details of the closed-door discussions.
The Pentagon is seeking assurances that it can use software from Anthropic and three other major technology firms — OpenAI, Google and xAI — for what it described as “all lawful purposes.”
"The Department of War’s relationship with Anthropic is being reviewed. Our nation requires that our partners be willing to help our warfighters win in any fight," Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell said in a statement provided to Anadolu.
"Ultimately, this is about our troops and the safety of the American people," he added.
Anthropic did not immediately respond to a request for comment. However, the company told Axios it is "having productive conversations, in good faith, with DoW on how to continue that work and get these new and complex issues right."
OpenAI, Google and xAI have agreed to lift some internal safeguards if the Pentagon opts to use their AI models, though only for unclassified activities, according to the report.

UAE and Bahrain launch ‘single travel point’ pilot

ALBAWABA- The United Arab Emirates and Bahrain have launched the pilot phase of a new “single travel point” system designed to eliminate duplicate airport procedures and significantly reduce passenger queues.
Under the initiative, citizens traveling between the two countries will complete immigration, customs, and security checks at their departure airport, with no additional formalities required upon arrival.
Announced by UAE authorities on Monday, the pilot is being implemented at Zayed International Airport in Abu Dhabi and Bahrain International Airport. The system relies on biometric pre-clearance technology to accelerate processing and improve passenger flow.
The project represents the first operational step toward a broader Gulf Cooperation Council vision for seamless regional travel. The concept was approved during the 42nd GCC Interior Ministers’ meeting in Kuwait in November 2025 and is intended to eventually link all six GCC states under a unified travel framework.
Initially limited to air travel between the UAE and Bahrain, the scheme is expected to expand to land and sea routes if the pilot proves successful, with full implementation targeted for late 2026 alongside plans for a unified GCC tourist visa.
Officials say the system could cut travel times by up to 50 percent, reduce congestion at major aviation hubs, and boost intra-regional trade estimated at $100 billion annually. Enhanced mobility is also seen as a driver for tourism growth, with GCC states aiming to attract millions of additional visitors by 2030 as part of broader economic diversification strategies.
The launch builds on earlier GCC agreements to standardize biometric platforms and data-sharing protocols, positioning the Gulf bloc as a potential model for technology-driven border management amid global aviation pressures and post-pandemic recovery efforts.

Bangladesh’s foreign policy ‘no longer submissive,’ says outgoing leader Yunus
Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus bids farewell as BNP government prepares to take office on Tuesday
DHAKA, Bangladesh
In a farewell address on Monday, outgoing interim leader Muhammad Yunus told the nation of 176 million that Bangladesh’s foreign policy “is no longer submissive” and that relations with all countries will be “based on mutual respect and national interest.”
“Bangladesh is no longer dependent on a submissive foreign policy or on the instructions and advice of other countries; today’s Bangladesh is confident, active and responsible in protecting its independent interests,” said Yunus, who took the helm at the peak of the summer uprising of 2024, which ended the 15-year rule of the Awami League, whose Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina fled to India on Aug. 5 that year.
Yunus took charge on Aug. 8 and led an interim administration for 18 months, including holding historic elections last week in which the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) won a two-thirds majority in the 300-seat parliament.
The BNP, led by Tarique Rahman, is set to take oath as the new government on Tuesday after securing 209 of 300 seats.
The election held on Thursday “will be a prime example of how Bangladesh's elections should be in the future. This vote is not just a transfer of power—it marks the beginning of a new chapter for Bangladesh’s democratic system… the birth of a new Bangladesh,” said Yunus, who is a globally renowned economist.
“After faithfully fulfilling the responsibilities entrusted to me for the past 18 months, I have come to bid you farewell today as the chief advisor of the interim government on the eve of handing over to an elected administration,” he continued.
Yunus recalled the poor economic status of Bangladesh left behind by Hasina’s government.
“The previous government left us with a bottomless economy. It embezzled $234 billion and left behind a huge debt burden. Now, as I leave, I am relieved that we have been able to cope with the situation, and we can leave behind the foundation of a new economy with a foreign reserve of $34 billion and record remittances,” said the outgoing leader.
Yunus, Bangladesh’s lone Nobel laureate and the country’s most renowned "global citizen," is a social entrepreneur, banker and economist.
He is best known for his pioneering work in microfinance and social business. He gained international fame for founding Grameen Bank in 1983 and was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006 for his contributions to economic development and poverty reduction.

’Ready to govern’ Hungary: Former ally Magyar challenges Orban with Europe gun
“We’re standing on the threshold of victory,” Peter Magyar confidently declared to thousands of cheering supporters in Budapest this weekend, kicking off the centre-right Tisza party's campaign for Hungary’s April 12 parliamentary elections. The former far-right Fidesz party insider turned defector is now Prime Minister Viktor Orban’s biggest threat after 16 years in power. FRANCE 24 lists the key stakes in what is expected to become one of Europe’s most closely watched election races this year.
-
Who is Peter Magyar?
Forty-four-year-old Peter Magyar burst onto Hungary’s political scene in February, 2024, after having broken ranks with Orban’s Fidesz party over a child sex abuse pardon scandal that led to the resignation of his ex-wife, then justice minister Judit Varga, and then president Katalin Novak.
Magyar, who up until then had been part of Orban’s inner circle, accused the government of walking free from responsibility after letting Varga and Novak take the blame. “I don’t want to be part of a system where the real culprits hide behind women’s skirts,” he said. Shortly afterward he launched his own centre-right party, Tisza (Respect and Freedom), and vowed to crack down on corruption and bring Hungary closer to Europe.

“Step by step, brick by brick, we are taking back our homeland and building a new country, a sovereign, modern, European Hungary,” Magyar said shortly after founding his party.
Just a few months later, Tisza stunned Hungary’s political establishment by securing almost 30 percent of the votes in the European parliamentary elections – cementing Magyar’s role as Orban’s most serious challenger yet.
As both contenders launched their campaigns over the weekend, Magyar’s Tisza already held a comfortable 10-point lead over Orban’s Fidesz – and has done so over the past year, according to a combined poll by Politico.
“Tisza stands ready to govern,” Magyar said at his launch event.

Why is Orban’s rule in danger?
Aside from the Fidesz “family values” brand taking a serious hit with the 2024 pardon scandal – prompting some of the party’s conservative members to defect to Tisza – Orban has been unable to to get Hungary’s bleeding economy back on track. In 2023, a presidential pardon had been secretly granted to the deputy director of a children’s home convicted of covering up a case of child sex abuse.
In the wake of Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine – which pushed the country’s energy prices to the skies – Orban also introduced new income rebates, which in 2023 resulted in the worst inflationary surge in Europe, at a staggering 25 percent.
Although the worst of the financial crisis has since subsided, a Eurobarometer survey cited by Reuters last autumn showed that rising prices, inflation and cost of living still top Hungarians’ main concerns.
The state of the country’s economy has also been weighed down by the fact that the European Union has blocked some €20 billion in funds over corruption and the rule of law concerns.
The economy is in other words a sore point for Orban, and Magyar has taken every opoortunity to point that out.
-
Europe in focus
The real battleground in the April ballot will be the two candidates' opposing views on the EU.
While Orban last week declared that the real danger to Hungary is the EU, Magyar has gone the other way: “Hungary will once again be a full-fledged member of the European Union,” he told a Budapest rally last year, touting the EU as the answer to Hungary’s prayers, especially if it releases the withheld EU funds.
On Saturday, Orban told supporters that “Brussels … [is] a source of imminent danger”, adding that the April ballot is therefore a choice between “war and peace”, and that Fidesz, with its anti-EU stance, therefore is the only “safe choice”.
Orban's anti-establishment and nationalist views has won him support from US President Donald Trump, and on Monday US Secretary of State Marco Rubio paid him a symbolic visit, telling him "your success is our success".

Orban hopes his ties with Trump wil help him collect the votes needed to prolong his reign.
If he wins the elections, he has promised to "clear away" the "oppressive machinery of Brussels" in his country.
-
Views on Russia and Ukraine
Under Orban, Hungary has remained Russia’s closest EU ally throughout the war, routinely blocking any European sanction packages against what has remained – despite pleas from Europe – its main gas supplier.
He has equally tried to stonewall any military or financial aid to Ukraine. And at the end of last year, he even went as far as to say it was “unclear who attacked whom”.
Although Magyar has described Moscow as “the aggressor” in the conflict, and last year told the Financial Times he would push for an immediate ceasefire along with Hungary’s EU allies if he comes to power, he has also said he would not reverse Hungary’s current policy of non-support for Kyiv nor totally sever Budapest’s ties with Russia. He staunchly opposes fast-track EU accession for Ukraine.
"On Ukraine, Tisza’s manifesto is notably thin," an analyst note from the Brussels-based think-tank European Policy Center warned, adding that "EU leaders should not assume that a Magyar government would mark a clean break with Orban-era policies."

EU Honors Alexei Navalny; Labs Say He was Poisoned with Rare Neurotoxin

Reported by
The EU Delegation to the United Nations in Geneva on Monday commemorated the Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, marking two years since his death in custody as European officials pointed to new laboratory findings they say strengthen evidence he was poisoned.
Diplomats gathered at a memorial in Geneva, laying flowers and holding photographs before observing a minute of silence. In remarks, the EU ambassador, Deike Potzel, said several European governments had concluded that Navalny’s death was the foreseeable outcome of a political system designed to silence dissent, noting that Russia holds more than 2,000 political prisoners, including journalists, lawyers and rights advocates.
Her comments came days after the United Kingdom, Germany, France, the Netherlands and Sweden said analyses by their national laboratories had “conclusively confirmed” the presence of epibatidine — a rare, highly toxic alkaloid associated with South American poison dart frogs — in biological samples linked to Navalny. The governments said the substance is not found naturally in Russia and that poisoning was therefore “highly likely” to have caused his death.
Speaking in Bratislava, Marco Rubio said the United States had “no reason” to doubt the European findings, calling the report troubling, though he stopped short of announcing any formal U.S. action.
The announcement coincided with international security meetings in Munich attended by Navalny’s widow, Yulia Navalnaya, who said the laboratory conclusions confirmed what she had long alleged: that President Vladimir Putin bore responsibility for her husband’s death.
European officials described the findings as significant because they link Navalny’s death to a specific toxin identified by multiple laboratories, potentially strengthening grounds for international action. The five governments said they had notified the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, signaling a possible violation of the Chemical Weapons Convention.
Members of the Russian opposition platform at the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe said the report confirmed long-standing accusations that Russian authorities were responsible and called for an international tribunal to investigate Navalny’s death and other alleged crimes.
Russian officials have denied involvement and dismissed the accusations as propaganda.

France opens murder probe into right-wing activist's death

France opens murder probe into right-wing activist's death
February 16, 2026French authorities on Monday opened a murder investigation after a 23-year-old man died from a severe brain injury following an attack on the streets of Lyon last week.
Lyon's public prosecutor Thierry Dran announced the probe at a press conference, saying that Quentin Deranque had been attacked by "at least six" people on Thursday.
The victim was part of a group of far-right activists protesting the appearance of a left-wing politician speaking at a university in the western city of Lyon.
Prosecutor Dran said that no arrests had yet been made and that authorities were working to identify the hooded assailants suspected in a killing being treated as a potential case of both "intentional homicide" and "aggravated assault."
Macron calls for calm as government implicates far left
The killing, thought to be part of a clash between left- and right-wing extremists, has strained tensions ahead of municipal elections in March and the 2027 presidential race.
Supporters held a march in memory of Deranque in Paris on Sunday, also attended by some far-right politicians including the founder of the "Reconquest" far-right party, former presidential candidate Eric Zemmour.
President Emmanuel Macron called for calm and for a swift investigation online.
"It is essential that the perpetrators of this ignominy be prosecuted, brought to justice and convicted," Macron wrote on X at the weekend. "Hatred that kills has no place among us. I call for calm, restraint and respect."
Far-right RN leader Marine Le Pen appealed for the "barbarians responsible for this lynching" to face the full force of the law.
An anti-immigration collective called Nemesis said that Deranque had been at the protest to protect its members.
It blamed the killing on a left-wing group called the Jeune Garde (Young Guard), an anti-fascist group cofounded by a current member of the left wing LFI political party, Raphael Arnault, before he joined the political fray.
The group, which was formally dissolved in June last year, denied any connection to the "tragic events." LFI leader Jean-Luc Melenchon rejected any involvement from his party.
Nevertheless, government spokeswoman Maud Bregeon accused the LFI on Monday of having "encouraged a climate of violence for years."
"There is therefore, in light of the political climate and the climate of violence, a moral responsibility of the part of LFI," she said on BFMTV.
One of Arnault's assistants had been banned from parliament after several witnesses mentioned him in the investigation into the fatal beating, parliamentary speaker Yael Braun-Pivet said on Monday.
Far-right and far-left could lead the race for presidency next year
France's political mood is increasingly fractious as April 2027 presidential elections near, when incumbent Macron will not be eligible to run after serving the maximum permitted two terms.
Opinion polls currently suggest that the nationalist RN (National Rally) party of Marine Le Pen, possibly led by her deputy Jordan Bardella if Le Pen proves unable to run amid an ongoing appeal against an election ban, has the advantage — at least when it comes to a first-round vote with more than two candidates standing. Voting habits in a second round with only two choices can be more difficult to predict.
Macron's centrist Renaissance party is struggling, while the traditional center-right and center-left powerhouses of French politics have been consigned to near-irrelevance for some time now.
At present, albeit with polling volatile and more than a year to go until a vote, a relatively new center-right party Horizons founded by Mayor of Le Havre and former Prime Minister Edouarde Philippe appears best placed to challenge the far-right.
A left-wing alliance led by LFI (France Unbowed) might also conceivably mount a serious challenge, as it did in 2024's legislative elections. But that's only if it can again unite a quite large group of ideologically disparate parties, none of which appear likely to challenge by themselves.

The fatal beating of a 23-year-old man in Lyon has shocked France and ignited a fierce political row. The victim, identified only as Quentin, died in hospital after being attacked on 12 February on the sidelines of clashes near a political event at Sciences Po Lyon attended by a left-wing politician. Prosecutors say he was assaulted during confrontations between rival activists and later succumbed to a traumatic brain injury, prompting a murder inquiry by French police.
The killing has intensified tensions between the far right and far left in the run-up to key elections, with national figures calling for calm even as accusations fly about responsibility for the violence. France 24’s Mark Owen is joined by economist Renaud Foucart of Lancaster University to analyse the political and social fallout from this deeply troubling incident.

Appearing on Lorraine on Monday (16 February), Paris explained that ahead of her performance to Houston’s “Run To You” back in January, she had a vision of the pop icon before she was about to go on stage.
“There was a moment just before in the costume when I had this vision and I just saw her in the album cover, you know with the white T-Shirt and the jeans and the afro, and all I heard was ‘you got this’.”

In Argentina, locals are taking loans to buy food

In Argentina, locals are taking loans to buy food
Argentinians are taking on loans, selling their belongings, and living on credit cards to pay for basics including food.
Buenos Aires, Argentina: Diego Nacasio, 43, works full time as a salesman at a large hardware store in Florencio Varela, a city in the greater Buenos Aires area. He says he doesn’t need a calendar to know what day of the month it is. By the time his salary and that of his wife, who also works full time in a shop, run out, it is around the 15th.
From then on, they look for extra jobs, find things to sell, use their credit cards, and get small loans to pay for basics, including food, until the next paycheques arrive.
“I have never experienced anything like this,” Nacasio told Al Jazeera. “Over the past 25 years, we have worked hard, and our jobs allowed us to build a house from scratch, buy a car and give our 17-year-old son a decent life. Now, we have better jobs than we did then, and still cannot even afford food for the whole month.”
“Living on credit puts you in a very dangerous cycle. It’s very easy to fall behind with payments, and then it is a matter of chasing your own tail. Most people I know are in the same situation. We are living in a constant state of stress and anxiety, and it feels like there’s no way out.”
Nacasio’s story has become increasingly common in Argentina, where nearly half of the people say they are using savings, selling belongings or borrowing money from banks or relatives to cover basics, according to a report by Argentina Grande based on the latest official figures available. Another report, from Fundacion Pensar, found that 63 percent of Argentines have cut down on activities or services to make ends meet.
“The current situation in Argentina is extremely concerning. It is particularly worrying to see that even people who have one or several jobs are getting loans not to buy a house, a car or white goods [appliances], but to buy food,” Violeta Carrera Pereyra, sociologist and researcher at the Argentina Grande Institute and one of the authors of the report, told Al Jazeera.
A tale of two cities
Argentina’s President Javier Milei, who took office in December 2023, says his austerity economic plan, based on achieving fiscal balance while building up reserves of United States currency through drastic cuts to public spending, has revitalised the economy and lifted millions of people out of poverty. He is backed by the International Monetary Fund, which, despite Argentina’s record levels of foreign loans, projects an economic growth of four percent in 2026 and 2027.
But a closer look at the figures shows a different, more sombre, picture.
While economic activity in Argentina has increased overall, growth has been uneven. In November 2025, the most recent month for which data is available, sectors such as banking and agriculture saw growth, but manufacturing and commerce experienced sharp declines, with many factories and shops closing due to falling demand. Consumption, particularly of food, has been falling, with a 12.5 percent drop reported by independent food retailers.
Then there’s inflation, a key variable that in Argentina needs to be kept at bay in order to access essential foreign credit.
While Milei’s shock economic plan managed to significantly reduce inflation from record-high figures when he first took office in late 2023, experts say his administration has taken some controversial measures to keep it low. This includes forcing salaries to remain stagnant and under the rate of inflation, and opening the country up to cheaper imports. These policies have left many without money to spend and forced thousands of factories and small businesses to close.
Critics also say inflation figures are not representative of real price fluctuations. The tool used to measure inflation in Argentina, a sample basket of goods people consume, was developed in 2004 and does not reflect current consumption patterns, including the percentage that items like electricity and fuel – two areas that have seen price hikes considerably higher than inflation – represent in people’s real spending habits.
Carrera Pereyra says that figures also show that the rapid changes in Argentina’s economy have widened inequalities.
“On the one hand, we see that some sectors are able to consume more, so we see a rise in the sales of properties, cars, motorbikes, some as a result of the opening of imports,” she said. “But on the other hand, items like food and medicines are decreasing. So, some people can buy more things than before, while others are struggling to put food on the table.”
An obstacle course
Many Argentines who spoke with Al Jazeera said that making ends meet has become nothing short of an obstacle course. Juggling multiple demanding jobs, selling used items such as clothing, borrowing from relatives, seeking shark loans and bargain hunting have become a regular part of daily life.
“Shopping for food has become a job in itself,” said Veronica Malfitano, 43, a teacher and trade unionist, whose salary was cut by a quarter when Milei slashed public spending. “I team up with relatives or people I work with, and we buy in bulk. I use my credit card or get small loans. This month, for the first time, I have only paid the credit card’s minimum, something I had never done before. It’s all very stressful. Everybody I know is in the same situation.”
Research confirms Malfitano is not alone. Nearly half of supermarket purchases in Argentina are paid with credit cards, a record, according to recent official data.
Both borrowing and default rates have increased. It is estimated that around 11 percent of personal loans are unpaid, the highest rate since the Central Bank of Argentina began keeping records in 2010, according to Central Bank data.
Griselda Quipildor, 49, who lives with her husband, two daughters and two grandchildren, says that even though several people in her family work, money usually runs out by the 18th of every month and they have to start taking loans.
“At the start of the month, we pay debts, the bills and then the money runs out and we have to start borrowing again. It’s an endless vicious circle, one that is very difficult to get away from. We borrow from people we know and people we don’t know. It wasn’t like this before.”
Lucia Cavallero, an analyst, economics expert, and member of Movida Ciudad, told Al Jazeera that even though Argentina’s economic problems are longstanding, their impact on people’s homes is worsening.
“Debt has long been a serious problem in Argentina, and it has now become a crisis,” she said. “The proliferation of informal lenders has created a dangerous situation, leaving many people with no other options.”
In response, a political party has proposed a bill that would help people in lower-income sectors unify their loans and apply for a long-term payment plan at lower rates.
Cavallero says there are some positive aspects to the initiative, but that it largely misses the central point.
“It is good to see the political class recognising that debts are a serious problem for people,” she said. “However, this approach follows the logic of borrowing to pay off debt. While it may provide temporary relief, deeper structural changes are needed.
“Just as banks are bailed out, we are calling for families to be supported. A more sustainable solution is for wages to keep pace with the cost of the basic basket, so that people do not have to go into debt just to afford food,” Cavallero told Al Jazeera.
Despite all the challenges he and his family face, Nacasio says many people like himself still count themselves lucky.
“At least we own our house,” he said. “If we didn’t and we had to pay rent, I don’t know what we would do. I just need things to change, for us and for everybody. Things cannot continue like this.”

MOSCOW, February 16. /TASS/. A senior Russian lawmaker has advised Polish President Karol Nawrotski to stop dreaming about obtaining nuclear weapons.
"I would not advise Nawrotski, even for the sake of domestic PR, to flex his nuclear muscles, which are unlikely to ever be built up," Leonid Slutsky, chairman of the international committee of the Russian State Duma, or lower house of parliament, and leader of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia (LDPR), wrote on his Telegram channel, commenting on the Polish president’s interview with the Polsat television channel, where he said that he wants Poland to strengthen its security "even on the basis of nuclear capacities."
Poland, in his words, will never be able to obtain nuclear weapons "either from the political or military-technical point of view.".

'Racist slob' and 'modern Klansman' Randy Fine faces resignation calls over rabid anti-Muslim post
Unknown

04:25:41 KST

Randy Fine, notorious Florida's Republican US Congressman, has made yet another inflammatory and anti-Muslim comment, with his latest remark likening dogs to Muslims and urging Americans to select the former "if they (Muslims) force us to choose."
Fine ignited widespread outrage and condemnation after posting, "If they force us to choose, the choice between dogs and Muslims is not a difficult one" — a comment particularly timed near Ramadan and targeting an entire faith group of nearly 2 billion Muslims globally.
Fine claimed the racist comment was a response to what was a joke by Nerdeen Kiswani, founder of the New York City-based Palestinian network Within Our Lifetime.
"Finally, NYC is coming to Islam. Dogs definitely have a place in society, just not as indoor pets," she wrote last week. "Like we’ve said all along, they are unclean."
"Lmao at the Zionists frothing at the mouth at this, thinking they're doing something. It's obviously a joke," Kiswani clarified later without mentioning Fine.
"I don't care if you have a dog, I do care if your dog is shitting everywhere and you're not cleaning it."
Another post from Kiswani clarified that it referenced individuals displeased by the amount of dog excrement left on piles of frozen snow throughout the city.
'Randy Fine is an ugly bigot'
Following the Republican’s comments about Muslims, California Governor Gavin Newsom called for the resignation of Fine, who is Jewish and has previously been criticised by Democrats, civil rights groups, and Jewish organisations for his anti-Muslim views and celebration of genocide in Gaza.
"Resign now, you racist slob," Newsom wrote on X.
Cameron Kasky, a Jewish activist, wrote on X in response to Fine's post: "Imagine if an American politician said this about Jews."
"Randy Fine is an ugly bigot. He should not be in Congress," said Representative Brendan Boyle, a Pennsylvania Democrat.
Representative Yassamin Ansari, an Arizona Democrat, said: "If anyone said something this vile in any workplace, they'd be fired. Randy Fine has repeatedly dehumanised Muslims without consequence. It's unacceptable and should not be normalised by Congress. @SpeakerJohnson should reprimand him immediately. And if Fine cannot meet the most basic standard of human dignity, he should resign."
The Council on American-Islamic Relations issued a statement on Monday demanding that congressional leaders call for Fine's resignation, describing his rhetoric, including this comment and prior ones, as racist, comparing him to a "modern Klansman and Nazi" targeting Muslims and Palestinians, and highlighting it as part of a pattern including calls for the destruction of "mainstream Muslims."
Celebrating genocide
In 2021, when a user on X asked Fine how he sleeps at night in a post that had the image of a dead Palestinian child pulled from rubble, the rabble-rousing politicians quipped, "Quite well, actually! Thanks for the pic!"
Fine has repeatedly lauded the deaths and suffering in Gaza genocide, remarking recently, "The Palestinian cause is an evil one.… We nuked the Japanese twice [in World War II]."
During a House committee hearing last year, Fine stated: "I don’t know how you make peace with those (Muslims) who seek your destruction, I think you destroy them first."
Fine has previously called for a "Muslim travel ban," "radical deportations of all mainstream Muslim legal and illegal immigrants," and "citizenship revocations wherever possible," claiming "Mainstream Muslims have declared war on us" and that they should be "kicked the hell out of America."
He has previously threatened Muslim Congresswomen like Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib, remarking "The Hebrew Hammer is coming" with "#BombsAway".
Fine, known for his hateful remarks, caused uproar after celebrating Israel’s killing of 26-year-old Turkish-American activist Aysenur Ezgi Eygi in the occupied West Bank, labelling Eygi a "Muslim terrorist."

Finland Determines Location for NATO Forward Land Forces Headquarters

Finland has determined the permanent location for NATO’s forward land forces headquarters. It will be in Rovaniemi, the administrative center of Lapland.
The decision was made by Finland’s Defense Minister Antti Häkkänen, according to Yle.
This refers to a multinational group of NATO’s forward-deployed land forces (Forward Land Forces) that will operate within the country.
The units will mainly operate in the northern regions of Finland, which is in line with the Alliance’s defense planning on the northern flank.
According to the defense minister, Rovaniemi was chosen for its operational expediency and “synergy effect” for the interaction of allied forces.
The headquarters will have permanent status and a continuous presence in Finland. The number of personnel may vary depending on the tasks.
During training periods or in the event of an escalation of the security situation, the contingent is planned to be increased, potentially to brigade level.
Regular rehearsals of scenarios for the rapid deployment of additional forces and equipment to the area of deployment are planned.
Sweden has taken on a key role in the formation of the group. Denmark, Norway, Iceland, the United Kingdom, France, and Italy are also involved.
The deployment of Forward Land Forces in Finland is part of a broader adaptation of NATO’s force structure following the country’s accession to the Alliance.
Earlier, President of Finland Alexander Stubb stressed that NATO membership had become a critical security factor for Finland and Sweden in the changed geopolitical situation.
Militarnyi also recently reported that NATO’s forward brigade in Finland will be formed on the basis of Swedish units.

California governor ‘a loser’, says Trump as state signs green energy deal with UK

Donald Trump has vented his fury against a green energy deal between the British government and California’s governor, Gavin Newsom, a likely future Democratic presidential candidate.
“The UK’s got enough trouble without getting involved with Gavin Newscum,” Trump said in an interview with Politico, using the derogatory nickname he reserves for Newsom. “Gavin is a loser. Everything he’s touched turns to garbage. His state has gone to hell, and his environmental work is a disaster.”
In an intervention that is likely to be clocked by British government officials wary of potential new landmines in the UK’s relationship with the White House, Trump went on to say it was “inappropriate” for Newsom to strike such agreements and “inappropriate for them [the UK] to be dealing with him”.
Newsom, one of the loudest domestic opponents of the US president on issues ranging from ICE deportation raids to the climate crisis, signed a memorandum of understanding in London with the UK’s energy secretary, Ed Miliband.
Their agreement is aimed at deepening existing cooperation between the UK and California and creates a new framework to scale up clean energy technologies and enhance ties between businesses and researchers in Britain and the US state, which is in effect the world’s fourth largest global economy.
The UK and California will also share practical expertise on protecting biodiversity and building resilience amid extreme weather, Miliband’s department announced on Monday.
Miliband said: “Strong international partnerships like today’s announcement with the state of California strengthen opportunities for UK businesses and secure investment for our country.”
The signing follows their meeting in New York in September. On Monday in London, Newsom and Miliband also discussed AI and the implications for energy, and lessons from California’s wildfires – over which Trump and Newsom have clashed, the US president blaming them on the state’s management of fires.
A source close to Miliband said: “It was a productive meeting based on the huge clean energy jobs and investment opportunities that the UK and California can bring to one another.”
Newsom was in London just after attending the Munich Security Conference, where he said: “Donald Trump’s administration is temporary. California’s commitment is not.”
The governor also used his visit to Europe to continue cultivating European leaders who have been notably outspoken in their opposition to policies pursued by the Trump administration.
Last week he met Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, who was quick to join Latin American countries in condemning the recent US military intervention in Venezuela, and the German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, who used an appearance in Munich to criticise Trump’s reorientation of US foreign policy.
Both Newsom and Miliband are bete noires for the new populist right. Nigel Farage, the leader of the hard-right Reform UK party, said on Monday that he believed Miliband was the most likely candidate to take over from Keir Starmer if the latter is forced out in the event of a disastrous Labour party performance in upcoming local elections. Farage said Labour would then “shift to the left”.

Hamas ‘used emojis’ to signal start of the October 7, 2023 attack on Israel
Citing the army, Israeli media reported that emojis were found on mobile phones belonging to members of Hamas’ elite Nukhba Forces unit
The militant Palestinian organisation Hamas used emojis to signal to its fighters the start of the attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, the Israeli TV channel N12 reported on Monday.
It cited the Israeli army as its source but a military spokeswoman was initially unable to officially confirm the story.
According to the report, the emojis were found on mobile phones belonging to members of Hamas’ elite Nukhba Forces unit, which were seized by the Israelis on the day of the attack. The specific emojis were not disclosed.
Militants from Hamas and other extremist groups killed more than 1,200 people in Israel in the assault and took more than 250 others hostage in Gaza.
The Jerusalem Post newspaper reported that Hamas fighters had moved to mosques or designated assembly points in Gaza after receiving the emoji signal.

Winter Olympics recap: Meyers Taylor finally gets gold for US and Eileen Gu wins second silver
Winter Olympics recap: Meyers Taylor finally gets gold for US and Eileen Gu wins second silver
MILAN (AP) — Small margins decided gold medals at the Milan Cortina Olympics as Eileen Gu had to settle for another silver in defense of her big air ski freestyle title and Elana Meyers Taylor of the U.S. finally won bobsled gold in her fifth Olympics.
Also on Day 10 of the Winter Games, a Norwegian contender’s emotional reaction overshadowed the last men’s Alpine ski event, and the U.S. and Canada advanced to another gold medal showdown in women’s hockey after winning their semifinal games.
Silver again for Gu in big air
Gu came to Italy to fight for gold medals in three different freestyle ski events. She has two silvers and still has her best event, the halfpipe, to go.
After a long delay because of heavy snow, it was Canada’s Megan Oldham who soared to victory with a combined score of 180.75 to Gu’s 179.
It was still a remarkable performance from Gu, the San Francisco-born skier for China who hadn’t competed in big air in the four years since winning gold at the 2022 Olympics.
The athlete who beat Gu to the gold in slopestyle last week, Switzerland’s Mathilde Gremaud, was ruled out of the big air final when she injured her hip in practice hours before.
The wait is over for Meyers Taylor
Vancouver, Sochi, Pyeongchang, Beijing. Meyers Taylor won at least one medal at each of her first four Olympics, but the gold always eluded her.
No longer.
The 41-year-old American won that long-awaited medal by just four hundredths of a second in women’s monobob when the last competitor, Germany’s Laura Nolte, made a small but costly mistake on her final run.
Meyers Taylor’s sixth career medal extends her record as the most decorated Black athlete at the Winter Olympics. She’s also the oldest American woman to win gold at the Winter Games.
Meyers Taylor’s U.S. teammate Kaillie Armbruster Humphries was third, 0.08 off Nolte’s time.
McGrath’s moment alone in the forest
The men’s slalom race had a finish like no other.
Norway’s Atle Lie McGrath was leading the race and skiing last on the second run but straddled a gate and was out. He stopped, threw his ski poles over a fence and then started walking through deep snow to the forest for some time alone.
“I thought that I would get some peace and quiet, which I didn’t,” said McGrath, who said photographers and police tracked him down.
The dramatic finish overshadowed Loic Meillard of Switzerland winning gold, and an earlier fall for giant slalom winner and South American history maker Lucas Pinheiro Braathen.
It’s been an especially tough Olympics for McGrath, whose grandfather died on the day of the opening ceremony. McGrath was racing with an armband as a tribute.
US-Canada again for women’s hockey gold
The U.S. and Canada will play for the gold medal on Thursday after the U.S. routed Sweden 5-0 and Canada struggled past Switzerland 2-1 in Monday’s semifinal games.
U.S. goaltender Aerin Frankel preserved a shutout streak which now stands at 331 minutes. The U.S. team is unbeaten and has allowed just one goal all tournament as it seeks a first gold medal since 2018.
Captain Marie-Philip Poulin broke the all-time Olympic scoring record with two goals in an unusually narrow win for Canada.
World record gives Japan a figure skating win
Riku Miura and Ryuichi Kihara needed something special after placing fifth in the pairs figure skating short program. They delivered.
Miura and Kihara produced a world record score in the free skate to win Japan’s first-ever pairs gold.
Georgia got its first medal in any Winter Olympic sport with Anastasiia Metelkina and Luka Berulava in second. Short-program leaders Minerva Fabienne Hase and Nikita Volodin of Germany dropped to the bronze medal position.
Xandra Velzeboer won her second gold medal of the Olympics in the women’s 1,000-meter short track speedskating to match her Dutch teammate Jens van ’t Wout with two gold medals for the games. Italy’s Arianna Fontana was chasing what would have been her 14th career Olympic medal but placed fourth.
Austria won the first-ever Olympic gold in men’s super team ski jumping. The Austrians were leading when the competition was cut short due to heavy snow and wind.

California braces for a major winter storm expected to bring heavy rain and snow

California walloped by winter storm with high winds and heavy rain and snow
California walloped by winter storm with high winds and heavy rain and snow
California was walloped Monday by a powerful winter storm carrying treacherous thunderstorms, high winds and heavy snow in mountain areas.
Millions of Los Angeles County residents faced flash flood warnings as rain pounded the region and people in some areas scarred by last year’s devastating wildfires were under an evacuation warning through Tuesday because of the potential for mud and debris flows.
Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass ordered emergency crews and city departments to be ready to respond to any problems.
The storm wreaked havoc on roadways spanning from Sonoma County to the Sierra Nevada. Traffic was halted temporarily in both directions on I-80 near the Nevada state line due to spinouts and crashes, the California Department of Transportation reported. In Santa Barbara County, a large tree toppled onto US-101, shutting down southbound lanes.
Forecasters said the western slope of the Sierra Nevada, northern Shasta County — including portions of Interstate 5 — and parts of the state’s Coast Range could see up to 8 feet (2.4 meters) of snow before the storm moves through late Wednesday. The heavy snow, wind and low visibility could also make travel conditions dangerous to near impossible, forecasters added.
“It has seemed ‘springlike’ for a large part of 2026, but winter is set to show it’s not quite done yet,” the Shasta County Sheriff’s Office said in a social media post urging residents to stay aware of the storm.
California’s Office of Emergency Services said it was placing fire and rescue personnel and resources in areas most at risk for flooding, mud and debris flows.
In Southern California, Six Flags Magic Mountain was closed Monday due to the storm, and Knotts Berry Farm amusement park shut its doors early. But the winter weather was celebrated by local ski resorts that have waited weeks for snow.
Other states on Monday braced for different threatening weather events. Residents in parts of eastern Colorado received warnings that they could be in fire danger due to a combination of abnormally high temperatures, gusty winds and dry conditions. The risks were expected to continue further into the week as gusts up to 60 mph (96 kph) are likely to hit the Colorado eastern plains on Tuesday. Parts of Texas, New Mexico and Kansas were also under red flag warnings.
The latest storm comes amid a snow drought across much of the American West, with snow cover and depth measuring at the lowest levels scientists have seen in decades. Most states saw half their average precipitation or less in January, though California fared better others due to heavy rains in December.
It was the first of several days of stormy weather forecast for California. A coastal flood advisory was in effect for San Francisco until Tuesday afternoon, with cooler showers and a chance of hail on Tuesday, while nearby mountains were expecting snow, the National Weather Service in Monterey reported.
Kashawna McInerny, a Realtor in the mountain community of Wrightwood, about 80 miles (130 kilometers) northeast of Los Angeles, on Monday said she was still dealing with several tons of rock and debris on her property from Christmas and New Year’s storms that pummeled the community. After the last one, she said she got help trenching part of her side yard to direct stormwater down the street and placed a barrier of metal and wood by a door in hopes of keeping out mud and debris.
“We’re not panicking yet. At least I’m not,” she said with a laugh.

Prosecutors plan to charge an Israeli settler with killing a Palestinian activist in the West Bank

Prosecutors plan to charge an Israeli settler with killing a Palestinian activist in the West Bank
RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) — Israeli prosecutors said Monday that they plan to charge a settler in the killing of a Palestinian activist during a confrontation that was caught on video, opening a rare prosecution of violence by Jewish settlers in the occupied West Bank.
Attacks from settlers and home demolitions by authorities have spiked dramatically over the past two years, but the death in July of Awdah Hathaleen has drawn particular attention due to his involvement in the 2025 Oscar-winning film “No Other Land,” which chronicled Palestinian villagers’ fight to stay on their land. The case also stands out because the confrontation between Palestinians and Yinon Levi, an internationally sanctioned settler, was captured on video from multiple vantage points.
In a video that family members say was taken by Hathaleen himself, Levi could be seen firing toward the person holding the camera. Another showed Levi firing two shots without showing where the bullets struck.
An Israeli judge released Levi from custody six months ago, citing a lack of evidence that he fired the shots that killed Hathaleen.
Israel’s State Attorney General’s office confirmed in a statement Monday that it had initiated proceedings to indict Levi. It did not specify the charges.
Eitan Peleg, an attorney for Hathaleen’s family, said the office had informed them it planned to indict Levi for reckless homicide, triggering a process that allows Levi to contest charges before they’re formally filed.
“Enforcement of the law in cases like this involving Palestinians in the West Bank is very rare, so this is unique,” Peleg told The Associated Press on Monday.
Israel’s military referred questions on the indictment to police, who have not yet responded. Both bodies enforce laws in the area.
More than 3.4 million Palestinians and 700,000 Israelis live in the occupied West Bank and east Jerusalem, territories captured by Israel in 1967 and sought by Palestinians for a future state. The international community overwhelmingly considers Israeli settlement construction in these areas to be illegal and an obstacle to peace.
Palestinians and rights groups say authorities routinely fail to prosecute settlers or hold them accountable for violence. Under National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, investigations into settler attacks have plummeted, according to the Israeli rights group Yesh Din.
Khalil Hathaleen, Awdah’s brother, said the family was glad some measure of justice was being pursued but felt the charge of “reckless homicide” was insufficient.
“It was an intentional killing in broad daylight, with prior intent and premeditation,” he said.
Levi’s attorney, Avichai Hajbi, declined Monday to comment on the coming indictment, which he said he hadn’t received. After the shooting, he told The Associated Press that Levi acted in self-defense, without elaborating. Levi did not answer phone calls Monday.
Parts of the confrontation were filmed
Video released last year by B’Tselem, an Israeli human rights group showed Levi firing a gun toward the person filming. At the moment that B’Tselem says Hathaleen collapsed, the visuals are jostled but moans of pain can be heard. The group said it obtained the video from the family of Hathaleen, who said he filmed it.
Additional footage obtained by the AP last year showed Levi waving a pistol during the standoff in Umm al-Khair that was with a group of Palestinians over an excavator that had rolled down from a nearby settlement and damaged Palestinian property earlier in the day.
Alaa Hathaleen, a cousin who filmed the encounter, told AP at the time that he had approached Levi to tell him the group was unarmed and to stop the bulldozing.
In the video, one Palestinian insults Levi and another challenges him to shoot. Levi shoves someone just out of the frame, demands to know who threw stones, and later fires a shot, seemingly away from the crowd. He then fires again and yells toward the crowd to get away from the excavator.
The footage did not show where bullets struck, though other relatives said they saw Awdah Hathaleen fall immediately after shots were fired.
Levi was detained before being released to house arrest. That condition was eventually lifted, too.
Levi was among the Israeli settlers sanctioned by the United States and other Western countries over allegations of violence toward Palestinians in 2024. U.S. President Donald Trump lifted the U.S. sanctions after taking office the following year.
Attacks spike as spotlight grows
Activists and crew members on the film “No Other Land” have said settler attacks have intensified on the village portrayed since the movie won the Oscar.
Hamdan Ballal, one of the film’s directors, said his family home in Umm al-Khair was subject to another attack on Sunday. Four relatives were arrested during the confrontation, he said.
Ballal said a soldier, who came to their home accompanied by another soldier and a settler-herder, grabbed his brother by the neck and tried to choke him. Neither the army nor the police responded to requests for comment on the incident.
“The year after I won the Oscar, the assaults increased significantly. On a daily basis, settlers come and destroy the fields, destroy the trees, destroy the crops around the house,” he said.
Israeli proof-of-ownership rules spark anger
As prosecutors move to indict Levi and violence persists across the West Bank, Israel is moving ahead with measures to deepen its control over land in the occupied territory.
On Sunday, it announced it would resume a land registration process across the West Bank to require anyone with a claim to land to submit documents proving ownership. Rights groups say the process could strip Palestinians of land they’ve lived on and farmed for generations and transfer vast swaths of land to Israeli state control.
Israel’s Foreign Ministry said the steps countered Palestinian Authority land registration efforts in areas where Israel maintains civil and military control.
The measures follow years of accusations by Palestinians that actions by settlers and the military — campaigns of violence, harassment and demolitions — have pushed them from their land.
The decisions have drawn widespread condemnation as violations of international law, including from countries involved in the ceasefire process in the Gaza Strip and Trump’s Board of Peace.
Saudi Arabia’s Foreign Ministry in a statement on Monday said the measures were part of Israel’s effort to impose a “new legal and administrative reality” that undermines prospects for peace and stability. Egypt’s Foreign Ministry called the move a “flagrant violation” of international law, warning it would escalate tensions in the Palestinian territories and across the region.
U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres condemned Israel’s decision, calling it not only destabilizing but unlawful according to the International Court of Justice, the U.N.’s highest tribunal, his spokesman Stéphane Dujarric said.

Robert Duvall, Oscar-winning actor and ‘Godfather’ mainstay, dead at 95
LOS ANGELES (AP) — Robert Duvall, the Oscar-winning actor of matchless versatility and dedication whose classic roles included the intrepid consigliere of the first two “Godfather” movies and the over-the-hill country music singer in “Tender Mercies,” has died at age 95.
Duvall died “peacefully” at his home Sunday in Middleburg, Virginia, according to an announcement from his publicist and from a statement posted on his Facebook page by his wife, Luciana Duvall.
“To the world, he was an Academy Award-winning actor, a director, a storyteller. To me, he was simply everything,” Luciana Duvall wrote. “His passion for his craft was matched only by his deep love for characters, a great meal, and holding court. For each of his many roles, Bob gave everything to his characters and to the truth of the human spirit they represented.”
The bald, wiry Duvall didn’t have leading man looks, but few “character actors” enjoyed such a long, rewarding and unpredictable career, in leading and supporting roles, from an itinerant preacher to Josef Stalin. Beginning with his 1962 film debut as Boo Radley, the reclusive neighbor in “To Kill a Mockingbird,” Duvall created a gallery of unforgettable portrayals. They earned him seven Academy Award nominations and the best actor prize for “Tender Mercies,” which came out in 1983. He also won four Golden Globes, including one for playing the philosophical cattle-drive boss in the 1989 miniseries “Lonesome Dove,” a role he often cited as his favorite.
In 2005, Duvall was awarded a National Medal of Arts.
He had been acting for some 20 years when “The Godfather,” released in 1972, established him as one of the most in-demand performers of Hollywood. He had made a previous film, “The Rain People,” with Francis Coppola, and the director chose him to play Tom Hagen in the mafia epic that featured Al Pacino and Marlon Brando among others. Duvall was a master of subtlety as an Irishman among Italians, rarely at the center of a scene, but often listening and advising in the background, an irreplaceable thread through the saga of the Corleone crime family.
“Stars and Italians alike depend on his efficiency, his tidying up around their grand gestures, his being the perfect shortstop on a team of personality sluggers,” wrote the critic David Thomson. “Was there ever a role better designed for its actor than that of Tom Hagen in both parts of ‘The Godfather?’”
In another Coppola film, “Apocalypse Now,” Duvall was wildly out front, the embodiment of deranged masculinity as Lieutenant Colonel Bill Kilgore, who with equal vigor enjoyed surfing and bombing raids on the Viet Cong. Duvall required few takes for one of the most famous passages in movie history, barked out on the battlefield by a bare-chested, cavalry-hatted Kilgore: “I love the smell of napalm in the morning. You know, one time we had a hill bombed, for 12 hours. When it was all over, I walked up. We didn’t find one of ‘em, not one stinkin’ dink body.
“The smell, you know that gasoline smell, the whole hill. Smelled like — victory.”
Coppola once commented about Duvall: “Actors click into character at different times — the first week, third week. Bobby’s hot after one or two takes.”
Honored, but still hungry
He was Oscar-nominated as supporting actor for “The Godfather” and “Apocalypse Now,” but a dispute over money led him to turn down the third Godfather epic, a loss deeply felt by critics, fans and “Godfather” colleagues. Duvall would complain publicly about being offered less than his co-stars.
Fellow actors marveled at Duvall’s studious research and planning, and his coiled energy. Michael Caine, who co-starred with him in the 2003 “Secondhand Lions,” once told The Associated Press: “Before a big scene, Bobby just sits there, absolutely quiet; you know when not to talk to him.” Anyone who disturbed him would suffer the well-known Duvall temper, famously on display during the filming of the John Wayne Western “True Grit,” when Duvall seethed at director Henry Hathaway’s advice to “tense up” before a scene.
Duvall was awarded an Oscar in 1984 for his leading role as the troubled singer and songwriter Mac Sledge in “Tender Mercies,” a prize he accepted while clad in a cowboy tuxedo with Western tie. In 1998, he was nominated for best actor in “The Apostle,” a drama about a wayward Southern evangelist which he wrote, directed, starred in, produced and largely financed. With customary thoroughness, he visited dozens of country churches and spent 12 years writing the script and trying to get it made.
Among other notable roles: the outlaw gang leader who gets ambushed by John Wayne in “True Grit"; Jesse James in “The Great Northfield Minnesota Raid"; the pious and beleaguered Frank Burns in “M-A-S-H"; the TV hatchet man in “Network"; Dr. Watson in “The Seven-Per-Cent Solution"; and the sadistic father in “The Great Santini.”
“When I was doing ‘Colors’ in 1988 with Sean Penn, someone asked me how I do it all these years, keep it fresh. Well, if you don’t overwork, have some hobbies, you can do it and stay hungry even if you’re not really hungry,” Duvall told The Associated Press in 1990.
In his mid-80s, he received a supporting Oscar nomination as the title character of the 2014 release “The Judge,” in which he is accused of causing a death in a hit-and-run accident. More recent films included “Widows” and “12 Mighty Orphans.”
Ungifted in school, gifted on stage
Robert Selden Duvall grew up in the Navy towns of Annapolis and the San Diego area, where he was born in 1931. He spent time in other cities as his father, who rose to be an admiral, was assigned to various duties.
The boy’s experience helped in his adult profession as he learned the nuances of regional speech and observed the psyche of military men, which he would portray in several films.
Duvall reportedly used his Navy officer father as the basis for his portrayal of the explosive militarist in “The Great Santini,” based on the Pat Conroy novel. He commented in 2003: “My dad was a gentleman but a seether, a stern, blustery guy, and away a lot of the time.” Bobby took after his mother, an amateur actress, in playing a guitar and performing. He was a wrestler like his father and enjoyed besting kids older than himself.
He lacked the concentration for schoolwork and nearly flunked out of Principia College in Elsah, Illinois. His despairing parents decided he needed something to keep him in college so he wouldn’t be drafted for the Korean War. “They recommended acting as an expedient thing to get through,” he recalled. “I’m glad they did.” He flourished in drama classes.
“Way back when I was in college,” Duvall told the AP in 1990, “there was a wonderful man named Frank Parker, who had been a dancer in World War I. We did a full-length mime play and I played a Harlequin clown. I really liked that.
“Then, I played an older guy in ‘All My Sons,’ and at one point I had this emotional moment, where this emotion was pouring out. Parker said at that moment he didn’t think acting can be carried any further than that. And this guy was a very critical guy. So I thought, at that moment at least, this is what I wanted to do.”
After two years in the Army, he used the G.I. Bill to finance his studies at the Neighborhood Playhouse in New York, hanging out with such other young hopefuls as Robert Morse, Gene Hackman and Dustin Hoffman. After a one-night performance in “A View From the Bridge,” Duvall began getting offers for work in TV series, among them “The Naked City” and “The Defenders.”
Between his high-paying jobs in major productions, Duvall devoted himself to directing personal projects: a documentary about a prairie family, “We’re Not the Jet Set”; a film about gypsies, “Angelo, My Love”; and “Assassination Tango,” in which he also starred.
Duvall had been a tango dancer since seeing the musical “Tango Argentina” in the 1980s and visited in Argentina dozens of times to study the dance and the culture. The result was the 2003 release about a hit man with a passion for tango.
His co-star was Luciana Pedraza, 42 years his junior, whom he married in 2005. Duvall’s three previous marriages — to Barbara Benjamin, Gail Youngs and Sharon Brophy — ended in divorce.

Godfather and Apocalypse Now actor Robert Duvall dies aged 95

LOS ANGELES - Robert Duvall, who played the smooth mafia lawyer in The Godfather and stole the show with his depiction of a surfing-crazed colonel in Apocalypse Now, has died at the age of 95, his wife said on Feb 16.
His death on Feb 15 was confirmed by his wife Luciana Duvall.
“Yesterday we said goodbye to my beloved husband, cherished friend, and one of the greatest actors of our time. Bob passed away peacefully at home,” she wrote.
Blunt-talking, prolific and glitz-averse, Duvall won an Oscar for best actor and was nominated six other times. Over his six decades-long career, he shone in both lead and supporting roles, and eventually became a director.
“To the world, he was an Academy Award-winning actor, a director, a storyteller. To me, he was simply everything,” Mrs Luciana Duvall said. “His passion for his craft was matched only by his deep love for characters, a great meal, and holding court.”
Duvall won his Academy Award in 1983 for playing a washed-up country singer in Tender Mercies.
But his most memorable characters also included the soft-spoken, loyal mob consigliere Tom Hagen in the first two installments of The Godfather and the maniacal Lieutenant Colonel William Kilgore in Francis Ford Coppola’s 1979 Vietnam War epic Apocalypse Now.
The latter, which earned Duvall an Oscar nomination and made him a bona fide star after years playing lesser roles, sees him utter what is now one of cinema’s most famous lines.
“I love the smell of napalm in the morning,” his war-loving character – bare chested, cocky and sporting a big black cowboy hat – muses as low-flying US warplanes bomb a beachfront tree line where he wants to go surfing.
That character was originally created to be even more over the top – his name was at first supposed to be Colonel Carnage – but Duvall had it toned down, demonstrating his meticulous approach to acting.
“I did my homework,” Duvall told veteran talk show host Larry King in 2015. “I did my research.”
Duvall was sort of a late bloomer in Hollywood – he was already 31 when he delivered his breakout performance as the mysterious recluse Boo Radley in the 1962 film adaptation of Harper Lee’s novel To Kill a Mockingbird.
He would go on to play myriad roles – a bullying corporate executive in Network (1976), a Marine officer who treats his family like soldiers in The Great Santini (1979), and then his star turn in Tender Mercies.
Duvall often said his favourite role, however, was one he played in a 1989 TV mini-series – the grizzled, wise-cracking Texas Ranger-turned-cowboy Augustus McCrae in Lonesome Dove, based on the novel by Larry McMurtry.
Film critic Elaine Mancini once described Duvall as “the most technically proficient, the most versatile, and the most convincing actor on the screen in the United States.” AFP

Report: Lebanese army sets 8-month timeline for Hezbollah disarmament north of Litani River

The Lebanese army has set a timeline of four to eight months to complete the second phase of weapons consolidation in southern Lebanon, including the disarmament of Hezbollah north of the Litani River, Lebanese media reported Monday.
Army commander Gen. Rudolph Haykal presented the timeframe to the Lebanese government during a briefing on the monthly progress of the weapons collection plan. According to reports, the timeline could be extended if necessary.
Lebanese military sources told the Qatari newspaper Al-Araby Al-Jadeed that Haykal did not set a firm deadline for collecting weapons north of the Litani but stressed the need to complete the process quickly.
The remarks come about a month after the Lebanese army announced it had completed the dismantling of Hezbollah weapons south of the Litani River, a claim rejected by Israel.
The developments unfold amid a diplomatic stalemate and Hezbollah’s continued refusal to hand over its weapons, arguing that U.N. Security Council Resolution 1701 applies only to areas south of the Litani.
Several key dates are expected to shape the next phase. A committee overseeing the ceasefire monitoring mechanism is scheduled to meet on the 25th of the month. On March 5, France is set to host a conference in support of the Lebanese army and security forces.
Hezbollah Secretary-General Naim Qassem on Monday criticized the Lebanese government’s focus on weapons consolidation, calling it “a grave mistake” that serves “the goals of the Israeli enemy.”
Speaking at an event commemorating leaders of the group, Qassem said responsibility for resistance in Lebanon rests with “the state, the army and the people,” and urged continued opposition to what he described as occupation.
“If you want to surrender, amend the constitution,” Qassem said, arguing that it mandates taking all necessary measures to liberate Lebanese territory. He called for national unity and full sovereignty but opposed efforts to centralize weapons under state control.
“The government is responsible for the enemy’s greed because of its continuous concessions,” Qassem said, adding that Hezbollah does not seek war but is prepared to defend itself. “There is a big difference between defense and initiating a war.”
Meanwhile, the military in Israel said it carried out a strike in the Tulousa area of southern Lebanon targeting a Hezbollah member. Lebanese reports said one person was killed in a strike on a vehicle, identifying him as Ahmad Tarmas.
Early Sunday, the military said it struck sites used to store weapons and launchers belonging to Hezbollah. Strikes targeting what Israel describes as Hezbollah’s attempts to rebuild its capabilities have continued daily through airstrikes, drone attacks on vehicles and artillery fire, amid the lack of diplomatic progress.

Europe must strengthen Ukraine for Putin to take negotiations seriously – German expert
German political scientist and managing partner of the Berlin think tank Liberale Moderne Ralph Fücks said this in a comment to Ukrinform.
"This only gives Putin time to continue his war of destruction and prevents Europeans from truly making all efforts to militarily strengthen Ukraine, which is the only path to peace," Fücks said.
He believes it is obvious that Putin is not interested in peace. "The Russian leader will take negotiations seriously only when he is on the defensive militarily," the expert said.
According to Fücks, U.S. President Donald Trump merely wants to make a deal with Putin, ideally before the U.S. midterm elections. "He wants to be able to present himself as a peacemaker at Ukraine's expense, and so he simply pressures Zelensky – the one who is being attacked," Fücks said.
However, Europeans could do much more, he said, such as protecting the airspace, at least over western Ukraine, from Russian drones and missiles. They could supply Ukraine with long-range guided missiles, such as Taurus, which could be used to strike Russian military infrastructure deep inside Russia. They could finally "paralyze" Russia's shadow fleet in the Baltic Sea and thereby further reduce the Russian regime's oil revenues.
"All of this would likely change Putin's calculations. So we have levers of influence that we are not using, either because we are afraid of being drawn into the war or because we do not want to disrupt negotiations, and that is exactly the essence of Putin's calculation," the expert said.
He stressed that Europeans finally need not only to say the right things but also to act. "So far, at various conferences, such as the recently concluded Munich Security Conference, they proclaim that '‘we stand with Ukraine, we must do everything possible for Ukraine.' But in reality, very little is happening," Fücks said.
He stressed that looking at which European countries provide Ukraine with military support, it becomes clear that Germany and the United Kingdom provide a lot, but measured against GDP, the Scandinavian countries, the Baltic states, and the Netherlands are much more resolute than Germany. Not to mention France. Even Poland has reduced its support.
"So among Europeans there is such a gap between words and actions that it is hard to understand. We need a European Coalition of the Willing, which will take the initiative and not wait for others, and also not wait for Trump," the expert said.
He added that Europeans will be taken seriously only when they begin acting in this way. "Currently, Europeans are really not at the negotiating table. But we are not at the negotiating table because neither Trump nor Putin actually take us seriously. And that is our fault," Fücks said.
As reported, the next round of trilateral talks between Ukraine, the U.S., and Russia is scheduled for February 17-18 in Geneva.

Israel’s 'land grab' in occupied West Bank flagrant violation of international law: UN
Unknown

UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Monday condemned Israel's decision to classify areas of the occupied West Bank as “state property.”
"The Secretary-General condemns the Israeli government’s Feb. 15 decision to resume land registration procedures in Area C of the occupied West Bank, following a cabinet decision in May 2025," said Guterres' spokesperson Stephane Dujarric during a news conference, warning that the move could dispossess Palestinians of their property and expand Israeli control over land in the area.
"Such measures, including Israel’s continued presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, are not only destabilising but, as recalled by the International Court of Justice, unlawful," Dujarric said.
The statement came a day after the Israeli government approved a proposal to register Palestinian land in the West Bank as "state property".
Israel’s public broadcaster reported that Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, Justice Minister Yariv Levin and Defence Minister Israel Katz submitted the proposal.
Palestinians view the measures as a prelude to the formal annexation of the West Bank and a step toward the de facto annexation of large parts of the territory, moves they say would undermine the two-state solution endorsed by the UN.
Calling on Israel to "immediately reverse these measures", Guterres warned that "the current trajectory on the ground is eroding the prospect for the two-state solution."
"The Secretary-General reiterates that all Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and the regime associated with them, have no legal validity and are in flagrant violation of international law and relevant UN resolutions," Dujarric told the press.
He also stated that Guterres called on all sides to "preserve the only path to lasting peace, a negotiated two-state solution, in line with relevant Security Council resolutions and international law."
Oslo Accords
The current administrative structure of the occupied West Bank largely stems from the 1993 Oslo Accords, which divided the territory into Areas A, B and C.
Area A, comprising about 18 percent of the occupied West Bank, includes major Palestinian cities and is under Palestinian civil and security control.
Area B, accounting for roughly 22–23 percent of the territory, falls under Palestinian civil administration with Israeli security control.
Area C, which covers around 60 percent of the occupied West Bank, remains under full Israeli occupation and contains most of the land reserves for future Palestinian urban growth, agriculture and grazing, according to the United Nations.
Roughly 150,000 Palestinians live in Area C.

Gazans who fled the enclave face traumatic return

When Rotana Al-Raqb stepped off the bus and set foot in Gaza on February 2, cameras trained on her, she could not hold back her emotions. Cries and tears intermingled. "No one should leave Gaza! No to forced exile!" she repeated, embracing her family after 11 months apart. The footage, captured by Palestinian journalists, spread rapidly on social media – Israel has barred foreign press from entering the enclave for the past 28 months.
Rotana, age 31, was among the first Gazans allowed to return to the Gaza Strip following the reopening of the Rafah border crossing with Egypt on February 2, after one year and nine months of closure imposed by Israel. As the only exit point to the outside world, Rafah's reopening had been highly anticipated and was supposed to take place during the first phase of the ceasefire agreement reached between Israel and Hamas on October 9. However, Israel made this deadline conditional on the return of all Israeli hostages, both dead and alive, held by Hamas in the enclave, a condition that was finally met on January 26.
On the bus chartered by the United Nations that was taking her and 11 other passengers to Nasser Hospital in Khan Yunis, Rotana had promised herself she would remain silent. "But when I saw all those eyes on me, I couldn't stay quiet anymore. I had to get the message across: This journey is a nightmare," said the mother, reached by Le Monde over the phone from Gaza. In March 2025, she went to Egypt with her mother, who needed cardiac treatment, but her husband and five children were not allowed to travel with her. Rotana, like many Gazans returning home, had to endure a grueling journey marked by humiliation and intimidation.

India sentences 3 to death for rape of Israeli and Indian women, killing of Indian man
Judge says ‘extreme brutality’ of crime merits punishment; in March 2025, the three attacked a group of 5 tourists stargazing near canal, pushed men into water, raped women
An Indian court on Monday sentenced three men to death for gang raping an Israeli woman and an Indian woman and for killing an Indian man, according to news outlets in the South Asian country.
In the March 2025 incident, a group of three men allegedly attacked a group of five people that included an Israeli woman and an American man who were on a stargazing outing.
According to the NDTV Indian news outlet, the three assailants were sentenced to death by a district court in the southwest state of Karnataka, after being found guilty last year of murder, gang rape, and robbery.
The English-language newspaper, The Hindu, identified the three as Handi Malla, 22, Chaitannay Sai, 21, and Sharanappa Sharanabasavaraj, 27.
According to the paper, the judge “noted the extreme brutality” of the crime, and underscored that “such heinous crimes” against Indian citizens and tourists merit the death penalty.
The sentence is pending confirmation from a higher court, reports added.

The attack happened when a 29-year-old Indian woman, who was hosting travelers, took her guests, two Indian men, an American man, and a 27-year-old Israeli woman, on a stargazing trip at the Tungabhadra Canal.
According to Indian media reports, the five were sitting and playing guitar by the canal when three men on a motorbike approached the group and asked for directions to a gas station, before demanding money.
The three attackers then pushed the three men into the canal and sexually assaulted the two women. One of the Indian men, Bhibash Kumar Nayak, 26, drowned.
The attackers also stole some of the group’s personal belongings and fled. They were found by police and arrested days later in the neighboring state of Tamil Nadu.
There were 31,000 reported rapes in India in 2022, the latest year for which data is available — nearly 90 per day. Several high-profile cases of rape and murder in recent years led to widespread protests.

Ukrainian Drones to be Equipped with French SAR Radars Capable of Operating Through Clouds and Fog

Ukrainian UAVs will be equipped with reconnaissance SAR radars from the French company Harmattan AI, which will enable reconnaissance even in the presence of clouds or fog.
This was announced by the CEO of Harmattan AI in an interview with Le Grand Continent.
According to him, Harmattan AI has developed a sensor that is unique in the world — a SAR radar for drones weighing less than 150 kilograms. This system will be integrated into Ukrainian systems and deployed in Ukraine.
He also noted that European manufacturers have a lot to learn from certain Ukrainian systems or certain Ukrainian manufacturers who have years of war behind them — not only since 2022, but since 2014. They have created an industry that changes every week: they have built proximity to the modern battlefield and its limitations, and this has prompted them to develop system resilience.
“Industrial cooperation is often viewed from a mercantile perspective: since some companies sell defense systems and there is a war going on, we should go and sell them there. Such a rather crude contract is undoubtedly appropriate — both for Ukrainians and for us — but it is also interesting to collect data and draw industrial and technological conclusions in order to learn what the modern theater of war is like. This involves, in particular, understanding the limitations of electronic warfare: when it is no longer possible to communicate via radio waves or position oneself using GPS, how should one act on the modern battlefield?” he explains.
In his opinion, sometimes you have to admit that the enemy is the best, and the defense sector has historically never been able to accept this. This realization is new: war has changed its form. It has become statistical. Therefore, the proportion of systems capable of operating above a certain level of capability is important.
It is not necessary for 100% of their systems to work. It is much more important that a significant proportion of the systems supplied work. Supplying 1,000 systems, 100% of which function, is much less useful than supplying 100,000 systems, 80% of which work.
This issue concerns not only production or its quality, but also the definition of the product and the program itself. Government agencies responsible for arms procurement need to completely change their approach to system procurement: it is no longer necessary to strive to completely eliminate the risks of system development. Instead, it should be recognized that fast delivery of a product is better than delivery of a perfect product — speed has become more important than quality.
“The real strategic weapon of World War II was not the bomber, but the factory. In the US, Germany, or anywhere else, all the parties that survived the war relied on it,” he emphasized.
SAR radar (synthetic aperture radar) is an active remote sensing system that uses microwave radiation to create highly detailed images of the Earth’s surface. It allows you to obtain images of territories in any weather conditions: during rain or fog, day or night.
According to the Harmattan AI website, the Sahara SAR radar can take images with a resolution of 0.25 m at a distance of 2 km and 1.2 m at a distance of 10 km. At the same time, the radar module weighs less than 3.5 kg.
It is not disclosed which Ukrainian drones will be equipped with French radars. However, it is known that in October 2025, the Ukrainian aviation holding Skyeton and the French defense company Harmattan AI announced a strategic partnership. As part of the cooperation, in particular, it is planned to integrate Harmattan AI’s sensor technologies with Skyeton’s Raybird drone.
Ukrainian companies are also working on similar developments. In 2020, Radionix presented a compact SAR radar for UAVs. It is known that at the time of the demonstration, it had already been tested on Skyeton’s Raybird-3 UAV.

BRUSSELS — Ireland on Monday sounded the alarm over a new group of Europe’s largest six economies, dubbed “E6,” amid fears that smaller countries’ interests could be bulldozed.
“I am conscious, and I say this very respectfully, a lot of the countries in that E6 will have different views on some fundamental issues,” Irish Finance Minister Simon Harris said ahead of a meeting with his eurozone peers in Brussels.
“I would much rather see a structure where countries come together on issues where they share a common view rather than the entry to the club being based on your size exclusively,” he said.

BRUSSELS — As the EU dithered over its Latin American trade pact, Donald Trump slipped past and moved the cheese.
A bilateral deal between the U.S. president and populist fellow traveler Javier Milei of Argentina is calling into question hard-won protections for signature European products in the EU’s trade agreement with the Mercosur bloc.
At a moment when Brussels is hoping to show its promise of free trade flows can be a counterweight to Trump’s threats and aggression, the EU’s internal divisions are once again hobbling its bid to wield influence in the Western hemisphere.

Anti-Zionist groups in Canada target Jewish children’s summer camps
Activists accuse youth programs of supporting a ‘genocidal state’; campaign marks new front in global campaign targeting Israel
Luke Tress is The Times of Israel's New York correspondent.
Anti-Zionist groups in Canada last week launched a campaign against Jewish children’s summer camps, marking a new front in activists’ global effort to dismantle the Jewish state and demonize its supporters.
A coalition of Canadian leftist and pro-Palestinian organizations announced the campaign seeking to strip accreditation from Jewish children’s summer camps due to their support for “a genocidal state.”
The campaign targeted at least 17 camps across Canada, in Ontario, Quebec, Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, and Nova Scotia.
“They pose a problem because they encourage support for a genocidal, settler-colonial state,” the campaign said of the camps, which serve children in elementary school, middle school and high school.
The campaign cited the camps for alleged offenses, such as celebrating Israel’s Independence Day and Memorial Day, staffers visiting Israel, and employment of IDF veterans.
A camp in Quebec, for example, employed a woman as a counselor who had served as a social worker in the IDF. Another camp’s director was decried as a “Zionist who publicly supports Israel.” A camp in Ontario was attacked for cultural “appropriation” for using za’atar, a Middle Eastern spice.
The groups supporting the effort included the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) campaign targeting Israel, the Palestinian Canadian Congress, the anti-Israel group Just Peace Advocates, the Ontario Palestinian Rights Association, and PAJU Montreal.
Children’s camps in Canada must meet a set of standards to gain accreditation from provincial camp associations. The accreditation is a stamp of approval that means the camps meet standards for safety, health, staffing, and programming.
The campaign against the Jewish camps instructed supporters to contact provincial camp accreditors to demand that the Jewish camps lose their accreditation.
Organizers said more than 800 letters had been sent to camp associations.
Anti-Zionist groups have widened their net in recent years to targets including Jewish and Israel-affiliated nonprofits, university clubs, comedy shows, and synagogues.
The latest campaign appeared to mark the first time anti-Zionist activists held an organized, concerted effort targeting Jewish children’s camps.
The campaigners argue they are fighting against “genocide” by Israel, while opponents say the activities amount to de facto stigmatization of Jews.
Anti-Zionist activists have incessantly accused Israel of “genocide” since the Hamas invasion of Israel in October 2023. Genocide is an international crime with a strict legal definition, and international courts have not found that Israel committed the crime.
Some groups have sought to expand the legal definition of genocide to condemn the Jewish state.
The rhetoric used by the anti-Zionists has steadily escalated. In recent months, protesters chanted for Hamas outside a New York synagogue for the first time, and demonstrators in Philadelphia hanged effigies of Israeli soldiers.
The escalating rhetoric also illustrated the international nature of the campaign against Israel, where tactics adopted in one country are often followed elsewhere. After a hip-hop group in the UK led a crowd in chants of “Death to the IDF” last year, for example, the chant began appearing at protests in the US.
Jews are targeted in hate crimes more than any other group in Canada, a figure that surged following the start of the Gaza war. Recent incidents include gunfire at synagogues, violent chants at a Holocaust museum, antisemitic bullying of schoolchildren, support for terrorism on college campuses, and attempted kidnappings of Jewish women.
The announcement targeting the summer camps sparked alarm from Jewish groups.
The UJA Federation of Greater Toronto called the campaign an attempt to “bully and harass” the camps.
“This direct targeting of Jewish campers and staff is a deliberate act of intimidation,” the federation said in a statement.
The Ontario Camps Association, a non-Jewish group that accredits camps, decried the statements as “deeply concerning.”
“…Certain characterizations and claims, we believe, reflect rhetoric that is discriminatory and antisemitic in nature,” the association said in a statement. “Campaigns such as these can be a dangerous expression of the singular demonization and wholesale attempt at the delegitimization of one minority group and have no place in camp culture or elsewhere.”
The association said it was engaging with Jewish groups to evaluate the situation.

Germany and France intend to purchase Polish Piorun man-portable air defense systems as part of the SAFE program.
According to Defence24, Deputy Minister of National Defence Cezary Tomczyk announced Germany’s interest at a press conference last Friday, while France’s interest was revealed by the Polish publication’s own sources.
In the case of the French order, some of the MANPADS will be supplied to the Security and Defense Forces of Ukraine. This accounts for about 70% of the systems purchased by France.
If the agreements are finalized, Germany and France will join the users of MANPADS, which already include Belgium, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Norway, Sweden, the United States, and Ukraine.
Ukraine has been successfully using Polish MANPADS in combat since 2022 and has shot down a number of Russian helicopters, aircraft, cruise missiles, and drones with their help. Read more about this in the article.
Piorun MANPADS is a Polish anti-aircraft system developed by Mesko (leader), CRW Telesystem-Mesko, and the Military University of Technology.
It can engage aircraft, helicopters, unmanned aerial vehicles, or other flying objects at ranges from 400 m to 6.5 km and altitudes from 10 m to 4 km.

SSU Detained Perpetrators of February 11 Terrorist Attack in Kyiv

The SSU apprehended Russian agents who blew up a car in Kyiv on February 11 this year.
The Security Service of Ukraine reported this on its social media.
The perpetrators are a 47-year-old Ukrainian Armed Forces serviceman recruited by the enemy, who left his place of service in the Sumy region without permission, and his 29-year-old accomplice from Kyiv.
Russian special services purchased a used van through front men and ordered it to be converted into a supposed ambulance for transporting wounded Defense Forces soldiers.
“To do this, the car sellers installed oxygen and gas cylinders in the vehicle’s interior and equipped it with a webcam with remote access, which was then used by Russian special services,” the SSU reported.
The ‘order’ was carried out by a 47-year-old Ukrainian Armed Forces serviceman recruited by the enemy, who had left his place of service in the Sumy region without permission. After fleeing the garrison, the deserter ‘went underground’ in western Ukraine.
He enlisted the help of a 29-year-old accomplice from Kyiv, whom he introduced as a Ukrainian special services agent, and instructed him to make a homemade explosive device (HED) with remote activation.
The perpetrators first loaded the van with explosives and then blew it up while it was parked next to one of the SSU facilities.
“Gas cylinder equipment was supposed to be used to increase the destructive power of the explosion, and the Russians used video equipment to monitor the parking of the van at the site of the planned terrorist attack,” the SSU said in a statement.
After making the explosive device, the suspects placed it inside the van and quickly left the location. Russian special services then remotely detonated the vehicle.
As a result of comprehensive measures taken jointly with the National Police, investigators from the SSU Main Directorate in Kyiv and the Kyiv region, and under the procedural guidance of the prosecutor’s office, the organizers of the terrorist attack were detained within 24 hours.
“During searches of the temporary residences of the perpetrators, components for a homemade bomb, video surveillance cameras, and SIM cards were found, which were being prepared for new terrorist attacks,” the SSU reported.
Currently, Security Service investigators have notified both agents of their suspicion under Part 2 of Article 258 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine (terrorist act). The detainees are in custody. They face up to 12 years in prison with confiscation of property.

Takamitsu Muraoka, Japanese pioneer of Dead Sea Scrolls Hebrew studies, dies at 88
A prominent specialist in Semitic languages, Muraoka was proud to describe himself as the first Japanese student to complete a PhD at the Hebrew University
Japanese pioneer Hebraist Takamitsu Muraoka died last week in Leiden, the Netherlands, at age 88, after suffering a stroke a few weeks earlier and never fully recovering.
A specialist in Semitic languages and biblical Hebrew, Muraoka was proud to describe himself as the first Japanese student to complete a doctorate at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, according to Steven Fassberg, the Caspar Levias Professor of Ancient Semitic Languages at the Hebrew University’s Department of Hebrew Language, who knew Muraoka since the early 1990s.
The Japanese scholar, he added, advanced the study of the Dead Sea Scrolls from a linguistic perspective and remained connected to Israel and in close contact with Israeli scholars for the rest of his life, even as he moved across the world to pursue his academic career, teaching at Manchester University in the United Kingdom, at Melbourne University in Australia, and finally at Leiden University, until he retired some 20 years ago.
“[Muraoka] did a doctorate with [prominent Semitic Languages Professor] Chaim Rabin, which was published years later as a book called ‘Emphatic words and structures in Biblical Hebrew,’” Fassberg told The Times of Israel over the telephone. “While he was doing his doctoral work, he took courses with all the greats at the university at the time.”
Fassberg explained that although Muraoka’s thesis was on biblical Hebrew, he also became an expert in Aramaic. By the end of his career, he knew several ancient and modern languages.
“He was a polyglot,” Fassberg said. “His English was impeccable. His Hebrew was excellent. He knew French and German. When he went to the Netherlands, he learned Dutch so he could lecture in Dutch. And, of course, he knew the ancient languages, Greek, Aramaic, Ugaritic… He was a very, very impressive scholar.”
Both during his active career and after he retired, Muraoka remained a prolific researcher, publishing dozens of academic works.
“He updated a grammar of biblical Hebrew that had been written in French in 1923, translated it into English, and it has become a classic since it appeared in the 1990s,” Fassberg said. “He was very interested in Septuagint studies, and he published a grammar of Aramaic in the Dead Sea Scrolls and wrote a syntax of the Hebrew of the Dead Sea Scrolls.”
According to Fassberg, Muraoka was instrumental in promoting the study of the Dead Sea Scrolls – a collection of approximately 1,000 biblical and non-biblical scrolls dating between the 3rd century BCE and 1st century CE – from a linguistic perspective in the early 1990s. That’s also how they met.
“He had recently moved to Leiden from Melbourne, and he had two graduate students, one working on the Dead Sea Scrolls, and one on the book of Ben Sira,” he said, referring to the 2nd century BCE Hebrew work known as wisdom literature that is part of the Catholic biblical canon (but not of the Jewish or Protestant ones).
“He organized an international conference on the Hebrew of the Dead Sea Scrolls and in Ben Sira, and invited several people, and I was lucky enough to be one of them,” he added.
In the following years, several additional conferences on the topic were organized in different universities across the world.
“These conferences and this renewed interest in studying the Hebrew of the Dead Sea Scrolls and of Ben Sira, were all due to him because up until then, the Dead Sea Scrolls, of course, had been studied intensely and extensively, but people hadn’t really been all that interested in the language,” Fassberg said. “Some scholars were interested, but Muraoka really wanted to stress the language of the scrolls and encourage the study of the language, and he was very successful in doing so.”
The Japanese expert maintained close ties with Israel and Israeli academics.
“He was very much concerned about what was happening in Israel,” Fassberg recalled. “I remember emails [on the topic] all the way back to the assassination of Rabin [in 1995]. After Rabin was assassinated, he wrote to me that he had heard that [Rabin] had a song written on a piece of paper in his pocket when he was assassinated, and he wanted to know what the song was. In a later email, he asked me about certain words in the song. He knew modern Hebrew very well. He even published in modern Hebrew and translated at least one story by [Israeli writer Shai] Agnon into Japanese.”
Muraoka was in touch with Fassberg also in the weeks after the Hamas attack on October 7, 2023, to inquire about his well-being and his family.
“He was upset and concerned,” Fassberg recalled.
They last exchanged emails about a year ago.
Muraoka was also a devout Christian, although according to Fassberg, this never influenced his academic work.
“He was a believer, but you would never know it from reading any of his academic work,” he noted.
After he retired, Muraoka often traveled to the Far East to teach biblical Hebrew in Christian seminaries, especially in countries where occupying Japanese forces committed atrocities during the Second World War.
“He was terribly upset and embarrassed by the Japanese occupation, and this was his way of atoning for it,” Fassberg said.
Although Muraoka was born in Hiroshima in 1938, just a few years before the US dropped an atomic bomb on the city at the end of the war in 1945, he never shared publicly what happened to him or his family during that period, as far as Fassberg knows.
On a personal level, according to the Israeli professor, Muraoka was reserved but always available to his colleagues.
“He was wonderful, always extremely helpful,” Fassberg said. “If you crack the outer veneer, he had a sense of humor.”
“He will be missed,” he added.
If so, we have a request.

Top Netanyahu aide: Hamas will have 60 days to disarm or IDF will ‘complete’ mission

Top Netanyahu aide: Hamas will have 60 days to disarm or IDF will ‘complete’ mission
Cabinet secretary does not specify start date for 2-month period, echoes PM in saying Hamas must give up AK-47 rifles; IDF: Troops kill 6 more terrorists from Rafah tunnels
Israel plans to afford Hamas a 60-day period to disarm, and if it does not, the Israeli military will go back to war in the Gaza Strip, a senior adviser to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Monday.
Cabinet Secretary Yossi Fuchs made the statement a day after the premier asserted that the terror group must give up its small arms as part of the disarmament process, including its AK-47 rifles — after some reports that the terror group might be allowed to hold onto its rifles for now.
Speaking in Jerusalem to the Besheva Group conference, Fuchs said that the Trump Administration had asked for a 60-day period, and “we are respecting that.”
Fuchs clarified that he is unsure when the 60-day period starts, but it may begin with Thursday’s Board of Peace conference.
During that time, Hamas “will have to give up all of its weapons,” including rifles, he said, asserting that the terror group’s AK-47s “will be taken from them entirely.”
“We will evaluate it,” he said. “If it works, great. If not, then the IDF will have to complete the mission.”
He added that it was a “reasonable estimate” that before Israel’s next election — which is currently set for October but could be moved up to June — either Hamas will have given up its weapons or the IDF will be in the midst of an intensive new military campaign in Gaza.
Fuchs said there were many Gaza tunnels that also needed to be destroyed as part of the process.
“Today, whoever plows the fields in Be’eri sees the sea,” he says of the Gaza border kibbutz invaded and brutalized by Hamas on October 7, 2023. “There is barely a building left standing in the Gaza Strip, but the work is not yet completed.”
A day earlier, Netanyahu said that disarmament means Hamas “must give up its weapons, not [just] its main weapons,” asserting that “the one that does the most damage is called an AK-47.”
“That’s what they used in the massacre of October 7,” the prime minister said, adding that the group still holds some 60,000 rifles in Gaza.
A report in The New York Times last week said Hamas would be allowed to keep “some small arms,” at least initially, while surrendering all weapons that are “capable of striking Israel,” according to a draft plan drawn up by officials involved in the US-led Board of Peace.
According to the report, a team including US envoys Steve Witkoff, Jared Kushner and Nickolay Mladenov, the Board of Peace’s Gaza envoy, plans on sharing the document in question with Hamas in the coming weeks.
IDF: Troops kill 6 terrorists from Rafah tunnels
Meanwhile, inside Gaza, the IDF on Sunday said it had killed six more Hamas terror operatives who have been holed up for months in a tunnel in southern Gaza’s Rafah, on the Israeli side of the ceasefire line.
Dozens of Hamas operatives trapped on the Israeli side of the so-called “Yellow Line” diving Gaza in accordance with the October 2025 ceasefire agreement were believed by the military to have been there since the collapse of a previous truce in the Strip in early 2025.
The IDF has reported killing or capturing some 50 of them in recent months.
According to the military, troops of the 7th Armored Brigade carried out several “significant actions” in the tunnels in the eastern Rafah area in the past week, “in order to eliminate additional terrorists residing there.”
A week ago, the IDF said troops exchanged fire with several gunmen who emerged from a tunnel in the area.
In an update, the military said that on Sunday, during scans of the area, it was confirmed that three gunmen were killed in that exchange of fire, and the bodies of six more were located after they were “eliminated as part of the operations carried out along the tunnel route.”
The IDF said it is continuing to operate in the area “to eliminate the terrorists in the tunnel routes.”
Elsewhere in the Strip, the IDF said late Sunday night that it struck terror operatives who engaged in “suspicious activity on the ground” and approached troops in the northern Gaza Strip earlier in the day.
According to the IDF, troops of the Gaza Division’s Northern Brigade identified the operatives on the Israeli side of the Yellow Line. The army said that in addition to “carrying out suspicious activity on the ground,” the operatives approached the soldiers “in a manner that posed an immediate threat.”
After they were identified, the Israeli Air Force struck and “eliminated two of the terrorists to remove the threat,” the IDF said. It did not specify what happened to the others.
Since the start of the ceasefire in October, the IDF has said it has killed dozens of terror operatives and other “suspects” who have crossed the Yellow Line and approached troops. Such incidents have taken place on a near-daily basis.

Russian Intelligence Uses Former Wagner Group Recruiters for Sabotage in Europe

Russian special services have begun using a network of recruiters and propagandists from the former Wagner Group to organize sabotage operations in European countries.
According to Western intelligence, after the death of Yevgeny Prigozhin, the group’s structures were integrated into the operations of the Main Directorate of the General Staff of the Russian Federation (GRU), reports the Financial Times.
Now, instead of looking for volunteers for the front, these units are focused on recruiting Europeans to carry out sabotage operations on NATO territory.
The main targets of recruiters are economically vulnerable and marginalized residents of European countries. Using established channels on Telegram and other social networks, operatives offer money for setting fire to warehouses with aid for Ukraine, politicians’ cars, or for spreading disinformation.
Western officials call such agents ‘disposable’ because they have no special training and are easily replaceable in case of failure.
The use of intermediaries from the Wagner network allows Russian intelligence to create several levels of cover between themselves and the direct perpetrators. This allows the Kremlin to deny involvement in the attacks.
Although the FSB more often turns to criminal circles and diasporas, it is Wagner’s tools that have proven to be more effective for mass recruitment through online platforms.
Western intelligence services note the high adaptability of Wagner propagandists to working with foreign audiences. Thanks to the experience of ‘troll factories’ in St. Petersburg, they create attractive content for young people prone to radicalization. Anonymous recruiters operate through encrypted chats, where they find people willing to commit crimes for quick money.
One example of such activity was the arson attack on a warehouse in London in March 2024. At that time, 21-year-old local resident Dylan Earl, recruited by Wagner structures through social media, recruited four other people to carry out the attack.
Last year, he was sentenced to 23 years in prison. The court emphasized that the hidden hand of the internet allowed anonymous proxy agents to radicalize British citizens.
Having lost a significant portion of its spies in Europe, the GUG is forced to rely on cruder and less covert methods of operation. This gives European security agencies a certain advantage, as the use of amateurs leads to poor-quality operational planning.
Currently, most sabotage attempts are detected and prevented in time. However, European intelligence services continue to gather data on an extensive network of ‘disposable’ agents across the continent. The main goal of these attacks remains unchanged — to weaken the determination of Western countries to support Ukraine and provoke social instability within Europe.

Radev Will Form a Government “One Way or Another,” Says Former Spokesman

Bulgaria Adds 20 New Vehicles to Boost Protection of Natura 2000 Sites

Anton Kutev, former spokesperson for three caretaker governments, expressed confidence that former President Rumen Radev will secure a victory in the upcoming elections and establish a government regardless of circumstances. Speaking on Nova News, Kutev emphasized his readiness to support Radev’s political project, though he acknowledged that his direct participation remains uncertain.

“I do not know if I will be invited to join Radev’s initiative, but I would certainly like to contribute, as it seems both useful and meaningful. We have an opportunity to change the country, though whether we succeed remains to be seen. Even without a formal role, I am prepared to assist in any way possible,” Kutev stated. He also noted that participation is not limited to being on electoral lists.
At present, Radev has not revealed details about his project, including its name, potential partners, or who might hold the mandate, citing tight deadlines for registering a new party. Since his January 30 appearance on BNT’s “Panorama,” the president has communicated mainly through Facebook and his press office, leaving the public largely uninformed about potential coalition plans.
Recent polling by Market Links, conducted February 7-13, indicates that Radev’s forthcoming party enjoys 25.6 percent support. Other parties likely to enter parliament include GERB, “We Continue the Change-Democratic Bulgaria,” DPS-New Beginning, and “Revival.” Pollsters note that 18 percent of respondents remain undecided, representing roughly 700,000 potential votes.

Meanwhile, the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP) faces uncertainty following the appointment of Krum Zarkov as its new leader on February 7. Zarkov, a former MP, acting Minister of Justice, and Radev’s former secretary for legal affairs, has sought to distance the party from Peevski’s New Beginning. Despite previous disagreements between Zarkov and Radev over the euro referendum, their split was not acrimonious, leading to speculation that the Socialist Party could align with the presidential project - a notion Zarkov has publicly denied.

Kutev echoed this assessment, suggesting that BSP will prioritize establishing its own identity rather than forming ties with Radev. “I believe the BSP will look to assert its independence and avoid alliances with Radev. A coalition is unlikely, as it would compromise their identity. The first question is whether they even secure parliamentary representation,” he concluded.

British Museum removes some references to ‘Palestine’ after accuracy complaints
UK Lawyers for Israel prompts change, arguing applying name to periods when no such entity existed risks ‘obscuring the history of Israel and the Jewish people’
The British Museum in London has removed some references to “Palestine” and people of “Palestinian descent” in some of its displays and is reviewing more cases, deeming them historically inaccurate and no longer neutral, following complaints by a pro-Israel group.
UK Lawyers for Israel (UKLFI) said in a statement Saturday that it had raised concerns about using the term in gallery panels and labels describing the ancient Levant and Egypt.
The group said it wrote to the museum’s director, Nicholas Cullinan, that “several maps and descriptions retroactively apply the term ‘Palestine’ to periods in which no such entity existed and risk obscuring the history of Israel and the Jewish people.”
Applying a single name across thousands of years “erases historical changes and creates a false impression of continuity,” it argued, asking for the terminology to be amended “so regions are referred to by historically accurate names such as Canaan, the Kingdoms of Israel and Judah, or Judea, depending on the period being described.”
A variation of the name Palestine, which the Romans gave to the Land of Israel in the 2nd century CE, was first documented in Greek literature in the 5th century CE. It is believed to be named after the Philistines, an ancient non-Semitic people mentioned in the Bible.
UKLFI said in its statement that a spokesperson for the British Museum replied that it was “in the processes of reviewing and updating panels and labels on a case-by-case basis. For example, the information panels in the Levant gallery, covering the period 2000-300 BC, have all been updated to describe in some detail the history of Canaan and the Canaanites and the rise of the kingdoms of Judah and Israel using those names. A revised text devoted to the Phoenicians was installed in early 2025.”
One of the examples given was a panel in the Egypt galleries having been changed from “Palestinian descent” to “Canaanite descent.”
“The Museum’s spokesperson explained that the larger graphic panels and maps require significantly more coordination and resources and cannot be updated and replaced at once, given their importance for visitor navigation of the gallery,” UKLFI added. “This work is being scheduled with designers and interpreters but, because of the scale and cost, will be implemented in phases over the coming years as part of the Museum’s long-term Masterplan redevelopment.”
The museum itself confirmed making the alterations, telling media outlets that “for the Middle East galleries for maps showing ancient cultural regions, the term ‘Canaan’ is relevant for the southern Levant in the later second millennium BCE. We use the UN terminology on maps that show modern boundaries, for example, Gaza, West Bank, Israel, Jordan, and refer to ‘Palestinian’ as a cultural or ethnographic identifier where appropriate.”
Since the changes have been made, thousands have signed an online petition urging the museum to reverse them.
Reacting to the museum’s actions, UKLFI said: “We welcome the British Museum’s willingness to review and amend terminology which is inaccurate or liable to convey an incorrect meaning today. The finding of its audience testing, that the term ‘Palestine’ is in some circumstances no longer meaningful, is relevant to and should be taken on board by other museums and cultural institutions.”

Nazi-Linked Lukovmarsh Took Place in Sofia After Court Overturned City Ban
A procession in memory of Gen. Hristo Lukov took place in Sofia on Saturday, after a court decision lifted the municipality’s ban on the event.
Bulgarian State Railways (BDZ) is offering a special retro train experience from Sofia to Bankya on 1 March to celebrate Baba Marta Day, one of Bulgaria’s most beloved springtime traditions. Passengers will travel aboard historic railcar No. 19 001.7, a diesel unit built in 1960 that was once reserved for high-ranking state officials and remains notable for its advanced technical features for the era. The festively decorated train will operate two return trips during the day.
The first journey departs Sofia Central Station at 09:50 and arrives in Bankya at 10:15, with the return leaving at 11:40 to reach Sofia at 12:05. The second trip sets off from Sofia at 13:00, reaching Bankya at 13:25, and returns at 14:25, arriving back in Sofia at 14:50. Travelers can combine the ride with a stroll through Bankya’s park and town centre, both within easy reach of the station.
Tickets are sold as return journeys with reserved seating and can be purchased at station ticket offices, railway bureaux nationwide, or online. Prices are €22 (43.03 leva) for adults and €11 (21.51 leva) for children under 10, with availability limited.
Baba Marta, celebrated annually on 1 March, marks the farewell to winter and the welcoming of spring. Central to the tradition are Martenitsas, red and white twisted thread ornaments symbolizing health, happiness, and protection against evil spirits. These are exchanged with friends, family, and colleagues and are typically worn on the wrist or clothing. In some mountain villages, Martenitsas are also used to decorate homes and animals.
Traditional Martenitsas often feature two small dolls, Pizho and Penda. Pizho, the male figure, is usually white, while Penda, the female figure, is red and distinguished by her skirt. The threads used can be wool, silk, or cotton, reflecting the enduring cultural significance and charm of this centuries-old Bulgarian custom.
Today, February 14, Bulgarians across the country are raising their glasses to celebrate Trifon Zarezan, the traditional holiday honoring the patron saint of vineyards and wine.
The Bulgarian Orthodox Church today commemorates Saint Agatha the Martyr. On this day, people bearing the names Dobrin, Dobromir, Dobri, as well as women with related female names, mark their name day.

The Sofia Court of Appeals has reduced the sentence of Orlin Vladimirov, convicted of murdering his wife Evgenia, from life imprisonment to 20 years. Evgenia, 33, was discovered in a suitcase submerged in a pond in late 2021. Orlin Vladimirov and his father, Plamen Vladimirov, were both originally sentenced to life in prison by the Sofia Court of Appeals in 2023.
In December 2024, the Supreme Court of Cassation overturned these life sentences, citing procedural concerns, and sent the case back for a retrial before a new panel at the Court of Appeals. Following the new hearing, the court issued a 20-year prison term for Orlin Vladimirov, while his father Plamen was acquitted.
The court noted that procedural violations had occurred during the original trial. Specifically, evidence involving police officers’ reconstructions of “operational conversations” with the defendants had been improperly excluded from the discussion.
The verdict is not yet final. Julian Lefterov, the prosecutor, remarked that one member of the panel had issued a special opinion that is well-argued and consistent with decisions from other Supreme Court panels, suggesting that there are no obstacles to further questioning of witnesses.
Lyudmil Rangelov, representing the victim’s family, expressed the profound grief caused by the case, stating, “Each of you can imagine what it means to have your child's life interrupted in this way. There is no measure of suffering.”

Hamas used emojis to signal operatives to prepare for Oct. 7 assault
IDF investigation finds same string of pictograms was sent to phones of terrorists on two prior instances when Hamas had intended to launch onslaught
Emanuel (Mannie) Fabian is The Times of Israel's military correspondent
Hamas used a sequence of emojis sent to its operatives’ phones as a coded signal to prepare to launch the October 7, 2023, terror onslaught, it was revealed on Monday.
The revelation was first reported by Channel 12 news and approved for publication by the Military Censor, more than two years after the attack.
It is believed that the sequence of emojis was used to instruct members of Hamas’s elite Nukhba Force to equip their phones with Israeli SIM cards to be used in Israeli territory, to gather at various staging grounds — including in homes, mosques, and tunnels — and to prepare their weapons for the attack.
At 9 p.m. on October 6, 2023, the Shin Bet security agency identified a handful of Israeli SIM cards in the hands of Hamas Nukhba terrorists being activated.
The SIM cards were being monitored by the Shin Bet, and the agency updated IDF intelligence officials on the development. Later that night, more SIM cards were activated, totaling several dozen.
On phones seized from Hamas terrorists who invaded Israel on October 7, the IDF identified that the same string of emojis was sent on two previous instances in which Hamas intended to launch its large-scale attack, in May 2023 and September 2022.

In May 2023, the Shin Bet also identified dozens of Israeli SIM cards in the hands of Hamas terrorists being activated, though ultimately the terror group did not launch the attack then.
The use of the emojis by Hamas to notify its terrorists to prepare to launch the onslaught was only discovered retrospectively as part of the IDF’s investigations into October 7 and was not identified in real time.
The IDF’s investigations into the failures of October 7 found that the military’s conduct, decision-making, and the intelligence it possessed on the night between October 6 and 7 were based on the results of years of false assessments about Hamas.
As a result, intelligence officials on all levels failed to provide a warning for what would come. Hamas’s October 7 attack claimed the lives of more than 1,200 people in Israel, mostly civilians, with another 251 people kidnapped and much of the area devastated. It launched the war in Gaza, which raged until an October 2025 ceasefire that has largely held, though violence has continued.

Rubio to Hungary’s PM Orban ahead of election: ‘Your success is our success’
Top US diplomat’s meetings with populist leaders of Hungary and Slovakia come on heels of his call in Munich confab for Europeans to get on board with Trump’s immigration agenda
BUDAPEST, Hungary — US Secretary of State Marco Rubio hailed Viktor Orban’s leadership during a visit to Budapest on Monday, ahead of elections threatening the nationalist Hungarian prime minister’s hold on power.
Rubio’s visit is the final stage of a whirlwind trip to Europe that also saw him address the Munich Security Conference and visit another right-wing ally, Slovakian Prime Minister Robert Fico.
US President Donald Trump has made no secret of his high regard for Orban, saying in a social media post on Friday that the prime minister, accused of leading a democratic backslide during his 16 years in power, had produced “phenomenal” results in Hungary.
But Orban, 62, has a fight on his hands for the April 12 legislative elections in Hungary. Polls suggest his Fidesz party is trailing opposition leader Peter Magyar’s TISZA.
“I can say to you with confidence that President Trump is deeply committed to your success because your success is our success,” Rubio said during a joint press conference with Orban after their meeting.
“The president has an extraordinarily close relationship to the prime minister, he does, and it has had tangible benefits,” he said.

Orban said the government “will be created after the election in Hungary based on the intention of the Hungarians.”
“Sometimes I lose, sometimes I win,” said Orban.
“So don’t be afraid [of] what will be if we are not winning because it’s regularly happened here,” he added.
In a speech on Saturday, Orban insisted he would keep up his fight against “pseudo-civil organizations, bought journalists, judges, politicians” — echoing similar Trump tirades in the United States.
He also took aim at the “oppressive machinery of Brussels,” another jibe at the European Union’s leadership, with whom he has long been at loggerheads on a host of issues.
Orban has provoked the ire of EU leaders who accuse him of silencing critical voices in the judiciary, academia, media and civil society. They also accuse him of going after minorities.
Adding to tensions with the EU is the close relationship Orban has maintained with Russia’s President Vladimir Putin — another thing the Hungarian prime minister has in common with Trump.
European Commission spokesperson, Paula Pinho, told reporters at a press briefing that it was “up to the United States government to decide whom, when, and how they support — or not.”
Rubio arrived in Budapest on Sunday for the talks on Monday, before flying back to Washington.
The decision to visit Fico and Orban, two nationalist leaders close to both Trump and Putin and out of step with the EU consensus, sends a clear diplomatic message.
In his speech on Saturday to the Munich Security Conference, Rubio called on Europe to join Trump in his fight to defend Western civilization from the threat of mass immigration.
He tried, too, to reassure European leaders over the US position on NATO, and on Greenland — with mixed success.
But if his main message was that Europe should get behind the vision of the US president, in Bratislava on Sunday he stressed: “We’re not asking Europe to be a vassal of the United States.”
“We want to be your partner. We want to work with Europe. We want to work with our allies.”
Orban is one of several leaders to have announced he will travel to Washington this week for the inaugural meeting of Trump’s controversial “Board of Peace” — which critics see as an instrument designed to undermine the UN Security Council.
Orban became a hero to many Trump supporters for his hostility to migration during the Syrian refugee crisis a decade ago. He has made several visits to Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.
Energy was also on the agenda in Monday’s talks, just as it was in Slovakia.
When Orban visited the White House in 2025, Trump granted Hungary an exemption from sanctions imposed on Russian oil and gas imports over Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine.

NATO Will Strike Russia If It Attacks Baltics, Says Foreign Ministry of Estonia

The Foreign Minister of Estonia has stated that NATO is ready to respond harshly in the event of Russian aggression against the Baltic states.
He made these comments in an interview with The Telegraph.
According to the Foreign Minister, a possible attack by Russia would not be limited to a local conflict. The Alliance is considering scenarios for strikes on Russian territory.
This involves potential air strikes ‘deep inside Russia.’ This approach is positioned as an element of deterrence.
The minister stressed that the Baltic states have their own defense plans. They do not involve passively waiting for help.
Tallinn considers scenarios of rapid occupation of the region to be outdated. These assessments are based on growth in defense spending.
Estonia and its neighbors have declared investments of up to 5% of GDP. The emphasis is on strengthening combat capabilities.
The statements were made in the context of discussions in NATO defense circles. They concern the risks of potential escalation after the war in Ukraine.
Previously, a series of military simulations modeled rapid offensive actions by the Russian Federation. In some scenarios, Russia achieved tactical successes.
Baltic officials have criticized such models. They called such assessments politicized and unrealistic.
Official Tallinn insists on the concept of immediate repulsion. It involves deterring the aggressor from the very first hours of the conflict.
We would like to remind you that recently, Militarnyi mentioned joint defense procurement and rearmament strategies of the Baltic states.

Russian Forces Capture Rivne and Press Further Toward Pokrovsk

Civilian Deaths in Ukraine Surge 26% in 2025 Amid Intensified Russian Strikes
Civilian casualties in Ukraine rose sharply during 2025, with the impact of bombings and missile strikes increasing by 26% compared to the previous year.
Russian forces have taken control of the village of Rivne, situated between Pokrovsk and Myrnohrad in Donetsk Oblast, according to DeepState, a Ukrainian monitoring and analytical group. The capture forms part of a broader Russian push in this section of the front line.
The analysts report that, in addition to occupying Rivne, Russian units have advanced further inside the cities of Pokrovsk and Myrnohrad, as well as in the nearby town of Rodynske. These movements indicate a continued effort by Moscow’s forces to expand their foothold around the Pokrovsk axis, which has remained one of the most contested areas in eastern Ukraine.
Despite the pressure, Ukrainian defenders have continued to resist. Over the past 24 hours alone, Ukrainian forces repelled 63 Russian attacks on the Pokrovsk front. However, the overall situation has remained tense, with sustained assaults and shifting control in and around urban areas.
Earlier this month, on Feb. 6, Colonel Volodymyr Polevyi, head of communications for the 7th Air Assault Corps, said Russian troops had seized key high ground in the Myrnohrad and Pokrovsk area. According to him, this development significantly complicated logistics for Ukraine’s Defense Forces operating in the sector.
Ukraine’s East troop grouping later reported that Russian forces were concentrating personnel and heavy equipment in preparation for a possible assault on Myrnohrad. At the same time, Ukrainian units were said to be holding their defensive positions and inflicting fire damage on advancing enemy forces. The grouping also stated that Ukrainian troops retained control of the northern part of Pokrovsk and were conducting search-and-assault operations against Russian units in built-up areas of the city.
On Feb. 9, DeepState warned that conditions around Pokrovsk were worsening, noting that Russian infantry had entered the northern part of the city while disorganized and intense fighting continued in Myrnohrad. The following day, the 7th Air Assault Corps reported renewed Russian attempts to expand their offensive in Pokrovsk, including infantry assaults on the village of Hryshyne in Donetsk Oblast.
US President Donald Trump said ahead of renewed trilateral negotiations in Geneva that Ukraine should join the talks without delay, warning that Kyiv “better come to the table fast.”
Civilian casualties in Ukraine rose sharply during 2025, with the impact of bombings and missile strikes increasing by 26% compared to the previous year.
A Bulgarian national fighting on the Russian side has been taken prisoner by Ukrainian forces during combat operations in eastern Ukraine,
Ukraine’s anti-corruption authorities have formally charged former energy minister Herman Halushchenko in what is described as the largest corruption case to emerge during President Volodymyr Zelensky’s time in office
The Kremlin has confirmed that the next round of peace talks aimed at ending the war in Ukraine will take place on February 17–18 in Geneva, Switzerland.
Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said that Europe’s “easiest path to victory” would be to stop providing financial assistance to Ukraine.

Istanbul court postpones hearing in İmamoğlu’s diploma case to July 6

An Istanbul criminal court on Feb. 16 adjourned the hearing in the case against Istanbul Mayor Ekrem İmamoğlu regarding allegations of official document forgery and an invalid university diploma to July 6, despite widespread anticipation that the prosecutor would deliver their final opinion.
İmamoğlu, who has been suspended from his post as mayor, stood trial for the fourth time on charges of “forgery of official documents committed in a chain.”
Prosecutors are seeking a prison sentence ranging from 2 years and 6 months to 8 years and 9 months.
İmamoğlu delivered a lengthy defense statement during the proceedings.
In his defense, İmamoğlu strongly rejected the accusations and argued that the proceedings were not truly about a diploma but part of a broader effort to sideline him from politics.
He criticized what he described as violations of the right to a fair trial and the principle of a natural judge, pointing to changes in the presiding judge during earlier hearings.
The case stems from a decision taken by Istanbul University on March 18 last year, when the university’s governing board annulled the undergraduate diplomas of 28 people, including İmamoğlu.
The university argued that in 1990, İmamoğlu had transferred improperly from Girne American University to Istanbul University’s Faculty of Business Administration English-language program.
One day after the diploma annulment, on March 19, İmamoğlu was detained at his home and was formally arrested on March 23.
İmamoğlu currently faces several ongoing investigations in addition to the alleged forgery of his university diploma, including those over the corruption allegations and insulting an expert witness as well as other offenses.

DEM Party delegation resumes İmralı talks with Öcalan

A delegation from the Peoples’ Equality and Democracy Party (DEM Party) visited imprisoned PKK leader Abdullah Öcalan on Feb. 16 on the İmralı prison island, marking another round of talks under Türkiye’s latest peace initiative.
MPs Pervin Buldan and Mithat Sancar, accompanied by lawyer Faik Özgür Erol, traveled to the high-security island off Istanbul for the meeting. The delegation last met Öcalan on Jan. 17.
The latest visit followed a Feb. 11 meeting in Ankara with President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. Senior officials attending that meeting included Efkan Ala, the vice chair of Erdoğan's ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP), and intelligence chief İbrahim Kalın. The talks lasted about an hour.
In a written statement, the delegation said the meeting confirmed a “shared will to continue the process with determination.”
“It was stated that the TBMM [parliament], relevant ministries and public institutions need to intensify their efforts to take concrete and reassuring steps regarding the ongoing process,” the statement said.
“It was emphasized that it is important for a legal framework that will encompass all segments of society and form the basis of Türkiye's democratic future to emerge without delay and with the broadest possible consensus.”
Momentum behind the initiative gained pace last year after Öcalan issued a call that prompted PKK to begin disarming. A first group of members publicly destroyed their weapons in July, and the terror group later announced plans to withdraw from Turkish territory in October.
A cross-party delegation previously visited Öcalan on Nov. 24, although representatives from the Republican People’s Party (CHP) and the New Path bloc did not join lawmakers from the AKP, the DEM Party and the Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) during that trip.

Man Who Found Bodies in Petrohan Lodge Left Bulgaria, Investigation Continues

Death, Deception, a "Cult": Inside Bulgaria's Disturbing Petrohan Investigation
In early February 2026, Bulgaria was rocked by a grim discovery that would spiral into one of the country's most disturbing cases in recent memory.
Deyan Iliev, the man who discovered the bodies in the Petrohan lodge on February 2 and subsequently alerted the police, has left Bulgaria, according to information published by 24 Chasa. Iliev found the bodies of 49-year-old Ivaylo Ivanov, 45-year-old Decho Iliev, and 51-year-old Plamen Stattev and formally reported the case to the Ministry of Interior before departing the country a few days later.
Concerns about Iliev’s whereabouts were publicly raised by Ralitsa Asenova, whose son Nikolay Zlatkov was found dead on February 8 beneath Okolchitsa Peak alongside Ivaylo Kalushev and 15-year-old Aleksandar Makulev. Speaking on Nova TV, Asenova said Iliev had informed her about the deaths in the Petrohan lodge but had not mentioned that the victims had gunshot wounds. She also voiced serious concern, saying she had been unable to contact Iliev or his partner.
It later became clear that Iliev, known by the nickname “the Mexican,” left for Mexico last week. As there are no direct flights from Bulgaria, he first traveled to Spain. His destination is linked to his personal life, as he lives with a Mexican woman named Lola. The two previously lived together in a house in the village of Gintsi, located near the mountain rangers’ base and closest to the Petrohan lodge.
A day before discovering the bodies, Iliev received a message from Ivaylo Kalushev reading: “Goodbye, friend, we are very tired and have no more strength.” Iliev passed this information on to the Ministry of Interior. He was questioned twice and cooperated with investigators before leaving the country.
Iliev became part of Ivaylo Kalushev’s inner circle when he was 16 years old. He later took part in boat journeys to Mexico, a fact confirmed by Valeri Andreev, who has stated that he had sexual relations with Kalushev while still a minor. In recent years, however, Iliev appears to have distanced himself from the most closely initiated members of the group associated with the so-called cult of Lama Ivo, likely due to his relationship with his Mexican partner.
There are records of Iliev’s activities in Mexico until 2024, when he rented a house in the Tulum area. In 2025, he purchased a property in the village of Gintsi, near the Petrohan lodge. His family background has also drawn attention. His father, Delcho Danailov Iliev, was recruited as a counterintelligence agent in 1987, according to data from the Commission on Files. He served in the same department to which Georgi Kalushev, the father of Ivaylo Kalushev, was later transferred.
Meanwhile, investigators have stepped up their work related to Ivaylo Kalushev. Teams from the Criminal Police at the Burgas Regional Directorate of the Ministry of Interior, together with officers from the Tsarevo regional unit, are searching Kalushev’s house in the Burgas village of Bulgari, as reported by bTV and BNR. Law enforcement entered the property for the first time, having previously only inspected it from outside. The operation is focused on locating documents, while devices storing video surveillance footage are also expected to be seized, with reports indicating there are nearly ten cameras on the premises.
The bodies found on February 2 in the Petrohan lodge were followed a week later by another grim discovery. Under Okolchitsa Peak, investigators found three more bodies in an abandoned camper: 51-year-old Ivaylo Kalushev, 22-year-old Nikolay Zlatkov, and 15-year-old Aleksandar Makulev. The investigation established that between January 27 and 31, the three had been staying in the village of Bulgari before heading toward the Vratsa Balkan.
Residents of Bulgari said that shortly before leaving, Kalushev, Zlatkov, and the teenager had been repairing a water tap in the yard of the property. Their departure was described as abrupt, as they left the water shaft open and did not close the gate to the yard. A specialized locksmith team was later brought in to help open the house.
The property in Bulgari was purchased by Ivaylo Kalushev in 2022 and was used as a base for his organization near the sea. Neighbors said the previous owner was Russian. A check in the Property Register shows that Kalushev had acquired a total of 21 properties across Bulgaria over the years through purchases, donations, and inheritance. His largest asset was the Petrohan lodge itself, near which he bought five acres of land from the Ministry of Agriculture in 2021 for 4,918 leva, or about 2,514 euros. Outside Bulgaria, Kalushev also owned real estate in Mexico.
The Sofia Court of Appeals has reduced the sentence of Orlin Vladimirov, convicted of murdering his wife Evgenia, from life imprisonment to 20 years
The car and the entrance to the home of Samuil Popov, mayor of the village of Bistritsa, were deliberately set on fire in the early hours of the morning, shortly after 1:30 a.m.
In early February 2026, Bulgaria was rocked by a grim discovery that would spiral into one of the country's most disturbing cases in recent memory.
A fatal knife attack took place early this morning in Sofia’s Poduyane district, leaving one person dead and two others seriously injured, according to information from police and emergency services.
Authorities in the Bulgarian town of Lovech have disclosed the results of a major operation targeting the distribution of counterfeit currency.
A 19-year-old has been formally charged by the Sofia District Prosecutor's Office for attacking two minors on the Sofia metro. The victims, aged 13 and 15, suffered injuries during the incident on February 8.

More from The Daily Briefing
While the prospect of American intervention in Iran appears to be receding, Horovitz discusses the mixed signals from the US and Iran and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s repeated remarks that Israel has multiple requirements for any deal that might take shape.
As election season nears, Horovitz reviews the latest efforts by the prime minister to minimize the blame attached to him for October 7, including recasting the war in Gaza as a war of revival, with that term used on the gravestones of the fallen.
Following a Haredi riot in the Tel Aviv suburb of Bnei Brak in which a mob attacked two young female soldiers visiting an ultra-Orthodox draftee, Horovitz discusses the riot, the lack of an immediate response from the police, and the idea that IDF soldiers can’t move around freely in Israel.
Finally, Horovitz and Steinberg discuss some of the latest issues facing the former hostages, as some choose to share the atrocities of their captivity, others have taken to crowdfunding to raise funds for their rehabilitation, and many are staying firmly out of the public eye.

The Fourth Law has raised a new round of strategic investment from the U.S. technology group Axon.
The funding will accelerate the development of artificial intelligence solutions for unmanned systems, the company told Militarnyi.
The partnership focuses on autonomy technologies designed for the combat deployment of drones.
Founded in Kyiv in 2023, The Fourth Law specializes in AI and robotics for defense and public safety.
Its flagship products are already in use by the Ukrainian military, including the Lupynis-10-TFL-1 unmanned aerial vehicle and the TFL-1 autonomy module.
According to the developers, Level 1 autonomy increases the effectiveness of FPV missions by 2–4 times, while raising the platform’s cost by approximately 10%.
A separate line of development is the TFL-Anti-Shahed module. The solution is designed for interceptor drones.
The system uses on-the-edge AI to detect attack UAVs. Its algorithms analyze the target’s thermal signature, movement, and other parameters.
The technology is platform-agnostic. The modules can be integrated into unmanned systems from different manufacturers and are compatible with various communication channels.
The company’s founder, Yaroslav Azhniuk, said the investment will be directed toward R&D, with priority given to developing autonomous counter-drone solutions.
Rick Smith, CEO of Axon, noted the rapid pace of development in Ukraine’s unmanned technologies. He emphasized the importance of a real combat environment for the fast evolution of AI systems.
The company said the teams were introduced through Brave1. The partnership is viewed as an example of attracting international investors to Ukraine’s defense tech sector.
Notably, Brave1 recently funded AI-based developments capable of autonomously targeting and eliminating Russian infantry.

Rubio Tells Orban: Trump Is “Deeply Committed” to Hungary’s Success as Ties Enter “Golden Age”

Orban: Europe Can “Win” by Cutting Aid to Ukraine
Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said that Europe’s “easiest path to victory” would be to stop providing financial assistance to Ukraine.
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said President Donald Trump is “deeply committed” to the success of Hungary and its prime minister, Viktor Orban, during a visit to Budapest. Rubio described relations between the two countries as exceptionally strong, arguing that the close personal ties between Trump and Orban are the key reason behind the current state of US–Hungarian cooperation.
According to Rubio, the relationship has entered what he called a “golden era,” not simply because of shared views between societies, but because of the direct and growing bond between the two leaders. He said there should be no doubt about Trump’s attitude toward Orban, recalling their interaction during Trump’s first presidential term and stressing that the connection has become even closer during his second term. Rubio underlined that Washington views Hungary’s success as directly linked to its own interests, particularly in Central Europe, and said Trump would take a personal interest if Hungary faced economic difficulties, obstacles to growth, or threats to stability.
Rubio also addressed questions about Hungary’s expanding cooperation with China, a strategic rival of the United States. He said countries inevitably pursue their own national interests, even when these do not fully align with those of their allies. The US, he stressed, does not expect any country to isolate itself from others and understands that geography, history, economic realities, and future challenges shape national decisions. Rubio added that while Washington raises concerns with partners, engagement with China is unavoidable, noting that the US itself maintains relations with Beijing and that Trump is expected to travel there in April. He said it would be unrealistic for two major global powers to avoid contact, even though serious differences remain.
Hungary has become a significant destination for Chinese trade and investment, with Budapest actively seeking Chinese capital through tax incentives and infrastructure support. This policy has drawn attention in Washington, but Rubio framed it as part of Hungary’s sovereign economic strategy rather than a point of confrontation.
On the war in Ukraine, Rubio said the United States appears to be the only country capable of bringing Ukraine and Russia to the negotiating table. He argued that neither the United Nations nor European countries have succeeded in doing so. Rubio emphasized that Washington is not attempting to impose a settlement or force either side into an unwanted agreement, but wants to help end a conflict he described as extremely destructive. He said Trump has invested significant time and political capital into peace efforts, even though negotiations have stalled over key issues, particularly territorial demands, where Russia continues to hold firm positions.
Rubio also linked past US decisions directly to the Trump–Orban relationship. He said the one-year exemption Hungary received from US sanctions last year, allowing it to continue using Russian oil and gas, was granted because of the close ties between the two leaders. According to Rubio, Washington wants Hungary’s economy to perform well and sees this as serving US national interests, especially while Orban remains in office. Hungary’s continued dependence on Russian energy since the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 has drawn criticism from several EU and NATO partners.
Rejecting claims that Hungary is becoming internationally isolated, Rubio pointed to sustained US corporate investment, crediting what he described as strong leadership and a business-friendly environment. He highlighted energy as a key sector for further bilateral cooperation. He also said US–Hungarian relations are as close as he could imagine, not just in rhetoric but in concrete actions, citing a newly signed agreement that builds on a meeting held at the White House in November. Rubio expressed hope that this agreement would be followed by many others.
For his part, Orban said Hungary would continue to back US-led peace initiatives aimed at ending the war in Ukraine. He repeated his view that the conflict would not have begun if Trump had been president at the time and argued that without Trump in office now, prospects for peace would be minimal. Orban added that Hungary remains willing to host a peace summit in Budapest if circumstances allow.
Orban acknowledged that Hungary has clashed with other Western partners over its approach to Russia, including its refusal to send weapons to Ukraine and its opposition to European Commission plans to phase out Russian gas and LNG imports by the end of 2027. These disagreements have contributed to ongoing tensions between Budapest and Brussels.
Describing ties with Washington, Orban said relations had entered a new “golden age” following Trump’s return to the White House. He said the current level of cooperation is unprecedented in his more than three decades in politics, both in terms of balance and friendliness. Orban thanked Trump personally and said that since January last year, 17 US investments have been approved in Hungary, a figure he described as a record over several decades. He also expressed appreciation for visa-free travel for Hungarians to the United States.

Iran FM meets with UN nuclear chief ahead of 2nd round of US talks, as IRGC holds drill

Iran FM meets with UN nuclear chief ahead of 2nd round of US talks, as IRGC holds drill
Araghchi vows ‘no submission before threats,’ as IRGC navy drills in Hormuz Strait amid US buildup; deputy Iranian FM says compromise on nuclear issue possible if US discusses sanctions relief
Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi met with Rafael Grossi, head of the United Nations nuclear watchdog, in Geneva on Monday, ahead of a second round of indirect nuclear talks there with the United States on Tuesday.
Araghchi said he would also meet with Omani Foreign Minister Badr al-Busaidi, whose country is mediating the talks and hosted their first round in Muscat on February 6.
The negotiations commenced amid a US naval buildup that sought to pressure Iran into reining in its nuclear program. On Monday, Iran’s Revolutionary Guards navy held a drill in the Hormuz Strait to test the readiness of operational forces in the face of “possible security and military threats,” semi-official Iranian news agency Tasnim reported.
Writing on X, Araghchi said he was in Geneva “with real ideas to achieve a fair and equitable deal” in the renewed indirect talks with US Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff and White House adviser Jared Kushner, President Donald Trump’s son-in-law.
“What is not on the table: submission before threats,” added Araghchi.
The meeting with Grossi was set to include “deep technical discussions” accompanied by nuclear experts, said Araghchi.
The IAEA has been calling on Iran for months to say what happened to its stockpile of 440 kilograms (970 pounds) of highly enriched uranium following US strikes on three key Iranian nuclear facilities during the 12-day Israel-Iran war in June, which put an end to previous US-Iran talks.
Araghchi’s direct meeting with Grossi is a significant step after Iran suspended all cooperation with the IAEA following the June war. The two also met briefly on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in September.
Iran’s stockpile of uranium enriched to 60 percent could allow the country to build as many as 10 nuclear bombs, should it decide to weaponize its program, Grossi previously told The Associated Press. He added that it doesn’t mean that Iran has such a weapon.
On Friday, Grossi told the Munich Security Conference that IAEA inspectors had returned to Iran since the war but have been unable to visit any of the facilities targeted by the US. He also said reaching a deal with Iran on inspection of its processing facilities was possible but “terribly difficult.”
While Iran, whose leaders are sworn to destroy Israel, denies seeking nuclear arms, it has enriched uranium to levels with no peaceful application, obstructed international inspectors from checking its nuclear facilities, and expanded its ballistic missile capabilities.
Iranian deputy FM: ‘The ball is in America’s court’
The second round of US-Iran talks comes after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu rushed to Washington last week to urge Trump to ensure that any deal would curtail Iran’s ballistic missile program and end its funding for proxy terror groups in the Middle East.
According to a CBS report Sunday, US-Israel discussions on possibly striking Iran’s missile facilities are ongoing, and Trump told Netanyahu in December that the US would back an Israeli strike on Iran’s ballistic missile program should talks fail.
Iran, for its part, has agreed to discuss only its nuclear program in the indirect talks with the US. The Islamic Republic has also refused to stop enriching uranium outright, as demanded by the US.
Iran’s Deputy Foreign Minister Majid Takht-Ravanchi signaled Sunday that Tehran could be open to compromise on the nuclear issue, but is looking for an easing of US-led international sanctions.
“The ball is in America’s court. They have to prove they want to have a deal with us,” Takht-Ravanchi told the BBC. “If we see a sincerity on their part, I am sure that we will be on a road to have an agreement.”
“We are ready to discuss this and other issues related to our program, provided that they are also ready to talk about the sanctions,” he added.

Trump initially threatened to take military action over Iran’s bloody crackdown on nationwide protests last month, but then shifted to a pressure campaign in recent weeks to try to get Tehran to make a deal over its nuclear program.
Trump said Friday the USS Gerald R. Ford, the world’s largest aircraft carrier, was being sent from the Caribbean to the Mideast to join other military assets the US has built up in the region. He also said a change in power in Iran “would be the best thing that could happen.”
Iran has threatened to attack Israel and US bases in the region in response to a US strike.

Shutting down buzz, Obama says no evidence aliens have made contact
Former US president clarifies he wasn’t saying he knows aliens exist during jocular interview, only that they likely do, but probably have not visited Earth
Former US president Barack Obama said he did not see evidence that aliens “have made contact with us,” after sending social media abuzz by saying aliens were real on a podcast over the weekend.
During a lightning round of questions with podcast host Brian Tyler Cohen, Obama was asked, “Are aliens real?”
“They’re real,” he answered, continuing: “But I haven’t seen them. And, they’re not being kept in Area 51.”
On Sunday, the former president released a statement on Instagram, appearing to clarify what he meant by his comments that have since gone viral.
“I was trying to stick with the spirit of the speed round, but since it’s gotten attention let me clarify. Statistically, the universe is so vast that the odds are good there’s life out there. But the distances between solar systems are so great that the chances we’ve been visited by aliens is low, and I saw no evidence during my presidency that extraterrestrials have made contact with us. Really!”
Secrecy around Area 51, a top-secret Cold War test site in the Nevada desert, has long fueled conspiracy theories among UFO enthusiasts.

In 2013, the CIA acknowledged the existence of the site, but not UFO crashes, black-eyed extraterrestrials or staged moon landings.
Declassified documents referred to the 575-square-mile (1,489-square-kilometer) installation by name after decades of US government officials refusing to acknowledge it.
The base has been a testing ground for a host of top-secret aircraft, including the U-2 in the 1950s and later the B-2 stealth bomber.

MEP: Constitutional Court Is the Safest Way for Bulgaria to Exit the Trump Board of Peace

Bulgaria Sees Strong Growth in New Car Sales
The market for brand new passenger cars in Bulgaria saw notable growth in 2025, according to data from the Association of Automobile Manufacturers and their authorized representatives
Bulgarian MEP Radan Kanev has argued that referring the agreement on the so called "Trump Board Peace" to the Constitutional Court is the most appropriate way for Bulgaria to withdraw from the format without provoking political tension with the United States. Speaking in a Dir.bg podcast, Kanev said the agreement signed by outgoing Prime Minister Rosen Zhelyazkov contradicts both the Bulgarian Constitution and EU treaties, while also placing Bulgaria in an isolating position within the Union.
According to the EPP representative, a constitutional review is likely and would provide a legally sound exit. Kanev also expects the newly elected 52nd National Assembly to reject ratification of the agreement altogether. In his view, this institutional approach would allow Bulgaria to disengage without escalating the issue diplomatically.
Kanev stressed that a request to the Constitutional Court offers a careful solution. He expressed confidence that the court would rule objectively that Bulgaria’s participation in such a format is not constitutionally permissible. At the same time, he acknowledged the political sensitivity of the move, remarking that there is a small risk of triggering an emotional reaction from US President Donald Trump, which is why the exit must be handled with caution.
Beyond the Board of Peace issue, the interview also addressed broader European topics. Kanev discussed the concept of a European Defence Union, which he said could push the EU toward deeper integration and federalisation. He warned against the idea of a two speed Europe and commented on the Union’s strategic focus on boosting competitiveness.
Among the key points highlighted were support for a common European defence framework without creating a single European army, expectations that the “Made in EU” industrial acceleration regulation will be adopted soon, and the emergence of the European Competitiveness Fund as a central element in the next multiannual financial framework. Kanev also noted that the European Parliament is preparing to vote on new safeguard measures aimed at protecting European agriculture under the Mercosur agreement.
An unofficial outline of the expected caretaker cabinet headed by Andrey Gyurov has begun to circulate, with multiple familiar political figures likely to return to government
Anton Kutev, former spokesperson for three caretaker governments, expressed confidence that former President Rumen Radev will secure a victory in the upcoming elections and establish a government regardless of circumstances
A new survey by the sociological agency Market Links shows that if parliamentary elections were held now, five political formations would enter the National Assembly, with the future coalition around Rumen Radev clearly in the lead
Former president Rumen Radev said he will announce the structure, name and program of the political formation with which he will take part in the upcoming early elections no later than March 4

Sofia Proposes New Admission Rules for Nurseries and Kindergartens

Nazi-Linked Lukovmarsh Took Place in Sofia After Court Overturned City Ban
A procession in memory of Gen. Hristo Lukov took place in Sofia on Saturday, after a court decision lifted the municipality’s ban on the event.
Sofia Municipality has proposed changes to the rules governing admission to nurseries and kindergartens in the Bulgarian capital. The draft amendments have been published for public consultation and are intended to revise both residency requirements and the way points are awarded in admission rankings. Under the current system, permanent address has carried greater weight, a balance the municipality now aims to adjust.
According to the proposal, a permanent or current address of one parent within Sofia Municipality that has remained unchanged for three years or more will bring 8 points. If the address has been changed within the past one to three years, it will carry 5 points, while a change within the last year will be awarded 3 points. The goal is to better reflect long-term residence without disproportionately disadvantaging certain families.
Deputy Mayor for Education Desislava Zhelyazkova said the existing approach has often worked unfairly against parents living in rented housing. Speaking on BNT, she noted that tenants who are unable to change their permanent address due to a landlord’s refusal have effectively been penalized through no fault of their own.
The point system for families in remote areas is also being updated. Children will receive an additional point when applying either to their designated kindergarten or to one located in a neighboring settlement, a measure aimed at easing access for families outside central districts.
Another significant change is the removal of the bonus point previously granted to children who had already attended a nursery. According to the municipality, this practice led to discrimination and blocked places that could otherwise be used, as some children formally occupied spots without actually attending. This amendment is scheduled to take effect next year.
The new rules also clarify procedures for admitting children whose parents are detained and who have no relatives able to care for them. While such provisions already existed, the municipality is removing the working group that reviewed these cases. Zhelyazkova explained that court rulings and official orders already require immediate placement of such children, making the additional review step unnecessary.
Among the longer-term policy directions is a plan to transfer nurseries to the Ministry of Education, alongside the introduction of an integrated early childhood development framework covering children from birth to the age of seven.
The municipality expects the revised admission rules to enter into force ahead of the next major ranking round for nurseries and kindergartens in Sofia.
The municipality of Pleven announced that schools will remain closed on Tuesday, February 3, due to forecasted extremely low temperatures and challenging winter conditions following heavy snowfall on February 1 and 2

Norway and Germany Sign Defense Pact to Strengthen Security in Northern Europe

Norway and Germany have signed a bilateral defense agreement known as the Hanseatic Agreement.
The signing ceremony took place during the Munich Security Conference and was attended by Norway’s Minister of Defence, Tore Sandvik, and his German counterpart.
The agreement formalizes a strategic partnership between the two countries. Its goal is to strengthen European security and ensure a fairer sharing of responsibilities within NATO.
The agreement covers five key areas of cooperation, including space surveillance and communications, maritime security in the North Atlantic, and land forces.
The two countries also plan to expand cooperation in the defense industry and develop mechanisms for the rapid deployment of reinforcements.
A central element of the maritime partnership is a joint submarine construction program. The Norwegian parliament has recently approved the purchase of two additional submarines, increasing the total number to six.
As a result, Norway and Germany will operate identical submarine fleets. In addition, the parties are jointly developing the promising long-range naval missile 3SM.
As part of strengthening its land forces, Norway is purchasing German Leopard 2A8 tanks. An important part of the contract is production localization: the Norwegian company Ritek will assemble 37 of the 54 ordered vehicles.
Operating the same main battle tanks will allow the armies of Norway and Germany to exchange experience more effectively in tactics, logistics, and personnel training.
Special attention under the Hanseatic Agreement is also given to the space sector. Norway and Germany are implementing joint technological projects, making use of the spaceport facilities on Andøya.
Space capabilities are viewed as a critically important element for ensuring modern military communications and targeting during joint operations.
German forces continue regular training on the territory of Norway, including as part of the upcoming winter exercise Cold Response 26. The parties are also discussing the possibility of pre-positioning German military equipment at Norwegian bases. This would reduce deployment time in the event of an escalation on the Alliance’s northern flank.

New settlement to ‘expand Jerusalem’ for first time since 1967

New settlement to ‘expand Jerusalem’ for first time since 1967
Left-wing group accuses government of ‘backdoor annexation’; West Bank regional council head lauds ‘realization of the settlement vision,’ says more such steps on the way
Jeremy Sharon is The Times of Israel’s legal affairs and settlements reporter
A recent development agreement signed by the state and the West Bank’s Mateh Binyamin Regional Council will, once given final approval, see the establishment of a new settlement that would in practice constitute the first expansion of Jerusalem since 1967.
The proposed settlement announced earlier this month would technically be a westward expansion of the Adam settlement, which lies very close to Jerusalem’s northeast boundary. It includes plans for the construction of some 2,780 housing units in a new “neighborhood” for Adam.
But the land on which the new settlement would be built is physically separated from Adam, first by Route 437, a major traffic artery, and second by the security barrier.
The proposed settlement would therefore have much greater territorial contiguity with the East Jerusalem neighborhood of Neve Yaakov, which is inside Jerusalem’s municipal boundaries, than with Adam.
It would not be a formal part of Jerusalem, and would officially be a neighborhood of Adam, although officials from the Peace Now organization claim that the new settlement would likely obtain at least some municipal services from Jerusalem.
The settlement would be built on 500 dunams of land between the Palestinian towns of Hizma and Al-Ram, and would involve an investment by the government of some NIS 120 million ($39 million) in order to construct the necessary infrastructure, public spaces and community institutions for the new development.
The plan has yet to be deposited with the Civil Administration’s Higher Planning Committee, meaning that full authorization could still take as long as two years.
Nevertheless, 500 housing units have already been marketed for the first phase of development, the Housing Ministry said.
“The agreement constitutes a significant step in continuing the development of the settlement and strengthening the settlement continuity in the area, while providing a response to the demand for housing in and around Jerusalem, and integrating a phased and balanced planning of new neighborhoods alongside the existing fabric,” the Housing and Construction Ministry said in a statement on February 3 announcing the development.
The Peace Now organization, which campaigns against the settlements, said that the new plans constituted a further form of annexation by the government and an unprecedented expansion of Jerusalem.
Following Israel’s conquest of East Jerusalem and the West Bank in the 1967 Six Day War, Knesset legislation and ministerial directives formally expanded the capital’s boundaries to their current position, taking in what had been Jordanian-controlled East Jerusalem. All neighborhoods built by Israel in East Jerusalem since that time, considered settlements by most of the international community, have been constructed inside those boundaries.
“This is the first time since 1967 that Jerusalem has been expanded into the West Bank,” asserted Peace Now.
“Under the pretext of a new settlement, the government is carrying out a backdoor annexation here. The new settlement will function for all intents and purposes as a neighborhood of the city of Jerusalem, and its planning as a ‘neighborhood’ of the Adam settlement is just an excuse and an attempt to conceal the move, the implication of which is the application of Israeli sovereignty to territories in the West Bank,” it said.
Democrats MK Gilad Kariv also condemned the move, describing it as “another unprecedented act of annexation that draws us closer to an explosion in the West Bank.”
Kariv said that he had written to Housing and Construction Minister Haim Katz about “the plan to expand Jerusalem over the Green Line and to de facto annex territory,” adding, “Annexation will bring about a security catastrophe.”
Mateh Binyamin Regional Council head Israel Ganz lauded the new development, describing it as “the realization of the settlement vision” for his region.
“The new plan will allow us to build thousands of housing units, while at the same time dramatically upgrading the quality of life of the residents,” said Ganz, adding that his council is “already working on additional agreements” that will “herald dramatic change on the ground.”

Russia Recruits More Foreign Mercenaries Amid Rising Losses

Russia is becoming increasingly dependent on foreign mercenaries due to mounting losses that it is unable to offset with its own recruits.
UK Defence Secretary John Healey stated this during the Munich Security Conference, Bloomberg reports.
According to him, the Kremlin is being forced to recruit thousands of fighters from India, Pakistan, Nepal, Cuba, Nigeria, and Senegal.
Healey emphasized that foreigners are often recruited through deception, without being warned that they will become part of the ‘Russian meat grinder’ on the front line. He also estimated the number of North Korean troops involved at 17,000.
“They are often recruited under false pretenses and coerced into service, without realizing they are destined to end up in Russia’s meat grinder on the front line,” the minister said.
UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer warned that Russia continues to rearm and rebuild its forces despite significant human losses.
He stressed that even if a peace agreement is signed, Russia’s militarization will only accelerate, posing an even greater threat to Europe. Western officials predict that Russia will be able to sustain combat operations throughout 2026.

Wagner Operatives Recruited to Carry Out Sabotage Across Europe

21:00:00 KST

Western intelligence sources indicate that former recruiters and propagandists of the Russian private military company Wagner are now being repurposed as channels for Kremlin-backed sabotage operations across Europe. The Financial Times, citing European Pravda, reports that these operatives are leveraging their existing networks to recruit Europeans - particularly those facing economic hardship - to carry out acts of violence on NATO territory.
Further reading: Activists Claim Discovery of Russian Paramilitary Site in Bulgarian Village
The operational status of Wagner has remained ambiguous since June 2023, following the failed rebellion against Russian military leadership and the death of its founder, Yevgeny Prigozhin. Previously, Wagner recruiters focused on enlisting young men from rural Russia for deployment in Ukraine. According to one Western intelligence official, Russian military intelligence is now “using the talent it has got available,” applying the Wagner network to European sabotage efforts.
Moscow’s broader campaign of destabilisation and sabotage over the past two years aims to undermine Western support for Ukraine while fostering social unrest. With a decline in covert operatives in Europe due to repeated diplomatic expulsions, Russian intelligence increasingly relies on intermediaries like Wagner to implement its agenda. European intelligence sources confirm that Wagner’s network has been effective for these operations, even if crude in execution.
Recruited individuals are often financially motivated and socially marginalised, with limited direction or purpose. Wagner operatives provide instructions ranging from arson attacks on politicians’ vehicles and warehouses storing humanitarian aid for Ukraine to posing as extremist propagandists. European officials note that Wagner’s existing network of propagandists and recruiters gives Russian intelligence a ready-made pipeline capable of targeting specific audiences with cultural and linguistic familiarity.
Operational security for these efforts typically includes multiple “cut-out” layers, providing deniability for Russian intelligence (GRU). Wagner operatives, who have a long-standing relationship with the GRU, act as intermediaries between the agency and amateur saboteurs. Meanwhile, Russia’s FSB tends to rely on criminal networks and diaspora communities in neighbouring countries, but these channels are considered less effective for large-scale recruitment.
Wagner’s strong online presence, previously focused on Russian audiences, has been adapted to recruit internationally. Sophisticated Telegram channels and social media accounts have been used to enlist recruits, including a group of British nationals in late 2023. European intelligence gradually mapped the broader network of Wagner operatives and “disposable” agents following that incident.
Authorities note that while the use of Wagner intermediaries allows Russian intelligence to scale its sabotage campaigns cost-effectively, it also reduces operational competence and secrecy. European security services report having prevented more attacks than those that have succeeded. Poland recently upheld convictions of Russians involved in recruiting individuals for Wagner, highlighting the ongoing legal and intelligence response to the network’s operations in Europe.

Bitter cold complicates Ukraine's drone defense
Unknown

20:42:46 KST

Earlier this winter, Ali's unit was flying an interceptor drone in subzero temperatures on the front when the camera suddenly froze, sabotaging their mission to detect and thwart an incoming Russian attack.
Temperatures across the 1,200-kilometer front line have plunged to their lowest of the entire four-year Russia-Ukraine war, complicating the use of battery-powered drones, central to both sides' military tactics.
"The impact on our drones is completely negative," said Ali, who asked AFP to identify him by his call sign, in line with military protocol.
"Batteries lose charge faster, the cameras and wires freeze, they just ice up."
Both Russia's and Ukraine's army have come to use cheap drones ubiquitously.
Small reconnaissance craft scope out enemy positions and can drop grenades on targets and soldiers, detecting even the smallest movement on the ground below, while others are packed with explosives and designed to slam into vehicles and buildings.
Some drones are now connected to their operators with an extremely thin fiber-optic cable, ensuring the connection to the pilot remains stable and immune to electronic jamming.
Interceptor drones, like the kind Ali's unit was flying, are used for defense, a kind of drone-on-drone aerial warfare to hobble incoming attacks.
But as temperatures have hit minus 20 degrees Celsius on the front, both the equipment and men operating the devices freeze up.
Near the southern front, pilots from the 18th brigade were getting ready to launch their interceptor drones.
The light polystyrene craft resembles a toy plane.
"Frost, low cloud, fog. In such weather, it is difficult for a drone to fly. It can short-circuit, it can break in the air," said Nazariy, one of the brigade's squad commanders.
Old-school solutions are sometimes required to help the high-tech devices stay airborne.
While the winter poses a technical challenge, in other respects it makes drones an even more potent threat.
When the skies clear, the white layer of snow can quickly turn into a death trap for any troops trying to traverse it.
"It's very easy to see where someone walked or drove because tracks stand out sharply in the snow," said Lafayette, a pilot with the Achilles brigade.
Some drones are also equipped with thermal cameras, which makes the heat they pick-up from human bodies much more visible in winter.
Amid the cold snap, Russia has upped its long-range attacks on Ukraine's energy sites, cutting off electricity and heating for hundreds of thousands of civilians across the country and triggering a major energy crisis.
At the front, Ukrainian forces are also struggling from the cold.
"Infantry that comes out is literally destroyed because they have nowhere to hide," said Koleso, a 31-year-old infantryman.
In the frost, wounds quickly turn deadly, as hypothermia weakens the body's ability to cope with trauma.
Despite these risks, Nazariy said there was no way but to keep fighting and ensure Kiev's drones stay in the air.
"We are at war. We work in any weather."

Rubio says US does not want 'vassal' Europe

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Feb. 15 that the United States does not want a "vassal" Europe, the day after a speech where he called on Europeans to embrace President Donald Trump's vision for "renewal" of the global order.
"We're not asking Europe to be a vassal of the United States," Rubio said during a brief visit to Bratislava, following his appearance at the Munich Security Conference.
"We want to be your partner. We want to work with Europe. We want to work with our allies."
Rubio told European leaders in Munich that they should rally behind Trump to defend "Western civilization," which Rubio said is in danger of "erasure" by mass migration and cultural and industrial decline.
Rubio moved on from Munich to some of Trump's staunchest right-wing allies in Europe. He met with Slovakian Prime Minister Robert Fico and then flew to Budapest where he met nationalist Prime Minister Viktor Orban yesterday.
At a press conference with Fico, Rubio asserted that Trump wanted to strengthen ties with Central Europe.
He also emphasized that it was in the U.S. interest to have "a strong Europe" more broadly at a time when transatlantic relations are turbulent. He rejected the notion that the United States would feel threatened by a more independent Europe.
Fico has embraced a similar strand of right-wing nationalism to Trump and cultivated close ties with Trump's MAGA movement.
Rubio said he appreciated the remarks and the stakes for Slovakia, saying that the US role is to "facilitate an end to a very deadly, very bloody, very, very costly war, with horrible suffering."
The U.S. chief diplomat then departed for Budapest, where Orban is facing his toughest electoral challenge since returning to power in 2010.
Trump has openly supported the Hungarian nationalist leader, whom he describes as a "strong and powerful man," ahead of parliamentary elections on April 12.

Gaza board to unveil $5 bln in reconstruction pledges at inaugural meeting

U.S. President Donald Trump said on Feb. 15 that members of his newly created Board of Peace have pledged $5 billion toward rebuilding war-ravaged Gaza and will commit thousands of personnel to international stabilization and police forces for the territory.
The pledges will be formally announced when board members gather in Washington on Feb. 19 for their first meeting, he said.
“The Board of Peace will prove to be the most consequential International Body in History, and it is my honor to serve as its Chairman,” Trump said in a social media posting announcing the pledges.
He did not detail which member nations were making the pledges for reconstruction or would contribute personnel to the stabilization force.
But Indonesia’s military said on Feb. 15 that up to 8,000 of its troops are expected to be ready by the end of June for a potential deployment to Gaza as part of a humanitarian and peace mission. It's the first firm commitment that the U.S. president has received.
Greek daily Kathimerini also claimed that Greece will take part in the force.
Rebuilding the Palestinian territory will be a daunting endeavor. The United Nations, World Bank and European Union estimate that reconstruction of the territory will cost $70 billion. Few places in the Gaza Strip were left unscathed by more than two years of Israeli bombardment.
It is not clear how many of the more than 20 members of the Board of Peace will attend the first meeting. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who held White House talks with Trump last week, is not expected to be there.
Trump’s new board was first seen as a mechanism focused on ending the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza. But it has taken shape with his ambition for a far broader mandate of resolving global crises and appears to be the latest U.S. effort to sidestep the United Nations as Trump aims to reset the post-World War II international order.
Many of America’s top allies in Europe and elsewhere have declined to join what they suspect may be an attempt to rival the Security Council.
Trump also confirmed that the Feb. 19’s meeting will take place at the U.S. Institute of Peace, which the State Department announced in December 2025 it was remaining the Donald J. Trump U.S. Institute of Peace.
The building is the subject of litigation brought by former employees and executives of the nonprofit think tank after the Republican administration seized the facility last year and fired almost all the institute’s staff.

Türkiye’s trade sector continued to expand its workforce through the end of 2025, with the number of salaried employees approaching 3.5 million.
According to data from the Turkish Statistical Institute (TÜİK), overall salaried employment in the country surpassed 15.7 million by year’s end.
The trade sector has now recorded uninterrupted annual growth in employment for 74 consecutive months.
The last decline was registered in October 2019. In December 2024, the sector employed 3.41 million people; by December 2025, that figure had risen to 3.47 million. Analysts attribute this steady increase to Türkiye’s sustained economic expansion, which has continued for 21 consecutive quarters, supported by rising domestic demand and financing opportunities.
Within the sector, retail trade remains the largest employer. Excluding motor vehicles and motorcycles, retail employment reached 1.79 million at the end of 2025, marking a 2.4 percent annual increase. Wholesale trade, also excluding motor vehicles and motorcycles, maintained its level above 1.3 million, a modest 0.2 percent annual rise.
Employment in the category covering wholesale and retail trade of motor vehicles and motorcycles, along with repair services, stood at 373,886, reflecting a robust 5.2 percent annual increase.

Australian archaeology museum recovers Egyptian artifacts after break-in
Man charged with stealing mummy mask, jewelry and wooden cat and causing ‘irreparable damage’ to other items, says he believed Abbey Museum was tied to Catholic Church
SYDNEY, Australia — Australian police have recovered a trove of stolen Egyptian artifacts and charged a 52-year-old man with a nighttime smash-and-grab at a museum.
The man was accused of breaking a window and making off with the priceless treasures in the early hours of Friday from the Abbey Museum of Art and Archeology in the Queensland town of Caboolture.
Police said they found all the stolen goods — except for a wooden cat sculpture — with only minor damage when they searched a car the following day at a ferry terminal south of the museum.
They arrested the suspect on the same evening.
“Police will allege the man was found in possession of the last missing artifact, the wooden cat sculpture,” they said.
The man, named by local media as Miguel Simon Mungarrieta Monsalve, was charged with various counts including breaking and entering, and three counts of willful damage.
In court on Monday, a prosecutor said the man stole a mummy mask, a collar, a piece of jewelry and the wooden cat while also causing “irreparable damage” to other items, according to public broadcaster ABC.
The suspect told police that he believed the museum had links to the Catholic Church, the prosecutor was quoted as telling the court.
The museum said it was “relieved and grateful” to get the artifacts back, but they could not go back on display immediately.
“Each piece must first undergo professional assessment and conservation to protect its long-term future.”

Twenty new high-clearance vehicles have been added to support state authorities in safeguarding Bulgaria’s territories within the EU’s Natura 2000 ecological network
At the start of the year, Bulgaria’s fruit market has seen notable price swings, particularly for citrus fruits. Data from the State Commission for Commodity Exchanges and Markets (DCBMT) show that in January, tangerine prices surged by over 14 percent, reaching 1.33 euros per kilogram, while oranges increased by nearly 6 percent. Entering February, wholesale prices began to ease, with oranges declining by 5.27 percent to average around 1.15 euros per kilogram.
Despite this recent easing in wholesale markets, retail prices for oranges in Bulgaria remain among the highest in the region. According to Numbeo data, the average price for oranges is 1.58 euros per kilogram, surpassing prices in neighboring countries such as Greece, Romania, and North Macedonia. In North Macedonia, oranges are 22 percent cheaper, costing around 1.23 euros per kilogram, while Greek consumers pay 1.31 euros, about 17 percent less than in Bulgaria. In Romania, the price difference is nearly 12 percent in favor of local buyers.
These figures highlight a notable economic paradox. In Greece, where the standard of living is roughly 29.4 percent higher than in Bulgaria, citrus fruits are more affordable, and in North Macedonia, with a lower overall cost of living by almost 15 percent, the situation is similar. Analysts attribute these disparities to a combination of logistical challenges, differences in VAT rates on food, and local supply chain structures, which together place Bulgarian consumers at a relative disadvantage when compared to their regional neighbors.

The Dutch State Secretary for Defence, Gijs Tuinman, said that the software of F-35 fighter jets could potentially be hacked in a way similar to unlocking an iPhone.
He made the statement on the “Boekestijn en de Wijk” podcast on BNR Nieuwsradio, as reported by The War Zone.
According to Tuinman, the aircraft’s closed digital system could theoretically be unlocked to allow software updates from third-party developers.
If such protections were bypassed, countries operating the F-35 could independently upgrade and modernize the jet’s combat systems. Tuinman noted that he was discussing matters he “probably should never have said publicly,” highlighting the sensitivity of the issue.
BIG: Dutch Defence Minister Gijs Tuinman hints that software independence is possible for F-35 jets.
He literally said you can “jailbreak” an F-35.

“That’s not the point… we’ll see whether the Americans will show… pic.twitter.com/f11cGvtYsO
— Clash Report (@clashreport) February 15, 2026
It is currently unknown whether there are real technical means to gain access to the fighter jets, or whether the statement was merely figurative.
The issue of dependence on the United States is critical, as these aircraft are currently the only type of fighter jet in service with the Netherlands. Full digital integration of the aircraft with U.S. infrastructure means that, without authorization from Washington, D.C., the operational capability of the fleet could be quickly neutralized.
There is also an article on Militarnyi about whether F-35 fighter jets can be remotely disabled.

Hungary Ends Operation of Mi-24 Helicopters

Hungary has retired its Mi-24 attack helicopters. The phase-out took place quietly in early February 2026 after all remaining airworthy aircraft reached the end of their service life.
The final flight was carried out on February 4. The very next day, the airworthiness certificate of the last operational helicopter expired, according to Portal Militarny.
Hungary’s Mi-24 history began in 1978, when the first four Mi-24D helicopters were delivered from the Soviet Union as part of a total order of 30 aircraft. The fleet was later expanded with upgraded Mi-24V variants. In 1995, Hungary also received additional used helicopters free of charge from Germany, previously operated by the former East German Army.
Despite the large number of helicopters received, economic difficulties and military downsizing steadily reduced the number of active aircraft.
After several years without flights, eight helicopters underwent major overhauls in 2018–2019 at a Russian plant in St. Petersburg. Specialists upgraded the TV3-117 engines and adapted the cockpits for the use of night vision goggles. It was at that time that the Hungarian helicopters received their distinctive graphite-black paint scheme.
In the final period of their service, the combat value of these helicopters was minimal. Hungary had no remaining stocks of 9M114 guided anti-tank missiles, and the storage life of the unguided S-5 and S-8 rockets had long expired. Due to safety risks, they were not even used for training, leaving the 30 mm cannon of the Mi-24P variant as the only available weapon.
All helicopters have now been towed to storage areas at the Szolnok airfield, where they will await a final decision on their future.
The Soviet-era aircraft are being replaced by Airbus H145M light attack helicopters. Hungary received 20 of these helicopters between 2019 and 2021.

Bulgaria Sees Strong Growth in New Car Sales
The market for brand new passenger cars in Bulgaria saw notable growth in 2025, according to data from the Association of Automobile Manufacturers and their authorized representatives
In January, Bulgaria recorded a monthly inflation rate of 0.6%, marking the first month after the country’s adoption of the euro, according to preliminary figures from the National Statistical Institute (NSI). The annual inflation rate reached 3.5%, slightly below the NSI’s earlier express estimates of 0.7% for the month and 3.6% for the year.
The most notable price increases were observed in personal care, which rose by 1.8%, and in restaurants and bars, which climbed by 1.6%. Insurance, as well as entertainment, sports, and cultural services, saw monthly price growth exceeding one percent. Food prices increased by 0.9%, reflecting typical seasonal shifts: non-seasonal vegetables such as tomatoes and cucumbers became more expensive, while citrus fruits declined in price. Among non-food items, higher fees for issuing official documents were included in the index, and hairdressing services rose by more than 3%.
Preliminary NSI data also indicate that harmonized inflation grew by 0.6% in January, with the annual rate at 2.3%. The price index for the small consumer basket rose 0.5% compared to December 2025 and 2.9% compared to January 2025.
For households in the lowest-income 20%, the small basket showed the most pronounced price increases in food products, which went up by 0.7% over the month. Service prices climbed 0.6%, while non-food items remained largely unchanged.
Authorities conducted widespread inspections in January through the National Revenue Agency and the Consumer Protection Commission to address unreasonably high prices. The focus of these checks closely mirrored the sectors where NSI data highlighted the strongest inflationary pressure.

Israeli charged with spying on ex-defense minister Gallant for Iran
Fares Abu al-Hija, 32, allegedly carried out missions for figure he met via social media, including stashing phones in Haifa, photographing former minister’s home in Amikam
Prosecutors filed charges Monday against a man for allegedly gathering intelligence on former defense minister Yoav Gallant on behalf of an Iranian agent.
The defendant, Fares Abu al-Hija, 32, was arrested in late January after taking photos of streets near Gallant’s home in Amikam at the behest of his handler, according to the indictment.
A joint statement from the police and the Shin Bet security service said the defendant is from the Galilee village of Kaukab Abu al-Hija, about an hour’s drive north of Gallant’s residence.
He first came into contact with the Iranian agent on the Telegram messaging app while searching for work in August last year, according to the indictment.
Between October and January, al-Hija carried out requests made by the person, who called himself “Martin,” even though he suspected he was a foreign agent, the statement said.
According to prosecutors, among the tasks al-Hija completed were to purchase and then hide cellphones and chargers at various locations around Haifa, activate the devices, install communication apps on them, record where they were stashed, and then pass on the information to his handler. He was also asked to take an envelope containing the password to a cryptocurrency account to a location in Zichron Yaakov, and to photograph a cafe in Tel Aviv.
Al-Hija was paid in cryptocurrency to carry out the intelligence-gathering missions. In return for taking photos and videos of the cafe, he earned $1,000 in cryptocurrency, according to the indictment.
In January, al-Hija was asked to photograph Gallant’s home. He was arrested at the location shortly after having sent the photos to his handler.
He was indicted at the Haifa District Court on the charge of contact with a foreign agent. Prosecutors requested that he be kept in custody until the end of legal proceedings against him.
Gallant was the defense minister from 2022 until 2024, when he was fired by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over political differences. In the past, he served as head of the Israel Defense Forces Southern Command.
In their statement, police and the Shin Bet noted that Iran is increasing its efforts to engage Israelis as spies within the country.
Law enforcement “takes a very serious view of any involvement in such activities and will continue to bring to justice those involved in harming the country’s security and its citizens,” they said.
Over the past two years, dozens of Israelis have been charged with espionage on behalf of Iran. In many of the cases, Iranian agents recruited Israelis via social media, specifically the Telegram messaging app.
Last week, two Israeli citizens were arrested on suspicion of spying for Iran in exchange for money, and earlier this month, a 22-year-old ultra-Orthodox yeshiva student from Beit Shemesh convicted of conducting espionage missions for Iran was sentenced to three years’ imprisonment and given a NIS 10,000 ($3,200) fine.
Many alleged Israeli spies recruited by Iranian agents begin with relatively innocuous tasks, such as vandalizing buildings with anti-government and pro-Iranian messages, then sending photos of the graffiti to their handlers. These gradually turn into more serious offenses, like intelligence-gathering and assassination plots.
The growing number of Iranian agents even prompted Israel to open a new wing for them in Haifa’s Damon prison. Only one of the alleged spies — Stern — has been convicted of espionage so far, as most cases are still making their way through the legal system.
Another Israeli was convicted on the lesser charges of contact with a foreign agent and entering an enemy state without authorization over meetings he had with Iranian agents, some of them inside Iran, in which they discussed a plot to assassinate Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. He was sentenced to 10 years in prison

19:18:21 KST

The American reference website Designation-Systems.Net has released its 2026 update, disclosing the official U.S. designations for several new missiles.
The update covers advanced systems currently undergoing testing as part of programs focused on developing affordable, mass-produced precision weapons.
Among them is the AHM-4A HACM hypersonic cruise missile developed by Raytheon. It uses a scramjet engine and can exceed Mach 5, with a reported range of up to 1,850 km. A new ‘H’ prefix was introduced specifically to identify hypersonic missiles in the U.S. designation system.
In the category of lower-cost cruise missiles, the AGM-188A Rusty Dagger developed by Zone 5 Technologies was also listed. The missile weighs about 225 kg, is powered by a turbojet engine, and has a range of more than 930 km. It was developed specifically for Ukraine under the ERAM (RAACM) program as an asymmetric solution to the shortage of more expensive weapons.
Anduril Industries has received the AGM-189A designation for its Barracuda-500 missile. This munition, with a range of over 900 km and a 45 kg warhead, is positioned as a lower-cost alternative to expensive systems such as the Tomahawk cruise missile.
Another system is the small AGM-190A Black Arrow cruise missile developed by Leidos Dynetics. Weighing just 90 kg, it has a range of up to 740 km and is designed for launch from the AC-130J Ghostrider or MQ-9 Reaper platforms.

Civilian Deaths in Ukraine Surge 26% in 2025 Amid Intensified Russian Strikes
Unknown

19:00:00 KST

Civilian casualties in Ukraine rose sharply during 2025, with the impact of bombings and missile strikes increasing by 26% compared to the previous year. The surge reflects intensified Russian targeting of Ukrainian cities and critical infrastructure, according to data from the monitoring group Action on Armed Violence (AOAV).
AOAV reported that 2,248 civilians were killed and 12,493 injured by explosive violence throughout Ukraine last year, with incidents affecting more people per attack than before. On average, 4.8 civilians were killed or wounded per strike, marking a 33% increase from 2024. The deadliest single attack occurred in Dnipro on June 24, when Russian missiles hit a passenger train, apartments, and schools, resulting in 21 deaths and 314 injuries, including 38 children.
Iain Overton, AOAV’s executive director, said the statistics demonstrate a broader collapse of restraint in modern conflicts, noting that the principle of proportionality in war is “at breaking point” across multiple theatres including Gaza, Sudan, Congo, and Ukraine. Deliberate attacks on civilians or civilian infrastructure that exceed military necessity constitute war crimes, but Overton warned that the erosion of accountability is now widespread.
Missile and drone strikes in Ukraine occurred almost nightly in 2025 and continued into 2026, leaving millions without reliable access to electricity, heating, or water. The largest single raid recorded by AOAV took place on September 9, when Ukrainian territory was struck by 805 drones and 13 missiles. The monitoring group compiles figures based on English-language media reports, a methodology that consistently undercounts the true scale of casualties due to incomplete coverage.
Globally, AOAV recorded a total of 45,358 civilian casualties from explosive violence in 2025, down from 61,353 in 2024. Of these, 17,589 were killed and 27,769 injured. The overall reduction is largely attributed to a ceasefire in Gaza, where civilian casualties fell by 40% compared to the previous year. Israeli authorities confirmed that the health ministry’s figures for Gaza—70,000 killed since October 2023—are broadly accurate. In 2025 alone, 25,718 Palestinians were recorded killed and 62,854 injured, highlighting the significant gap between English-language reporting and actual casualties.
The countries causing the highest number of civilian casualties last year were Israel and Russia, responsible for 35% and 32% of reported deaths and injuries from explosive violence, respectively. Other conflict zones with significant civilian harm included Sudan and Myanmar, with 5,438 and 3,178 casualties recorded.
Overton stressed that a pattern of impunity is taking hold across conflict zones. “Across Ukraine, Myanmar, Gaza and Sudan, the message is the same,” he said. “When impunity becomes normalised, war crimes stop being shocking exceptions and begin to resemble a method of warfare.”
This trend illustrates the growing human toll of modern conflicts, where both urban centers and civilian infrastructure are increasingly caught in the crossfire of sustained military operations.

Fake Euros Used in Bulgarian City: 35-Year-Old Suspect Detained
Forensic experts in the Bulgarian city of Shumen have identified and arrested a 35-year-old man who attempted to pay for a soft drink with a counterfeit 50-euro banknote
Shumen remains without water as the city faces an ongoing disruption at its main pumping station, BNT reported. Specialists from Varna have been deployed to assist with repairs, working to assess the facility and safely restart the pumps. Authorities warned that it will take several hours before the water supply network can be fully restored.
The breakdown followed an electric shock yesterday that partially flooded the pumping station. Emergency teams from the water company and the local fire department worked to remove the water from the facility. Both main pumps and the backup, along with the power supply and motors, were affected by the flooding. Drying of the electrical components is now underway, according to Eng. Ivan Pushkarov, manager of ViK-Shumen, who described the situation as evolving.
To support residents during the outage, water carriers will be set up across the city until the pumping station is fully operational again.

Navalny Poisoning Verified by Five Countries
Unknown

18:00:00 KST

Independent labs in five European countries have confirmed that Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny was poisoned with a rare neurotoxin. The Insider reported on February 14, 2026, that tests of biological samples taken from Navalny and smuggled abroad revealed the presence of epibatidine, a highly toxic compound derived from a South American frog. Britain, Sweden, France, Germany, and the Netherlands issued a joint statement corroborating the findings and accusing Russia of violating the Chemical Weapons Convention. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio echoed the European assessment, describing it as “troubling,” while Russia’s Foreign Ministry dismissed the conclusions as deliberate misinformation.
The Russian government reacted sharply. Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova criticized the European countries for raising the Navalny case instead of focusing on investigations into the Nord Stream pipeline bombing. She demanded the chemical test results and formulas before commenting, labeling the reports as a “planted story” intended to distract the West. The Russian embassy in London called the joint statement a “political pageant” staged alongside the Munich Security Conference, accusing Western politicians of “necro-propaganda,” claiming it mocked the dead rather than sought justice. Russian state television largely ignored the European statement, while outlets such as Kommersant, Forbes, and Lenta.ru covered it only after Zakharova’s remarks.
Western reactions were swift. Rubio confirmed that the U.S. had no reason to question the European labs’ findings. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen condemned the poisoning as “a cowardly act from a frightened leader” and highlighted Russia’s reliance on terror tactics. German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul emphasized that Russian authorities had both the motive and means to carry out the attack. British Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper described the poisoning as evidence of Russia’s fear of political opposition, while French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot framed it as a demonstration of Vladimir Putin’s willingness to use chemical weapons to maintain power. Leonid Volkov of the Anti-Corruption Foundation said the confirmation marked a significant milestone after years of propaganda and misinformation, though he cautioned that achieving justice would require much more effort.
Experts have provided insight into the neurotoxin used. Azerbaijani toxicologist Ismail Efendiev explained that epibatidine is extraordinarily potent, with a lethal dose potentially as small as hundredths or thousandths of a gram. Symptoms resemble those caused by Novichok, but unlike Novichok, the standard treatment administered to Navalny in 2020 - atropine - would be ineffective. Treatment can only manage symptoms, as no specific antidote exists. Efendiev also noted that epibatidine persists in the body, making detection easier, and stressed that it cannot be synthesized outside specialized government laboratories.
The confirmation of Navalny’s murder and the ongoing revelations about the poison mark a grim milestone in Russian political repression. Today, on the anniversary of his death, the case continues to draw international scrutiny and condemnation, highlighting the dangers faced by opposition figures under the Russian regime.

Bulgaria: Arson Attack Targets Bistritsa Mayor’s Home and Car

Europe’s Best-Selling New Car Revealed for 2025
The Dacia Sandero has emerged as the best-selling new car in Europe for 2025, maintaining a strong presence at the top of retail sales charts since 2017
The car and the entrance to the home of Samuil Popov, mayor of the village of Bistritsa, were deliberately set on fire in the early hours of the morning, shortly after 1:30 a.m. Popov said he was awakened by a loud sound similar to an explosion, which initially made him think thunder had struck nearby.
Moments later, he realized that the vehicle parked in the yard of his house was burning. Smoke then began to fill the stairwell, and it became clear that not only the car but also the front door of the house had been set alight. According to Popov, both the vehicle and the entrance had caught fire almost simultaneously.
The mayor told BNT and Nova TV that he noticed a motorcycle leaving the area immediately after the incident. Based on what he observed, he believes that two individuals entered the property, poured a flammable substance over the car and the front door, and then ignited it. An emergency call was placed to 112, and fire crews arrived quickly to extinguish the flames.
At the time of the arson, Popov, his wife, and their four-year-old daughter were asleep on the third floor of the house. On the first floor live his nephew and the nephew’s mother, while several friends of the nephew were also present that night.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs confirmed that the case is under active investigation and that operational measures are already underway. Popov recalled a previous incident from July last year, when masked individuals appeared at the village hall, and said he cannot rule out a connection between the two cases.
He pointed out that on July 11 he publicly questioned the destination of funds collected from municipal rents for sites in the center of the village. According to him, he did not receive a clear explanation and later sent an official inquiry to the Pancharevo district administration and Sofia Municipality. The response indicated that rental revenues did exist but were being managed through an intermediary.
Popov said he has not received new threats since the summer. Asked whether he suspects anyone in particular, he mentioned that recent media coverage had focused on illegal dumping of earth masses in the area, but stressed that he has no concrete information or assumptions about who might be responsible for the arson. Regarding the earlier case involving masked individuals, he added that, to his knowledge, no perpetrators have yet been identified.
Samuil Popov is currently serving his second term as mayor of Bistritsa. He was first elected as an independent candidate and is now in office under the quota of the WCC-DB coalition.
The Sofia Court of Appeals has reduced the sentence of Orlin Vladimirov, convicted of murdering his wife Evgenia, from life imprisonment to 20 years

In early February 2026, Bulgaria was rocked by a grim discovery that would spiral into one of the country's most disturbing cases in recent memory.
A fatal knife attack took place early this morning in Sofia’s Poduyane district, leaving one person dead and two others seriously injured, according to information from police and emergency services.
Authorities in the Bulgarian town of Lovech have disclosed the results of a major operation targeting the distribution of counterfeit currency.
A 19-year-old has been formally charged by the Sofia District Prosecutor's Office for attacking two minors on the Sofia metro. The victims, aged 13 and 15, suffered injuries during the incident on February 8.

A Bulgarian national fighting on the Russian side has been taken prisoner by Ukrainian forces during combat operations in eastern Ukraine, Bulgarian National Radio reported, citing information published by Ukrainska Pravda.
According to the report, the capture was announced in a post on the Facebook page of the 20th Regiment of Unmanned Systems, known as “K-2”. A company commander from Ukraine’s 115th Separate Mechanized Brigade said the Bulgarian was detained while advancing toward Ukrainian positions in an unspecified sector of the Kupyansk–Lyman direction.
The Ukrainian officer explained that the soldier was first urged to surrender, an offer he accepted. After being taken to a dugout and searched, Ukrainian troops discovered a Bulgarian passport among his belongings, confirming his nationality.
To remove the prisoner from the combat zone, Ukrainian forces used a ground-based robotic evacuation system. The man was restrained to prevent escape attempts. During the operation, Russian forces reportedly tried to strike both the robotic platform and the captured soldier with a drone, but the attack was unsuccessful.
Footage released by the Ukrainian military shows a man in uniform with his hands tied and his face partially covered, speaking in Russian. In the video, he thanks the 115th Mechanized Brigade for capturing him and the K-2 unit for evacuating him safely, adding that he is grateful to be alive and ending his statement with the words “Glory to Ukraine”.
In a separate video released by the Armed Forces of Ukraine, it is stated that the operation took place on February 1. Ukrainian soldiers describe how enemy FPV drones attempted to destroy the robotic complex during the evacuation. The prisoner survived the attack, and during the subsequent search his Bulgarian passport was again shown. His name has not been made public.
According to information cited by Bulgarian media "Sega", the man told Ukrainian soldiers that his Russian military documents had been taken from him. He claimed he was recruited while visiting relatives in the Russian city of Voronezh and was then pressured into signing a contract for military service with the Russian army.
The approximately five-minute video documenting the incident shows that at one stage Russian forces opened fire on the area during the evacuation, effectively shelling the group that included their own captured soldier. The Bulgarian is currently being held by Ukraine’s 115th Mechanized Brigade as a prisoner of war.
In the recording, with his face concealed, the man repeats his thanks to the Ukrainian units involved, says he is relieved to be alive, and again voices support for Ukraine, ending with the phrase “Glory to Ukraine, glory to the heroes.”
