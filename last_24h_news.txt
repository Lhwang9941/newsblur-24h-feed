Palestine Action wins UK legal challenge over 'terrorist organisation' ban

UK terrorism ban on Palestine Action group unlawful, court rules
2026-02-13 11:34:39 GMT
https://www.newarab.com/news/uk-terrorism-ban-palestine-action-group-unlawful-court-rules

Britain's
ban on pro-Palestinian campaign group
Palestine Action
as a terrorist organisation was ruled unlawful by London's High Court on Friday, though the ban will temporarily remain in place, and the government said it would appeal the decision.
Palestine Action was proscribed in July, having increasingly targeted Israel-linked defence companies - particularly
Elbit Systems
- in Britain with "direct action", often blocking entrances or spraying red paint.
Britain's interior ministry argued the group's escalating actions, culminating in a June break-in at the RAF Brize Norton air base when activists damaged two planes, amounted to terrorism.
Lawyers representing Huda Ammori, who co-founded Palestine Action in 2020, argued at a hearing last year that the move was an authoritarian restriction on the right to protest.
The ban had put Palestine Action on a par with
Islamic State
or al-Qaeda and made it a crime to be a member. Many have been arrested for holding signs during protests in support of the group under the anti-terrorism legislation.
The High Court
upheld two grounds of challenge, including that the ban was a disproportionate interference with the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly.
Judge Victoria Sharp said that "Palestine Action is a group that promotes its political cause through criminality", but that proscription was still disproportionate.
She added, however, that the ban would remain in place pending any appeal, which interior minister Shabana Mahmood immediately said the government would pursue.
"I intend to fight this judgment in the Court of Appeal," she said in a statement.

About 20K Slovak donors raise €1.1M for Ukrainian generators and charging stations
2026-02-13 11:30:29 GMT
https://euromaidanpress.com/2026/02/13/about-20k-slovak-donors-raise-e1-1m-for-ukrainian-generators-and-charging-stations/

Kyiv has received the first batch of humanitarian aid from Slovakia, including 16 generators of various capacities and 2 charging station sets with 8 kW capacity each, valued at 166,000 euros ($174,000 total) total, Kyiv city mayor Vitalii Klitchko
said
.
The three most powerful generators—225 kW, 100 kW, and 63 kW—will be transferred to schools in different districts of the capital, according to the announcement.
The delivery is part of the large-scale "Warmth for Ukraine" fundraising campaign, launched in the second half of January. The initiative was organized by the Embassy of Ukraine in the Slovak Republic in cooperation with Slovakia's largest fundraising platform Donio and 10 leading Slovak public organizations.
The campaign has collected nearly 1,100,000 euros ($1,150,000) from more than 19,500 donors. "These are funds to help Ukrainian communities," the statement notes. Slovak partners are purchasing and delivering generators and charging stations with the collected money.
The "Warmth for Ukraine" campaign became possible "thanks to the solidarity of citizens of the Slovak Republic and the joint work of partner organizations," according to the announcement.
Partner organizations include Donio, Človek v ohrození, Mier Ukrajine, Nadácia Integra, PostBellum SK, Nadácia Pontis, Ambrela, All4Ukraine, Nadácia otvorenej spoločnosti, Srdcom s Ukrajinou, and ADRA.

El Souq's Ramadan Pop-Up Market celebrates SWANA in NYC
2026-02-13 11:28:24 GMT
https://www.newarab.com/features/el-souqs-ramadan-pop-market-celebrates-swana-nyc

Inside a small studio in New York City's West Village, the smell of spices like cardamom, saffron, and rose fills the air as people continue to stream in to get their share of Egyptian koshary, Turkish coffee, and Persian tea.
They shop for jewellery, prints, and textiles from Southwest Asia, North Africa, and South Asia, while Turkish rock music and other Arabic sounds play on vinyl and cassette tapes in the background.
For many of the attendees and vendors at
El
Souq's Ramadan and Eid Pop-Up
, this event is not only a space to shop ahead of the holiday but also a community-oriented space that supports local businesses selling local products and goods that cater to the needs and tastes of New York City's Arab, Muslim, and South Asian communities.
El Souq was founded in 2023 by lifelong friends
Hanan Thabet and Dalia Ghanem
, who met back in 2004 at an Arab American Conference in Washington, D.C.
The platform became a way for the two friends to showcase brands they felt were underrepresented in the mass market and to help people shop more intentionally, to "bridge the gap of the things that I felt were missing in our culture," explained Dalia.
"This was an extension of our identities," added Hanan. "As Arab-American women here in the United States, but especially important for us as we are also mothers, so raising our children to value and celebrate who they are."
This year's pop-up arrives at a particularly resonant moment. As New York enters a new chapter under
Zohran Mamdani
, the city's first Muslim mayor, El Souq's presence in Manhattan reflects a broader shift in visibility and belonging for Southwest Asian and North African communities long central to the city's cultural fabric.
"There's a corner of New York that really represents everyone, and this just feels like what that means for us – a little corner of the city where it's your people and things that really speak to you and the way that you live," said Afreen Ahmed, who attended the pop-up with friends.
For the co-founders of the event, the timing of this recent historic mayoral election and the pop-up is a celebration of where the SWANA community comes from and where they are going together.
"Muslims, Arabs, and South Asians are proud, present, and showing up with full recognition that we can occupy space in a big way," Hanan tells
The New Arab
.
"This is a really profound moment for our communities, and we're really excited to see this political shift in New York and to be able to host our first event in the new year, in a new New York.”
Mamdani's historic win drew strong support from the Middle Eastern, North African, Muslim, and South Asian communities, who saw his election as an ode to New York City's long history as a city of immigrants, shaped by its diverse population.
Nearly 184,000 Middle Easterners and North Africans live in New York City, according to the 2020
US Census
. Similarly, almost 450,000 South Asians call New York City home.
Diaspora in bloom
The 8 February pop-up brought together more than 40 independent brands and makers, from the Middle East and South Asia, to showcase thoughtfully crafted apparel, jewellery, home goods, books, artisanal foods, and handmade gifts rooted in diasporic storytelling, sustainability, and heritage.
The concept of the market speaks to a generation of creators looking to reclaim their heritage in public spaces.
One of these creators is Amazigh-Moroccan jewellery designer
Kenza Alaoui
, who describes her work as "a modern take on the Arab woman."
When Kenza launched her jewellery brand,
Kenza Klay
, she was advised not to promote it as Moroccan or Arab, as it would diminish its value.
"I was told to use the word 'ethnic,'" Kenza shared. "It's something that always stayed with me. I refuse because it's what I am.”
Like many of the creators and attendees, projects like El Souq have become safe spaces for SWANA and South Asian community members to be unapologetically themselves.
"Many Arabs (and) many people from the region in general, felt like this event was very much needed," shared Kenza, recalling the first El Souq event launching during the first year of
Israel's war in Gaza
.
"A lot of them would come and just hug us and cry it out. It was so emotional."
Across the city, a growing number of local initiatives to highlight SWANA and South Asian culture are making their mark, mostly in the digital sphere.
This includes initiatives like the weekly newsletter
Menna
, which means "from us" in Arabic, that curates a roundup of cultural and social events around New York City rooted in the Middle Eastern and North African diaspora, and
SHOR
, which showcases South Asian experiences in the city on Instagram and Substack.
Young people want to be able to talk about their heritage and culture with pride, said Jigisha Patel, a New Jersey-based Indian artist who repurposes vintage saris into accessories, jewellery, and purses for her brand
Bella Mews
.
And as these cultural spaces grow online and in person, the SWANA and South Asian communities are having their moment, she said, noting that growing up, the number of South Asian brands was minimal.
"People want authenticity," Jigisha said. "There's something raw and authentic to it. There's a story behind it, there's tradition behind it. People want that."
That authenticity is part of El Souq's appeal to many visitors, who cited the ongoing boycott movement and the fact that a portion of the day's proceeds goes toward charities in Palestine.
"It is good to come to spaces where it's very community-oriented, and it's all local businesses," said attendee Nadia Helmi.
"You obviously feel good about supporting those businesses, but the feeling is also exacerbated because of all the boycotts going on, and you know you can sort of support (local businesses) ethically, and proceeds are helping a good cause."

Europe’s China shock worsens as trade deficit widens
2026-02-13 11:25:37 GMT
https://www.politico.eu/article/europe-china-trade-deficit-widens/?utm_source=RSS_Feed&utm_medium=RSS&utm_campaign=RSS_Syndication

BRUSSELS — Chinese goods continue to flood into the European Union as the bloc’s manufacturing base struggles to cope.
The EU’s trade deficit in goods with China widened to €359.3 billion in 2025, up nearly a fifth from €304.5 billion in 2024,
according to data published
by Eurostat on Friday.
The figure is the total value of all goods imported from China, minus the goods exported to the country. The widening deficit was the driven both by a 6.3 percent increase in imports from China, and a 6.5 percent decline in EU exports to China. The widening deficit exposes Europe’s inability to compete in industries ranging from basic chemicals to cars.
In 2025, China’s global trade surplus in goods
hit a record of nearly $1.2 trillion
— with Donald Trump’s U.S. tariffs redirecting its export glut to more open economies like Europe.
China has been on an inexorable economic ascent since joining the World Trade Organization in 2001. Neither the 2008 financial crisis, nor the recent
deflation of a vast real estate bubble
, has been enough to knock it off course.
While Chinese businesses used to occupy the bottom of the value chain — assembling electronics, producing basic chemicals, or manufacturing low-end consumer goods — they’ve steadily moved to the technology frontier. Chinese champions operate in everything from electric vehicles to artificial intelligence and robotics.
EU leaders are alert to the threat. Speaking at an EU industry summit in Antwerp on Wednesday, French President Emmanuel Macron called on the European Commission to act more swiftly to erect trade protections when China uses subsidies to give an unfair leg-up to its industry.
“We have a big issue today. We are too slow,” said the French leader talking about the Commission’s lengthy probe into Chinese electric vehicles that resulted in the imposition of duties in late 2024.
It was useless, Macron said, if the European Commission takes two years to find out that a Chinese company was relying on state aid to undercut its European competitors. “I mean, thank you, happy I was right, but it’s over. So we have to accelerate much more swiftly the process for these inquiries, clearly,” Macron added.
France’s High Commission for Strategy and Planning estimates that a quarter of the country’s exports are “directly threatened” by Chinese competition. For Germany, that number rises to a third. The advisory body
has recommended
that the EU retaliate with a weaker euro — which would give exporters a boost — and across-the-board tariffs.
Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng
seemed to offer an olive branch
at the World Economic Forum in Switzerland last month.
In a speech made in the wake of U.S. President Donald Trump’s threat to annex Greenland, He promised that China would uphold the international trade order and “open its door still wider to the world.” He also said that the government would move to fix economic imbalances that had sapped domestic demand and added to the export glut.
But policymakers, both in EU capitals and the Berlaymont, are skeptical that China is serious about any shift toward household consumption.
French Finance Minister Roland Lescure said this week that Chinese officials have been “saying the right things” with talk of “rebalancing of the Chinese economy with more consumption.” But, he told reporters: “We feel that so far, there’s been a lot of talk, but not many results yet.”
It’s an attitude shared by top Commission trade official Joanna Szychowska who, at a conference last month, said the EU should not “all of a sudden become friends with China today because we have a shift in U.S. policy.”
“China is very much focused on transactions. Now we have to ask ourselves the question of what transactions we can make — so what is our leverage, what is our strength?” added Szychowska, who is director for Asia, services and digital trade.

New astronauts launch to the International Space Station after medical evacuation

2026-02-13T10:16:36Z
CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) — A new crew rocketed toward the
International Space Station
on Friday to replace the astronauts who returned to Earth early in
NASA’s first medical evacuation
.
SpaceX launched the replacements as soon as possible at NASA’s request, sending the U.S., French and Russian astronauts on an expected eight- to nine-month mission stretching until fall. The four should arrive at the orbiting lab on Saturday, filling the vacancies left by their
evacuated colleagues
last month and bringing the space station back to full staff.
“It turns out Friday the 13th is a very lucky day,” SpaceX Launch Control radioed once the astronauts reached orbit. “That was quite a ride,” replied the crew’s commander, Jessica Meir.
NASA had to put spacewalks on hold and deferred other duties while awaiting the arrival of Americans Meir and Jack Hathaway, France’s Sophie Adenot and Russia’s Andrei Fedyaev. They’ll join three other astronauts — one American and two Russians — who kept the space station running the past month.
Satisfied with
medical procedures
already in place, NASA ordered no extra checkups for the crew ahead of liftoff and no new diagnostic equipment was packed. An ultrasound machine already up there for research went into overdrive on Jan. 7 when used on the ailing crew member. NASA has not revealed the ill astronaut’s identity or health issue. All four returning astronauts went straight to the hospital after splashing down in the Pacific near San Diego.
It was the first time in 65 years of human spaceflight that NASA cut short a mission for medical reasons.
With missions becoming longer, NASA is constantly looking at upgrades to the space station’s medical gear, said deputy program manager Dina Contella. “But there are a lot of things that are just not practical and so that’s when you need to bring astronauts home from space,” she said earlier this week.
In preparation for moon and Mars trips where health care will be even more challenging, the new arrivals will test a filter designed to turn drinking water into emergency IV fluid, try out an ultrasound system that relies on artificial intelligence and augmented reality instead of experts on the ground, and perform ultrasound scans on their jugular veins in a blood clot study.
They also will demonstrate their moon-landing skills in a simulated test.
Adenot is only the second French woman to launch to space. She was 14 when Claudie Haignere flew to Russia’s space station Mir in 1996, inspiring her to become an astronaut. Haignere traveled to Cape Canaveral to cheer her on.
“I thought it would have been a quiet joy with pride for Sophie, but it was so hugely emotional to see her with a successful launch,” Haignere said.
Hathaway, like Adenot, is new to space, while Meir and Fedyaev are making their second station trip. Just before liftoff, Fedyaev led the crew in a cry of “Poyekhali” — Russian for “Let’s Go” — the word uttered at liftoff by the world’s first person in space, the Soviet Union’s Yuri Gagarin, in 1961.
On her first mission in 2019, Meir took part in the first all-female spacewalk. The other half of that spacewalk, Christina Koch, is among the four Artemis II astronauts waiting
to fly around the moon
as early as March. A ship-to-ship radio linkup is planned between the two crews.
Meir wasn’t sure astronauts would return to the moon during her career. “Now we’re right here on the precipice of the Artemis II mission,” she said ahead of liftoff. “The fact that they will be in space at the same time as us … it’s so cool to be an astronaut now, it’s so exciting.”
SpaceX launched the latest crew from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station. Elon Musk’s company is preparing its neighboring Kennedy Space Center launch pad for the super-sized Starships, which NASA needs to land astronauts on the moon.

Israel closes dozens of war-crime cases over fears of ICJ probe
2026-02-13 11:21:46 GMT
https://www.newarab.com/news/israel-closes-dozens-war-crimes-cases-over-fears-icj-probe

The Israeli military
has closed dozens of cases believed to have amounted to war crimes between 2023-2024, according to the
Jerusalem Post
.
In a
report
published earlier this week, the newspaper disclosed that the army’s legal branches had decided to block investigations into an unspecified number of war-crimes cases involving Israeli officials and military personnel and officials beginning when the
war on Gaza started in October 2023
.
Although the exact list of cases dismissed have not been made public,
the Jerusalem Post
said many of the investigations relate to the deaths of 98 detainees held at the notorious Sde Teiman detention centre as well as other facilities.
The investigations, according to the report, were being conducted by the Israeli military’s legal division looking into soldiers’ conduct towards Palestinian prisoners.
Rights groups had previously recorded at least 98 deaths in Israeli detention since October 2023, accusing authorities of torture and medical neglect.
Not every death triggered a probe,
the Jerusalem Post
continues, saying that some Palestinian detainees were mortally wounded "in battlefield" and subsequently died in detention.
Human rights organisations, however, have long called for independent investigations into abuses by Israeli soldiers towards Palestinian prisoners, with B’Tselem previously saying that "Israel has instated a systemic policy of abusing and torturing thousands of Palestinians in its custody".
Sde Teiman, in particular, has drawn widespread condemnation amid reports of horrific rape by Israeli soldiers of Palestinian detainees there.
The Jerusalem Post
said that the decision to close these investigations was taken over fears that the cases may come to the attention of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) and the International Criminal Court (ICC)
The ICC has issued arrest warrants against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defence Minister Yoav Gallant for war crimes and crimes against humanity in Gaza.
Likewise,
South Africa filed a case against Israel at the ICJ
in December 2023, saying that Israel’s military campaign and policies towards Palestinians in Gaza amount to genocide.
Israel is expected to respond to the ICJ case by March 12, with
the Jerusalem Post
suggesting Israel’s legal defence brief is approximately 1,000 pages long.
The genocide case has argued that Israel’s policies in Gaza have amounted to war crimes and a genocidal agenda, while highlighting specific cases including the 1 April 2024 killing of seven
World Central Kitchen employees
and the
massacre of paramedics
on 23 March 2025 in Rafah.
In both cases, results of the criminal probes have consistently been delayed and not released in full.

Global: Governments must use new UN General Assembly resolution to turn ICJ’s Advisory Opinion on climate change into robust action
2026-02-13 11:21:38 GMT
https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2026/02/global-governments-must-use-new-un-general-assembly-resolution-to-turn-icjs-advisory-opinion-on-climate-change-into-robust-action/

Governments must not squander the opportunity to turn the International Court of Justice’s 2025 Advisory Opinion on states’ obligations regarding climate change into robust climate action, Amnesty International said ahead of discussions to finalize a new UN climate change resolution.
Informal consultations on the draft resolution circulated by Vanuatu begin today. UN member states are expected to vote on the resolution at the end of March, marking three years since the UN General Assembly first requested the ICJ’s opinion.
“The resolution attempts to turn the ICJ’s interpretation of key legal standards into a practical roadmap for state accountability which is likely to trigger political pushback from higher income high emitting countries wary of their historical responsibility and financial liability,” said Candy Ofime, Climate Justice Researcher and Legal Advisor at Amnesty International.
Amnesty International is calling on governments to sponsor the resolution and secure its adoption in its current form.
The draft resolution gives unqualified support to the Advisory Opinion and urges states to meet the legal obligations that it clarified. These include:
adopting national climate actions plans, known as nationally determined contributions, to limit global temperature rise to below 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels.
taking effective steps to cut emissions, such as ending subsidies for fossil fuel exploration, production and exploitation;
fully upholding their obligations to refrain from returning displaced individuals to a country where climate change impacts pose a risk to life, and to consider creating safe, regular and non‑discriminatory pathways and protection frameworks for persons displaced across borders by climate‑related factors;
for states that have violated their obligations, to provide full and prompt reparation for damage.
“
The ICJ in its landmark Advisory Opinion
made clear that the full enjoyment of human rights cannot be ensured without protection of our climate system and other parts of the environment from the harms of human-induced climate change. We know that extracting and burning fossil fuels are the root cause, yet recent actions by major world leaders, including U.S. President
Trump’s latest revocation of the “endangerment finding” on greenhouse gases
, have
weakened global climate action
. This has included defunding key international climate bodies and rolling back multi-lateral climate cooperation,” Candy Ofime said.
This is a vital moment for states to show they stand on the side of climate justice – not delay, weaken, or turn away from their legal obligations and moral duty.
Candy Ofime, Climate Justice Researcher and Legal Advisor at Amnesty International
“Global cooperation, with those most responsible for climate change leading the way, is essential to equitably phase out fossil fuels, support a just transition for workers and others impacted by the phase out, protect groups and communities on the frontline of the climate crisis, and finance recovery from climate change-related loss and damage. Without it, climate impacts such as sea-level rise, salinization and coastal erosion, extreme heat, food insecurity, wildfires, violent storms, floods, and safe water shortages will intensify.
“This is a vital moment for states to show they stand on the side of climate justice – not delay, weaken, or turn away from their legal obligations and moral duty. The world cannot afford anything less. Humanity must win.”
Background
The zero draft has now been shared with all UN Member States and will be taken up during informal consultations on 13 and 17 February at the General Assembly in New York, giving every government the opportunity to shape this crucial resolution. A revised draft is expected in early March, followed by a window for states to add their sponsorship and move it toward adoption later in the month.
Amnesty International’s Climate Justice team will be available for media comments and interviews throughout this process, providing analysis as the draft evolves and urging governments to strengthen—not dilute—this landmark effort for global climate justice.

Portugal’s PM has had a terrible week — and it’s only getting worse
2026-02-13 11:20:56 GMT
https://www.politico.eu/article/portugal-pm-luis-montenegro-storms-crisis-fraud/?utm_source=RSS_Feed&utm_medium=RSS&utm_campaign=RSS_Syndication

Portuguese Prime Minister Luís Montenegro is under pressure over his government’s handling of the storms that have wreaked havoc across the country for several weeks.
At least 16 people have died as a result of the fierce cyclones that have battered the Atlantic nation since late January, destroying homes and leaving thousands without power for days.
A stretch of the A1 motorway that serves as the country’s main north-south artery was wiped out after a dike collapsed this week, and railway service between Lisbon and Porto is suspended. Coimbra, home to one of Europe’s oldest universities, is being threatened by major floods that could force the evacuation of up to
9,000 residents
.
Growing anger over the lack of preventative measures taken ahead of the storms, as well as the delays in emergency response and recovery operations, prompted Interior Minister Maria Lúcia Amaral to step down on Tuesday. “I no longer possess the personal and political conditions necessary to hold the position,” she wrote in her resignation letter, which President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa
promptly accepted
.
Opposition parties on both sides of the aisle seized on Amaral’s sudden exit to criticize the country’s center-right prime minister. André Ventura, leader of the far-right Chega party,
accused
Montenegro of having “lost control of his own government,” while the Socialist Party’s José Luís Carneiro said the resignation proved the administration had “failed in its response to this emergency.”
Montenegro himself has provisionally taken up Amaral’s portfolio to oversee the crisis response operations personally. While the move is aimed at underscoring the prime minister’s commitment to addressing the disaster, it is also politically risky, as he is now directly linked to the handling of the calamity.
In a bid to calm citizens, Montenegro
announced
Thursday its government will use EU recovery funds to reconstruct devastated communities, and deliver a new water and forest management plan, he said, that will prepare the country for the extreme weather it will face over the next quarter-century.
Fraud investigation
But the prime minister’s messaging was undermined on Friday, when he was linked to an ongoing tax fraud probe.
According to Portuguese weekly newspaper
Expresso
, prosecutors have been investigating alleged discrepancies between the cost of Montenegro’s summer house and the invoices issued by his contractors since last fall.
Although he has not been named as a subject in the probe, the news is an unpleasant distraction for the prime minister. Montenegro did not immediately respond to POLITICO’s request for comment on the investigation.
Last year, the prime minister called
snap elections
after an unrelated corruption probe involving his family’s businesses led to him
losing a confidence vote
in parliament. That case was ultimately shelved by prosecutors, who found no evidence of criminal activity.
The house in question in the latest probe was already the subject of a criminal investigation in 2024, when prosecutors raised doubts over the tax breaks the prime minister had claimed. That case was
dropped
after authorities concluded Montenegro was legally entitled to the benefits.

Next trilateral talks about war in Ukraine reportedly to take place in Geneva – Putin’s spokesperson

Brazil Charges Slain Paraguayan Congressman’s Son With Drug Trafficking
2026-02-13 11:17:00 GMT
https://www.occrp.org/en/news/brazil-charges-slain-paraguayan-congressmans-son-with-drug-trafficking

Brazil has brought drug trafficking charges against Alexandre Rodrigues Gomes, the son of a former congressman with Paraguay’s ruling party who was killed in a police raid in 2024.
The Brazilian prosecutors office, known as the Federal Public Ministry (MPF), has charged Gomes with transnational drug trafficking aggravated by the use of a firearm, according to a February 9 indictment obtained by OCCRP.
Gomes also faces charges of money laundering linked to drug trafficking in Paraguay, where his case has been the subject of considerable
media attention
, and he has been in custody since 2024. The charges have not yet been tried in court.
He was charged alongside his father, Eulalio “Lalo” Gomes, who was a congressman and deputy in Paraguay's ruling Colorado Party before he was shot and
killed
in a shootout during an August 2024 police raid on a family home. The younger Gomes had initially escaped during the operation, but turned himself in later.
Gomes’ lawyer, Noelia Núñez, told OCCRP that neither Paraguayan nor Brazilian authorities have gathered sufficient evidence to show he was involved in any crimes.
The Brazilian embassy in Paraguay’s capital, Asuncion, has requested Gomes’ extradition and asked that he be kept in “preventative detention” in the meantime. The MPF alleges that he coordinated regular cocaine flights to Brazil, according to files from the investigation obtained by OCCRP.
The MPF alleges in its indictment that Gomes, “in addition to leading his own criminal organization, was responsible for transporting drugs from production sites in Andean countries to their destination in Paraguay or Brazil.”
Prosecutors claim he “coordinated the aircraft fleet and recruited narco-pilots.”
Gomes allegedly oversaw two clandestine airstrips — one in Paraguay and another in Brazil — according to prosecution files. Cocaine was flown from Bolivia and Colombia to Paraguay, put on another plane, and from there flown to Brazil. The drugs were then shipped out of Brazilian ports to Europe.
The MPF investigation is code named “Balkans,” and investigators claim that a man working with Gomes was in contact with members of a Balkan organized crime group, which managed drug shipments from Brazilian ports to Europe.
The Balkans investigation follows up on a 2021 MPF investigation named “Hinterland,”uncovered an alleged international drug trafficking scheme involving Paraguay and Brazil. Investigators said they found at least 11 tonnes of cocaine moved from South America to Europe between 2020 and 2021.
In Hinterland, Brazilian investigators say they were able to unravel the drug trafficking scheme by seizing “shielded” phones and devices using encrypted applications such as
Sky ECC
. Gomes was not charged in the Hinterland investigation. However, investigators working on the Balkan case later discovered his name among the Sky ECC chats.
Núñez, Gomes’ lawyer, told OCCRP the Sky chats alone do not constitute enough evidence to prove her client was guilty.
“Basically, there are no witnesses, nor documentary proof, nor suitable means to link Alexandre to the case, beyond the messages contained in the Sky system,” Núñez said.
According to Brazilian prosecutors, Gomes used a shell company called FRG Constructora S.A. to launder drug money into luxury real estate projects like the Tetryz Palace in Pedro Juan Caballero, a Paraguayan city on the border with Brazil.
Núñez said her client had testified in a previous hearing in Paraguay that the purchases were legitimate.
“I understand that all the properties he had were justified,” she said.

Ukraine frontline mapping startup draws €7.2 million from Axon and European defense funds
2026-02-13 11:11:21 GMT
https://euromaidanpress.com/2026/02/13/farsight-vision-seed-round-axon-smartcap/

A Ukrainian defense-tech startup that began by mapping Russian trenches for frontline units has closed a €7.2 million ($8.5 million) seed round led by US-based Axon Enterprise and Estonia’s state-backed SmartCap Defence Fund, with participation from Polish, Swiss, and Danish investors.
The deal adds to a surge in private capital flowing into Ukrainian defense companies—from $5 million in 2023 to over $40 million in 2024 to $105 million in 2025, according to
Brave1 data reported by Kyiv Post
.
“We’re betting on innovation and speed: from idea to product in weeks.”
Farsight Vision’s round, which also drew Polish Radix Ventures, Swiss Anker Capital, Danish Final Frontier, and a reinvestment from Estonian fund Darkstar, pulls investors from five NATO-allied capitals into a single Ukrainian combat-tech company.
Acting Minister of Digital Transformation
Oleksandr Bornyakov
, who
announced the round on Facebook
, cast it as proof of Ukraine’s speed advantage. “We’re betting on innovation and speed: from idea to product in weeks,” he wrote—a timeline that Farsight Vision itself illustrates, having gone from a student project to a platform used by over 100 military units in under two years.
From trench maps to autonomous combat systems
Viktoriia Yaremchuk
and
Volodymyr Nepiuk
founded Farsight Vision in 2023 after meeting at the Lviv Business School of the Ukrainian Catholic University. Yaremchuk, one of a growing number of women leading Ukrainian combat-tech companies, serves as CEO.
The platform, according to the company, is now used by more than 100 Ukrainian military and security units.
Their starting point was practical: Ukrainian forces needed faster ways to analyze enemy trenches and positions, but satellite imagery was too slow, and GPS often jammed. So they built software that turns raw drone footage into detailed 3D terrain models and maps in real time—without relying on satellite navigation.
The platform, according to the company, is now used by more than 100 Ukrainian military and security units. At the Brave1 Defense Tech Valley summit last September, Farsight Vision
won a startup award
for aerial imagery processing.
The startup has also expanded partnerships across NATO countries and signed its first commercial contract in Asia.
The new funding marks a different ambition. The money will go toward automating robotic systems for logistics, navigation, and weapons control—a move from mapping to autonomous combat systems.
According to InVenture
, the goal is to combine reconnaissance, target formation with coordinates, target transfer to strike drones, and navigation during the final phase of flight into a single autonomous pipeline. The startup has also expanded partnerships across NATO countries and signed its first commercial contract in Asia.
Ukrainian wartime startups are transforming into global players in defense technology.
Axon CEO
Rick Smith
—whose company is known worldwide for Tasers and police body cameras—told InVenture that technology shaped by real combat use evolves faster and with clearer focus.
Mykhailo Fedorov
, then Digital Transformation Minister and now Ukraine’s Defense Minister, called it proof that Ukrainian wartime startups are transforming into global players in defense technology.
The Estonian connection
Most coverage describes Farsight Vision as a “Ukrainian-Estonian” company. The label is accurate, but it describes a trajectory, not an origin.
The company was founded in Lviv by two Ukrainian entrepreneurs. Its technology was built for and tested by Ukrainian forces. The Estonian element came later: incorporation as FarsightVision OÜ in Tallinn in July 2024, followed by Estonian state funding—€2 million ($2.4 million) from SmartCap’s Defence Fund in this round, plus earlier grants totaling roughly €1.7 million ($2 million) from Estonia’s applied research program and Defense Ministry,
according to Ärileht
.
The company plans to expand both sales and product development in Estonia.
Now the Estonian footprint is becoming operational. Brigadier General (ret.) J
aak Tarien
, former Estonian Air Force commander and former director of NATO’s Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence in Tallinn, has joined as
Head of Strategic Partnerships
and is actively
recruiting Estonian developers
. The company plans to expand both sales and product development in Estonia.
Estonia’s own government
frames the deal
as helping “Ukraine frontline-tested technology expand to Europe”—perhaps the most precise description anyone has offered. Economy Minister
Erkki Keldo
called the defense industry “Estonia’s new strength.”
In short: a Ukrainian-founded, Ukrainian-tested startup is building its European expansion through Estonia, backed by real Estonian capital and a serious Estonian hire. “Ukrainian-Estonian” is becoming true.

Thousands of 1948 Palestinians protest rising organised crime
2026-02-13 11:05:34 GMT
https://www.newarab.com/news/thousands-1948-palestinians-protest-rising-organised-crime

Hundreds of thousands of
Palestinians who stayed in their lands and homes after the 1948 Nakba
and forcibly accepted Israeli citizenship took to the streets this week across Israeli cities in an unprecedented show of public rage.
On Tuesday,
Palestinians
staged coordinated disruptions, shutting down major intersections in Jerusalem, Beersheba, and Haifa, painting fountain waters red in symbolic protest, and blocking Tel Aviv's central Ayalon Street. Medical teams walked off the job. Tech firms closed their doors. University students joined families of murder victims in demonstrations outside the homes of top government officials.
The scale of the uprising reflects a community in crisis. In 2025 alone, 252
Palestinians
in Israel were killed by firearms. Another source documents 245 murders from organised crime, with one death approximately every two days.
From Wednesday night through Thursday night this week, six people were killed in organised crime shootings across Palestinian towns in the 1948-occupied territories within approximately eight hours, bringing the 2026 death toll to 47, including 16 in February alone.
Victims include Farid Abu Mubarak, 20, shot in Shuqaib al-Salam in the Negev; Mukhtar Abu Mudeghem, 22, son of a former Rahat mayor, found shot dead in his vehicle in Rahat; Sheikh Najib Hamd Abu Reish, shot on his way to work in Yirka; Hussein Saleh Abu Raqiq, 65, killed in Lod; Mohammed Qassem, 47, shot while heading to work in al-Fureidis; and Wafaa Awad, 40-year-old, shot when she left her home in Tamra in northern occupied Palestine, according to the Palestinian Media Centre.
"If our children's lives are not normal, then the entire state's life should not be normal," said Ayman Odeh, head of the Arab Democratic Change list and one of the few Arab members of Knesset to lead street protests alongside party colleagues Mansour Abbas and Aida Toma Sleiman.
"We hold the government accountable as a partner in these organised crimes through its deliberate neglect, which aims to force
1948 Palestinian citizens of Israel
to emigrate," he said.
Odeh, in this talk to
The New Ara
b, pointed to a staggering toll: 2,600 murders since 2000. He demanded the Israeli state "take responsibility for curbing unlicensed weapons and organised crime, rather than allowing what he called a two-faced police approach, excessive force against Palestinians coupled with neglect of community safety."
"The question is: what will we do?" Odeh said, turning the demand inward to his own community.
A mother's anguish
The murders have become numbingly routine. On 6 January, Asmahan Ghawi received a phone call at 9:15 pm from her son, Mahmoud, a 23-year-old barber in Kafr Qara with dreams of helping his family survive. She was preparing dinner for him. He was laughing, his young voice filling the line, when gunshots cut through the call.
She rushed to his barber shop, barely breathing, tears streaming down her face. She found Mahmoud lying in a pool of blood surrounded by neighbours and friends. The perpetrator was never caught.
"How will I continue my life without him? How will I face the coming days? Every moment reminds me of his absence," she told
TNA
.
The very next evening, another family's world was shattered in nearly identical circumstances.
When the delivery arrived at the Abu Arar home on 7 January, masked gunmen opened fire. Twenty-three-year-old Mahmoud Abu Arar, a first-year medical student in Georgia, United States, who was visiting his family, fell to the ground. He died instantly.
The delivery person who witnessed the crime wept, according to Abu Arar’s mother. He said, "I didn't want that. If I had known, I would have told you!"
These were not outliers. According to
UN data
from early 2023, the murder rate in Arab communities inside Israel is three times the national average. Youth under 30 comprise 54 per cent of victims.
Political neglect
At the heart of the crisis lies what analysts describe as systemic abandonment.
Hanieda Ghanem, director of the Palestinian Centre for Israeli Studies, attributes the surge not merely to individual violence but to decades of political marginalisation that have fractured community bonds.
"The Palestinian minority faces a complex set of challenges rooted in their status as a national minority living in an environment they perceive as foreign and hostile," Ghanem explained to
TNA
. "This breeds feelings of marginalisation and exclusion from political and social spheres."
She points to two historical ruptures that shaped
Palestinian identity inside Israel
: the 1948 Nakba, which severed cultural and social ties to their homeland, and the Oslo Accords era, which disconnected Palestinians from the broader Palestinian cause and intensified individualism at the expense of collective solidarity.
"Palestinian communities live in a state of perpetual psychological tension," Ghanem said. "The security system operates within a complex context that reveals a gap between official statements and actual practices on the ground."
Ayman Odeh was more direct about police complicity. He highlighted what he called a fundamental paradox: excessive force deployed against Palestinians in some contexts, combined with deliberate neglect and resource starvation. Most critically, he noted, the Israeli government licenses weapons to civilians in Palestinian communities, creating an arsenal that fuels organised crime.
"There are unreasonable quantities of unlicensed weapons circulating in Palestinian communities, and the state has failed to address this," Odeh said. "As a result, the likelihood of arresting a criminal in Arab communities is far lower than in Jewish communities."
Sami Abu Shahada, head of the National Gathering, blamed the absence of Palestinian intellectual and middle-class leadership from civil and political spaces. "Their preoccupation with personal interests rather than building community awareness and organisation has exacerbated chaos and violence," he said.
The state, Abu Shahada argued, maintains Palestinians in marginality and insecurity through selective enforcement of law, strict application against Palestinians, and permissive tolerance in Jewish communities.
"This deepens feelings of injustice and discrimination, making it harder for Palestinians to develop their communities and manage their affairs effectively," Abu Shahada said.
Systemic failure
Rawia Handaklo, director of the Eilaf Centre for promoting safety in Arab communities, reframed 2025 as a turning point that exposed systematic escalation.
"It is no longer simply about rising numbers of dead," she said. "Violence has become a continuous, organised reality affecting the daily lives of Palestinians. Behind every victim are dozens of wounded people living with ongoing psychological trauma and suffering, with no protection or support."
Official data confirms the breadth of harm: 450 people injured alongside the hundreds killed. For Handaklo, this represents a deep civic security crisis with consequences stretching far into the future.
"This is not merely about acknowledging failures," she emphasised. "It requires building a strategy to confront internal terror, unifying efforts to achieve safety and stability. This demands involving all segments of society to achieve shared interests, efforts rooted in strengthening cultural and social values, building structures that support collective identity, and empowering individuals to reclaim their active role in the community."
On the other hand, Psychologist Riba Abu Ghosh stressed the psychological toll. Rising murder rates create a permanent climate of fear and anxiety, triggering widespread disorders: Anxiety, depression, and loss of trust in one's social environment.
"Many have lost family members or lived through traumatic experiences during crimes," she said. "These events leave deep psychological marks affecting their education and family relationships."
Educational and community institutions, Abu Ghosh argued, bear responsibility for providing psychological support through professional programs, mental health workshops, and specialised staff to assist the affected, "to restore a sense of trust and safety in our community."
A movement escalates
The Tuesday disruption marked a visible escalation of an organised campaign. Over 100 families of murder victims have launched a coordinated escalation program, demanding that the state take immediate, serious action against organised crime.
Dozens of organisations joined: health workers staged one-hour walkouts across major hospitals—Rambam, Ziv, Soroka, Beilinson, Wolfson, Sheba, Assaf Harofeh, Schneider, Shalfata, Beit Levonstein, and the French Hospital in Nazareth, among them. Academic institutions, including Ben-Gurion University and Tel Aviv University, participated. High-tech companies and the Sarona complex in Tel Aviv shuttered operations. Social workers' unions mobilised.
Police arrested seven activists from the "Standing Together" movement during the protests.
But families vowed to continue. As one statement from bereaved parents declared: "Despite its cost, this struggle is a duty to our sons and daughters who are gone, and to the right of the Palestinian Arab community inside to life, security, and dignity."

Turkey detains 16 in OnlyFans probe, seizes $6.9 mln in assets
2026-02-13 11:02:51 GMT
https://www.newarab.com/news/turkey-detains-16-onlyfans-probe-seizes-69-mln-assets

Turkey
detained 16 people and seized assets worth about 300 million lira ($6.9 million) on Friday in an investigation into alleged money laundering linked to content shared on the
OnlyFans
platform, prosecutors said.
The probe, led by a department investigating terrorism financing and money laundering crimes, targeted 25 suspects and two companies in operations across eight provinces, including Istanbul, Ankara and Antalya, the
Istanbul
chief public prosecutor's office said.
Prosecutors said suspects generated income by sharing explicit content on social media and directing users to paid platforms, including OnlyFans and private messaging channels such as Telegram.
OnlyFans has been blocked in Turkey since 7 June 2023, by a ruling of an Istanbul court on the grounds that it hosted content deemed contrary to public morality and family values.
Despite the ban, suspects were found to have accessed the platform via virtual private networks (VPNs), prosecutors said.
According to the statement, the suspects laundered proceeds through the purchase of assets, as well as investments in bitcoin and gold.
Authorities identified 10 properties, 14 vehicles and two companies linked to the suspects. The total value of the assets was estimated at around 300 million lira.
The prosecutor's office said the investigation was ongoing.

Gender studies courses are shutting down across the US. The Epstein files reveal why | Joan Wallach Scott

Texas A&M University is the latest school to end women’s and gender studies programs and teaching race. We know why
Last week, we learned of the decision of the Texas A&M University board of regents to end women’s and gender studies programs as well as the teaching of “divisive concepts” such as race. A&M was not the first university to do this.
Florida
’s New College made the move in 2023. Other red state legislatures have passed similar requirements and their public universities (in
North Carolina

Kansas
) have followed suit.
The move to cancel gender studies is explicitly justified as a way to comply with

How to Have a Good First Date
2026-02-13 11:00:00 GMT
https://time.com/7378033/good-first-date-how/

I have been on 76 first dates in the past three and a half years since moving from a small town to New York City. I know this because (like many before me) I have been keeping a spreadsheet.
Dating had always felt like an experience I’d missed out on during the two relationships I’d been in for most of my 20s. But once I was actually doing it, I felt overwhelmed by the sheer number of prospects. I needed a way to keep track of them all—and I wanted to be able to observe patterns from my experiences.
[time-brightcove not-tgx=”true”]
The reality is, a lot of first dates do not turn into second dates. You have the same conversations over and over, go on mediocre date after mediocre date. It can feel like a chore. Dating in New York necessitates efficiency, but it can be hard to make quick decisions. If someone’s dating app profile seems only okay, should I still give them a chance? Can a mediocre first date turn into a great second date? What if I’ve already met the right person but discounted them too quickly?
I wanted to use data to make the process more efficient—to figure out what made a first date good. And I’ve found that instead of approaching every first date as the search for a partner, it’s important to be open to whatever unfolds, and to embrace the unexpected adventures that appear along the way.
My spreadsheet columns are simple: basic biographical information, first date activity, and general notes. Other friends have told me about more elaborate categories: Early on in my spreadsheet, I had a conversation with a friend at a dinner party who was so moved by an
1896 painting of three Dutch girls peeling potatoes
at the Met that he would surreptitiously lead each date to the gallery and note their reaction. (He has since moved to California to be with a woman who he never took to see it.)
Forty-six of my 76 first dates involved getting drinks, 13 were walks, and 11 were coffee. A little less than half of those dates (35) led to second dates.
Less than a quarter of my first dates (15) led to four dates or more. I have gone on dates with four Matts, four Joshes, and four Dans.
I met 56 men via dating apps, and the other 20 through mutual friends, dating events, and parties. Dating apps get a lot of hate, but I will say, they’ve led to better first dates.
There’s a scriptedness to dating in a big city: How many messages you send on Hinge before one person asks the other out. The standard first date activities. The typical first date questions. Who pays. How long you wait to text afterwards if you had a good time. When it’s acceptable to mutually ghost if you didn’t.
It’s a dance that nobody choreographed, but with distinct steps we’re supposed to pick up as we go. I can tell if somebody is an experienced dater by where they sit in a bar (next to somebody allows for casual physical contact, across from them doesn’t) or the kinds of questions they ask (“so how’s your New York dating experience been?” to suss out where I am emotionally.)
My spreadsheet chronicles 40 months of rom-com worthy exploits: I’ve (accidentally) dated multiple people in the same community choir at the same time, then found out one of them was also dating one of my close friends. I reconnected with a college crush. I went on a date with a barista I’d long admired (who turned out to be so unpleasant I had to stop going to my favorite cafe). People I’ve dated have set me up on blind dates. I was asked out on the street by a Parisian doctor, and met somebody just before midnight at a New Year’s Eve party.
Some dates have been lackluster (next to Joe from 2023, I wrote:
doesn’t believe that climate change is “that big a deal”
). I’ve been ghosted, strung along, rejected. In one of the spreadsheet columns, I put an x if somebody has treated me poorly: lowercase for little things like ghosting or rudeness (14)—uppercase for worse (2).
And yet—and I may be the only person to have ever written these words—dating in New York has been so much fun. And the key to that, for me, has been learning how to enjoy first dates.
It’s strange to meet people within such a predetermined context, as if this is their audition for a romantic position in my life, with no other options for what the relationship can become.
Often, on a first date, somebody will ask: What are you looking for?
The problem is, if (like me), you’re “looking for” love, or a life partner, then every date where that doesn’t happen can feel like a failure. If dating is framed as the search for something missing, how do you enjoy the process of finding it?
I like to approach first dates as an opportunity to step into somebody’s world. When else do you get to spend a few hours getting to know a stranger? I like to see how my date approaches meeting someone new, the questions they ask, the way they carry themselves. I like to see who I become in their presence.
I try to get something out of every date, even if it’s not romance. I’ve discovered my favorite neighborhood bars, learned about new sci-fi books, picked up a new favorite question to ask other people I go on dates with (what
qualities do you look for in friends
?), and had conversations about how trying to do something you love professionally changes your relationship to it. And I’ve made many friends (as many as 15, my spreadsheet says).
Dating is most fun when I can hold multiple truths at once: It can be the search for a partner, and also an experience, an adventure, an opportunity to learn something new.
Dating has also made me a more confident person. It’s influenced the way I approach new experiences, and how I think about the world. I think it’s made me better equipped to find the kind of relationship I want.
I’ve learned to evaluate people based not on the facts of their lives (like their job or hobbies) but on how I feel when I’m with them. Are they kind? Do we laugh? Do I feel like myself?
A former circus coach of mine had a strategy for when we got stuck trying to choreograph new sequences, that I think about when the monotony of dating has taken hold. Instead of trying to create something perfect, she’d have us improvise. She’d tell us to notice the patterns we fell into, the movements we gravitated towards. She’d have us pay attention to the boredom, and then change one small thing. She’d tell us to focus on what
felt
good, rather than what looked good.
Dating also needs some improv. It requires moving in directions that feel right, without trying to control what those directions are. It’s about finding ways to venture through mediocrity until you stumble on magic.

Davos and Munich Matter. We Can’t Zoom Our Way in a Fragmenting World
2026-02-13 11:00:00 GMT
https://time.com/7378030/davos-munich-leadership-global-crisis/

We are living through a moment of profound strain on the global system. Geopolitical conflict, economic uncertainty, technological acceleration, political polarization and social fragmentation are no longer separate challenges. They are converging, reinforcing one another, and reshaping how leadership is exercised and where it comes from.
[time-brightcove not-tgx=”true”]
Coming out of the World Economic Forum’s annual meeting in Davos and heading into another consequential gathering at the Munich Security Conference, which starts today, one thing is clear: these convenings are becoming more consequential, not less. Not because they offer easy answers, but because they provide something increasingly rare and increasingly necessary: opportunities for sustained, face-to-face dialogue among leaders grappling with the hardest problems of our time.
This is not nostalgia for globalization. It is not a defense of elite gatherings for their own sake. It is about necessity.
The world is fragmenting. Alliances are being reassessed. Trust in institutions is eroding. Political divides within countries are deepening, even among long-standing allies. At the same time, technology—particularly artificial intelligence—is advancing faster than governance systems can keep pace. These forces are colliding, and the consequences are playing out in markets, workplaces, and societies around the world.
In this environment, dialogue is not a soft concept. It is foundational infrastructure.
Critics often dismiss forums like Davos as talk shops and view Munich as a grim exercise in security realism. That critique misses what is actually happening. These gatherings matter not because of what is said onstage but because of what happens away from the cameras—where leaders can argue, disagree, test assumptions and confront uncomfortable truths without the distortion of performative politics or social media outrage.
These conversations cannot happen over Zoom. They cannot be delegated to artificial intelligence. They require presence, nuance, trust and judgment. At a time when many public institutions are constrained by polarization or retreating from global engagement, these convenings serve an increasingly important function.
One of the most significant shifts underway is this: leadership is no longer coming primarily from the public sector. That is not an ideological observation. It is a practical one.
Governments are under strain, and many political leaders are increasingly focused inward. Yet the defining challenges of our era do not respect borders. Cyber threats, artificial intelligence, trade disruption, workforce transitions, energy security, climate pressures, human rights, labor standards and national security are inherently transnational.
As a result, responsibility is shifting. Leadership is emerging, increasingly, from the private sector and civil society: institutions that live with complexity every day. Companies operate across borders. They manage diverse workforces, serve multiple constituencies and navigate competing regulatory, cultural and political expectations simultaneously.
In many ways, they already inhabit a borderless world, even as tariffs rise and alliances fray.
This reality is reshaping what is expected of chief executives and board chairs. They are no longer seen solely as operators or stewards of capital. They are increasingly expected to act as statesmen and stateswomen, making decisions that resonate globally, nationally and locally at the same time.
Chief executives are being asked to engage with defining issues that do not fit neatly into quarterly earnings calls: technological governance and cyber risk; artificial intelligence and its impact on work and society; employment transitions; trade and supply chain resilience; human rights and labor standards; energy security; national and economic stability. These issues shape institutional legitimacy and market confidence.
Dialogue alone is not sufficient. But without dialogue, nothing durable is possible.
The ability to sit face to face, to listen as much as to argue, to disagree without retreating into caricature is a prerequisite for meaningful action. Gatherings like Davos and Munich preserve that capacity at a moment when it is eroding elsewhere. They create space for trust to form, for partnerships to emerge, and for leaders to recalibrate as conditions shift.
If political systems are constrained in addressing global challenges that cross borders, the responsibility shifts. Chief executives, chairs and leaders of civil society will increasingly be asked to step forward: not because they sought the role, but because the moment demands it.
That leadership will not come from slogans. It will come from judgment, courage, and engagement. It will be shaped, in no small part, by the quality of the conversations leaders are willing to have with one another.
The question is no longer whether gatherings like Davos or Munich matter. The question is whether leaders are willing to use them not as stages, but as workshops for ideas, as places to wrestle honestly with the hardest questions and decisions of our time.
The challenges we face do not stop at borders. Leadership, if it is to mean anything now, cannot either.

Wuthering Heights Was Not a Swoony Romance. Then Hollywood Got Involved
2026-02-13 11:00:00 GMT
https://time.com/7373005/wuthering-heights-adaptations-differences-from-book/

When
Sam Hirst
teaches Emily Brontë’s 1847 novel
Wuthering Heights
, they often find the students who end up hating it are the ones who go in expecting it to be a love story.
“They come in thinking it’s a romance,” says Hirst, who lectures in English literature at the University of Liverpool and teaches courses at the
Brontë Parsonage Museum
. “And then they’re like, ‘This isn’t a romance, this is domestic abuse. This is a nightmare.’”
[time-brightcove not-tgx=”true”]
Victorian critics agreed
. Early reviews of
Wuthering Heights
found it disturbing and violent. In fact, the first known movie adaptation—a (now lost) 1920 silent film—advertised itself as “
Emily Brontë’s tremendous Story of Hate
.” So why do so many modern readers expect it to be a romance?
“You really see a change in the way in which
Wuthering Heights
is understood with the release of the 1939 film with Laurence Olivier and Merle Oberon,” Hirst says. This film adaptation cut out the second half of the book, downplayed the violence committed by Olivier’s character, Heathcliff, and played up the romance between Heathcliff and Oberon’s character, Cathy.
Since then, there have been several feature film adaptations of
Wuthering Heights
, including the 1954 Mexican film
Abismos de Pasión
, the 1966 Bollywood musical
Dil Diya Dard Liya
, the 1970 British adaptation starring Timothy Dalton, the 1985 French film
Hurlevent
,
and
the 2011 movie by Andrea Arnold. Like the 1939 film, all five of these movies adapt the first part of the novel by focusing on Cathy and Heathcliff’s romantic (if destructive) feelings for each other, while excluding the second half of the novel in which Heathcliff exhibits some of his worst behavior.
In keeping with this tradition,
a trailer
for Emerald Fennell’s 2026 adaptation starring Margot Robbie and Jacob Elordi calls the novel “the greatest love story of all time.” The director
has said
that the book is such a “gargantuan masterpiece” that she focused more on the feelings it inspired in her than capturing every beat of the story. The movie is, rather unsubtly, set for release on Valentine’s Day weekend, with already sold-out costume screenings around the U.S.
But even if we allow filmmakers creative license, the critics have a point when they say that excising half the book and softening Heathcliff’s behavior results in leaving a lot of the novel’s most significant themes on the cutting-room floor. Here’s what to know about the plot and themes of the novel that didn’t make it into the new film.
Wuthering Heights
is about cycles of abuse
Wuthering Heights
is a multigenerational saga set between 1771 and 1802. Though Heathcliff and Cathy’s relationship is a significant part of the story, Cathy dies at age 18 halfway through the book. Heathcliff spends the rest of the novel carrying out a revenge scheme that involves torturing everyone around him, including his own son, the son of a man who abused him, and the daughter Cathy gave birth to just before she died.
Film adaptations like the 1939 version often leave out this second generation of characters. But without them, “you lose that sense of a cycle of violence,” says Murray Tremellen, a curator at the Brontë Parsonage Museum.
As a child, Heathcliff’s main tormenter is Cathy’s brother, Hindley, who physically abuses Heathcliff and forces him to work in the stables as a servant. Later, after Heathcliff mysteriously earns his fortune, he takes revenge on Hindley by gaining financial control of Wuthering Heights and forcing Hindley’s son, Hareton, to work as a servant in the manor he was supposed to inherit.
The fact that Cathy marries her wealthy neighbor Edgar Linton instead of Heathcliff fuels a lot of Heathcliff’s anger, and he takes it out on his own wife and child. Heathcliff has tricked Edgar’s sister, Isabella, into marrying him by pretending to love her. Once wed, Heathcliff immediately turns abusive, killing her dog by hanging it from a tree and trapping her at Wuthering Heights. Isabella runs away while pregnant to raise their child alone; but after she dies, Heathcliff calls their sickly son, Linton, back to Wuthering Heights to abuse him and use him in his ongoing revenge plot.
This leads us to Cathy’s daughter, also named Cathy. When the younger Cathy is a teenager, Heathcliff kidnaps her and forces her to marry the younger Linton (her first cousin), while simultaneously preventing her from seeing her dying father. This allows Heathcliff to gain full possession of Edgar’s estate after Edgar and Linton die.
Wuthering Heights
isn’t really a love story
For the reader, Heathcliff’s horrific actions raise questions about the nature of his supposed love for the deceased Cathy.
“I mean, he abducts the daughter of the woman he’s said to love, and forces her to marry somebody,” says
Claire O’Callaghan
, a lecturer in English at Loughborough University and author of
Emily Brontë Reappraised
. “His bad behavior is not only because she chose somebody else, but because of the things he chooses to do as well.”
The highly acclaimed 1939 adaptation of
Wuthering Heights
doesn’t include any of Heathcliff’s actions toward the children, because it doesn’t include the children at all. Instead, it ends by fast-forwarding from Cathy’s death to Heathcliff’s death many years later, and then showing the ghosts of Cathy and Heathcliff happily walking together on the West Yorkshire moors. The 1954, 1970, and 2011 adaptations only include Hareton (“Jorge,” in the Mexican version) as a young child, and don’t portray Heathcliff or Cathy’s children.
Eliminating the second generation of characters and Heathcliff’s treatment of them “allows you to ignore that who he is persecuting are the innocent,” Hirst says. “You can’t think of it as a love story if you actually honestly portray that part of the story,” because “what his love actually looks like is this horrifying toxic nightmare of a thing.”
Early media coverage of Emerald Fennell’s 2026 adaptation has noted the film’s deviations from the novel, including
Cathy’s age
(Robbie is 35 whereas in the novel her character dies before 20); the casting of Elordi as Heathcliff, whose
racial and ethnic identity
in the book is ambiguous (characters frequently describe him using a slur for Romani people); and the film’s ahistorical
costumes and sets
.
Additionally, the new movie does not tell the second-generation characters’ stories following Cathy’s death and, in fact, overwrites some of their existence. In Fennell’s version, Cathy’s brother is dead by the time her father brings home a selectively mute boy, whom Cathy chooses to name Heathcliff after her deceased brother. The new film also doesn’t include Heathcliff or Cathy’s children.
All of which makes sense. It’s hard to spin a film as a
Valentine’s Day movie
if the romantic hero kidnaps the heroine’s daughter.

Cuba’s energy and tourism sectors are in crisis as US sanctions and a blockade of oil supplies, particularly after pressure on Venezuela, have halted fuel imports and strained the power grid. The lack of fuel has forced hotel closures, empty attractions and disruptions to transport and flights, depriving many Cubans of crucial income and prompting concerns of broader economic and humanitarian fallout.

Severe water crisis hits two Palestinian camps in Lebanon
2026-02-13 10:36:56 GMT
https://www.newarab.com/news/severe-water-crisis-hits-two-palestinian-camps-lebanon

Palestinian refugees in
Lebanon
renewed appeals to UNRWA and the Popular Committee to provide sufficient clean water and end worsening humanitarian conditions in Beirut and southern Lebanon.
Amid escalating living crises facing Palestinian refugees in
Lebanese camps
, administrators of the Al Murshid well in
Ain al Hilweh camp in southern Lebanon
announced a decision to reduce water supply hours. The same situation applies to residents of the Burj al Barajneh camp in the southern suburbs of Beirut, who face water scarcity due to a breakdown at the Al Wazzan well.
Administrators of Al Murshid recently said, "With regret, operating hours of the well will be reduced to only three hours per day. This necessary measure follows a decision by the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for
Palestine Refugees
, UNRWA, to cut the diesel allocated to operate the well to less than half, preventing operation according to usual hours"
They stressed that the situation is beyond their control and urged residents to understand the critical circumstances, asking them to use water rationally.
Abu Mohammad, a resident of Ain al Hilweh, described to
Al Araby al Jadeed
, the Arabic language sister publication of
The New Arab
, "The water crisis is no longer bearable. We wait for the few hours of pumping to store what we can, as if we are living in a constant state of emergency. Three hours a day are not enough to secure drinking water, water for daily use and personal hygiene, or any basic needs."
"The problem extends to the cost of buying water, which many cannot afford, especially as most camp residents are low-income and elderly. We call on the concerned authorities, foremost
UNRWA
, to assume full responsibility, because water is not a luxury but a basic human right," he said.
"It is impossible to speak about health, cleanliness and disease prevention under these conditions. We are not asking for the impossible. We only want safe water in sufficient quantities," Abu Mohammad added.
In a separate interview with
Al Araby al Jadeed,
Firdaws Maysour Nassar, a social activist in Burj al Barajneh camp, said, "When we ask the popular committee about the cause of the water crisis, it holds UNRWA responsible. When we ask the agency, it says it provided diesel a year ago, but it was stolen within three days. The agency says it does not know who stole it, yet acknowledges it handed over the required quantities to the popular committee."
"Committee members later changed, and the file remained without accountability or follow-up. We are facing an ongoing crisis, and what is required is an immediate solution, not an exchange of accusations," Nassar added.
Nassar further noted there are two main reasons for the current crisis: first, limited pumping hours because UNRWA does not provide sufficient diesel to operate water generators; and second, the breakdown of the generator that pumps water to homes. Repairs require two parts: the first costs $2,500, and the second costs between $2,500 and $4,000. UNRWA refuses to cover the cost, while the Popular Committee says it lacks the budget.
"We are stuck between two sides without a solution," she said. "A small group has been able to subscribe to fresh water for 35 dollars per month, but most residents cannot afford this."
"In the Al Wazzan area specifically, the generator pumping water to homes has broken down. Available water is calcareous and highly saline, harming physical health and corroding most pipes and household tools," she added. "The generator costs between 2,500 and 4,000 US dollars, yet no party is acting, neither
UNRWA
nor the popular committee nor the Palestinian factions. Refugees are left without sufficient or drinkable water, while the cheapest water tank costs 500,000 Lebanese pounds, about six dollars."
"We call on
UNRWA
and the Popular Committee to find a radical solution to the water crisis," Nassar said. "It is unreasonable to give people guidance on hygiene and disease prevention while water suitable for bathing, washing vegetables, laundry and cleaning is unavailable."
Maha Mahmoud, also a resident of Burj al Barajneh camp, said, “The available water is highly saline and unfit for use, causing health problems including allergies, skin diseases, severe dryness and hair loss. It has also caused damage to household possessions, such as taps, mixers, and tanks, due to rust. The water is not subject to any health testing or monitoring.”
She told
Al Araby Al Jadeed, "
We are forced to buy fresh water every three days for bathing, washing vegetables, cooking and even ablution, as saline water cannot be used for any of these purposes. The monthly cost of buying fresh water exceeds $100, a heavy burden on camp residents amid Lebanon's difficult economic conditions. We also have to buy a water tank for 350,000 Lebanese pounds, about four dollars, every three days, and it only covers basic use."
"
We feel abandoned
, and that service and aid reductions are deliberate, increasing daily suffering and making life almost impossible," she said. "The aim is clear: to pressure Palestinian refugees and push them to leave, while most of us have no alternative or ability to rent outside the camp. This is not a dignified life. What we are living is a real tragedy that worsens day by day, amid the absence of oversight and accountability,
leaving refugees alone
to face poverty and disease."

Behind the Curtain: Resistance rising
2026-02-13 10:35:27 GMT
https://www.axios.com/2026/02/13/trump-lose-power-republican-resistance

Little by little, week after week, a subtle but significant shift is unfolding in American politics: Institutions and even a small but growing number of Republicans are
standing up
to President
Trump
.
Why it matters:
This is hardly COVID, where everyone seemed to resist everything — or even a return to Normal Times, when CEOs and Republicans
said something
when they
saw something
alarming.
But the law of political gravity
is starting to apply to Trump. Simply put, the more unpopular his policies and tactics, the easier it is for even scared Republicans to speak up and institutions to hold their ground.
To be clear, the number of House and Senate Republicans willing to cross Trump publicly remains tiny. But everywhere else, resistance is growing.
Look how 2026
has started for Trump, and the new pushback he faces, as synthesized by Axios' Zachary Basu:
⚖️ Retribution:
A federal grand jury
unanimously rejected
the Justice Department's attempt to indict six Democratic lawmakers over a video they made urging service members to refuse unlawful orders. It's
at least the fifth time
that charges against Trump's adversaries or protesters have been turned away by a grand jury — virtually unheard of in modern federal prosecutions. A federal judge also
shut down
Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's attempt to punish Navy veteran Sen. Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.) over his role in the video, accusing the Pentagon of unconstitutional retaliation.
🚨 ICE raids:
Trump's border czar Tom Homan
announced an end
to the 10-week ICE surge in Minneapolis following the fatal shootings of two U.S. citizens, which drew mass protests and rare rebukes from
corporate America
. The president
acknowledged
his mass deportation campaign could use a "softer touch," as
private
and
public polls
point to a sharp decline in support for his immigration policies.
🪖 National Guard:
Trump also
withdrew
all federalized National Guard troops from L.A., Chicago and Portland after repeated legal defeats and opposition from state and local leaders, dealing a blow to his efforts to crack down on crime in Democratic-run cities.
📦 Tariffs:
Six House Republicans joined Democrats to
pass a resolution
rescinding Trump's tariffs on Canada. The vote became possible only after a smaller group of Republicans staged a
floor rebellion
against GOP leadership, opening the door for Democrats to
force more politically painful votes
on Trump's trade agenda.
🗂️ Epstein files:
Trump's push to shut down
MAGA's Jeffrey Epstein obsession
backfired in spectacular fashion. The Justice Department is still grappling with daily backlash after releasing more than 3 million documents, with Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.)
voicing rare criticism
over revelations that DOJ tracked what lawmakers searched while reviewing the unredacted files.
📽️ Racism:
A chorus of Republicans, led by Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.),
condemned Trump's reposting
of a video that depicted Barack and Michelle Obama as apes. The White House initially defended the post before deleting it and claiming an aide shared the clip.
🇩🇰 Greenland:
Trump
dominated Davos
last month with his threats to seize Greenland by any means necessary —
only to retreat
amid market turmoil, European fury, warnings from congressional Republicans, and a vague "deal" promising the U.S. greater access to the Arctic territory.
🏦 Fed:
The DOJ's criminal investigation of Federal Reserve Chair Jay Powell has
drawn deep skepticism
from Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), who has vowed to block confirmation of Powell's successor,
Kevin Warsh
, unless the probe is dropped. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent
privately proposed
shifting the investigation to the Senate to placate Tillis, who swiftly threw cold water on the idea.
White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt
told Axios in response to a query about this column: "President Trump is the unequivocal leader of the Republican Party and anyone who says otherwise is fooling themselves."
"Under President Trump's leadership, Republicans will remain united together against the radical Democrats, who will destroy our country once again, if given the chance, with wide-open borders, noncitizens voting in elections, and horrible economic policy."
The bottom line:
Trump remains the dominant force in American politics. But the automatic deference that defined his first year is eroding.
Go deeper
: MAGA's metastasizing mess.

The Complicated History of Interracial Love
2026-02-13 10:30:00 GMT
https://time.com/7377429/complicated-history-interracial-love/

When my father died, I inherited hundreds of transcripts from interviews he conducted with interracial couples in Chicago. He began his
project
in 1937, as a 21-year-old graduate student, and continued it into the 1980s, documenting the lives of couples who crossed the city’s rigid color line over the course of a century.
As I immersed myself in these stories, I was unsettled by a question that kept resurfacing: What, exactly, is the impact of interracial dating?
[time-brightcove not-tgx=”true”]
The couples my father spoke with in the 1930s built lives together under daily scrutiny, employment discrimination, police harassment, and exclusion from white neighborhoods. And yet, inside some homes—and even inside the interracial spaces they created as refuge—anti-Blackness endured. Crossing the color line
did not
always mean challenging the
hierarchy
behind it.
A striking example was a social organization I had never heard of: the Manasseh Club.
In the 1890s, interracial couples in Chicago formed the
Manasseh Club
, named after the biblical son of a Jewish and Egyptian couple. The club met regularly, held dances, and provided burial insurance and cemetery plots. Rumors of it first drew my young father through South Side “colored” neighborhoods, searching for mixed-race couples. Former members described the club as a haven.
But the more my father asked questions, the more a pattern emerged. The couples admitted were overwhelmingly white women married to Black men.
Black women married to white men were almost entirely excluded. Several people my father interviewed could recall seeing only three or four such couples admitted in the club’s entire history.
When my father pressed a white woman who was married to a Black man on the absence, she responded with brutal candor: “Most of the Manasseh women don’t want to have anything to do with colored women.” She went further, offering her explanation for why white men rarely married Black women: “The morals of colored women have been looser,” she claimed. “They don’t have to marry them.”
Another white woman who belonged to the Manasseh Club argued that Black women “don’t like intermarriage.” “And yet they will have all sorts of white men,” she sneered. As if her disparagement of colored women weren’t enough, she went on to cast white women as the greater sufferers.
“Who are the slaves of the South?” she asked dramatically, then answered: “A white woman and a colored man.”
A Black doctor married to a white woman expressed a similar sentiment: “If colored women would say to the white men of the South, ‘You can’t have me until you put a ring on my finger,’ the southern white man would be the first to favor intermarriage.”
Reading these exchanges, I found myself wondering what Black husbands felt when they stepped into interracial spaces where Black women were unwelcome. What did it mean to build a refuge by reproducing the very stereotypes and hierarchies that make refuge necessary? For members of the Manasseh Club, the gender of the spouses mattered nearly as much as their race. Marriages between white women and Black men were revered; marriages between Black women and white men were looked down on.
If the Manasseh Club shows how anti-Blackness shaped who belonged, my father’s interviews also show how it shaped what parents wanted for their children.
In one early interview, a Black father cooed over his baby’s light skin and reddish hair, calling the boy his “Little Dutchman.” “He’s even lighter than his mother,” he told my father proudly. Other parents expressed disappointment or dread when babies appeared too dark. For instance, a white wife to a Black man refused to consider the children of mixed couples as colored. “I always call those girls Manasseh,” she told my father.
Another white woman my father spoke with rejected the Manasseh Club because she was repelled by members’ fixation on light skin. They acted as though “their children were a little better than the full-colored child,” she said—teaching their children to believe “a colored person can’t get anywhere.”
The irony is that these parents tried to lift their biracial children up by teaching them to see colored children as beneath them. Instead, it backfired. Over the years, my father heard how their confidence was shattered the moment the outside world reminded them that, in its eyes, they were colored, too.
One white mother complained that mixed children felt the sting of discrimination more sharply. She recalled how it pained her to reveal to her children that they were colored. “People said things to them, and finally we had to tell them,” she said. “And it was a terrible shock.”
In these conversations, interracial intimacy did not automatically deconstruct racism. Sometimes it reinforced racist perceptions of whiteness from one generation to the next. My father learned that some people had married because of their partner’s color, not despite it. Some Black spouses seemed to hope that marrying a white person might lighten their children, perhaps even allow them to pass as white. Some white spouses, in turn, sought partners with light skin, hoping their children would turn out lighter than their spouse.
By the time I was born, the language surrounding interracial dating and marriage had changed. The couples my father interviewed in the 1960s no longer demeaned “colored” women or spoke openly about passing. But America’s racial assumptions about who belongs together, whose bodies are legible as family, hadn’t disappeared.
When I was a child, my sister and I once waited in an ophthalmologist’s office in downtown Chicago after an eye exam. Our mother checked us in and left. Later, my father arrived to pick us up. He told the receptionist he was there for his two daughters.
“Your daughters haven’t been here,” she said.
Then my sister and I stepped into the reception area.
It simply hadn’t crossed her mind that the daughters of the white man standing in front of her could be Black.
My father’s 1930s interviews tell stories of couples who defied Chicago’s seemingly impermeable color line. But the archive offers a warning worth carrying into conversations about interracial love: crossing a boundary isn’t the same as dismantling what built it.
Love can cross a line. Erasing it requires justice—and that takes work.

Archaeologists find 10,000-year-old rock art in Egypt's Sinai
2026-02-13 10:29:58 GMT
https://www.newarab.com/news/archaeologists-find-10000-year-old-rock-art-egypts-sinai

Archaeologists
have discovered a 10,000-year-old site with rock art in
Egypt's
Sinai Peninsula, the country's ministry of tourism and antiquities said Thursday.
The previously unknown site located at
Sinai's
Umm Irak Plateau has a 100-metre-long rock formation whose diverse carvings trace the evolution of human artistic expression from prehistoric times to the Islamic era.
The Supreme Council of Antiquities "has uncovered one of the most important new archeological sites, of exceptional historical and artistic value", the ministry said in a statement.
Its chronological diversity makes it "an open-air natural museum", according to council secretary general Hisham El-Leithy.
The natural rock shelter's ceiling features numerous drawings in red pigment of animals and symbols, as well as inscriptions in Arabic and the Nabataean language.
Some engravings "reflect the lifestyles and economic activities of early human communities", the ministry said.
Inside, animal droppings, stone partitions and hearth remains confirm that the shelter was used as a refuge for a long time.
These "provide further evidence of the succession of civilisations that have inhabited this important part of Egypt over the millennia", Tourism and Antiquities Minister
Sherif Fathi
said.
He described the discovery as a "significant addition to the map of Egyptian antiquities".
The site is located in the south of the Sinai Peninsula, where Cairo is undertaking a vast megaproject aimed at drawing mass tourism to the mountain town of Saint Catherine, a UNESCO world heritage site and home to Bedouin who fear for their ancestral land.

JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) — Indonesia has begun training a contingent of up to 8,000 soldiers it plans to send as part of an international peacekeeping force to
Gaza
, the first firm commitment to a critical element of U.S. President Donald Trump’s postwar
reconstruction plan
.
Indonesia has experience in peacekeeping operations as one of the top 10 contributors to United Nations missions,
including in Lebanon
, and has been deeply involved in providing humanitarian aid to Gaza, including funding a hospital.
But many Indonesians are skeptical of President
Prabowo Subianto
‘s plans to join
Washington’s proposed Board of Peace
and participate in the International Security Force with only vague details so far on how they will operate, seeing it as simply kowtowing to Trump’s agenda as the two countries negotiate a trade deal.
“We need to be careful to ensure that our military personnel are not supporting the Israeli military forces,” said Muhammad Zulfikar Rakhmat, a Middle East expert with Jakarta’s Center of Economic and Law Studies. “We need to be careful that our military forces are not fighting against wrong actors.”
The ISF’s mandate remains unclear
U.N. peacekeeping forces all have clear and strict mandates, but since the Board of Peace and ISF will operate outside the U.N., many wonder how the troops will be used, and who will pay for them. Last year’s ceasefire agreement broadly says that the ISF will “provide support to vetted Palestinian police forces in Gaza” and will “work with Israel and Egypt to help secure border areas.”
Indonesia currently is paid by the U.N. for the troops it sends to serve as peacekeepers, but people fear it will have to pick up the tab for the troops sent to Gaza, as well as
a possible $1 billion payment for a permanent place
on the Board of Peace, as outlined in a draft charter.
Indonesia is the world’s most populous Muslim country and firmly supports a two-state solution in the Mideast, and officials have justified joining the Board of Peace by saying it was necessary to defend
Palestinian interests
from within, since Israel is included on the board but there is no Palestinian representation.
“Indonesia sees the importance of the involvement of the parties to the conflict as part of the process towards peace,” Foreign Ministry spokesperson Yvonne Mewengkang said this week.
She said Indonesia would use its membership to “ensure that the entire process remains oriented towards the interests of Palestine and respects the basic rights of the Palestinian people, as well as encouraging the realization of a two-state solution.”
The Jakarta Post slammed that kind of reasoning in an editorial, however, saying that an “independent Palestinian state, if it emerges at all, is likely decades away.”
“Indonesia will end up paying $1 billion long before any meaningful outcome is achieved,” Abdul Khalik wrote. “And if Indonesia eventually withdraws in frustration, it will have already spent vast resources; financial, diplomatic and political, for nothing.”
Trump seen as overstepping the UN
The Board of Peace was initially envisioned as a small group of world leaders overseeing Trump’s
plan for Gaza’s future
. But the U.S. president has since said he sees the board as a mediator of worldwide conflicts, sidestepping the mandate of the U.N.
Prabowo, a former army general who has been keen to raise Indonesia’s profile on the world stage, quickly accepted Trump’s offer for a place on the Board of Peace and made an initial pledge of 20,000 Indonesian troops as peacekeepers during his speech at the
United Nations General Assembly
.
An online petition started by a group of Muslim scholars and activists questions joining a body that ostensibly promotes peace, but whose proposed chairman for life will be Trump, citing his threats to take Greenland, the seizure of
then-Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro
, and the American veto of a U.N. Security Council resolution calling for a Gaza ceasefire last year.
“In our belief, peace will be difficult to achieve by a country or a leader of a country who repeatedly uses his veto power to prevent the occurrence of peace itself,” reads the petition, which calls for Indonesia to withdraw from the Board of Peace and has gotten more than 9,000 signatures so far.
“The BoP faces serious legitimacy problems, both normatively, structurally and morally.”
Indonesia’s military readies troops despite lack of guidance
About 100 protesters against Indonesia’s involvement gathered outside the U.S. Embassy in Jakarta on Friday, holding signs with slogans like “Bored of peace?” and “Free Gaza.”
Earlier this week, Indonesian Army Chief of Staff Gen. Maruli Simanjuntak said that training had begun for the peacekeepers, even though Indonesia has yet to receive any guidance on what types of personnel were needed.
He said Indonesia now envisions sending between 5,000 to 8,000 troops.
“We have started training personnel who might later serve as peacekeepers,” he said. “So that means engineering, medical units - the types often deployed.”
Despite the skepticism at home, the idea of Indonesians serving as peacekeepers in Gaza is seen in the region as a good one, said Hassan Jouni, a Qatar-based analyst who was formerly a Lebanese army general. Indonesia, he said, is viewed as an “honest and acceptable broker” by both sides in the conflicts in Lebanon and Gaza.
“Indonesia is a Muslim country... and its religious identity gives it a large distinction in its security participation as part of the peacekeeping forces in the Arab region,” he said. “At the same time, it does not pose a strategic threat to Israel.”
While Indonesia and Israel do not have formal diplomatic ties and Indonesia has been supportive of the rights of the Palestinians, it has not taken a directly confrontational stance toward Israel similar to some other Muslim-majority powers such as Turkey and Iran.
“From this point of view, the participation of Indonesian forces in southern Lebanon comes in a balanced and effective manner,” he said, and it may be expected to do the same in Gaza.
Many are looking for clarity toward the inaugural meeting of the Board of Peace next week in Washington, where other countries are expected to announce troop commitments of their own.
Prabowo plans to attend in person and is expected to also sign the new trade deal while there, and the Center of Economic and Law Studies’ Rakhmat said he didn’t think he would be swayed by public sentiment.
“I don’t think the domestic opposition would significantly change the decision of Indonesia in joining the BoP,” he said.

New revelations from Epstein files take a toll across Europe
2026-02-13 10:23:02 GMT

2026-02-11T14:56:44Z
GENEVA (AP) — The fallout from the Jeffrey Epstein saga is rippling through Europe.
Politicians, diplomats, officials and royals have seen reputations tarnished, investigations launched and jobs lost after a
trove of more than 3 million pages
of Epstein-related documents released by the U.S. Justice Department revealed their ties to the American financier and convicted sex offender who died behind bars in 2019.
Apart from the former Prince Andrew, none of them face claims of sexual wrongdoing. They have been toppled for maintaining friendly relationships with Epstein after he became a convicted sex offender.
Some experts note
the reckoning in Europe’s parliamentary democracies
has been swifter and more severe — for now — than in the United States, where Epstein built his empire and hobnobbed with many American elites.
Here’s a look at some of those in the Old World caught up in the new furor.
U.K. royal family
The former Prince Andrew, one of King Charles III’s two brothers, is one of the most prominent names linked to the Epstein underworld involving the recruitment of underage girls for sex.
He has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing, but the scandalous headlines forced the king last year to
strip Andrew of his royal titles
, including that of prince. He is now known as Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor.
The recent document dump exposed the depth of ties between Mountbatten-Windsor and Epstein, revealing more unsavory details that have jolted the royal family, including an allegation that the former prince sent trade reports to Epstein in 2010.
Mountbatten-Windsor
has been forced to move out of the royal estate that he occupied for more than two decades. Buckingham Palace says that the king
is ready to support police
in the event of an inquiry into whether Mountbatten-Windsor gave confidential information to Epstein.
British politics
The U.K. government has been shaken by new revelations about
Peter Mandelson
, a longtime Labour party stalwart who Prime Minister Keir Starmer brought out of the political wilderness as U.K. ambassador in Washington.
Mandelson was stripped of that plum post
in September
, after Epstein emails showed that they had had closer ties than the ambassador had initially acknowledged.
While Starmer himself isn’t implicated in the files, his position has come under threat over appointing Mandelson. He has faced calls from his opponents and from within his own Labour party to resign — which he has so far refused.
Mandelson is now facing a criminal investigation, after the new files suggested that he may have shared market-sensitive information with Epstein a decade and a half ago.
Norway’s crown princess
The new documents showed, among other things, that Norwegian Crown Princess Mette-Marit, the 52-year-old wife of Crown Prince Haakon, borrowed an Epstein-owned property in Palm Beach, Florida, for several days in 2013.
And in an
email exchange
between Epstein and Mette-Marit in 2012, he noted how he was in Paris “on my wife hunt,” but “i prefer Scandinavians.”
She replied that the French capital was “good for adultery,” but “Scandis” were “better wife material.”
Mette-Marit apologized this month for “the situation I have put the royal family in,” and said: “Some of the content of the messages between Epstein and me does not represent the person I want to be.”
Norway ex-prime minister
The head of the economic crime unit of Norwegian police said Thursday that former Prime Minister Thorbjørn Jagland has been charged with “aggravated corruption” in connection with an investigation linked to the release of the Epstein files.
Økokrim, as the police unit is known, said last week it would investigate whether gifts, travel and loans were received in connection with Jagland’s position.
On Thursday, unit chief Pål K. Lønseth also said its teams conducted a search of Jagland’s residence in Oslo on Thursday, along with searches at two other properties in Risør, a coastal town to the south of the capital, and in Rauland to the west.
The searches were carried out after the
Council of Europe
, a human rights body that Jagland once led, said it was honoring a request from Norwegian authorities to waive the immunity from legal processes that he had enjoyed.
The council lifted the immunity, saying it was intended to protect activities linked to official duties, not “personal benefit.” Jagland is also a former head of the Norwegian Nobel Committee.
Norwegian former ambassador
Mona Juul, Norway’s ex-ambassador to Jordan, who was involved in Israeli-Palestinian peace efforts in the 1990s, resigned over the weekend, after reports said that Epstein left $10 million to Juul’s children in a will drawn up shortly before he died.
Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide said that a ministry investigation into her knowledge of and contact with Epstein will continue, and
Juul will continue discussions
with Norwegian officials to clarify the situation.
French ex-culture minister
Jack Lang, 86, stepped down as head of the Arab World Institute in Paris over alleged past
financial links to Epstein
that prompted a tax investigation.
Lang was summoned to appear Sunday at the French Foreign Ministry, which oversees the institute, but submitted his resignation.
The former culture minister under President Francois Mitterrand is the highest-profile figure in France impacted by the U.S. Justice Department’s release of files on Jan. 30.
Slovakia ex-foreign minister
Prime Minister Robert Fico’s national security adviser, Miroslav Lajčák,
resigned over past communications with Epstein
— including text messages in which they discussed “gorgeous” girls.
“When I’m reading the messages today, I feel like an idiot,” Lajčák told Slovak public radio.
Lajčák, a former foreign minister and former president of the U.N. General Assembly, has denied any wrongdoing. He said that he considered Epstein a valuable contact who was accepted by the rich and powerful in the U.S.
“Those messages are nothing more than stupid male egos in action,” Lajčák said. “Nothing more than words ever came of it.”

Ukraine’s drones flew three sorties per minute in January — Russia lost 8,600+ more troops than it recruited, commander says
2026-02-13 10:20:19 GMT
https://euromaidanpress.com/2026/02/13/ukraines-drones-flew-three-sorties-per-minute-in-january-russia-lost-8600-more-troops-than-it-recruited-commander-says/

Ukraine's Unmanned Systems Forces (SBS) drove Russia's troop balance negative for the second time since the full-scale invasion, with verified drone kills far exceeding Moscow's January recruitment, SBS commander Robert "Madiar" Brovdi reported. His forces flew 140,677 combat sorties in January alone, averaging three sorties per minute, while destroying thousands of pieces of Russian equipment alongside the personnel losses.
As Russia's full-scale war against Ukraine approaches the end of its fourth year, Moscow continues its ground attacks across the frontline, sustaining heavy losses in the drone-saturated battle zone. The balance between Moscow's ability to feed troops into the front and Kyiv's capacity to eliminate them has emerged as the central variable determining whether Russia can sustain its offensives, the Ukrainian leadership and military currently believe.
Russia's January recruitment fell 8,618 short of drone-verified kills
Brovdi
reported
that
Ukraine's drone units verified 30,618 Russian personnel kills during January, while Moscow managed to recruit or contract just 22,000 troops over the same period
.
The resulting deficit of 8,618 marks only the second month since 2022 when Russia lost more troops than it could replace
. Brovdi called the result "
not a reason for applause,
" stressing that the minimum monthly task is to equalize the balance between incoming and eliminated Russian troops.
The real goal, he said, is to gradually ramp monthly kills to 50,000
. Brovdi's January numbers suggest that Ukraine's drone forces are currently delivering about 60% of that target from drones alone, with room to scale further.
Russia's mobilization plan for 2026 targets over 400,000 new troops and Moscow would handle that regardless of circumstances, the commander said.
SBS claimed one in three January kills
Brovdi's own SBS Group accounted for 9,381 of the 30,618 total verified kills — roughly every third eliminated Russian soldier, according to the report.
That figure is 22% below December's record, when SBS pilots struck 12,037 out of a total 33,019
. Two factors drove the slowdown: persistent fog and blizzards throughout January, and a decrease in Russian assault activity, the commander said.
The broader drone kill count also dipped from December's record, though it remained well above the autumn pace. In November 2025, Ukrainian drones struck 26,000 Russian troops; in October, 24,000, according to the
official data
.
Earlier, Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi
confirmed
that January's overall Russian losses — nearly 32,000 killed and seriously wounded across all weapon types — exceeded recruitment. Syrskyi had disclosed in late December 2025 that Russia's full-year 2025 losses of 410,000 troops exceeded the 406,000 Moscow claimed to have recruited, with December's kills roughly matching recruitment.
Explore further
Ukraine’s kill rate just overtook Russia’s troop replacement, Syrskyi says
37,000 FPV drones and 140,000 sorties — what it took
To achieve these results last month, the SBS Group expended 37,054 FPV drones, 1,119 night bombers, 1,301 fixed-wing interceptors, 971 interceptor copters, and 936 Mavic drones, Brovdi said.
The 140,677 combat sorties averaged 4,500 per day — three per minute around the clock for all 31 days of January
. The daily average hit 303 Russian troops and 896 targets.
Brovdi says his forces destroyed 1,012 enemy drone pilot launch points, 1,404 pieces of drone operator equipment, 2,128 Russian reconnaissance and strike drones, 478 artillery systems, 80 tanks, 88 armored vehicles, 44 air defense and MLRS systems, 27 radars, 1,705 logistics vehicles, and about 28,000 pieces of other equipment during January.
President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has previously
set the strategic benchmark
at 50,000 Russian losses per month — a level he says Russia would most likely be unable to replenish.
"It's the optimal level at which Russia will begin to seriously weigh what it is doing and what it is fighting for,"
Zelenskyy noted.

'Palestine House' in London is facing ongoing harassment
2026-02-13 10:19:19 GMT
https://www.newarab.com/news/palestine-house-london-facing-ongoing-harassment

Entering the building, visitors find themselves in another world—real, not virtual—populated by people of diverse backgrounds and nationalities, all centred on Palestine.
In central London, the "
Palestine House
" was established about a year ago as a "cultural embassy" and "gathering hub" representing Palestinian identity. The house now faces a blockade seeking to strangle it.
The six-storey building in Holborn is hard to miss. It sits just two kilometres from Parliament and government offices and falls under the constituency of
UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer
. On its facade, a protest calls out Israeli crimes in Palestine. Silent but visible, the Palestinian flag glows on a banner that reads: "
Stop the Genocide
."
That banner is one source of the conflict. It was installed by Osama Qashoo, the house's founder, to greet nearly 250,000 visitors, he told
Al-Araby al-Jadeed
, the Arabic language sister publication of
The New Arab
.
He said the house is a social project with no political leanings except defending the Palestinian cause.
"Stop the Genocide" as a crime
Qashoo said Camden Council, which administratively oversees the house, insists on removing the banner, claiming it is a "criminal breach of the law".
Official correspondence reviewed by
Al-Araby al-Jadeed
claims the banner's illumination as the problem, in violation of urban planning rules designed to preserve the area's architectural character.
Angela Ryan, head of the council's planning department, told
Al-Araby al-Jadeed
the banner must be removed because it was not licensed.
She said the house could formally request a permit for a non-illuminated banner, but warned there was "no guarantee" it would be granted.
The issue remains unresolved.
Some visitors questioned the council's focus, noting that the neighbouring fast-food chain "Wasabi" also displays a banner brighter than the "
Stop the Genocide
" sign.
Tracy Duffy, a visitor, said, "Even
protesting Israeli crimes
in Palestine has become a crime!" She called on management to "fight to keep the banner at any cost."
Meanwhile, another visitor, Sanjay Raj, asked, "Why focus on the Palestine House?"
Physical pressure
Physical attacks are another form of pressure aimed at closing the house, which presents itself on social media as "a home for Palestinians and anyone who has suffered displacement, exile, or seeks community."
On 27 November 2025, Qashoo was repeatedly assaulted near the building. After one attack, he called the police, who recorded the incident and assured him they would investigate. He has heard nothing since, though the attack meets the criteria of a hate crime.
Police did not confirm an "open investigation".
Despite providing the incident's timing and Qashoo's name, a spokeswoman told
Al-Araby al-Jadeed,
"We could not locate an ongoing investigation based on the information provided."
Over the past six weeks, Qashoo and his brother suffered further assaults, seeing "no point in contacting the police because they do nothing."
Sunday surprises
Sundays hold a special place in the house.
The day begins with a Palestinian breakfast, including za'atar, olives, falafel, fava beans, labneh, baba ghanoush, tahini, flatbread, and tea.
Afterwards, Qashoo leads visitors on a tour of all six floors. Each floor tells a
story of Palestine
, allowing visitors to experience cities such as Jerusalem, Jenin, Tulkarm, Gaza, Ramallah, and Nablus. The top floor evokes the Palestinian desert.
Qashoo, drawing on his experience as a filmmaker and his knowledge of Palestinian history, geography, and society, stresses the importance of visiting Palestine to witness its reality.
Visitors are often surprised to learn, for example, that the Israeli army treats wounded Palestinians in Israeli hospitals at Palestinian Authority expense, calculated at tourist rates.
Qashoo said Israel collects roughly $100 million annually from Palestinian exports passing through Israel, enough to build many hospitals in the Palestinian territories, which he argues explains the army’s insistence on demolishing hospitals.
Visitors also hear about
the destructive impact of British military
and intelligence support to Israel on Palestinian society.
Qashoo demonstrates, with figures, Palestinians' potential to rebuild their economy without aid.
He said Palestinians ask Britain to stop supporting Israeli authorities and open markets to trade with Palestine instead of ignoring illegal trade with settlements, which Britain considers unlawful. Palestinians seek "trade, not aid".
Za'atar, olive oil, and dabke
The house differentiates between governments and people. It emphasises "respect for British societal values, including equality, freedom of speech, and cultural diversity."
This is exactly what successive British governments have proudly highlighted over the past decades, most recently the current government. In a tweet on Wednesday evening, Prime Minister Starmer said, "Britain is a proud, tolerant, and diverse country," responding to businessman Sir Tim Ratcliffe's claim that "immigrants are taking over Britain."
Qashoo said, "We are here for the community." He pointed to house principles published online: "We welcome everyone, from London and around the world, and provide an environment where each individual feels valued and respected."
The house is open to all social, cultural, and artistic activities. It provides space for young people to explore business projects, network, and build friendships. It encourages marriage and childbearing to preserve identity, offering free use of the wedding hall for couples with at least one Palestinian partner. Courses in the Arabic language and Palestinian arts, including embroidery and dabke, are also hosted.
The house launched the "
Gaza Cola
" project, with sales exceeding six million bottles, still growing in the Gulf.
The building is filled with images of Palestinian suffering, especially in Gaza, historical maps of Palestine, and depictions of planned occupation and displacement. Its ground-floor restaurant displays images of dead children, destroyed homes, and Palestinian resilience, accompanied by Arabic and Palestinian music.
Protesters sometimes gather outside, waving Palestinian flags.
Hate messages
House staff, mostly young international volunteers, said the project's growing popularity has not been welcomed by some neighbours and supporters of Israel.
They regularly receive hate messages calling them "terrorists", "bloodsuckers," "racists," and "anti-Semites," with threats of killing. Staff rarely report these incidents, believing "no one will act because we are Palestinian or
pro-Palestine
."
Qashoo added that the goal is to "exhaust us psychologically, financially, and mentally until we despair."
Other harassment includes cutting the electricity. A large generator now powers the building after the local electricity company disconnected service, citing unpaid bills from a previous tenant. The council opposed using the generator without prior approval.
In a letter to the House, reviewed by
Al-Araby al-Jadeed
, the council said the generator constituted "unauthorised development and a breach of (urban) planning rules."
The objection cited "the potential negative impact on building occupants and nearby businesses due to noise and smoke."
In a call with
Al-Araby al-Jadeed,
Angela Ryan confirmed the council "received a complaint about the generator" but declined to disclose the complainant's name.
The council gave the Palestine House until 20 February to remove the generator, warning that failure to do so would result in legal action.
Qashoo, however, insists he has received no complaint. He said removing the generator would halt all activity in the building.
"I have found no solution so far," he added. "We have exhausted every means to restore electricity, but they have trapped us in a cycle that drains our energy, time, and resources."
Intimidation through litigation
The House was advised to hire a lawyer, but Qashoo asked, "Where would I get the funds to hire lawyers?"
He contrasted their limited resources with the UK Lawyers for Israel group, located metres away, which openly aims to "create a supportive climate in the UK for Israel" by challenging narratives critical of Israel.
The organisation's website says one of its ways to support Israel in the UK is by "providing legal assistance, advice, and campaigns to counter attempts to undermine Israel, Israeli organisations, Israelis, or supporters of Israel, or to attack or delegitimise them."
One of the group's most troubling strategies for the Palestine House and its growing UK supporters is exploiting legal loopholes to file baseless lawsuits against opponents, deterring protests.
Rights organisations
have filed complaints with the UK Solicitors Regulation Authority, alleging the group sends "vexatious, legally unfounded letters" to intimidate Palestine supporters.
While the organisation has denied the allegations, the investigation has been ongoing since August, amid concerns that the group operates through law firms outside the authority's oversight.
The Charity Commission is also investigating a related charity accused of issuing "legal threats to charities and individuals" in violation of the law.
"Like living under occupation"
Across High Holborn, the Israeli Hajaj Holding bought a multi-use building for £52 million ($71 million) in 2021. The company focuses on assets in Germany and London, aiming to increase its value through management improvements and development rights.
The Palestine House could have used the building commercially to earn millions, but chose to defend its identity despite the siege imposed on it. Qashoo described the challenges as "occupational harassment aimed at expelling us… It feels like we are under occupation, not in London."
"The system does
not welcome our presence here
," he said, and urged accountability from both Britons and non-Britons.
"This system oppresses us simply because we express our identity in a supposedly multicultural society," he added.
Qashoo also pledged to uphold the motto, "Your voice should be loud and proud" for all Palestinians.
How to help
The house's main request is for people to visit and join as members. Qashoo stressed it is open to all ideas except alcohol, and provides a platform for Israel.

Finding Strength After a Synagogue Fire in Mississippi
2026-02-13 10:00:00 GMT
https://time.com/7378086/mississippi-synagogue-arson-fire/

In the Deep South, family and community ties run deep. The southern Jewish community is no exception.
We are bound by ties of faith as a small minority in a mostly Christian part of the country. There are only around
2,900 Jews living in Mississippi
. Louisiana’s Jewish population is nearly 20,000, less than one-half of 1% of the state’s total population. We are bound by ties of family, sharing roots going back generations. And we are bound by ties of community, having attended the
same summer camps
, showed up at each other’s family celebrations, and felt each other’s pain.
[time-brightcove not-tgx=”true”]
On Jan. 10, a 19-year-old man
poisoned with antisemitic beliefs
broke into the Beth Israel synagogue, the
oldest synagogue in Mississippi
, and used
gasoline to set fire to the building’s interior
. In an interview with law officers, the arsonist characterized this building as a
“synagogue of Satan”
and admitted to targeting the building because of its “Jewish ties.”
Jewish ties have held this community together for generations, and Jewish ties are what are motivating us to stay the course and to rebuild. This community isn’t going anywhere.
Our two communities of New Orleans and Jackson, Miss. share many common bonds and a history of helping one another in times of trial. In Aug. 2005, when
Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans
, members of the Jewish community of Jackson welcomed members of the New Orleans community into their homes as they waited for the city to rebuild. For many, Beth Israel Congregation became their second spiritual home.
When the New Orleans community heard about the arson attack in Mississippi, everyone sprang into action. Word spread quickly, and one of us—Lindsay Baach Friedmann—immediately swung into action, jumping into her car to make the three-hour drive up to Jackson. It was one of several visits Lindsay made over the next few weeks.
On Lindsay’s second trip to Jackson, she was invited to attend the first Shabbat service after the fire, which was being hosted in a local Baptist church. Word about this trip went out in her temple bulletin, and her rabbi insisted that she should not go empty-handed.
The community started cooking (this, after all, is New Orleans). By the time Lindsay was ready for the road trip, her car was loaded to the roof with king cakes, cookies, brownies, cupcakes, and a Praline king cake challah.
Her car smelling like a bakery, Lindsay drove the entire 190 miles without once turning on the heat to ensure the delicacies arrived in perfect condition for the Oneg Shabbat service.
Lindsay unloaded the car and met several of the pastors, who shared the story of the church’s founding and its connective roots to the synagogue. It turned out that when this Baptist church was founded some 50 years ago, they needed a home, and the synagogue offered them a place to pray until their church was built. Now, they were returning that favor by taking in the Jewish congregation and lending them an indefinite home.
That night, the community celebrated Shabbat together marking the resilience of this historic Jewish community and their commitment to their future. Following services, the remaining king cakes were taken to the local firehouse and shared with the first responders who battled the fire.
This week, we took Beth Israel’s story to Washington, D.C. One of us, Beth Israel’s president Zach Shemper, joined Anti-Defamation League team members in meetings with legislators to urge Congress to protect funding for enhanced security for synagogues and other houses of worship, starting with
increased funding for the Nonprofit Security Grant Program
and
support for the Pray Safe Act,
which would create a central database of security resources for institutions.
No community should have to endure a tragedy like this alone. And with the right action, we can make meaningful progress toward ensuring it never happens again.
We envision a country where people of different faiths pray together. A country where people still watch out for each other, not because of mistrust, but because they genuinely care for each other. A country where people can make something better after a tragedy.
In the weeks since the arson attack, Beth Israel has been supported by neighbors and people of different backgrounds and beliefs who have stood together with compassion and resolve. That is the America we believe in.

Swiss wrestling champion Joel Wicki caps off memorable career

Joel Wicki, one of the most successful Swiss wrestlers of his generation, has announced his retirement. The 2022 champion of Swiss wrestling, known as Schwingen, enjoyed a remarkable career marked by spectacular victories as well as repeated setbacks due to injuries. When Wicki stepped into the sawdust ring, one thing was clear: hesitation was not his style. The wrestler from central Switzerland was known for his offensive approach, confidence and willingness to decide a bout quickly. These qualities made the 28-year-old one of the dominant figures of modern Schwingen. Now Wicki has announced his retirement. He is one of only two wrestlers from the Central Switzerland wrestling association ever to be crowned the king of Schwingen (Schwingerkönig). His defining moment came on August 28, 2022, when he defeated Bernese wrestler Matthias Aeschbacher in the final after an intense 12 minutes and 41 seconds. At 25, Wicki reached the pinnacle of a career that was already rich in success.

UK court overturns terrorism ban on Palestine Action group
2026-02-13 08:00:20 GMT
https://www.israelhayom.com/2026/02/13/uk-court-overturns-palestine-action-terrorism-ban/

A judicial determination struck down the Home Office's terrorism classification of Palestine Action as unlawful, marking a significant defeat for British authorities,
The Independent
reported.
Co-founder Huda Ammori prevailed in her judicial review challenging the governmental designation. The court's decision invalidated the classification despite its having been implemented following operational actions against military aircraft. Yvette Cooper, serving as Home Secretary at the time, instituted the proscription in July 2024 after operatives from the organization damaged aircraft at a Royal Air Force facility.
The designation remains under provisional status, pending additional court proceedings that could affect the outcomes of numerous criminal prosecutions involving protest participants currently advancing through Britain's judicial system.
NEW: Police release footage to trial of the Palestine Action members. It shows the attack on PC Kate Evans with a sledgehammer. This is distressing. She still isn't back to normal duties. Yet mainstream journalists and celebs call Palestine Action non-violent. A nasty joke.

— Heidi Bachram (@HeidiBachram)
November 24, 2025
Civil liberties organizations denounced the measure as a "grave abuse of state power," while attorneys representing Palestine Action maintained their client organization rejects violent methodology.
The ruling adds to earlier legal victories for the organization, including the acquittal of six Palestine Action operatives of aggravated burglary charges following allegations they forcibly entered the British headquarters of an Israeli arms manufacturer,
Elbit
.
Charlotte Head, Samuel Corner, Leona Kamio, Fatema Rajwani, Zoe Rogers, and Jordan Devlin received not guilty verdicts at Woolwich Crown Court in southeastern London after prosecutors alleged they employed or threatened illegal force.
The operatives allegedly employed a police vehicle to breach an Elbit Systems manufacturing site in Bristol during the early morning of August 6, 2024, and assaulted responding officers using sledgehammers, Avon and Somerset Police stated, with video evidence presented to jurors.
The jury acquitted all six defendants of aggravated burglary, while Rajwani, Rogers, and Devlin also received not guilty determinations on violent disorder charges.
