Malaysia seeks to seize Saudi prince’s overseas assets worth US$115 million
The 1MDB funds are held in several Swiss bank accounts belonging to Turki Abdullah Al Saud
The Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) has filed a court order to forfeit overseas assets belonging to Prince Turki Abdullah Al Saud.
The application to forfeit assets was filed under Sections 56(1), 59 and 61(2) of the Anti-Money-Laundering, Anti-Terrorism Financing and Proceeds of Unlawful Activities Act.
Around US$115.3 million held in several Swiss bank accounts is subject to the forfeiture order, including funds in JP Morgan (Suisse) and UBS Switzerland.
MACC chief commissioner Azam Baki confirmed the court application on Sunday.
Previously, in October 2026, the MACC obtained an order to block US$115.3 million in transactions held in three Swiss bank accounts under the name of Prince Turki Abdullah Al Saud.
At the time, the MACC said the move was based on information it received in 2011, alleging that he had received, transferred and used proceeds from the misappropriation of 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) funds through his bank accounts.

Iran: Ready to compromise, zero enrichment not for negotiation

Iran is prepared to compromise in nuclear talks with the US if sanctions are lifted, but the issue of "zero uranium enrichment" is no longer on the negotiating table, Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Majid Takht Ravanchi said in an interview published by the BBC.
"The ball is in America's court to prove that it seeks an agreement," Takht Ravanchi said, adding that if US intentions are genuine, "I am sure we will be on the path to an understanding." He confirmed that a second round of indirect talks is set to take place Tuesday in Geneva and described previous discussions as having proceeded "more or less in a positive direction," though he cautioned that it was too early to judge the outcome. US President Donald Trump has also described the talks as positive.
Takht Ravanchi said Iran was willing to show flexibility in the negotiations if Washington agreed to lift sanctions. He noted that the demand for "zero enrichment," publicly emphasized by several senior US officials, was no longer being raised at the talks. "The issue of zero enrichment is no longer an issue, and from Iran's perspective it is no longer on the table," he said.
On Saturday, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Trump preferred a deal but acknowledged that reaching one with Iran would be "very difficult."
Trump has threatened to use military force if no diplomatic solution is reached to curb Iran's nuclear program. At the same time, the US military has increased its presence in the region, and according to reports, an additional aircraft carrier was sent to the Middle East last week.
The US and Iran held indirect talks earlier this month in Oman. Takht Ravanchi pointed to Tehran's proposal to dilute its stockpile of uranium enriched to 60% as evidence of its willingness to compromise. That level of enrichment, which is close to weapons-grade, has deepened suspicions that the Islamic Republic is moving toward developing nuclear weapons, an allegation Iran consistently denies.
"We are ready to discuss this and other issues related to our program if they are ready to talk about sanctions," Takht Ravanchi told the BBC, without elaborating.
Asked whether Iran would agree to remove from its territory its stockpile of highly enriched uranium, estimated at more than 400 kilograms, as it did under the 2015 nuclear deal, Takht Ravanchi replied that it was "too early to say what will happen during the negotiations." Other proposals previously reported in the media include a temporary suspension of uranium enrichment by Tehran.
One of Iran's key demands has been that the talks focus exclusively on the nuclear issue. However, the deputy foreign minister said, "Our understanding is that they have come to the conclusion that if they want an agreement, they should focus on the nuclear issue." If so, that would mark a significant step forward from Tehran's perspective, as it has viewed Washington's maximalist demands for zero enrichment as an obstacle to any potential deal.
Takht Ravanchi reiterated Tehran's refusal to discuss its ballistic missile program with the US delegation, a central demand of Israel, which is within range of those missiles. The inclusion of the missile issue in any future agreement, along with Iran's support for armed organizations across the region, has also been emphasized by US officials, including Rubio.
"When we were attacked by the Israelis and the Americans, our missiles came to our aid. How can we agree to deprive ourselves of our defensive capabilities?" Takht Ravanchi said.
He also questioned the justification for the increased US military buildup in the region and warned that another war would be "traumatic, bad for everyone … everyone will suffer, especially those who initiated the aggression."
"If we feel it is an existential threat, we will respond accordingly," he said. Asked whether Iran would view a US campaign as a battle for its very existence, he replied: "It is not wise even to imagine such a dangerous scenario, because the entire region would descend into chaos." Iran has repeatedly made clear that US military bases in the region would be considered legitimate targets.
Senior Iranian officials are engaged in intensive discussions with counterparts across the region, who in turn have been speaking with President Trump about the urgency of avoiding a war with far-reaching consequences. Iran has repeatedly accused Israel of trying to sabotage the negotiating track.
"We hope we can achieve this through diplomacy, although we cannot be 100 percent certain," Takht Ravanchi concluded, adding that Iran must "remain vigilant so that we are not caught off guard."

Ignorance and panic mark death throes of liberalism
Peter Hartcher (“Taylor-made Libs v Turnbull party?” , February 14) refers to remarks by Tony Barry of Redbridge Group that MPs from all parties have two speeds, “ignorance and panic”. This was truly demonstrated by James Paterson when he said that based on recent opinion polls, the Liberal Party was losing 7000 supporters a day. Except this was both panic and ignorance. Paterson should know opinion polls show the voter’s intention at the time and not how they would vote once in the polling booth when confronted by serious choices. He would also be aware that polling before the last federal election had the Labor government just scraping in and some polls suggested a minority Labor government. Still any reason to discard a female leader. Rodney Crute, Hunters Hill
The party is in its death throes. Menzian small “l” liberalism’s time is coming to an end. The beginning of the end came in 1996, when John Howard took charge. He had little time for “trivialities” such as housing and social justice: nothing in common with Robert Menzies or Malcolm Fraser, who saw owning a place of residence as sacrosanct and a necessity for a happy and productive society. Howard saw residential property as a tax concession perk for savvy investors for tax minimisation in exchange for electoral support. Successive iterations of the Liberals and their tail-wagging, “do not upset” the Nationals rump had not and still have not the nous or intellect to see the damage Howard’s tax concessions have done and are still doing. So in walks the Alternative Liberal Party (the ALP under Albanese) in 2022 and it’s all the way with Howard and his tax perks. The “space” is up for grabs and Albanese takes it gleefully; the demise of Menzian liberalism aided and abetted by both sides of the duopoly of woe. There is nothing to suggest that under Albanese and Jim Chalmers anything will change. John Kingsmill, Fairlight
Talk sense on immigration
My heart sank when I heard the new opposition leader talk about “bad” migration (“‘Change or die’: Taylor’s new vision”, February 14). Postwar Australia has been built on immigration. Immigration policy needs to be continually reviewed and adapted to Australia’s needs at the time, but can this please be done through sensible and detailed analysis and not through dog whistling. Angus Taylor will lose voters to the left if he engages in culture wars and he will never outdo One Nation on the right. If we are to work towards greater social cohesion in this country, migrants should not be turned into scapegoats. Genevieve Kang, Glebe
So, Angus Taylor grew up in a suburb full of migrants, he said in his acceptance speech. Their contribution to society was “the cappuccino”, he stated. What an insult to migrants whose contributions to this country have been indefatigable. Shame his contribution is inconsequential and minuscule by comparison. Merilyn Hall, Greenwich
The main problem for the Liberal Party is that following the Friday the 13th coup, the same Liberals and Nationals are sitting there on the parliamentary benches glowering at the nation as were there on Thursday the 12th. The resignation from the Liberal Party of Charlotte Mortlock, the founder of the Hilma movement, says it all (“She tried to fix the Liberals’ women problem. Now she’s quitting the party”, smh.com.au, February 15). The more things change, the more they remain the same in Liberal Party World. Well may we say god save the teals because nothing will save the Liberal Party. Tom Mangan, Woy Woy Bay
While I agree with Rowan Godwin’s other comments (Letters, February 14), I take offence at his comparison of the Liberal Party to F Troop. As a kid, I loved F Troop and 60 years later I still remember it was a really funny program. In contrast, the Liberal Party is laughable for unfunny reasons and, the way it is going, it may one day be forgotten. Victor Bivell, Abbotsford
Ley should have stayed
Sussan Ley’s resignation has caused a byelection (“Why the fight for Ley’s seat will be a stiff test for Taylor”, February 14). Yes, she got rolled by her party, but regardless of that, it is selfish and unfair that taxpayers have to now fund a byelection because she’s decided she doesn’t want to stay in politics because she lost the leadership. A mature, professional response would be to stay until the next election. I hope she enjoys her generous pension – also funded by the taxpayers. Kip Morel, Pyrmont
The headline in Saturday’s letters pages asserts that the Liberal Party has a “women problem” because Sussan Ley lost the leadership (Letters, February 14). However, Jane Hume was elected deputy leader of the federal Liberal Party. Kellie Sloane is the NSW opposition leader. Jess Wilson is the Victorian leader. Ashton Hurn is the South Australian leader and Lia Finocchiaro is the Northern Territory’s chief minister. On the other hand, the federal Labor Party has a male prime minister, a male deputy PM and a male treasurer in its three senior leadership positions. How is it then that Herald letter writers conclude that the Liberal Party has a “women problem”? Riley Brown, Bondi Beach
Gap widens on haves and have-nots
Inequality is one of the blights on our society and Malcolm Knox has highlighted the fact that the gap between rich and poor is widening (“It’s time to say the C-word out loud”, February 14). Those in the lower echelons of the class structure will always struggle regardless of whether inflation is at 6 per cent or 1 per cent. In this so-called cost-of-living “crisis”, there are still millions of Australians eating in restaurants, driving new cars, paying private school fees, buying investment properties, travelling the world, going to concerts and sporting events, enjoying generous tax concessions, consuming endless cups of coffee and contributing to the coffers of the gambling industries. For the least well off, such things can be luxuries beyond their wildest dreams. It behoves our parliamentarians to protect the most vulnerable in our society to ensure everyone can live with dignity. Phil Peak, Dubbo
While Malcolm Knox raises some interesting ideas, he misses the point about class in Australia unless he addresses the work of Karl Marx and also the theory of the embourgeoisement of the working class, whereby workers develop false consciousness and discard their working-class status. The notion of classlessness became part of Australia’s social fabric when Robert Menzies corrupted the idea into what he called the “forgotten people” and John Howard capitalised on it with his “battlers”. Consequently, working Australians with a mortgage, a car in the garage and a barbie in the backyard, although being workers, came to see themselves as being middle class and needing to support the Liberal Party to stay there. Class still exists, but today the battlers are those struggling to eke out an existence on paltry handouts from the government; those who work three jobs in the gig economy; those unable to afford rents on properties that are negatively geared by people opposing legislative change to income and taxation; and those who have no protection via unions and no one to represent them. Patricia Farrar, Concord
Thank you, Malcolm Knox, for destroying the notion that we are a largely classless society. It is time for drastic action by Labor, on behalf of the less well-off and young people, to do away with concessions to the rich and establish an equitable tax system. Andrew Macintosh, Cromer
Trump cashing in
Nicholas Kristof’s story (“By one measure, Trump’s the best ever”, February 14) about the money Donald Trump and his family have raked off from the presidency tells us three things: how crooked Trump is, how inadequate the US political system is and how naive US electors are. The amount of damage Trump has done to his own country and to the world generally will take years to fix – if it’s at all possible. The Founding Fathers, whose perspicacity Americans love to extol, never reckoned with a person who was so unfit for the office. Ian Adair, Hunters Hill
That none of his predecessors ever cashed in on the presidency as he has is a label that superego transactional billionaire Donald would readily wave as a badge of honour. He, seemingly, subscribes to Mark Twain’s “money is God”. Steve Ngeow, Chatswood
Donald Trump will have no difficulty refuting the claim that Alexei Navalny was poisoned by Russia (“Russia poisoned Alexei Navalny with dart frog toxin, European nations say”, smh.com.au, February 15). He will simply check with Vladimir Putin, an impeccable source. Don Firth, Wooli
Hiding our Jewishness
I was grateful for your Saturday coverage marking two months since the Bondi terrorist attack, particularly the editorial “Two months after Bondi, it is more important than ever that we strive for social cohesion” (February 14). You refer to last week’s protests as a “small core of radical protesters”. However, as a Jewish parent, that to me is increasingly not how it feels. This week, my primary school-aged son attended an interschool sports competition wearing an unidentifiable plain T-shirt instead of his Jewish school uniform, accompanied by security. It was unsafe to do anything else. When Jewish children require security and must hide their identity simply to play sport, it suggests a problem that extends well beyond a marginal fringe. If we are serious about social cohesion, then leaders who amplify rhetoric associated with violence must be held accountable for the climate they help create. Tomas Lopata, St Ives
On Monday last, 3000 police with enhanced powers to move people on were in attendance at a pro-Palestinian protest. Far from Premier Chris Minns’ claim that such lethal curtailing of civil rights would make everyone safer, the Herald has featured injured protesters: ordinary Australians in their seventh, eighth and ninth decades whose democratic right to demonstrate peacefully was removed through overly aggressive tactics sanctioned by an unrepentant Minns. Monday’s protest was to focus on ongoing actions by the Israeli government in Gaza. What the world saw was peaceful protesters in Australia being attacked by their own police force. The development of social cohesion will never be advanced by increased powers to assault and detain ordinary Australians by their own state and federal governments under the guise of making us safer. Helen Cameron, Wollstonecraft
The comments by Prime Minister Anthony Albanese on the egregious NSW Police bastardry practised against Muslims praying in front of the Sydney Town Hall (“Officers’ action over protest prayer needs full explanation: PM”, February 14) are simply an admission that Minns and the NSW police commissioner need to be brought to heel in their attack on the freedom of the right to peacefully assemble and demonstrate opposition to public wrongs. Ian Usman Lewis, Armidale
Sure, some police may have overreacted, possibly responding to a perceived or real danger, but most citizens would appreciate, even demand, police protecting them in all potentially dangerous situations. They have a tough job day in and day out and they don’t always get it right. They deserve our understanding and the support of the premier and the police commissioner. Denis Suttling, Newport Beach
Labor must act on CFMEU
The recent CFMEU Herald coverage (“CFMEU behaviour on projects leads to 1000 complaints”, February 14) clearly shows that although Labor has put the CFMEU into administration, much more needs to be done, and it may take a royal commission to really change things. The Victorian Labor government can’t escape criticism. If one looks at underlying contributors, one factor again is how elections are funded. As union membership declined over the years, Labor’s electoral funding became more concentrated in the surviving unions, and they may have been more reluctant than was wise to completely deregister the union. They will pay a price. Labor’s changes to rules about electoral funding have done something to limit big money’s influence, but in the process, that has handicapped independent candidates financially to the extent that two independents, Zoe Daniel and Rex Patrick, are taking to the High Court a claim that Labor’s changes are unconstitutional. Australia’s electoral system is world-class, but our politics isn’t. Gary Barnes, Mosman
Exports killing species
The addition of many more plants and animals to Australia’s critically endangered and threatened species listings places even greater emphasis on addressing global warming issues (“Rising heat puts more species in peril”, February 14). While new environmental rules being developed by Environment Minister Murray Watt may address some of the threats to these species, they do not specifically address the primary cause of the dilemma – the burning of fossil fuels. In this regard, while Australian governments are attempting to reduce our carbon dioxide emissions through their support for renewables, the nation, nevertheless, substantially contributes to warming on a global scale through its exports of coal and gas for energy production. Roger Epps, Armidale
IOC’s double standards
The poor decision by the International Olympic Committee to disqualify Ukrainian skeleton athlete Vladyslav Heraskevych is mystifying given what Russia has done to trounce the Olympic spirit in so many ways (“Ukrainians blast IOC over disqualification”, February 14). The 1968 Black Power salute can only be described as iconic, a moment in the Olympics that shook the world and caused people to think. What a shame the IOC took a chance away for another poignant moment to occur. David Jarrett, Leppington
WorldPride profitable
In “Drive to survive helps in keeping festival alive” (February 14), Sydney gay and lesbian mardi gras chief executive Jesse Matheson speaks with Gary Nunn over lunch and is quoted as saying “even Sydney WorldPride made a loss”. Perhaps he should check the charity’s accounts at the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission, which show that by June 2023, the organisation had net assets of $33,968, and at June 2024, the year in which the company was wound up, it had net assets of $104,040 – certainly not a loss. Having managed a huge and successful event, the financial accounts show that they delivered all that was promised and they closed with a modest profit. Thanks to great leadership from CEO Kate Wickett. Philip Busfield, Surry Hills (chair of finance and audit committee of Sydney WorldPride 2023)
Face value
David Ashton (Letters, February 14), my son tells me about shopping in Las Vegas last year, where after registering online with an image of your face, customers go into shops where they take what they want from the shelves and just walk out. Shoppers’ linked bank details and the facial recognition software in the shop did the rest. Hardly faceless? Phil Armour, Yass

Russians attack Odesa region with drones, causing damage to civilian and transport infrastructure
According to Ukrinform, Oleh Kiper, head of the Odesa Regional Military Administration, reported this on Telegram.
“Administrative facilities at the railway station in the Odesa region were damaged. A railway tanker was also damaged by a repeated strike, causing fuel to spill and burn. The fires have been extinguished,” the post says.
In addition, as noted, the attack caused a fire on the roof of an abandoned one-story building. The fire was quickly put out.
Serhii Lysak, head of the Odesa City Military Administration, reported that in one of the city's districts, the blast wave damaged windows in residential buildings and educational institutions.
The municipal services have already eliminated the consequences. No information about the dead and injured has been received.
Also, the Odesa City Council reported that due to an emergency power outage at water supply facilities, users in Kyivskyi, Primorskyi, Khadzhybeiskyi, and part of Peresypskyi (Slobidka, Peresyp) remain without water supply.
Power engineers are working to restore power; once power is restored, the water supply will stabilize.
As reported by Ukrinform, the power supply situation remains difficult in Kyiv, Odesa, Mykolaiv, and Dnipropetrovsk regions.

European Debate Over Nuclear Weapons Gains Pace

European leaders, worried about threats from a nuclear-armed Russia and doubts about the future of US security commitments, are increasingly debating whether to bolster nuclear arsenals on the continent.
While the United States and Russia have thousands of nuclear warheads each, in Europe only France and Britain have atomic weapons, with the combined total in the hundreds.

Follow our coverage of the war on the @Kyivpost_official.
US President Donald Trump’s disdainful comments about NATO and his transactional approach to foreign relations have European allies questioning whether they can risk relying on US protection.
“Europeans can no longer outsource their thinking about nuclear deterrence to the United States,” an expert group warned in a report published for the Munich Security Conference.
It called on Europe to “urgently confront a new nuclear reality” in the face of “Russia’s nuclear-backed revisionism”.
Speaking at the MSC, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said he was already holding “confidential talks with the French president about European nuclear deterrence”.
Britain’s Prime Minister Keir Starmer said the UK’s nuclear deterrent already protected fellow NATO members but stressed he was “enhancing our nuclear cooperation with France”.
Starmer said “any adversary must know that in a crisis they could be confronted by our combined strength” alongside France.
Europe Deserves Seat at Ukraine Peace Talks, Says Polish FM
- US ‘ultimate guarantor’ -
NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte insisted that “nobody” was considering fully replacing the American nuclear umbrella, which has shielded Europe’s NATO countries for decades.
“I think every discussion in Europe making sure that collectively the nuclear deterrence is even stronger, fine,” Rutte, a former Dutch prime minister, told journalists.
“But nobody is arguing in Europe to do this as a sort of replacement of the nuclear umbrella of the United States.
“Everybody realises that is the ultimate guarantor -- and all these other discussions are in addition.”
US Under Secretary of Defense Elbridge Colby said that Trump “has made clear the US extended nuclear deterrent continues to apply here” in Europe.
He said there is US “receptivity to a greater European contribution to ... the NATO deterrent” -- but that conversations need to be “very sober” and “deliberate” because of concerns about nuclear proliferation and instability.
- No good options -
Discussion of nuclear armament has long been viewed as taboo in many other European countries -- but Russian aggression and worries about US commitment have forced the issue into mainstream European politics.
Many European officials are convinced that Moscow’s territorial ambitions will not be confined to Ukraine, and that other European countries -- including even NATO members -- could face some sort of attack.
The MSC report laid out five nuclear options for Europe, while cautioning that none were good. There was “no low-cost or risk-free way out of Europe’s nuclear predicament”, they warned.
“The era in which Europe could afford strategic complacency has ended,” wrote the authors, calling on European policymakers “to confront the role of nuclear weapons in the defence of the continent directly and without delay -- and to invest the resources needed to do so competently”.
It listed five options: Continue to rely on American deterrence; strengthen the role of British and French nuclear weapons in a European deterrent; jointly develop European nuclear weapons as a deterrent; increase the number of European countries with their own nuclear arsenals; or expand European conventional military power to present a more intimidating non-nuclear deterrent.
Sticking with the status quo, and relying on America’s unmatched military might, remained “the most credible and feasible option” in the short term, they argued.
- ‘We need action’ -
Very few currently believe Europeans can assume full responsibility for deterrence in the short term.
“If there’s going to be some kind of bigger European investments in France or the UK’s nuclear deterrence, that’s only a good thing,” Finnish Defence Minister Antti Hakkanen recently told AFP.
But he quickly added: “If you’re talking about to compensate US nuclear deterrence, that’s not realistic at this point.”
Experts nevertheless welcomed the increasingly serious political debate on an issue that has long worried military planners.
“That’s very positive, but now we need action,” Heloise Fayet of the French Institute of International Relations (Ifri), a contributor to the MSC report, told AFP.
The report noted that both France and Britain would face a range of challenges in growing their arsenals and extending nuclear protection across Europe -- from hefty costs to tricky questions about who holds final authority to launch the warheads.
French President Emmanuel Macron, who has previously raised the possibility of extending France’s nuclear umbrella across Europe, is scheduled to deliver a major speech on French nuclear doctrine at the end of February.
Macron said in Munich he was considering a doctrine that could include “special cooperation, joint exercises, and shared security interests with certain key countries”.

ZIM sold in $3.5B deal, to be delisted from Wall Street

ZIM Integrated Shipping Services will be sold in a deal worth more than $3.5 billion and delisted from Wall Street, marking the end of the company's operations as they have been known until now. The agreement, reached overnight, will see Germany's Hapag-Lloyd and Israel's FIMI Opportunity Funds acquire the historic Israeli shipping line and divide its operations in a move designed to secure Israeli regulatory approval.
Under the emerging deal, ZIM's activities will be split between shipping lines that operate to and from Israel and those that do not. Hapag-Lloyd will acquire the international routes that do not call at Israeli ports and integrate them into its global operations. The routes serving Israel will be sold to FIMI, which is expected to seek approval from Israeli regulators, including the Defense Ministry. The ministry plays a significant role due to the state's "golden share" in the company, which grants it special oversight powers on matters deemed strategic.
ZIM is currently traded on the New York Stock Exchange with a market capitalization of about $2.5 billion. The company went public in 2021 at a valuation of $1.5 billion. Other bidders reportedly included a group of investors led by ZIM CEO Eli Glickman, but their offers were believed to be lower than those submitted by Hapag-Lloyd and FIMI.
The transaction is not a standard acquisition in which a company is purchased outright and shares divided among partners. Instead, the structure effectively splits the company in order to navigate regulatory hurdles in Israel.
ZIM, originally founded in 1945 by the Jewish Agency as ZIM Palestine Navigation Company Ltd., was established before the creation of the State of Israel as a national shipping line. Among those who pushed for its establishment were David Ben-Gurion, who would become Israel's first prime minister, and David Remez, later the country's first transportation minister.
In early 1970, the state sold 50% of ZIM's shares to Israel Corporation. During Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's first government in the late 1990s, a decision was made to privatize the company as part of a broader plan to privatize most state-owned enterprises.
Hapag-Lloyd's shareholder base includes investors from Saudi Arabia and Qatar, holding approximately 10% and 12% stakes, respectively. That ownership structure is expected to complicate Israeli regulatory approval of a full acquisition. As a result, Hapag-Lloyd will purchase only the shipping lines that do not operate in Israel.
The routes connecting Israel to the rest of the world, considered strategically vital in times of emergency, will be transferred to FIMI. In theory, this arrangement is intended to satisfy Israeli regulators, given the importance of maintaining national maritime links during crises.

Efrat’s new mechitza pool tests balance between halacha, family life

Until recently, there was a longstanding joke in Efrat about whether the proposed swimming pool or the Messiah would come first. Now, the community, located in the Judean Hills just south of Jerusalem, has something that does not exist anywhere else in the world – a community pool with a mechitza: a mechanical wall that divides the pool in half.
A significant percentage of Orthodox Jews avoid swimming in mixed-gender settings. To meet their religious requirements, they need separate swimming hours or entirely separate swimming facilities for men and women.
Existing pools in Israeli communities generally operate on one of two models. Either they serve a religiously diverse population and are available for mixed swimming all the time, or they operate on a schedule that alternates among hours for men, women, and families.
Efrat’s founding rabbi, Shlomo Riskin, a serious swimmer, had a different vision. In keeping with the city’s hallmark outlook of balancing Jewish law and modernity, Riskin envisioned something so revolutionary that there was no precedent for it. Now Efrat has an eight-lane pool with a middle divider that opens and closes, enabling men and women to swim separately – at the same time.
Israeli innovation
The idea of building a pool in Efrat dates back decades. The actual construction of the project took 10 years – and NIS 40 million ($13m). According to Ryan Levin, executive director of the Efrat Development Foundation, also known as Keren Efrat, about 25% of the funding was provided by Mifal HaPais (the Israeli lottery) and other government allocations. Efrat’s municipality provided another 55%, and the Kleinberg Family Foundation, a philanthropy with family connections to the community, provided the remaining 20% through Keren Efrat.
Levin said that Riskin’s idea of creating a pool with a built-in divider that could be raised and lowered “seemed like fantastical thinking – and we made it practical.” Any pool construction must comply with specified requirements; Riskin’s vision went way beyond that.
“The mechitza has to go up and down: That’s a different problem. How do we, in a wet environment, have something safe and sturdy? It took a lot of testing to get it right,” Levin explained. “Part of why it took longer than expected was a lot of trial and error. The technical team worked very hard trying to figure it out.”
Levin said that “Outside of Israel, there are very few pools exclusively for the Jewish community. It makes sense that this [innovation] happened in Israel – and in a community that is both Orthodox and modern.”
A dream come true for some…
Reactions to the pool design among Efrat residents tend to fall into two camps. To those for whom separate swimming is a religious priority, the pool with a mechitza offers “a real, meaningful, actual solution for those who require it,” Levin noted.
Shira Schreier, a grandmother of 13, has been living in Efrat since 1989. She joined the pool as soon as it opened and swims almost every day. “The pool is a dream come true for me. I love to swim! I love the water aerobics classes!” she enthused. “The presence of the mechitza is genius as far as I’m concerned. There are four lanes for men and four lanes for women – and each [gender] goes out to their respective locker rooms.
“The design of the pool and the schedule are both perfect for me! The pool manager, receptionists, and lifeguards are all friendly and professional. The pool is new, clean, and beautiful, and it has greatly enhanced my physical and emotional health,” Schreier said.
“I love the new Efrat pool, and I am extremely grateful every day. I feel like I should make a blessing every time I go swimming.”
Leah Bernstein of Efrat is another satisfied user. “I think the mechitza is a wonderful solution to allow many hours a day of separate swimming.” She pointed out that there are no transparent windows on the women’s side, “to prevent people from looking in. I appreciate the time and effort put into planning the pool.”
Not a good match for others
For those critical of the setup, it’s generally not so much about the mechitza itself as it is about the pool’s design and scheduling policies that don’t meet their family’s needs.
Along with her husband and four children, ages seven to 11, Shaina Warshay has lived in Efrat since 2020. After visiting the pool once, the Warshays concluded that it wasn’t a good match for them.
“The layout of the pool precludes our family from fully enjoying it,” she said. “The family wading pool is in a separate room from the full-sized pool, so unless both my husband and I come, the kids have to choose one or the other. My kids did not enjoy the family time. The small area allocated to families was loud and crowded,” which makes lap swimming impossible. And if her children who genuinely want to swim want to go when it’s not family time, they can’t go with the parent of the opposite gender.
“I understand the desire for some to have separate swim hours for men and women,” Warshay elaborated. “I think the city did not take into account that there may be residents who don’t care if there are separate swimmers all the time.” She also made the point that the current configuration doesn’t allow any opportunity for adults “who may want to swim as a couple without the noise and crowding of young families present.”
Not so family-friendly
Wendy Erdheim-Poch, her husband, and two young boys have been living in Efrat for almost 10 years. A member of the pool for a few months, she indicated that, while separate swimming is not her priority, the mechitza, which has extended hours for adult swimming, “at least allows me the opportunity to swim at times that work for me – in theory.”
The issue, she said, “is that the schedule shows very little understanding of family and school realities.” She mentioned, as an example, that most of the hours on Fridays are reserved for separate swimming, even though children are not in school then.
“This was presented as a family pool, with family time at its core, but that is not how it feels in practice,” she asserted. “It often feels like a choice between separate swimming or a crowded situation where not everyone can realistically use the pool. If there is family time, it should be the entire pool. Separate swimming should happen at the same time on both sides. It should be one or the other, not a mix that leaves everyone frustrated. More true family time would make a big difference.”
Erdheim-Poch also expressed concern about the fact that when she brings her young sons to family swim, they are required to enter through separate entrances.
“My boys are capable and responsible, but they are still children. Things can happen very quickly around water – and pools, while enjoyable, can also be dangerous. Any system that physically separates a parent from their young children before they are reunited in the pool needs to be reconsidered. Family-oriented planning must account for safety, not just ideology or technical rules.”
From her perspective, “This is not just about a physical divider: It is about how policies, scheduling, and enforcement affect the overall atmosphere. Even people who are willing to compromise need a system that feels thoughtful, fair, and respectful of families, not one that creates tension and resentment.”
She would like to see the pool open much later on Fridays to relieve the overcrowding, and building “an outdoor pool for the summer and designating it as a true family pool. That would allow families to swim together without constant conflict over separation, while still preserving indoor options for those who prefer separate swimming.”
Balancing contradictory demands
Levin acknowledged the challenges. “The mechitza itself creates a challenge more than a single pool [does]. The challenge is the delivery of equity. We do our best, but it’s challenging to please everybody equally. Ultimately, balance is in the eye of the beholder; this is the compromise of a shared community.”
Addressing the fact that the kiddie pool is in a different room than the adult pool, he remarked that since both fathers and mothers take equal responsibility for their children, situating the kiddie pool on one side or the other would have created additional problems. Parents are expected to dress appropriately in the shared kiddie pool area.
With some notable exceptions, Levin said that the divided schedule “has been well received. Pools with separate hours also have limited family hours. The real novelty, aside from these family hours, is that men and women have equal access concurrently.” Levin called the Efrat model “absolutely duplicatable” by other communities.
Reflecting on the relative success of the Efrat pool in balancing contradictory demands, he concluded, “Often, as observant Jews, there’s emphasis on restriction and inconvenience. I think the message that Efrat is communicating broadly is that it is possible to square modern-day life with halachic [Jewish legal] sensibility in a way that doesn’t compromise on Halacha, religious sensitivities, and requirements.
“Creative thinking and willpower reveal solutions,” he said. “That’s exciting.”

US Justice Department sends Congress Epstein files memo as criticism mounts over redactions
Officials say edits protect victims, while lawmakers accuse DOJ of obscuring key details and fueling confusion
ISTANBUL
The US Justice Department has sent a letter to congressional leaders defending redactions in newly released Jeffrey Epstein files while providing a list of public figures named in the documents, a move that has intensified political disputes over transparency.
According to a report by The Hill on Saturday, citing Politico, the six-page letter was delivered to the Senate and House Judiciary committees and included “all government officials and politically exposed persons” referenced in the files.
The department said individuals appeared in a “wide variety of contexts,” ranging from direct communications with Epstein or associate Ghislaine Maxwell to indirect mentions such as media references.
The inclusion of high-profile names, including President Donald Trump, without detailed explanations drew sharp criticism from lawmakers.
Rep. Ro Khanna said through the US social media company X that the DOJ was “purposefully muddying the waters on who was a predator and who was mentioned in an email,” and added: “To have Janis Joplin, who died when Epstein was 17, in the same list as Larry Nassar, who went to prison for the sexual abuse of hundreds of young women and child pornography, with no clarification of how either was mentioned in the files is absurd.”
He urged officials to “Release the full files. Stop protecting predators. Redact only the survivor’s names.”
- ‘Political expediency and cheap clicks/demagoguery’
The debate follows complaints from members of Congress who reviewed unredacted material at a DOJ facility this week and described extensive masking of information they called unnecessary. Department officials have said the redactions were intended to protect victims’ identities.
Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche criticized lawmakers after Khanna and Rep. Thomas Massie publicly revealed several previously concealed names, arguing on X that they had “forced the unmasking of completely random people” with no connection to Epstein or Maxwell.
Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon echoed that criticism, accusing them of prioritizing “political expediency and cheap clicks/demagoguery over justice and due process.”
Separately, Rep. Nancy Mace also challenged the department’s legal justification for withholding information, writing on X that citing “Work Product Privilege” would not prevent courts from compelling fuller disclosure and questioning claims that redactions were unrelated to reputational or political concerns.
The Justice Department did not immediately respond to The Hill's request for comment, as scrutiny continues over its handling of the Epstein investigation and document releases.

Londoners express joy as Ramadan lights return to London
'I think it is great that we can celebrate all faiths and be totally inclusive in London. It is brilliant, really nice, really nice to see,' says Heather
- 'I'm Christian. I have Muslim friends here with me today. It's just all about friendship. And that's how I see it,' Dylan says
- 'For people who don't know about Ramadan, this is a good way for them to know that,' says Ramsha
LONDON
Returning for its fourth year, the UK's first and largest Ramadan light display once again illuminates Coventry Street in London, attracting crowds and public interest.
London's Ramadan lights are back again, lighting up the heart of the West End as the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, on Friday took part in the switch-on celebrations for the lights ahead of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.
More than 30,000 energy-efficient LED lights will shine nightly from 5 pm to 5 am local time until the end of Ramadan on March 19.
The display reads "Happy Ramadan" throughout the holy month, before switching overnight to "Happy Eid" next month.
The Ramadan lights have returned to the city for the fourth year as many people visit Coventry Street to see and take photos of the display.
Heather, who is in her 60s, is one of them, and she told Anadolu that she found the lights "lovely."
"I think it is great that we can celebrate all faiths and be totally inclusive in London. It is brilliant, really nice, really nice to see," she said.
Heather added that all nationalities and faiths are here in London, and that she likes seeing everyone celebrate it.
For his part, Dylan, an 18-year-old Christian, said: "As much as I believe that England is a Christian country, I also think that London is a very diverse city."
Dylan said that he believes they need to love neighbors who come from different religious backgrounds.
"Maybe sometimes we don't agree with someone, but as a Christian, I believe we should at least have the respect to let people think what they want to think," he said.
"I'm Christian. I have Muslim friends here with me today. It's just all about friendship. And that's how I see it," he added.
Also speaking to Anadolu, Ramsha, another London resident, said she feels happy when she sees the Ramadan lights.
"There are a large number of Muslims in London, and seeing our tradition and religion be celebrated makes us feel very included, and it's very pretty to look at," she noted.
Saying that she even comes and sees the Christmas lights, Ramsha said she believes lots of non-Muslims also come and see the Ramadan lights, "because it just looks nice and it makes you feel happy."
"For people who don't know about Ramadan, this is a good way for them to know that ... it's a festival for Muslims going on right now."

Zelensky: Ukraine Ready for Elections After Two-Month Ceasefire Backed by US

Ukraine is prepared to hold democratic elections if the United States helps secure a two-month ceasefire to allow for security guarantees and election preparations, President Volodymyr Zelensky said Saturday.
Speaking at the Munich Security Conference, Zelensky said elections during an active war would be impossible without a full pause in fighting and basic safety conditions.

“Give us two months of a ceasefire – and we will go to elections,” he said. “That’s it. Ceasefire, security, infrastructure. We need time to prepare.”
‘We Are Under Ballistic Attacks’
Zelensky rejected comparisons to historical wartime elections, including US elections during the Civil War, stressing that Ukraine faces constant missile and ballistic strikes.
“Our people are under missiles,” he said. “This is not just a ground war. We are under ballistic attacks.”
He also emphasized that any vote must include Ukrainian troops fighting on the front line – a logistical and legal challenge under current conditions.
“Our soldiers are defending the country and must also be able to vote. That is extremely complicated,” he said.
Appeal to Trump
Zelensky directly appealed to US President Donald Trump, saying Washington has the leverage to force Moscow into a temporary halt in fighting.
“President Trump can do this,” Zelensky said. “Put pressure on Vladimir Putin, get a ceasefire – and then our parliament will change the law and we will hold elections, if needed.”
British Defence Intelligence Update Ukraine 14 February 2026
He added pointedly that Ukraine is open to elections if they are genuinely required by partners – or demanded by Russia.
“If Americans need elections in Ukraine, if Russians need elections in Ukraine – we are open,” he said.
Zelensky ended on a note of irony, suggesting Ukraine could offer Russia a similar “ceasefire” – on the condition that Moscow holds free and fair elections of its own.
Election Debate Intensifies
The issue of wartime elections has gained traction in recent weeks after The Economist and Financial Times reported that Ukraine was allegedly considering a presidential vote in 2026.
Ukraine’s Presidential Office has pushed back, insisting that a just peace remains the top priority.
Zelensky has also dismissed as “a stupid idea” any suggestion of announcing elections on Feb. 24 – the anniversary of Russia’s full-scale invasion.

Iran prepared to consider compromises to reach nuclear deal:  'Ball is in the US's court'

Iran is prepared to consider compromises in order to reach a nuclear agreement with the United States, provided that Washington is willing to discuss lifting sanctions, a senior Iranian official told the BBC.
In an interview from Tehran, Majid Takht-Ravanchi, Iran’s deputy foreign minister, said that the ball was "in America's court to prove that they want to do a deal. If they are sincere, I'm sure we will be on the road to an agreement.”
He confirmed that a second round of talks, following an initial meeting in Oman, is scheduled to take place Tuesday in Geneva. So far, he said, the discussions have been “more or less in a positive direction but it is too early to judge.”
Takht-Ravanchi pointed to Tehran’s proposal to dilute uranium enriched to 60% as evidence of its willingness to compromise. However, that enrichment level is close to weapons-grade and has deepened suspicions that Iran is advancing toward nuclear weapons capability—an accusation it consistently denies. “We are ready to discuss this and other issues related to our programme if they are ready to talk about sanctions,” he told the BBC.
Asked whether Iran would agree to remove its stockpile of more than 400 kilograms of enriched uranium from its territory, as it did under the 2015 nuclear deal, Takht-Ravanchi replied, “It was too early to say what will happen in the course of negotiations.”
One of Iran’s key demands has been that the talks focus solely on the nuclear issue. The Islamic Republic has stressed that Washington’s demand for zero enrichment is an obstacle to any agreement. “Our understanding is that they have come to the conclusion that if you want to have a deal you have to focus on the nuclear issue,” the deputy foreign minister said. According to him, “issue of zero enrichment is not an issue anymore and as far as Iran is concerned, it is not on the table anymore.”
He underscored Tehran’s refusal to discuss its ballistic missile program with the Americans, a central demand of Israel. “When we were attacked by Israelis and Americans, our missiles came to our rescue so how can we accept depriving ourselves of our defensive capabilities?” he said.
Takht-Ravanchi warned that another war would be “traumatic, bad for everybody... everybody will suffer, particularly those who have initiated this aggression. If we feel this is an existential threat, we will respond accordingly.” Asked whether Iran would view a U.S. military campaign as a battle for its survival, he replied: “It is not wise to even think about such a very dangerous scenario because the whole region will be in a mess.”
Negotiations between Iran and the United States are expected to resume Tuesday in Geneva. Although Israeli officials assess that the chances of reaching an agreement are not high—given Tehran’s refusal thus far to accept Washington’s conditions—the understanding is that U.S. President Donald Trump wants to exhaust the diplomatic track and is giving it several weeks to a month. During the Geneva talks, Washington is expected to seek clear answers from Iran regarding demands raised in Oman.
Trump has stated that there is a deadline for the talks, and in the meantime the United States continues to build up forces in the Middle East. Secretary of State Marco Rubio addressed the recent reinforcement of U.S. forces near Iran, explaining that it was undertaken in part because “Iran has shown the willingness and the capability to lash and strike out at the United States’ presence in the region.” Therefore, he said, “sufficient firepower in the region to ensure that they don’t make a mistake and come after us and trigger something larger.”
Rubio reiterated that President Donald Trump prefers to reach an agreement with Tehran, even though it is “very hard to do,” and that envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner are expected to hold additional meetings soon to explore the possibility of progress.
“The president has said that his preference is to reach a deal with Iran,” Rubio said. “That’s very hard to do, but he’s going to try. And that’s what we’re trying to do right now.” He added that “ Iran will never be allowed to have a nuclear weapon, that that poses a threat not just to the United States, to Europe, to world security, and to the region.”

Zelenskyy says US ‘too often’ pushes Ukraine, not Russia, for concessions
Ukraine’s president also calls Vladimir Putin a ‘slave to war’ and accuses Moscow of stalling talks.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has expressed hope for United States-brokered peace talks with Russia next week, but warned that Kyiv was being asked “too often” to make concessions and pressed his allies for “clear security guarantees”.
Zelenskyy’s speech at the annual Munich Security Conference on Saturday came as US President Donald Trump seeks to broker a deal to end Europe’s biggest war since 1945.

Ukraine and Russia, which invaded its neighbour in February 2022, have engaged in two recent rounds of talks mediated by Washington in Abu Dhabi, UAE, described by the parties as constructive but achieving no breakthroughs.
The three sides are due to sit down in Geneva, Switzerland, again this week.
In his speech, Zelenskyy said he hoped the trilateral talks in Geneva on Tuesday and Wednesday “will be serious, substantive” and “helpful for all of us”.
“But honestly, sometimes it feels like the sides are talking about completely different things,” Zelenskyy said.
“The Americans often return to the topic of concessions, and too often those concessions are discussed only in the context of Ukraine, not Russia,” he said.
The Ukrainian leader also argued that there would be a greater chance of ending the war if European countries had a seat at the negotiating table, something Moscow has opposed.
“Europe is practically not present at the table. It’s a big mistake to my mind,” he said. And Ukraine, he said, “keeps returning to one simple point”.
“Peace can only be built on clear security guarantees. Where there is no clear security system, war always returns,” Zelenskyy said.
Among the most contentious issues in the negotiations is Russia’s demand for a full withdrawal of Ukrainian troops from the remaining parts of Ukraine’s eastern region of Donetsk that it still controls. Ukraine has rejected a unilateral pullback, while also demanding Western security guarantees to deter Russia from relaunching its invasion if a ceasefire is reached.
Zelenskyy, in remarks to reporters, said the US had proposed a security guarantee lasting for 15 years after the war, but Ukraine wanted a deal for 20 years or longer. He added that Putin opposes the deployment of foreign troops in Ukraine, as it would deter any future aggression by Russia.
Zelenskyy said Russia had to accept a ceasefire monitoring mission and an exchange of prisoners of war. He estimated that Russia currently has about 7,000 Ukrainian soldiers, while Kyiv has more than 4,000 Russian personnel.
He also acknowledged feeling “a little bit” of pressure from Trump, who on Friday urged him not to miss the “opportunity” to make peace and told him “to get moving”. Zelenskyy also called for greater action from Ukraine’s allies to press Russia into making peace, both in the form of tougher sanctions and more weapons supplies.
Trump has the power to force Putin to declare a ceasefire and needs to do so, Zelenskyy said. Ukrainian officials have said a ceasefire is required to hold a referendum on any peace deal, which would be organised alongside national elections.
Zelenskyy also expressed surprise at Russia’s decision to change its delegation to the Geneva talks and said it suggested to him that Russia wanted to delay any decisions from being agreed.
The Kremlin had said the Russian delegation would be led by Putin’s adviser Vladimir Medinsky, a change from negotiations in Abu Dhabi, where military intelligence chief Igor Kostyukov was in the lead. Ukrainian officials have criticised Medinsky’s handling of previous talks, accusing him of delivering history lessons to the Ukrainian team instead of engaging in constructive negotiations.
In his main speech at the Munich event, Zelenskyy also denounced Putin as a “slave to war”.
He drew parallels between the current talks and the 1938 Munich Agreement, when European powers let Hitler take part of the erstwhile Czechoslovakia, only for World War II to break out the following year.
“It would be an illusion to believe that this war can now be reliably ended by dividing Ukraine, just as it was an illusion to believe that sacrificing Czechoslovakia would save Europe from a great war,” he warned.

One Nation hunts down the Coalition, but voters give Taylor some ground
Updated ,first published
One Nation has drawn level with the Coalition for the first time, setting up a fierce battle for Australia’s conservative vote and making clear the enormous challenge confronting newly installed leader Angus Taylor.
In the first published poll since Taylor deposed Sussan Ley as the Liberal Party leader, support for One Nation has surged to 23 per cent of the primary vote – although voters appear willing to give Taylor an opportunity to turn things around, backing the Coalition under Taylor by three more percentage points than under Ley.
Asked how they would vote in either of two scenarios – one with Ley leading the Coalition and Taylor as leader in the other – voters handed One Nation 25 per cent of the primary vote to Ley’s 20 per cent, whereas Pauline Hanson’s party’s votes were split evenly at 23 per cent with a Taylor-led Coalition.
In either case, the Coalition’s support has continued to slide from 28 per cent in January to another record low, while One Nation surges from 18 per cent last month. Labor, meanwhile, regained some ground against a Taylor-led opposition to earn 32 per cent of the primary vote.
Taylor inherits an opposition that must convince Australians it can outperform the Albanese government on cost of living, with 92 per cent saying it would affect their vote, and 45 per cent ranking it as their number one concern. Immigration – identified by Taylor as a clear policy priority – and refugees (10 per cent) was the only other issue to reach double figures.
The findings, conducted by Resolve Political Monitor from February 8 to 14, canvassed 1800 respondents during the final days of Ley’s leadership and the first days of Taylor’s. The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 2.3 per cent.
With One Nation and the Coalition neck-and-neck on 23 per cent voter support each, this masthead has chosen not to highlight the two-party preferred vote. Only a seat-by-seat two-candidate preferred vote count could indicate which seats One Nation could potentially win, given the party’s support is typically concentrated in a smaller group of seats.
The findings also highlight the ongoing collapse in support for the major parties.
Just 51 per cent of voters said they would vote for one of the two major parties while Ley was still leader, while 49 per cent of people said they would vote for other options, including One Nation, the Greens or other independents.
With Taylor as leader, the major parties slightly increased their overall vote share to 55 per cent while “others” secured 45 per cent. At the last election, about one third of voters voted for independents and minor parties.
Acknowledging they must urgently claw back support, the new opposition leader and deputy Jane Hume said on Sunday they wanted to return the party to its traditional focus on economic management.
In this simplified chart, One Nation’s rise to match major parties is rapid.
Resolve pollster Jim Read said One Nation’s vote had risen to such heights that calling it a “minor party” was no longer a useful distinction.
“In Ley’s final week, Hanson’s party overtook the Coalition, and it’s only when we measure primary vote with the change to Taylor factored in that they draw level again,” he said.
“The task ahead of the new opposition leader is Herculean. The reset has allowed him to regain a couple of points from One Nation, but he has to do that another ten times before he even begins to compete with Labor.”
Taylor secured a plus 3 percentage point likeability rating, reflecting his status as a new leader, compared to a net likeability rating for Albanese of minus 12 percentage points and minus 11 percentage points for Ley. Andrew Hastie, who had also considered a challenge to Ley before withdrawing, had a likeability rating of plus 4 percentage points.
When voters were asked to nominate their preferred Liberal leader from a group of five names, 19 per cent named Ley, 10 per cent named Taylor, 13 per cent chose Hastie, 4 per cent of people nominated frontbencher Tim Wilson and former deputy Ted O’Brien secured just 3 percentage points. More than half those polled – 52 per cent – said they were unsure or had no preference.
Ley was the most popular pick among Labor, Greens and Coalition voters – though she had the benefit of incumbency – while among One Nation voters, Hastie (26 per cent) was the stand-out choice, followed by Taylor (15 per cent) and then Ley (10 per cent).
Pauline Hanson secured the highest net likeability ratings of plus 7 percentage points while David Littleproud and Chris Bowen were the two least-liked politicians after Ley and Albanese, scoring minus 8 percentage points each.
After 13 years as an MP, 61 per cent of respondents said they had heard of Taylor and 32 per cent had a neutral view of the new opposition leader, suggesting he has time to shape his story on his own terms, even as Labor digs up old controversies from his time as a Morrison-era energy minister.

Hong Kong’s surveillance cameras are expected to incorporate facial recognition technology as early as this year, pending the resolution of legal and technical issues, according to the city’s police chief.
Commissioner of Police Joe Chow Yat-ming also said on Sunday that the force would prioritise linking closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras in high-traffic and strategically located shopping centres into the force’s SmartView system, noting that operators had “responded positively” to the plan.
The force previously indicated that facial recognition technology could be adopted in the system by the end of last year, but Chow said that some legal and technical issues had to be addressed.
“The adaptability of our colleagues, the level of acceptance among the public and the legal framework – these are all areas we are working on,” Chow said in a televised interview.
“I hope that we can introduce [facial recognition technology] in the near future … I cannot say with certainty whether it will happen this year, but of course, I hope we can. If not, I hope it will be next year.”
Chow said the force would tell the public before deploying the facial recognition technology.

ASTANA, February 15. /TASS/. The construction and subsequent operation of Kazakhstan’s first nuclear power plant with Russia’s participation represent the creation of an entire sectoral cluster within the national economy, and Kazakhstan’s resources will be actively used for this purpose, Russia’s ambassador to Astana Alexey Borodavkin said in an interview with TASS.
"I believe I would not be far from the truth in saying that this project will boost the development of the construction and transport sectors, healthcare, the services sphere, and the Kazakh economy as a whole, and will also strengthen our integration-based economic ties, since we will be implementing it together. Kazakhstan’s resources will be used in the construction and operation of the plant," he said.
The diplomat noted that "this concerns uranium mined here, which will be used as fuel for the power plant, as well as Kazakh nuclear scientists." "In other words, a new sectoral cluster of Kazakhstan’s national economy is being created," Borodavkin added.
In 2025, Kazakhstan’s authorities announced that Russia’s Rosatom would lead the consortium to build the country’s first nuclear power plant. The facility is planned to be located in the settlement of Ulken in the Almaty Region near Lake Balkhash, after which the plant was named.

Brushing fraud: Britons told to beware of mystery parcels as new scam soars

A package arrives but you can’t remember ordering anything.
When you open it, you find some cheap, flimsy jewellery.
Is it a case of mistaken identity or has someone accidentally selected the wrong address? You put it to one side and wait to see if anyone claims it or contacts you to ask if you got their gift, but no one does.
While it is far from unusual for parcels to go astray, if one arrives with all your details on it, it is possible you have become an unsuspecting cog in a large-scale “brushing” fraud, a scam that is on the increase, according to online security experts.
Fraudsters need your postage details, which they will often obtain through a data breach. They then set up a false online account in your name on the shopping site they are selling their goods on and post a fake verified and positive review, apparently from you, about the products you have received.
These positive five-star reviews “brush up” their online ranking on the shopping site and also their credibility. In theory, this can then increase their sales. Oliver Devane of the security company McAfee says the goods need to be sent to the customer in order for a purchase and review to be verified. These fake verified reviews are often paid for.
While it may appear to be a victim-free scam, it could highlight that your personal details have been hacked. It also risks bringing potentially harmful toys or cosmetics into your home, says Devane.
“If it is some little toy that you give to your child, you’ve got no idea of the quality … which is a risk in itself. You have no idea where it came from and what it contains,” he says.
What it looks like
The package will come out of the blue and could contain anything from a key chain gadget to random homeware or even plant seeds. The contents will be cheap and likely to be of poor quality. This could happen at any time of the year, although deliveries of the goods peak at busy shopping periods.
In some cases, says Devane, the fraudsters may send QR codes or USB sticks with the product in the hope that people will scan them or put their into their computer. These will invariably lead to some malware being added to a phone or laptop that could result in data being stolen.
What to do
If you get something unexpected in the post, do not use it or consume it as it may be dangerous. For example, a toy may not be produced to proper standards or perfume may have harmful ingredients.
Check your online accounts to make sure there has been no unauthorised order and then report it to the marketplace that it was sent from.
Amazon says third-party sellers are prohibited from sending unsolicited packages to customers and have a way to report them here. If you can identify the fake reviews in your name, then you can inform the shopping site you are dealing with and they can take action.
It is worth changing the password on your online shopping accounts and enabling two-factor authentication, says Devane.
Do not try to return it to the retailer as this may prompt them to engage with you more and initiate more scams. Instead, simply throw it away after reporting it, he says.

Senior police praised undercover officer who lied to court about identity, papers at spycops inquiry show

Senior police officers praised an undercover officer who had lied to a court about his real identity during a prosecution of environmental activists, secret documents aired at the spycops public inquiry have revealed.
Jim Boyling, an undercover officer, gave evidence under his fake identity when he was prosecuted while masquerading as an activist. He was prosecuted alongside six campaigners for public order offences, but senior officers decided not to tell the court that he was actually a police spy.
His superiors authorised him to maintain his false identity through the legal case, adding later that he certainly “should be praised for the way in which he dealt with each of the court appearances”.
Two activists’ criminal convictions were overturned when the subterfuge later came to light.
The spycops inquiry has heard that over decades, senior officers had a deliberate policy of not disclosing the true identities of undercover officers to courts when they were prosecuted.
The inquiry, led by the retired judge Sir John Mitting, is continuing to examine how many activists have been wrongly convicted as a result.
An internal police review concluded in 2009 that the undercover officers in the covert Scotland Yard unit the Special Demonstration Squad (SDS) “did, with their management’s knowledge, blessing and support, mislead the courts”.
The review concluded that the deceitful tactic prejudiced the rights of activists to a fair trial, describing it as “grossly unprofessional … and completely ‘off piste’ from accepted practice”.
The spycops scandal involves 139 undercover officers who spied on tens of thousands of predominantly leftwing campaigners in secret operations that began in 1968 and lasted until at least 2010.
So far the inquiry has heard evidence that between 1970 and 1998, undercover officers concealed their real identities in at least 13 trials of activists who were supporting causes such as anti-fascism, anti-apartheid and animal rights. The trials mainly concerned public order offences.
David Barr, the inquiry’s chief barrister, said: “The SDS appears to have put the security of its operation over and above its duty to the court and the rule of law.”
Senior police officers believed that disclosing the real identities of undercover officers in court would inevitably cut short their deployments. It would also have led to public controversy that would have jeopardised the existence of the unit.
They also believed that being prosecuted boosted the credibility of their spies among the activists they were infiltrating.
This week, the inquiry heard evidence from Boyling, who infiltrated environmental and animal rights activists between 1995 and 2000.
In 1996, he was arrested under his fake identity while taking part in an environmental demonstration at the Transport for London offices.
The managers of the SDS told him to maintain his false persona throughout the legal proceedings.
He gave evidence as his fake identity when he and the activists were prosecuted for public order offences over three days at a magistrates court in 1997. The magistrate was not told that he was an undercover officer.
Barr asked him: “Was there any consideration of the impact of the court not knowing that you were, in fact, an undercover police officer?” Boyling replied: “No.”
Boyling and the activists were acquitted. After the trial, DCI Keith Edmondson, the head of the SDS, wrote in a memo: “DC Boyling’s operation has been strengthened by this involvement in this case, not least for the way in which he has been seen to stand his ground against the ‘authorities’. Certainly he is to be praised for the way in which he dealt with each of the court appearances.”
Barr said the memo suggested that Edmondson “had no qualms whatsoever about one of his undercover police officers giving evidence in a false identity in a trial with co-defendants. Is that fair?” Boyling replied: “Yes”.
Edmondson previously said: “We did not consider that he would be misleading the court by appearing in a cover identity.”
Supt Eric Docker, a more senior officer who oversaw the SDS, sent a memo up the chain of command, reporting a “most satisfactory conclusion” which “once again, highlights the professionalism and dedication of our SDS officers”.
After Boyling was unmasked as an undercover officer in 2011, two activists who had been convicted of related offences in the protest had their convictions overturned.

‘It makes no sense’: the battle over plans for a windfarm by the Yorkshire Dales

Instead of a slingshot, the Davids are brandishing a sculpture and a coffee table book. Their Goliaths are a Norwegian energy company and a UK energy secretary with renewable targets to meet.
A fierce battle has begun over one of England’s tallest windfarms, proposed for deep peat moorland overlooking the Yorkshire Dales national park, in what residents say will mark the irrevocable industrialisation of their rural landscape.
A local sculptor has constructed a scale model of one of Hope Moor windfarm’s 20 turbines, whose blade tips will reach 200m – as high as the “skyscraper” in Deansgate, Manchester, which is the tallest building outside London.
“It’s all very well talking about 200m but it’s hard to visualise it,” said Michael Kusz, who lives in Reeth, North Yorkshire. He has based his model on the model railway 00 gauge; a model person at this scale is 22mm tall.
“I’m absolutely horrified,” he said of the proposed windfarm, which would power 81,000 homes and constitutes a key part of the Labour government’s renewable energy targets and planning revolution. “I’ve been on walks where you can have a 360-degree view with nothing man-made and it brings a profound depth of relaxation I’ve never experienced before. There are so few places in Britain where you can connect to the natural world in its own state.”
The battle over Hope Moor is set to be repeated across the country as the government’s unprecedented drive to generate 95% of electricity from low-carbon sources by 2030 clashes with local people’s fears for wildlife, landscape and countryside.
This week, the UK’s energy secretary, Ed Miliband, announced contracts for 157 new solar farms, 28 new onshore windfarms, eight offshore windfarms and three tidal projects. Together with other offshore windfarms announced in January, they will generate enough clean power to supply 16m homes.
Labour lifted the “ban” on onshore windfarms in 2024. Among the onshore projects approved this week is Imerys in Cornwall – the largest onshore windfarm in England for a decade at 20MW. But that will be dwarfed by 100MW Hope Moor.
In the pretty village of Barningham, County Durham, on the other side of Hope Moor, rebellion is coalescing around a coffee table book produced by Sir Anthony Milbank, the bird-loving former owner of one of two large moorland estates where the windfarm is proposed.
The book describes the bountiful wildlife – from breeding curlew and nightjars to rare black grouse and hen harriers – found on the moor and was published in tribute to Sir Anthony, who died in 2016. His son, Sir Edward Milbank, is one of the two landowners who will profit from the windfarm planned by Fred. Olsen Renewables.
Suzy and Tim Wilson moved from Warwickshire three years ago, convinced that Barningham, where Suzy grew up, and its surrounding moorland wildlife was in safe hands next to the national park and the North Pennines National Landscape.
“We live here because of this – it’s priceless. It’s paradise. It’s heaven,” said Suzy Wilson on a walk across the moor, where we saw rare black grouse and heard endangered curlew calling. “We want to share it with people. There’s a carpet of sphagnum moss. In the spring, it’s heaven – all the curlew and oystercatchers, and the grouse are doing their little dance.”
The moorland where the windfarm is proposed is outside protected national parks but much of it is designated by Natural England as blanket bog, a priority habitat for conservation, with extensive areas of “deep peat”, classified as deeper than 30cm.
Locals question the logic of damaging this carbon sink with large concrete turbine bases and access roads in the quest to reduce carbon emissions. “It’s a complete joke,” said Simon Thompson, who has lived in the moor-edge village of Newsham since he was 11 and now owns a caravan park. “The fact they are digging up peat to save carbon emissions is ridiculous. The size is ridiculous. The location next to the Yorkshire Dales national park is ridiculous. It just doesn’t make sense.”
An application for 54m-high turbines on the same moorland was rejected in the high court in 1999 when the judge supported the planning inspector who concluded that the “special character” of this area of “high landscape value” would “be seriously harmed”.
But to speed up renewable projects, schemes such as 100MW Hope Moor are designated a “nationally significant infrastructure project” (NSIP), meaning that the planning decision is not made by local councils but by the national Planning Inspectorate – with Miliband having the final say.
While onshore turbines once reached 100m in height, newer more efficient turbines currently in planning are closer to 200m. “Turbines of this scale are becoming increasingly typical for new schemes and it is unlikely that the proposed turbines would be among the tallest onshore turbines by the time they are constructed,” said a Hope Moor windfarm spokesperson.
Locals Chris Thurgar-Dawson and Christine Gonsalves are both Labour voters. “It’s easy to say: ‘It’s green, full-stop’. We’re not against green energy and our friends who are Tory supporters agree with green energy, but when we heard about the scale of it – it’s off the scale,” said Gonsalves. “It’s the scale and where it’s being built that’s the problem.”
According to Hope Moor, the turbines will deliver £500,000 to the local community each year for 30 years.
“It’s as if everybody is motivated by money,” said Gonsalves. “The people who live here aren’t necessarily motivated by money. They are motivated by nature and the countryside.”
Opponents of the scheme, who have formed an action group and plan to tour their region with the model turbine, insist they are not nimbys. “Of all the people we’ve spoken to, only one has mentioned the impact on house prices,” said Tim Wilson.
Instead, local concerns include the new access roads required, the pylon and cable routes to connect into the grid, the impact on “pristine” water supplies, and noise and flicker from the turbines.
Local Steve Myers, an academic researcher, has conducted a sightlines analysis that concludes the turbines will be widely visible from the Yorkshire Dales and even the Lake District in clear weather. Hope Moor said: “These factors will be assessed comprehensively through a detailed, robust, evidence‑led environmental impact assessment (EIA), which will be presented at future stages of public consultation, alongside how potential impacts will be minimised.”
But Myers also fears the “scoping” – deciding what will be examined by the environmental impact assessment – will be determined before the community can give its view.
“We will hold two stages of public consultation later this year to gather local views and feedback, which will help shape the project and inform the environmental assessments,” said the Hope Moor spokesperson, who pointed out that scoping is administered by the Planning Inspectorate, not the developer. “There will be many opportunities for the public to have their say on their proposals and nothing at this point in the project is fixed.”
Kelly Wyness, senior project manager for Hope Moor, added: “Hope Moor windfarm is a proposal to strengthen energy security by delivering home‑grown renewable power. It will provide long‑term investment in the land and the traditional practices that have shaped this landscape for generations.
“At a time when rural skills and land‑management traditions are under increasing pressure, the project offers a modern, balanced approach – combining renewable energy generation with the active stewardship of the moors. Alongside clean energy, Hope Moor aims to support established farming and moorland management practices, sustain traditional skills, and enhance habitat restoration.”
For locals, the prospect looming over their working landscape is already spoiling their enjoyment of it. Simon Thompson said he used to walk on the moors to clear his head but hasn’t done so since the windfarm was proposed. “I’ve been walking up there for years, among the buzzards and hares. But my mind is no longer clear when I go up there, it’s just focused on this all the time.”

Despite Munich smiles, Greenland shock hasn’t catalysed European defence collaboration
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
MUNICH – When Dr Wolfgang Ischinger, the president of the Munich Security Conference, spoke of a “sigh of relief” that swept through the hall after US Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s speech, he may well have been carried away by the emotion of the moment.
While Mr Rubio’s speech on Feb 14 might not have been the overt broadside against Europe that US Vice-President J.D. Vance delivered in Munich a year ago, its substance still exposed the profound fracture between the two continents.
His message focused on national rather than global interests, the perceived failure of the rules-based order and a harsh indictment of globalisation and its subsequent deindustrialisation. The West, he said, had collectively embarked on the wrong path after the fall of the Berlin Wall. For the past year, the US has set about correcting that mistake.
Those listening in the main hall of Hotel Bayerischer Hof in Munich may, at that moment, have mentally added a postscript to Mr Rubio’s words: anyone who does not follow this path is no longer a friend of the US.
Mr Rubio did not utter a single word about the ongoing assault on what were once transatlantic values, to which the alliance has been subjected since US President Donald Trump took office.
The damage to the alliance forged shortly after the end of World War II reached a provisional low point only a few weeks ago, when Mr Trump scarcely concealed his threat to use force against another NATO member state.
Only after substantial pushback from both European leaders and figures within his own ranks – not least from the US military – did Mr Trump reverse course, pledging at the Davos conference in January that he would not use force or tariffs to seize Greenland. But he has not fully withdrawn what many describe as a “coercive demand” for ownership of Greenland, an autonomous territory of Denmark.
The Greenland shock still runs deep and continues to dominate conversations in the corridors of the Bayerischer Hof after Mr Rubio’s speech.
With an aggressive Russia in the east, an ever more assertive China and a US that is no longer reliable and is gradually turning away from democratic values, Europe not only has fewer and fewer allies, but also is as directly threatened as it has not been for 80 years.
“The international order based on rights and rules no longer exists in the same way,” said German Chancellor Friedrich Merz in his opening address. As a result, he added: “We are breathing new life into our defence industry.”
But can Europe’s defence industry actually deliver what is now required?
In June 2025, NATO members agreed to spend 5 per cent of their gross domestic product on defence by 2035 – 3.5 per cent directly on armaments and 1.5 per cent on security-related infrastructure. That represents a significant increase compared with previous decades, when only 2 per cent was spent and often not even that. In absolute terms, this amounts to €831 billion (S$1.25 trillion) in additional funds to be made available for defence.
Germany alone has, since the outbreak of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine four years ago, launched several special funding packages worth hundreds of billions of euros, earmarked for rearmament. The money is therefore available – but to whom will it go?
Since the conclusion of a major consolidation process in the defence industry in the 1990s, five American defence giants have dominated the sector: RTX, Lockheed Martin, Boeing, General Dynamics and Northrop Grumman. There are also significant Chinese and Russian suppliers.
Among the world’s top 20 defence companies, however, only five are European: BAE Systems, Leonardo, Airbus, Thales and Rheinmetall.
German defence manufacturers, though, are expanding their capacities. Not only is market leader Rheinmetall growing rapidly, but other companies, such as KMW, Hensoldt, Renk, Diehl and drone producers like Helsing and Quantum Systems, are also increasing output.
But the European defence industry remains highly fragmented and a patchwork of national interests that continues to hamper decision-making and large-scale production.
All the more reason, then, for German and French defence companies to work closely together.
Yet talks between Airbus and the French company Dassault on developing a joint fighter jet within the Future Combat Air System project appear to have hit a stalemate, with the French insisting on taking the lead role. The new jet is intended to replace the ageing Eurofighter Typhoon and Dassault Rafale. But that objective now hangs in the balance.
“It would be a fatal signal if the two largest European countries were unable to reach an agreement,” former four-star NATO general Erhard Buhler said in an interview with the Straits Times.
At the same time, it is clear that Europe can, at best, only gradually disentangle itself from dependence on American defence equipment. The most salient example is the 35 Lockheed Martin F-35 fighter jets already procured by Germany from the US, which are also capable of carrying American nuclear weapons.
Critics argue that without regular software updates from the US, the jets would not be fully operational. Given the dramatic erosion of the transatlantic alliance, they say, it is no longer responsible to rely on the US.
Yet cancelling the order, worth up to €10 billion, could be interpreted as signalling that Germany is no longer fundamentally interested in nuclear defence provided by the US. The F-35 aircraft are certified to carry the US B61 nuclear bombs stationed in Germany. They are set to replace the Tornado fleet, which has been in service for more than four decades.
And then what? Could Germany simply shelter under the nuclear umbrella of France or Britain? Mr Buhler doubts this: “Both countries possess nuclear weapons that are not tailored to Germany’s requirements.” Above all, that means too few weapons and ranges that are too limited.
But how does one convince a former protecting power that the alliance is not a one-way street, but one that serves American interests as well?
“NATO is not only our competitive advantage but (also), dear American friends, yours too,” said Mr Merz, pointedly speaking in English to ensure his intended audience takes note.
This is the overarching strategy of the conference: to demonstrate to a Washington that now views relationships in strictly transactional terms that Europe remains indispensable to the security of the US – be it by securing the transatlantic flank against Russia or by providing vital intelligence.
US military leaders well understand this reality. Although the Trump administration has already replaced some generals, the vast majority remain committed transatlanticists.
“NATO is not an act of American generosity. It is a strategic bargain that ensures the United States remains the world’s most powerful and economically secure nation at a fraction of the cost of going it alone,” argued 16 former US ambassadors to NATO and supreme allied commanders in a paper from the Belfer Center at Harvard Kennedy School.
When Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi took the stage immediately after Mr Rubio, invoking the virtues of a rules-based order, free trade and partnership over rivalry, he sounded almost like a European of the old school.
Yet, when pressed on specifics such as Beijing’s influence over Moscow to end the war in Ukraine, he remained resolutely non-committal. For Mr Wang, it is seemingly enough to stand by and watch as the West appears to dismantle itself.

Poland’s Foreign Minister Radosław Sikorski said he is “not sure” the United States still treats ending the war in Ukraine as a top priority, despite what he described as frank private talks with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference.
Sikorski told TVP World on Saturday that Rubio’s tone at the conference was “an improvement,” but that it did not fully answer Europe’s central question: whether Washington is prepared to keep Ukraine at the top of its agenda as the Trump administration pivots strategically toward Asia.

Rubio used his Munich speech to stress transatlantic ties, portraying the U.S. as Europe’s “child,” while offering few concrete commitments and omitting direct mention of Russia.
“Not sure” Ukraine is the priority
Pressed on whether he sensed, in conversation with Rubio, that Ukraine remains a U.S. priority even if it was not emphasized publicly, Sikorski replied: “I’m not sure.”
He said Washington’s “preference is for the war to end,” while Europe’s preference is “for it to end the right way”—language reflecting European fears that a rushed deal could leave Ukraine weakened and the continent exposed.
Sikorski argued that Europe’s stakes are inherently higher because the war is on the EU’s doorstep. He said Ukraine must negotiate from a position of strength and not be pushed into what he called a “semi capitulation.”

Listen when dictators tell you who they are
Sikorski also warned leaders not to dismiss authoritarian threats as bluster—a lesson, he suggested, Europe learned too late with Russia.
“They… have to have more imagination,” he said, arguing that when dictators spell out their intentions, outsiders often assume it is “too crazy” to be real—until it happens.
He pointed to Poland’s long-running warnings about the Nord Stream gas pipeline and Putin’s ambitions, saying Warsaw had urged Western European partners to prepare earlier for a more confrontational Russia. “Belatedly, I think most people get it,” he said.
Sikorski said his two messages—uncertainty about Washington’s priorities and a call to take dictators at their word—underline the pressure on European capitals to plan for a tougher security environment, even as they try to keep the U.S. anchored to Europe’s defense.

"Finnish is my native language, yet people still speak to me in English" – How international adoptees feel marginalised in Finland
Finland

Sadhi Luokomaa has lived in Finland all her life. She speaks perfect Finnish, follows Finnish customs and traditions, and raises her two teenage sons the same way.
Yet she often feels like an outsider.
"I have lived most of my life in Hämeenlinna, yet still people speak to me in English at first," Luokomaa said.
This is because she was adopted at 11 months old and brought to Finland from the Indian city of Chennai.
Luokomaa's experiences are not unique. Many international adoptees report feeling 'othered' in Finland because of how they look.
Othering is defined as a process that labels individuals or groups as fundamentally different from, and inferior to, a dominant societal group.
Anu-Rohima Mylläri, an advocate for adoptees, told Yle that many people adopted from abroad feel sidelined and frustrated as they would want to participate in discussions about Finnish identity, immigration, and working life.
Myllari was herself adopted from Bangladesh in 1980, when she was two years old. She wrote a book about her experiences, called "Adoptoitu" (Adopted) in 2006, which deals with themes such as abandonment, prejudice, and racism.
A unique insight
Tampere University researcher Anna Rastas welcomes the calls for a wider societal discussion in Finland about key issues such as the concept of family, children's rights, and racism — with international adoptees as participants, not just the subject matter.
"Adoptees have a kind of sharper radar for noticing structures and phenomena that often go unnoticed by the majority population," Rastas noted. "They have a special understanding of, for example, how Finnishness is discussed and how differences can be handled. They recognise the times when Finnishness is defined narrowly."
However, many adopted adults feel their Finnishness is neither recognised nor accepted. Instead, there is a hierarchy of which people are accepted and which are not.
"Adoptees concretely show that language skills do not determine inclusion or exclusion, but rather a lack of acceptance of difference, and often outright racism," Rastas added.
Previous studies have shown that applicants with foreign-sounding names have a much harder time being called to a job interview than people with Finnish-sounding names, even if their CV's are identical.
Academic: Finnishness is tied to whiteness
According to University of Helsinki Professor Suvi Keskinen, there is a problem in Finnish society: the definition of Finnishness is tied to whiteness, and belonging to Finland is interpreted based on appearance and skin colour.
"The problem is in the narrow definition of Finnishness. Only certain types of families and people of a certain appearance fit into it," Keskinen said.
She pointed to the example of Denmark, where international adoptees are more often included in discussions about national identity.
The Expectation of Gratitude
Sadhi Luokomaa told Yle that she often encounters situations where she is expected to be grateful for being able to come to Finland.
The same sentiment also comes up during discussions about immigrants.
"I have thought that this should already be a thing of the past, this old-fashioned thinking, but yes, I still encounter it sometimes," she said.
Luokomaa is one of the first generation of adoptees to Finland, and she has developed her own coping strategies for how to deal with these incidents of othering.
"The first question is always, where are you from? When I was younger, I always answered, but now as an adult, I have learned to set boundaries. I am not accountable to tell my story to everyone," she said.
According to Anna Rastas, societal discussion in Finland has become too polarised and exclusionary, especially as the Finnish government continues to tighten legislation about who can become Finnish — and who cannot.
"This is a big concern, and this discussion needs everyone, including adoptees and immigrants," Rastas said.

'Clown show': Obama speaks out on Trump racist monkey clip, Minneapolis crackdown
Former US president Barack Obama on Saturday addressed a racist video posted on President Donald Trump's social media, telling a podcast host that the "decorum" that once guided public officials has been lost. Obama also lamented the "rogue behavior" of federal agents involved in a deadly immigration crackdown in Minneapolis and praised local communities for pushing back against the operations.
Former US president Barack Obama criticized a lack of shame and decorum in the country's political discourse, responding Saturday for the first time to a racist post on Donald Trump's social media account that depicted him and first lady Michelle as monkeys.
In a wide-ranging podcast interview with left-wing political commentator Brian Tyler Cohen released Saturday, Obama also compared the actions of agents enforcing the president's immigration crackdown in Minnesota to dictatorships.
The video, shared on Trump's Truth Social account on February 5, sparked censure across the US political spectrum, with the White House initially rejecting "fake outrage" only to then blame the post on an error by a staff member and taking it down.

Near the end of a one-minute-long video promoting conspiracies about Trump's 2020 election loss to Joe Biden, the Obamas – the first Black president and first lady in US history – were shown with their faces on the bodies of monkeys for about one second.

"The discourse has devolved into a level of cruelty that we haven't seen before...Just days ago, Donald Trump put a picture of you, your face on an ape's body," Cohen said in the interview.
"And so again, we've seen the devolution of the discourse. How do we come back from a place that we have fallen into?"
Without naming Trump, Obama responded by saying the majority of Americans "find this behavior deeply troubling."
"There's this sort of clown show that's happening in social media and on television, and what is true is that there doesn't seem to be any shame about this among people who used to feel like you had to have some sort of decorum and a sense of propriety and respect for the office, right? That's been lost."
'Rogue behavior'
Obama predicted such messaging will hurt Trump's Republicans in midterm elections, that "ultimately, the answer is going to come from the American people."
Trump has told reporters he stood by the thrust of the video's claims about election fraud, but that he had not seen the offensive clip at the end.
Turning to Trump's policies, Obama criticized his immigration crackdown in Minnesota and blasted the conduct of agents during the controversial weeks-long operation that was brought to an end this week.
Obama called the behavior of federal officers, which included two fatal shootings that sparked mounting pressure on Trump's mass crackdown, as the sort that "in the past we've seen in authoritarian countries and we've seen in dictatorships."
Thousands of federal agents – including those with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) – carried out weeks of sweeping raids and arrests in what the Trump administration claims were targeted missions against criminals.
"The rogue behavior of agents of the federal government is deeply concerning and dangerous," Obama said.
But he added he had found hope in communities pushing back against the operations.
"Not just randomly, but in a systematic, organized way, citizens saying, 'this is not the America we believe in,' and we're going to fight back, and we're going to push back with the truth and with cameras and with peaceful protests," he said.

"That kind of heroic, sustained behavior in subzero weather by ordinary people is what should give us hope.
"As long as we have folks doing that, I feel like we're going to get through this."
The aggressive immigration operation in Minnesota had triggered large protests and nationwide outrage.
The Department of Homeland Security was subject to a partial government shutdown Saturday as US lawmakers fought over funding the agency overseeing much of Trump's immigration crackdown.
Democrats are opposing any new DHS funding until major changes are implemented over how ICE conducts its operations.

Russia closely watching Kazakhstan’s constitutional reform — ambassador

ASTANA, February 15. /TASS/. Russia is closely following the process of constitutional reform in Kazakhstan and hopes that the proposed changes will further strengthen domestic political stability in the republic, Russia’s ambassador to Kazakhstan Alexey Borodavkin said in an interview with TASS.
"We are closely watching the actively ongoing process of preparing the country’s new basic law and the discussion of its provisions. The adoption of a new constitution is, without exaggeration, a new milestone in the country’s history. We hope that the proposed changes will strengthen domestic political stability, including in its interethnic aspects, and at the same time boost the comprehensive modernization of Kazakhstan’s entire political architecture being carried out at the initiative of President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev — a large-scale reset and improvement of the effectiveness of key state institutions," the diplomat said.
Russia regularly sends observers to elections in Kazakhstan, and the upcoming March 15 referendum on the republic’s new constitution will be no exception, Borodavkin added.
"According to established practice, Russia regularly sends its observers to elections and referendums in Kazakhstan. For example, our representatives were present during the nationwide vote on amendments to the constitution in June 2022. I believe the upcoming constitutional referendum will be no exception," the diplomat said.
The referendum, in accordance with a decree by the president of Kazakhstan, will be held on March 15. The draft new constitution includes changes to more than 80% of the text of the current basic law adopted in 1995. Key innovations include a transition to a unicameral parliament consisting of 145 deputies, the establishment of the post of vice president, as well as the creation of the People’s Council of Kazakhstan as the highest consultative body under the president with the right of legislative initiative.

Georgia should consider economic gains from ties with Russia — Galuzin

MOSCOW, February 15. /TASS/. The Georgian authorities should consider that diplomatic relations with Russia would bring economic dividends to the country, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Galuzin said in an interview with TASS.
"I believe that cooperation with Russia is one of the main factors behind Georgia’s unprecedented economic growth. However, these economic successes stand in sharp contrast to the absence of political dialogue. Perhaps the Georgian authorities should reflect on how much more could be achieved if diplomatic relations with Russia were in place," he said.
Galuzin added that the issue of restoring diplomatic relations remains a matter for Georgia. "We simply want Tbilisi to know that Moscow is open to expanding cooperation wherever it brings mutual benefit," the deputy minister noted.
He also said that Russia understands the current Georgian authorities’ desire to put an end to Western dictatorship.
"We see that the current Georgian authorities are striving to restore the country’s sovereignty. They are not satisfied with a situation in which Georgia’s domestic policy is difficult to distinguish from the EU’s foreign policy. We view Tbilisi’s attempts to end external dictatorship, as well as steps to protect Georgian identity, with understanding," he said.

Rubio tells Europe to join Trump's fight, says it belongs with US

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio sought to reassure a nervous Europe on Saturday, saying Washington wanted to recharge the transatlantic alliance so a strong Europe could help the United States on its mission of global "renewal".
Speaking at a security conference in Munich after months of turmoil in U.S.-European relations sparked by President Donald Trump's vows to seize Greenland and his often derisive remarks about allies, Washington's top diplomat struck a markedly soothing tone.
"We do not seek to separate, but to revitalise an old friendship and renew the greatest civilisation in human history," Rubio said, calling for "a reinvigorated alliance".
"We want Europe to be strong," Rubio said, adding that the continent and the United States "belong together."
He echoed the Trump administration's oft-stated assertion that immigration poses a threat, saying that "mass migration" is "a crisis which is transforming and destabilising societies all across the West".
He said Europe and the United States were "heirs to the same great and noble civilisation" and that he hoped Europe "together with us are willing and able to defend it".
Change in tone
Aside from immigration, Rubio otherwise largely avoided the MAGA flashpoint and culture-war issues that German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said Friday had deepened a "rift" between U.S. and Europe.
Rubio's speech marked a sharp contrast to that of U.S. Vice President JD Vance a year ago, when he used the same stage to attack European policies on a range of issues including free speech, shocking European allies.
The Trump administration has also charged that Europe faces a "civilisational decline", and has courted far-right parties on the continent.
Ties plunged last month when Trump stepped up threats to annex Greenland, an autonomous territory of NATO member Denmark, forcing European nations to stand firm in protest.
Rubio was on Sunday due to travel to Slovakia and Hungary, European countries run by nationalist leaders endorsed by Trump.
Some breathed a sigh of relief after Rubio's speech, with Estonia's defense Minister Hanno Pevkur telling AFP: "It was needed to show that we are still allies and partners."
But others said they did not mark a shift in the U.S. stance, with former Lithuanian foreign minister Gabrielius Landsbergis saying: "It was simply delivered in more polite terms. I am not sure the white paint will hold."
European security
European leaders at the Munich Security Conference have pledged to shoulder more of the burden of shared NATO defenses, saying this was essential for Europe to counter a hostile Russia.
European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen told the gathering that "Europe needs to step up and has to take on its responsibility" for its security, including closer ties with Britain 10 years after Brexit.
British leader Keir Starmer echoed the sentiment, saying, "We must build our hard power, because that is the currency of the age," and calling to build "a shared industrial base across Europe which can turbocharge our defense production".
NATO chief Mark Rutte told reporters that although France and Britain, Europe's only nuclear powers, have discussed greater cooperation to make their nuclear deterrence stronger, "nobody is arguing in Europe to do this as a sort of replacement of the nuclear umbrella of the United States."
Ukraine war
The high-powered Munich meeting of government leaders, diplomats, defense and intelligence chiefs comes shortly before Russia's full-scale war on Ukraine is set to enter its fifth gruelling year.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky decried that political efforts to end the war have not worked.
"Weapons evolve faster than political decisions meant to stop them," he said, calling for speedier arms deliveries for Ukraine's Western-supplied air defense systems.
He said that "there is not a single power plant in Ukraine that is not damaged by Russian strikes," after Russia stepped up its attacks on infrastructure over the past few months, as the coldest snap since the war started in February 2022 hit the country.
"No one in Ukraine believes (Russian President Vladimir Putin) will ever let our people go, but he will not let other European nations go either, because he cannot let go of the very idea of war," Zelensky warned.
At the White House on Friday, Trump urged Kiev to "get moving" to end the war. "Russia wants to make a deal... (Zelensky) has to move," he said.
But Rubio — who met Zelensky on the sidelines in Munich — said on Saturday: "We don't know if the Russians are serious about ending the war."

MOSCOW, February 15. /TASS/. European politicians are not presenting serious arguments in favor of their participation in negotiations on Ukraine, according to Alexey Pushkov, head of the Federation Council’s commission on information policy.
"Polish Foreign Minister [Radoslaw] Sikorski cannot cite a single argument in favor of such EU participation in the negotiations [on Ukraine]. <…> There are no serious answers to the question of why Europeans are needed at the negotiating table — neither from him, nor from [French President Emmanuel] Macron, nor from [EU foreign policy chief Kaja] Kallas. And indeed, why? To derail even the fragile negotiations that are already underway? To puff up their cheeks and feel important? Europeans are incapable of contributing anything else to the settlement process in Ukraine," he wrote on his Telegram channel, commenting on Sikorski’s demand that EU countries be admitted to the negotiation process.
Earlier, The Guardian reported that Sikorski, speaking at the Munich Security Conference, questioned the United States’ right to play a leading role in negotiations on Ukraine. He noted that EU countries "deserve" a seat at the negotiating table, as they provide the bulk of military assistance to Kiev.

Women's advocate quits Liberal Party after Ley defeat

Charlotte Mortlock quits Liberal Party following Sussan Ley leadership defeat
In short:
The founder of a group aimed at increasing women's representation in the Liberals has quit the party following Sussan Ley's leadership loss.
Women were less likely to vote for the Coalition at the 2025 election than ever before, according to the Australian Election Study.
What's next?
Charlotte Mortlock's departure has prompted questions about what the Liberals can do to retain women in the party.
The founder of a group aimed at increasing women's participation in the Liberal Party has resigned and relinquished her membership after the Coalition's first female leader was toppled just nine months into the job.
Former Liberal staffer and journalist Charlotte Mortlock started Hilma's Network in 2022, named after suffragist Hilma Molyneux Parkes, who formed the Women's Liberal League of NSW in 1902, which won the right for women to vote in pre-selections.
In a statement released on Instagram, she said recent events led her to quit the party and support women in other ways.
"I founded Hilma's four years ago and am incredibly proud of all we have achieved, mainly the many women we supported across the country throughout preselections and elections," she wrote.
"From inception, we quickly grew to multiple states hosting events that challenged the Party to evolve."
The number of women voting for the Liberal Party has been dropping since 2004, with women voters being less likely to vote for the Coalition at the 2025 election than at any time in the past, according to the Australian Election Study.
Deputy Liberal leader Jane Hume said Ms Mortlock has been an amazing advocate for women in the Liberal Party and she was sad to see her go.
"I was disappointed to hear this news today because the network she's built, the Hilma's Network, has been a fantastic pathway for so many women that have run for us in the last elections but also got involved in the party," she said.
"My concern, of course, is when somebody that has done all that work Charlotte has decides to leave the party for whatever reason they do, that the organisation that they've built underneath them loses its momentum.
"I'm going to make sure that certainly doesn't happen."
The new chief executive of Hilma's Network Erin Watson said Ms Mortlock had built a strong and sustainable organisation that will carry on into the future.
"It's sad, but actually she leaves behind a really healthy organisation for us to sort of work with and take forward, so I don't think that's a bad place to be for Hilma's at the moment," she said.
Loading...Ms Watson said, like Ms Mortlock, she was disappointed the Liberals dumped their first federal female leader after less than a year in the job.
"From day one of when Sussan Ley won the leadership and everyone said, 'Has she been handed a poisoned chalice?' And, maybe, right?
"The Liberal Party was in a really bad place after this election, so you know it is really disappointing to see what's happened."
But Ms Watson said women leading the party at a state level were cutting through.
"On one hand, yeah, things are pretty bad federally right now, but we have a lot to work with when it comes to the states."
There are four women leading the Liberal Party at a state level: Northern Territory Chief Minister Lia Finocchiaro and opposition leaders Jess Wilson in Victoria, Kellie Sloane in New South Wales and Ashton Hurn in South Australia.
Liberal politicians thank Mortlock
Current and former Liberal politicians have left comments of support on Ms Mortlock's Instagram post including Shadow Minister for Women Maria Kovacic, who supported Sussan Ley in Friday's leadership spill.
"You will be missed. Thank you for all that you have done, and for all that you tried to do," she said.
The sentiment was echoed by former South Australian MP Nicolle Flint.
"Thank you so much for all you've done for women & the Liberal Party," she said.
Do you know more about this story? Get in touch via Signal (claudialong.01) or email long.claudia@abc.net.au
Former NSW Energy Minister Matt Kean thanked Ms Mortlock for "inspiring leadership and courage".
"You've already made a big difference for women's participation in the Party, but your greatest legacy will be seen in the years ahead as the talent you welcomed and nurtured rises through the ranks."
The quota question
Ms Mortlock has been a prominent supporter of gender quotas in politics, pushing for the Liberal Party to adopt them.
She was recently part of an unsuccessful push to implement them at a state level in New South Wales.
Ms Watson said while some state branches of the party have gender quotas already, it differs from state to state.
"If you look at the representation of women across the party at the moment, there's some pretty good outcomes," she said.
Loading..."So let's look at what's happened in those states and what have you done there in order to get those numbers up.
"You've got to work with what you can do."
Asked on Sunday whether she would support quotas, Jane Hume reaffirmed her stance against them.
"I don't support quotas, but I do support having more women in parliament and there are lots of ways to do that. It's not a binary issue, it's not quotas or not quotas."
Ms Hume said the party would make sure to nurture and attract new talent.
"Because women and women's voices have a very important role to play in the future of the Liberal Party and in the future of a Coalition government."

Zelensky labels Putin a 'slave to war'

Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky denounced Russia's Vladimir Putin as a "slave to war" in a speech to the Munich Security Conference Saturday, adding that Russia's attacks had damaged every power plant in the country.
Zelensky also drew parallels between the current Russia-Ukraine talks over territorial concessions and the 1938 Munich Agreement, when Hitler forced territorial concessions from the European powers -- a year before World War II.
Zelensky was speaking days before the fourth anniversary of Moscow's invasion, which has killed hundreds of thousands, decimated eastern Ukraine and forced millions to flee.
Kiev and its Western allies have accused Moscow of deliberately freezing Ukraine's population with its attacks on the energy grid.
"There is not a single power plant left in Ukraine that has not been damaged by Russian attacks," Zelensky said. "Not one."
"But we still generate electricity," he added, praising the thousands of workers repairing the plants.
Once again, he appealed to the West to deliver air-defence systems to Ukraine more quickly.
Of Putin, who launched the war in February 2022, Zelensky said: "He may see himself as a tsar, but in reality he is a slave to war."
Russia and Ukraine will hold U.S.-brokered talks next week, and Zelensky said Kiev was doing "everything" to end the war.
Security guarantees
Zelensky also met with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio on the sidelines of the Munich conference.
Russia has demanded that Ukraine withdraw from its Donetsk region and wants Kiev to recognise its claim to the swathes of Ukraine that it occupies. Ukraine has ruled out surrendering its eastern regions.
Of the talks so far, Zelensky said: "The Americans often return to the topic of concessions, and too often those concessions are discussed in the context only of Ukraine."
He also drew parallels between the current talks and the 1938 Munich Agreement, when European powers let Hitler take part of Czechoslovakia only for the Second World War to break out the following year.
"It would be an illusion to believe that this war can now be reliably ended by dividing Ukraine -- just as it was an illusion to believe that sacrificing Czechoslovakia would save Europe from a great war," he warned.
Kiev was doing "everything" to end the war, he said, insisting that viable security guarantees were the only way to get to a deal and prevent future Russian aggression.
"With Russia, you cannot leave a single loophole Russians can use to start a war," he said.
Zelensky again argued that there would be more chance of ending the war if European countries had a seat at the negotiating table -- something Russia has opposed.
Next week's talks in Geneva between the two sides will come after two rounds of U.S.-Russia-Ukraine negotiations in Abu Dhabi.
In a social media post Zelensky said he had spoken by phone to U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff and Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner ahead of the talks.
"We count on the meetings being truly productive," he added.
But with no diplomatic breakthrough so far, the Ukrainian leader has called on his Western allies to make faster political decisions.
"Weapons evolve faster than political decisions meant to stop them," Zelensky said. The Iranian-designed Shahed drones that Russia was using had become much more deadly, he noted.
Returning to the question of elections in Ukraine, Zelensky said they would be held once Kiev received security guarantees and a ceasefire had been agreed.

Newsom Warns ‘Deal’ Politics Could Undercut Ukraine

At the Munich Security Conference (MSC), California Governor Gavin Newsom questioned whether Ukraine can rely on the current US administration, after US Secretary of State Marco Rubio largely avoided mentioning the war in his keynote address and emphasized a broader civilizational reset of the transatlantic relationship.
In a doorstep interview with Kyiv Post on the sidelines of the MSC, Newsom said the administration’s approach risks prioritizing headline-grabbing deals over sustained support for Ukraine, even as the war grinds on and Russia shows little sign of compromise.

Rubio’s speech framed global politics as a shift away from what he described as a failed “rules-based global order,” arguing instead for national sovereignty, reciprocal partnerships and a multipolar world structured around interests rather than treaties. Ukraine featured only briefly in the address and more prominently during a short question-and-answer session.
Rubio’s limited focus on Ukraine
In response to questions, Rubio said the US was testing whether Russia was serious about ending the war, while maintaining sanctions and continuing weapons sales to support Ukraine’s defense. He described negotiations as narrowed to “the hardest questions to answer,” adding that a just and sustainable settlement remained elusive.
The remarks came as Rubio prepared to travel next to Hungary and Slovakia, two EU countries whose governments have opposed further military aid to Ukraine and, in Budapest’s case, openly questioned Kyiv’s alignment with European interests.
ISW Russian Offensive Campaign Assessment, February 14, 2026
Newsom described the timing and destination of the trip as “remarkable,” given Hungary’s recent political positioning and the rhetoric of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán toward Ukraine.
Orbán recently described Ukraine as an enemy, placing Hungary at odds with most EU and NATO partners.
Newsom questions trust and consistency
In an interview after Rubio’s speech, Newsom said the administration’s stated desire for peace was sincere but poorly executed.
“I want to acknowledge the desire that is sincere of [US] President Trump, the administration, [and the] secretary of state, to get a peace deal,” Newsom said. “But the nature of how they’ve gone about it, where they initially pulled the rug out from under the Ukrainian people in an effort to reach out to [Russian President Vladimir] Putin, clearly has not worked.”
He said a recalibration appeared to be underway but warned that inconsistency undermines Ukraine’s position.
“You’re dealing with an impossible partner in Putin,” Newsom said. “That requires consistent, strong support for the Ukrainian people that is expressed over a long period of time in order to create the conditions, from my perspective, for a peace deal.”
Newsom argued that Trump’s political instincts were shaping foreign policy.
“That’s what Donald Trump’s all about,” he said. “He wants the deal, he wants the headline.”“But the desire for a deal is real, and Trump recognizes that,” Newsom added. “He [just] needs to, I think, change his approach a bit with Putin.”
A deal-driven presidency
Newsom suggested domestic political pressure could further influence the White House’s approach, pointing to the US midterm elections.
“He needs a deal,” Newsom said, adding that Trump “doesn’t have many wins on the board.”
While declining to comment on specific weapons systems or escalation risks, Newsom said decisions about long-range missiles for Ukraine should rest with US diplomats and military leaders, not state officials.
“I want to be careful as a governor,” he said. “That calculation, that consideration, I think is best left in the hands of [the administration], our military personnel, and obviously the secretary of state.”
Europe urged to project strength
Newsom also revisited comments he made in Davos, where he had described European politicians as “pathetic” in their response to Trump’s pressure tactics, later clarifying that his remarks were about strategy, not individuals.
“He susses out weakness and he exploits weakness,” Newsom said of Trump. “That’s his super skill. He respects strength.”
He said Europe would benefit from a clearer, more assertive stance toward Washington, citing recent speeches by European leaders that emphasized unity, including on Ukraine and resistance to US overreach on issues such as Greenland.
A broader shift in US foreign policy
Rubio’s speech echoed themes outlined in the latest Munich Security Report, which described the current US approach as “wrecking-ball politics” – a rejection of multilateralism in favor of transactional relationships and ad hoc partnerships.
In Munich, Rubio defended that shift as a necessary correction to decades of policy he said weakened Western societies through de-industrialization, mass migration and dependence on global institutions.
Newsom, however, warned that in the context of Ukraine, a deal-first mindset without sustained pressure on Moscow risks rewarding aggression.
For Ukraine and its allies, he suggested, the question raised in Munich was not whether Washington wants peace – but on whose terms, and at what cost.

New Zealand officials warn more flooding could hit north island as man killed after heavy rain

New Zealand’s weather bureau has warned more flooding could hit the country’s North Island, a day after floods caused power outages, road collapses, home evacuations and caused the death of a man whose vehicle was submerged on a highway.
There was “threat to life from dangerous river conditions, significant flooding and slips” as a deepening low-pressure system east of the North Island brought heavy rain and severe gales to several regions, the weather bureau said.
The worst weather was forecast to hit late on Sunday, followed by a slow easing of conditions on Monday, it said on its website, after heavy rain began battering large swaths of the country on Friday, sparking the floods.
Authorities on Sunday had a state of emergency in place for the districts of Waipa and Otorohanga, an agricultural region home to about 10,000 people that is 180km (112 miles) south of the country’s most populous city, Auckland.
About 4,291 properties remained without power on the North Island, energy company Powerco said on its website.
On Saturday, a man apparently died in his car in flood waters, authorities said, adding that about 80 people were evacuated to an emergency centre. Images shared on social media showed vast semirural neighbourhoods submerged and collapsed sections of road where flood waters had receded.
Extreme rainfall is more common and more intense because of human-caused climate breakdown across most of the world, particularly in Europe, most of Asia, central and eastern North America, and parts of South America, Africa and Australia. This is because warmer air can hold more water vapour. Flooding has most likely become more frequent and severe in these locations as a result, but is also affected by human factors, such as the existence of flood defences and land use.
Six people were killed in January after heavy rains triggered a landslide at Mount Maunganui on the North Island’s east coast, bringing down soil and rubble on a site crowded with families on summer holidays.

Partisans destroy electric locomotive in Oryol, disrupting Russian troop logistics in Sumy sector
Atesh reported this on Telegram, according to Ukrinform.
<script async src="https://telegram.org/js/telegram-widget.js?22" data-telegram-post="atesh_ua/9276" data-width="100%"></script>
The VL80 is considered a "workhorse" of Russian railways – a heavy-duty locomotive used to transport multi-tonne military trains. The destroyed unit had been actively used to move equipment, ammunition, and fuel from the rear to Russia's border areas in order to reinforce troop groupings operating on the Sumy axis.
"This locomotive will not be going anywhere again. The enemy's logistics supply chain has suffered another blow. While they search for a replacement locomotive, shells and equipment will not reach the front in time," Atesh said.

MOSCOW, February 15. /TASS/. Kiev has not responded to Russia’s proposal to establish a bilateral center for monitoring and controlling the ceasefire regime, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Galuzin said in an interview with TASS.
"Kiev has left unanswered our proposals to enhance the effectiveness of the negotiating process through the creation of a bilateral center for monitoring and controlling the ceasefire regime, as well as working groups to address military, political, and humanitarian issues. There has also been no clear reaction to our readiness to raise the level of the heads of delegations," he said.
According to Galuzin, the Istanbul format of negotiations has not been formally closed by anyone, and Russia has not withdrawn from the process. "As you may recall, three rounds of consultations were held there in 2025: in May, June, and July. At the same time, in November of last year, Ukraine’s Foreign Ministry publicly announced a unilateral suspension of the negotiations in Istanbul, allegedly due to a lack of ‘tangible progress.’ This looks, at the very least, strange," the deputy minister added.

Ivan Marchuk at 90 – An Interview from Vienna

Ivan Marchuk is one of Ukraine’s most internationally recognized contemporary artists, whose biography stands as a testament to the confrontation between an artist and an imperial system.
Born in 1936 in the Ternopil region, he endured KGB surveillance, exhibition bans, and repeated refusals to join the Soviet Artists’ Union before achieving global recognition and holding solo exhibitions across continents. Soviet authorities denied Marchuk membership in the Artists’ Union three times. In 1984, his studio was searched, and for years he was barred from traveling abroad.

Only in the late 1980s, during “perestroika,” (restructuring of the political economy) did Marchuk leave the Soviet Union — first for Australia, and later for Canada and the US. In 2007, The Daily Telegraph included him in its list of the “100 Living Geniuses.”
Today, Marchuk’s work is among the most expensive of Ukraine’s living artists. In 2024, his landscape “The Moon Rose Over the Dnipro” sold at the Goldens auction for $300,000. Since the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, he has been living in Austria, where he has held several major exhibitions.
In conversation with KyivPost on the eve of his 90th birthday, Marchuk speaks about resilience of spirit, art as a form of consciousness, his father, and his homeland.
KyivPost (KP): Over your nine decades, you’ve witnessed the fall and rise of empires, regimes, and borders. What, in your view, is truly transient – and what is imperishable?
ISW Russian Offensive Campaign Assessment, February 14, 2026
Ivan Marchuk (IM): The human soul is imperishable. And art is imperishable. For me, above all, art. There is much else that is imperishable too, in fact. But if we start listing everything, we’ll lose ourselves. Some things simply cannot be counted.
KP: The Soviet system tried to break you and failed. What, in your view, makes an artist unbreakable? Where does Ivan Marchuk’s strength come from?
IM: From strength of spirit. From stubbornness. From tenacity. From the desire to possess the world – people and space. And I succeeded. The entire planet knows Marchuk now. These little machines help with that today [gestures to his mobile phone] – they watch everything, everywhere.
That stubbornness has been with me since childhood. It didn’t appear later – it was there from the very beginning.
KP: Who gave you the first push toward becoming an artist?
IM: My father. He was very intelligent and extraordinarily talented – a master of all trades and a renowned weaver. He had only three years of Polish schooling, yet he was deeply wise, very religious and principled. People came to him as to a teacher, almost as to an apostle. To have such a father is a great fortune. When I began to take an interest in art, he encouraged me.
KP: How did Marchuk the professional artist come into being?
IM: In 1965, I graduated from the Lviv Institute of Applied Arts. I was assigned to a state job at the Kyiv Institute of Superhard Materials, which researched and produced synthetic diamonds. The system was simple: sit there for eight hours a day. I thought – I have all this time. What should I do? And I decided to draw.
I don’t know who guided me – I completely switched off consciousness. Only intuition worked. It was as if someone stood above me and guided my hand on small standard sheets of paper – the same kind used for typing. Every day I produced two or three drawings. They were graphic, black-and-white works – “early Marchuk.”
Everything all around was dominated by Soviet “collective art.” I set myself the task of being an “abnormal” artist and I began carving my own path.
KP: Was that when your legendary style began to form?
IM: Not a style – a consciousness. Style is how you do things. I have different ways of thinking. Fifteen different Marchuks. I dipped the pen and someone guided my hand. Where did it come from? Who invented it?
A colleague once saw my graphics and said, “You would illustrate the Bible very well.” I replied, “Why? I am writing my own Bible.” And that spirit — it is alive in every single sheet.
KP: How old were you when this crystallized?
IM: Twenty-eight. That’s when I truly committed myself to art. I worked a lot with publishing houses and Ukrainian literary journals. In five minutes, I could earn enough for a plane ticket to Lviv and back. I only flew – I didn’t know trains. Financial problems didn’t concern me at all and I valued time immensely. Since childhood, I have never been bored.
KP: You’ve seen a great deal in your lifetime. Where do you think humanity is heading today?
IM: Toward destruction.
KP: And does it have a chance?
IM: There is always a chance. [Smiles]. But it’s a thin one. A few weeks before the Chornobyl disaster, I painted the triptych “Monologue.” When I was working on it, I wasn’t thinking about Chornobyl. But the tragedy happened.
KP: You’ve worked on different continents, yet you’ve always painted Ukraine and about Ukraine. Why such devotion to the Ukrainian theme? What does Ukraine mean to you?
IM: Ukraine is my land. Period. I’ve never painted a foreign land. Not because it is worse, but because it is not mine. Ukraine is my home.
I may disagree with the systems that ruled – and still rule – over it, but I love the land. I am rooted in it. Ukraine, if governed wisely, would have ruled the world long ago. [Smiles.] Ukraine produces the highest number of talents per square meter in the world – that’s a fact.
And which of its talents has truly resonated in all the world’s capitals? There was the great singer Solomiya Krushelnytska, our great sculptor Oleksandr Archipenko. And then? I often compare Ukraine to a potted plant. What must you do for it to bloom? You must create the conditions for growth. The same is true for talent – it must be nurtured.
What do we see instead? Why do talents grow like mushrooms all over the world, but not here? Because in Ukraine, talent is neglected.
And yet, despite everything, I love Ukraine. Ukraine is my land. And the feeling of belonging to it never disappears.
KP: Since the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion, you’ve been living in Vienna. How do you perceive this city?
IM: I feel Vienna very deeply. Vienna smells of art and breathes art – you feel it at every step. It’s also a city designed for people. You can sit comfortably on a bench, drink clean water – everything is thought through so that a person doesn’t stumble and can feel at ease. People here are kind and welcoming.
After major exhibitions in Vienna, people recognize me and greet me in the park when I’m walking.
But… I am not at home.
KP: In the year of your 90th birthday, what advice would you give to your 25-year-old self, knowing what lay ahead?
IM: Don’t waste time. Work even more. Because I am insatiable. [Smiles]. I would advise devoting even more time to creativity.
KP: What dreams do you still wish to fulfill?
IM: To preserve my paintings for Ukraine, so that they live. So that they serve people.
That is why in 2024, in Vienna, we established and officially registered the Ivan Marchuk Foundation – to preserve, promote, and eventually return the collection to Ukraine, when the time comes.

Tony Abbott’s budgie smugglers sell for $700 at Young Libs gala

Tony Abbott’s budgie smugglers sell for $700 at Young Libs gala
Ain’t no party like a Liberal Party party, we have observed before. And there certainly ain’t no party like The Young Liberal Annual Ball held at the Royal Automobile Club of Victoria the other weekend.
The gala event was all part of FedCon Melbourne 2026, which is not, as we first thought, a federal confidence trick, but rather the Young Liberal Movement of Australia’s annual convention, which brings together Young Liberals “for an opportunity to both engage with a wide range of thought-provoking speakers, Parliamentarians, and policy-makers, while re-energising themselves with standout social events”.
Is that re-energising or re-animating? Time will tell. The chinwag conference was attended by Senator Sarah Henderson and also local bright young thing MPs Rachel Westaway and Brad Rowswell.
But our interest was turned up to 11 when we learned that the ball staged an auction that included some standout items of party memorabilia – former prime minister Tony Abbott’s budgie smugglers and former PM Scott Morrison’s 2024 memoir Plans for Your Good: A Prime Minister’s Testimony of God’s Faithfulness.
Liberal sources told us that the swimwear in question raised an incredible $700 and the winning bidder came from South Australia.
We contacted the young fogey organisers, who were sadly reluctant to engage.
Abbott himself has no such qualms, texting CBD with a singular “Wow!”. Says it all really.
PwC chairman John Green upstaged by Margot Robbie and Jacob Elordi
PwC’s independent chairman John Green has a busy day job, but also a riveting side hustle: he writes thrillers – and has just published his seventh.
Late last week, a gaggle of persons within Green’s orbit descended on the QT Hotel’s Gilt Lounge in Sydney for the launch of Staged, a crime thriller set in the Emerald City.
Publisher Hardie Grant, which in 2024 scooped up Green’s family publishing business Pantera Press, bills it thus: “When a Hollywood star is killed live on stage, the entire cast falls under suspicion … Can a disgraced journalist and a rule-bending detective with a PhD in AI crack the case?”.
The room, we hear, was dotted with some of corporate Australia’s biggest names. The PwC chairman played host to NAB chairman Philip Chronican and former Origin executive Karen Moses.
Worley chairman John Grill was also there, according to CBD spies in the room, as was PwC chief executive Kevin Burrowes. How many copies of the boss’s book do we reckon Burrowes purchased? Also there was Nicholas Gray, publisher of The Australian newspaper and managing director of tech partnerships at News Corp Australia, which not long ago tapped Burrowes and Co for help with a major restructure.
Others said to have gone along, but who our spies didn’t get eyes on, were two leathery survivors of corporate Australia – activist investor Gary Weiss and former UNSW chancellor David Gonski.
Downstairs there was a massive commotion when real Hollywood stars Margot Robbie and Jacob Elordi and pop spouse turned beauty entrepreneur Hailey Bieber turned up.
We knew Green was connected, but this connected? Turns out the trio were there for the Australian premiere of Wuthering Heights. But we wouldn’t put it past Green to have sidled up to the celebs to pitch them his latest tome.
Siobhan McKenna closes the book on News Corp with Sky News exit
It was back in October that news broke about the separation of Lachlan Murdoch’s longtime lieutenant Siobhan McKenna from the News Corp mothership. Who knows, it bore all the hallmarks of an agreed departure. Murdoch agreed and McKenna departed.
As we reported from the footpath outside Lachlan and Sarah Murdoch’s summer party: “But that (departure) didn’t stop McKenna from being the first arrival at the summer soiree at 4.58pm on the dot!”
Now, McKenna has formally cut all ties with her employer and his various media businesses, bringing to an end a decades-long corporate alliance with one of the most influential figures in global media and politics.
The final tie McKenna had to the billionaire media scion, at least on paper, was to News Corp Australia’s Australian News Channel, the holding company that controls Sky News Australia.
But earlier this year, the company filed documents with the corporate regulator revealing she had stepped down as a director of the broadcaster, adding to her exits from News Corp and Lachlan Murdoch’s investment vehicle, Illyria, which controls his radio interests in Nova Entertainment. Sky News Australia didn’t respond to a request for comment.
News Corp CEO Robert Thomson’s email to staff announcing McKenna’s departure quickly set off a wave of chatter about what led to the split. Now, we’re also interested in what the former Foxtel chairman will do with all of her newfound leisure time. Perhaps another book is in the offing.

Beijing warns tech giants to curb ‘involution’ amid AI giveaway war
Companies should ‘uphold a fair and competitive’ environment to ‘foster innovation and healthy development’, regulator says
The SAMR “reminded” the platforms to “further regulate promotional activities” and stay clear of “all forms of involutionary competition”, it said, without naming any exact activities conducted by the companies.
The companies should “jointly uphold a fair and competitive market environment to foster innovation and healthy development within the platform economy”, the regulator added.
The word “involution”, or neijuan, refers to cutthroat, low-quality price competition in sectors ranging from electric vehicles to food delivery. It has become a common term in China over the past few years, with Beijing vowing to combat the phenomenon because of its damaging economic effects.
China’s tech giants have been locked in an intensifying giveaway battle before the Lunar New Year, one of the year’s most critical shopping periods, to attract users for their services, especially AI apps.

- Russian officials continue to insist that the issues and terms impeding a peace agreement go beyond Russia’s territorial demands.
- Russian forces continue to suffer disproportionately high casualties in return for marginal territorial gains.
- Ukraine’s and SpaceX’s efforts to shut off Russian forces’ access to Starlink terminals in Ukraine are reportedly disrupting Russian Rubikon Center for Advanced Unmanned Technologies’ short- and mid-range drone strikes in the immediate term, as ISW recently forecasted.
- Ukrainian forces recently advanced in the Oleksandrivka direction. Russian forces recently advanced in northern Kharkiv Oblast, in the Borova and Slovyansk directions, and in the Kostyantynivka-Druzhkivka tactical area.

Russia must show restraint, respond appropriately to tanker seizures — Shokhin

MOSCOW, February 15. /TASS/. Russia needs to exercise restraint and develop an appropriate response to attempts by Western countries to detain its oil tankers or container ships, head of the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs Alexander Shokhin said in an interview with TASS.
"Clearly, there may be fewer purely economic elements here than political and military-political ones. In particular, there are already encroachments on container ships, not to mention the so-called shadow fleet and oil tankers. Of course, protecting them by escorting them, say, with naval vessels — we probably do not have enough naval capacity to escort every tanker and every container ship. Although, of course, some appropriate responses, including taking into account that these seizures involve the use of military force, may be possible. Frankly speaking, this is no longer a trade blockade of the kind of a continental blockade. Nevertheless, this is, in fact, a step toward an actual war. Therefore, we must show some restraint," Shokhin said.
According to him, under current conditions, certain international organizations have proved ineffective. He added that Western countries first began detaining tankers of the so-called shadow fleet and only later started creating a regulatory framework to justify those actions.
Shokhin also recalled threats to impose secondary sanctions and to pressure India and China not to purchase Russian oil. "All of this is, on the one hand, harsh, quasi-military, imperial pressure in a classical sense. On the other hand, it is a bargaining system aimed, in this case, at punishing Russia," he added.

How things went ‘downhill’ for Vietnam’s once-booming cryptocurrency traders
Vietnam’s crypto boom faces a harsh winter as investors lose fortunes, bankruptcies and lay-offs roil the industry
As a first-year computer science student in Hanoi, Hoang Le started trading cryptocurrency from his university dorm room, egged on by his gamer friends who were making a killing.
But they crashed to zero when the bottom fell out of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in recent months.
Getting wiped out “hurt a lot”, he said, but he also learned a valuable lesson: he has come to think of the losses as “tuition fees”.
“When profits were high, everyone became greedy,” said Le, now 23, adding that “it was too good to be true”.
Unlike neighbouring China, which has banned cryptocurrencies outright, communist Vietnam has allowed blockchain technology to develop in a legal grey area – barring its use for payments but letting people speculate unimpeded.

New law to give police power to refuse ‘hate’ protests

New law to give police power to refuse ‘hate’ protests
The Cook Government will introduce new laws to Parliament this week that aim to give WA Police the power to refuse a permit to protest if it is considered likely to promote hate.
According to the state government, the proposed bill aims to strike a balance between the right to protest while targeting behaviour including harassment, violence and intimidation.
Reasons to refuse a protest permit can be based on factors such as religion, race, disability, gender, sexuality or ethnicity.
The proposed bill extends WA’s prohibition on nazi symbols to representations of all organisations outlawed under Commonwealth legislation and will also apply to juveniles who display the symbols.
Face coverings worn in public to intimidate or cause apprehension in others will also be banned, with exemptions for health, occupational safety, religious, cultural or artistic purposes.
It will also become an offence to knowingly provide false or misleading information when applying for a protest permit.
Police Minister Reece Whitby said Western Australia has long enjoyed a tradition of having peaceful protests.
“We haven’t seen the type of aggression, the extremes of confrontations that we’ve seen on the East Coast, here in Perth,” he said.
“The WA Police work closely with the organisers of protests and assemblies to ensure that they are able to exercise their constitutional rights, in a safe and responsible manner.
“These laws will only continue to foster mutually respectful relationships between organisers, the Police and the wider WA community.”
WA Greens anti-racism spokesperson Sophie McNeill said her party held deep concerns about the proposal of the new bill.
“How will this be decided? Will protests against Israel’s genocide be banned? What about peaceful gatherings against visiting war criminals, like what took place last Monday night?,” McNeill said.
“The government says this legislation is aimed at Nazis, but if it is written too broadly it could be applied against any group at the will of the police and have concerning impacts on the freedom of speech and assembly.
“It is dangerous to rush through any sort of legislation that fundamentally impacts our basic democratic rights.”
The existing right to appeal permit rejections to the State Administrative Tribunal will remain as a safeguard to protect the right to demonstrate.
Premier Roger Cook said the proposed bill aims to promote social cohesion in Western Australia.
“What has been targeted by these laws today is behaviour that crosses the line into violence, harassment or intimidation,” he said.
“We will stand at nothing to make sure that Western Australia remains a safe and peaceful community where social cohesion is supported, not undermined by the activities of those who wish to spread hatred, violence or intimidation.”
The proposed Public Order Legislation Amendment Bill will be introduced at the first parliamentary sitting of the year on Tuesday.

Michael Imperioli and Steve Schirripa: ‘People say The Sopranos is their comfort food – even though it’s about killers and drug addicts’
For six seasons, Steve Schirripa and Michael Imperioli lived at the heart of television’s most notorious crime family. Decades on, they speak to Annabel Nugent about the show’s legacy, James Gandolfini, and what Tony Soprano’s mobsters would’ve made of Trump

It’s strange to think that had things been different, there might’ve been a seventh season of The Sopranos – that in another world, David Chase’s ambitious, mean mob opera, and with it James Gandolfini’s ambitious, mean mobster Tony Soprano, could have returned to screens one last time. “There was talk of us coming back,” says Michael Imperioli, whose performance as Tony’s problem nephew Christopher won him an Emmy. It was around 2012, five years after the show wrapped, that the idea of a reboot was first floated.
“There was even talk at one point of us doing a prequel, like with us in it – which given our age didn’t really make any sense,” says Imperioli from the dark alcove of a hotel room somewhere. “I remember Jim was like, ‘What are we gonna do? Wear wigs and girdles like Star Trek?” He laughs to himself, lost in the memory. “Yeah, I remember Jim saying that.”
Any chance of a reunion would be stamped out for good when Gandolfini died aged 51 of a heart attack a year later. “I think he would have gone for it for the right price and the right script but then he passed away – and without Jim it didn’t make sense,” adds Steve Schirripa on a separate call, Zooming in from home where behind him today are a raft of framed photographs – some of him in character as Bobby “Bacala” Baccalieri, the mob’s most domesticated soldier, and others of him alongside Clint Eastwood, Frank Sinatra, Willie Nelson, Tony Danza, and Tony Bennett.
And so, barring a spin-off movie that starred none of the original cast – 2021’s The Many Saints of Newark – The Sopranos remains preserved as a singular moment in time: six seminal seasons of complicated and clever television that have proven rich enough to justify decades of discussion. Not least on Talking Sopranos, the rewatch podcast that Imperioli and Schirripa hosted during the pandemic, when viewership skyrocketed as older fans embarked on their billionth rewatch and new ones discovered it for the first time. “People say it’s their comfort food, which is funny because it’s about killers and drug addicts,” says Imperioli. “But there are people who have been with us since it first came on air, and they have memories of watching it on Sundays with family and friends. It occupies a special place.”
Schirripa and Imperioli are bringing their podcast this side of the Atlantic for the first time this month. On air, they make a right pair: Schirripa is a laugh, while Imperioli carries a more sober tone about him. It took them a while to find their groove when recording, admits Schirripa. “People thought we didn’t like each other,” he says. “The first five episodes were a little rough but then I think we did OK. You know, it was a tall order.”
Tall order, indeed. If fans of The Sopranos did not approve, certainly they would make their disapproval known. It’s a testament to the show’s legacy that fans are so ardent despite the fact social media did not exist back when it was airing. Several accounts have been created retroactively in appreciation of its fashion (gaudy and louche) and dialogue (hilarious and affecting). “Christopher in a Neckbrace” has become a classic Halloween costume.
One guy approached Imperioli in Central Park to show off a tattoo on his calf he’d had done of Christopher. Imperioli gets it: “I became an actor because I was a fan – of Al Pacino and Jon Voight and Robert De Niro and Meryl Streep. Musicians, too. I still have that for certain artists.” To be clear, he doesn’t have an Al Pacino tattoo. “But I understand that intense fandom.”
Intense is underselling it, really. The Sopranos was one of the first shows big enough and with a perfervid enough fanbase to justify extreme measures when it came to on-set secrets. The season five fate of Adriana (Christopher’s glamorous girlfriend, played by a phenomenal Drea De Matteo) was famously filmed two ways to stop it getting to the press. And by the end of the show, Schirripa says, the actors were only getting their own pages. “There was a leak on set because somebody was selling information. We had some suspects…” They never did catch the rat.
Talking Sopranos is full of behind-the-scenes trivia and juicy titbits like this, but when it comes to on-set drama, the pair keep their cards close to their chests. “I never say anything bad about anybody,” says Imperioli. “I mean, I could, but I won’t. I’m sure people say bad things about me – I wouldn’t be surprised – but we tried to keep it above the belt. No low blows. I find it not classy.”
They are likewise careful to protect Gandolfini’s legacy. Across several documentaries and biographies since his death, the cast and crew have recalled how tough those last months of shooting The Sopranos were amid the actor’s worsening depression and addictions: how he would frequently threaten to quit; how on some days he wouldn’t show up to set at all, a breach in his contract that cost him $250,000 each time. “Look, Jim was a brilliant actor and a wonderful guy, but not without problems,” says Schirripa. “You’re working 16-hour days, you’re making a lot of money, and you have no life. And the fame snuck up on him, and he didn’t expect it. He was very nice to people, to fans, but he wasn’t one of those guys who could hide away.”
I’ve long wondered whether some of that real-life darkness bled into what we were seeing on screen, as Tony’s storylines became progressively bleaker too. Neither Schirrippa nor Imperioli think so. “I think there were times Jim felt that way, that the series was mirroring some of his life,” Schirripa says. “But I didn’t see that [translate to his performance].” Imperioli agrees, “No, that darkness was necessary to show the karmic debt of all this criminality and amorality.”
For any off-camera drama or backroom politics that may or may not have happened, both actors remember their time on set fondly. “It wasn’t Hollywood-y,” says Schirripa, “and the vibe came from the top down, from Jim. He was the leader, and if he was a schmuck, it would trickle down. But there was none of that diva attitude on set. It just wouldn’t fly. And if anyone did behave like that, you’d get straightened out quickly. David wouldn’t have it, and Jim wouldn’t have it.”
The Sopranos has gone down in history as the first cable show to ever win an Emmy for Best Drama; it’s surreal to think it took a whole five seasons for the series to nab it. When Edie Falco took home the acting prize early on for her performance as OG mob wife Carmela Soprano, she said she felt embarrassed by the win, given that the series had been snubbed elsewhere. She stuffed the statuette in her bag immediately. “The West Wing kept beating us every year,” says Schirripa, with Imperioli adding, “All the reviews were so hyperbolic, and we thought we were going to win – and then it didn’t happen.” That said, they both say it didn’t stop them from having a good time on the company dime.
The Sopranos was always about more than mobsters; it was about capitalism and consumerism, human struggle and the banality of evil. It’s tempting to imagine what the show might look like set in America 2026. “The show is about the American dream, especially through the eyes of immigrants,” says Imperioli. “I think that would be one of the big themes if it was made today: the current climate in the US and what they’re doing to immigrants. The fact is that these characters are all immigrants, but I think a lot of them would probably be Trump supporters, oddly enough. So how do they reconcile those things? When Italians came over – and people forget this, or they don’t want to see it – a lot of them were undocumented.”
In 2024, the cast and crew members of The Sopranos reunited at Da Nico, an old red sauce restaurant in Little Italy, New York, where they celebrated the show’s 25th anniversary. Lorraine Bracco, Dominic Chianese, Aida Turturro, Steve Buscemi, Drea de Matteo; the gang was all there. Gandolfini’s absence was felt, and so too was that of Tony Sirico, who’d played wise guy Paulie Walnuts and who had died years earlier following a dementia diagnosis. Who knows if there will be a 30th celebration? “We’re all getting older,” says Schirripa. “Everything changes, but hopefully there will be.” Imperioli compares those six years on set to an experience akin to just hanging out with your friends. “And we would go out afterwards,” Schirripa adds. “We were younger. Going out every night and having a great time – a real good time, maybe a little too good. But we just enjoyed every moment.”

US’ Rubio says nation-states must engage, rejects talk of US-Europe rupture
Secretary of state says dialogue essential in changing world order, transatlantic alliance adapting to new realities
ISTANBUL
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Saturday that communication among nation-states is essential to managing global challenges, while dismissing claims of a rupture in relations between the US and Europe.
Rubio told Bloomberg that diplomacy and engagement between countries should not be viewed as concessions but as necessary tools to prevent conflict and address shared problems in a changing world order.
His remarks came in response to a question about European leaders engaging with China. Rubio said it is normal for major powers to maintain dialogue, arguing that interaction between states does not contradict cooperation among allies on common interests and threats.
“We expect nation-states to interact with one another. In the end, we expect nation-states to act in their national interest. I don't think that is excluded. That in no way runs counter to our desire to work together on things that we share in common or threats we face in common. But I don't think visiting Beijing or meeting with the Chinese is on the contrary,” he said.
Rubio stressed that it would be “irresponsible” for great powers not to have relationships and talk through things, “and to the extent possible, avoid unnecessary conflict,” adding that while there will be areas they may never agree on, "those are the areas that I hope we can work together on.”
Addressing broader transatlantic relations, Rubio rejected suggestions of a breakdown in ties, pointing to continued military, intelligence and economic cooperation, including the presence of US forces in Europe under NATO commitments.
He said the US-European alliance is undergoing a “readjustment” to reflect evolving global realities, arguing that partnerships must adapt to 21st-century challenges while remaining grounded in shared historical and civilizational ties.
“This alliance has to look different, because the world looks different. This alliance has to be about different things than it's been in the past, because the challenges of the 21st century are different than the challenges of the 20th. The world has changed, and the alliance has to change,” Rubio stressed.
He underscored that the fundamental thing that has to change is "we have to remind ourselves of why it is we have an alliance in the first place.” Calling the alliance not just a military arrangement, or commercial arrangement, he said it is “what holds us together in the first place as an alliance, is our shared civilizational values.”
“The fact that we are all heirs to a common civilization and one we should be very proud of. And only after we recognize that and make that the core of why it is we're allies in the first place, can we then build out all the mechanics of that alliance. Then everything else we do together makes more sense,” he added.

Queensland police have arrested a man accused of staging a brazen cat burglary of priceless Egyptian artefacts from a museum in Caboolture, north of Brisbane.
The man, 52, of no fixed address, was arrested on Russell Island in Moreton Bay on Saturday evening, after police allegedly found most of the stolen artefacts in a camper van parked at a ferry terminal.
Another missing piece, a 2,600-year-old wooden cat sculpture from the 26th dynasty of ancient Egypt, was allegedly found in his possession.
The arrest brings to the close a two-day hunt for the stolen items, which were taken from the Abbey Museum of Art and Archaeology at Caboolture about 3am on Friday.
In scenes reminiscent of the 2025 Louvre heist, police said a thief had smashed a window at the museum and left with a number of items from its ancient Egypt exhibit. They included a 3,300-year-old necklace and a mummy mask.

About 1.30pm on Saturday, police said, they located a vehicle of interest parked at the Cleveland ferry terminal, about 80km from the museum. Inside they found most of the stolen artefacts.
Footage released by police appears to show that the mummy mask was found inside the vehicle wrapped in a Venezuelan flag.
It appears the artefacts sustained only minor damage.
Later on Sunday, police arrested the 52-year-old. He was charged with breaking and entering, and three counts of wilful damage.
He was scheduled to appear in court on Monday.

France's Sophie Adenot and crew arrive at International Space Station

France's Sophie Adenot and crew arrive at International Space Station
France's Sophie Adenot and her fellow Crew-12 members docked at the International Space Station late on Saturday for the start of their months-long mission aboard the orbiting laboratory, where a medical evacuation earlier this year left a skeleton crew of just three astronauts. Adenot is only the second French woman to fly to space.
Four astronauts docked at the International Space Station on Saturday for a months-long research mission, replacing a crew forced to return to Earth early over a medical issue.
The US space agency's Crew-12 arrived at the orbiting laboratory after a journey of about 34 hours that started with blastoff from Cape Canaveral, Florida aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket.
"We have bridged the legacy of humankind's continuous presence in space spanning more than 25 years at this very site," American astronaut Jessica Meir said after docking at the ISS.
"As we look back at Earth from these windows, we are reminded that cooperation is not just possible, it is essential. Up here, there are no borders and hope is universal."
Other members of Crew-12 are American Jack Hathaway, French astronaut Sophie Adenot and Russian cosmonaut Andrey Fedyaev.

The foursome are replacing Crew-11, which returned to Earth in January a month earlier than planned in the first medical evacuation in the space station's history.
The ISS, which orbits 250 miles (400 kilometers) above Earth, has since been staffed by a skeleton crew of three.
NASA declined to disclose any details about the health issue that cut the previous mission short.
Crew-12 will be one of the last crews to live aboard the football field-sized space station.
Continuously inhabited for the last quarter-century, the aging ISS is scheduled to be pushed into Earth's orbit before crashing into an isolated spot in the Pacific Ocean in 2030.
Microgravity and the human body
During their eight months on the outpost, the astronauts will conduct many experiments, including research into the effects of microgravity on their bodies.
Meir, who previously worked as a marine biologist studying animals in extreme environments, will serve as the crew's commander.
Adenot has become the second French woman to fly into space, following in the footsteps of Claudie Haignere, who spent time on the Mir space station.
Among other research, she will test a system that uses artificial intelligence and augmented reality to allow astronauts to carry out their own medical ultrasounds.
"I am proud to bring France and Europe along on this incredible adventure that transcends borders," Adenot said.
"Count on me to share every step with you and bring a sparkle to the eyes of the French people."
The ISS, once a symbol of warming post-Cold War relations, has been a rare area of continued cooperation between the West and Russia since Moscow invaded Ukraine in 2022.
However, the space station has not entirely avoided the tensions back on Earth.
In November, Russian cosmonaut Oleg Artemyev -- who had long been planned to be a member of Crew-12 -- was suddenly taken off the mission.
Reports from independent media in Russia suggested he had been photographing and sending classified information with his phone while training at a SpaceX facility. Russian space agency Roscosmos merely said he had been transferred to a different job.
His replacement, Fedyaev, has already spent some time on the ISS as part of Crew-6 in 2023.

Australia commits $2.8B down payment for nuclear submarine facility under AUKUS pact

Australia has unveiled $2.8 billion in spending as a "down payment" on a new facility to build nuclear submarines under the tripartite AUKUS security pact with Britain and the United States.
Defence minister Richard Marles said on Sunday that the facility in Osborne, near the southern city of Adelaide, would be at the heart of that.
In the long term, an estimated $21.3 billion is expected to be spent on the facility.
"The transformation underway at Osborne shows Australia is on track to deliver the sovereign capability to build our nuclear-powered submarines for decades to come," he said.
The investment in the Submarine Construction Yard "is critical to delivering Australia's conventionally-armed, nuclear-powered submarines," Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said in a statement.
"We are accelerating AUKUS opportunities to secure Australia's future defence capability and create lasting prosperity and jobs for the state," he added.
Improving long-range strike capabilities in Pacific
The AUKUS pact aims to arm Australia with a fleet of cutting-edge submarines from the United States and would provide for cooperation in developing an array of warfare technologies.
The submarines, the sale of which will begin in 2032, lie at the heart of Australia's strategy of improving its long-range strike capabilities in the Pacific, particularly against China.
The deal could cost Canberra up to $235 billion over the next 30 years, and also includes the technology to build its own vessels in the future.
‘America First’ agenda
In September, Canberra also revealed a US$8 billion investment to be spent over a decade to transform a shipbuilding and maintenance precinct in Perth, Western Australia, into facilities for a future fleet of nuclear-powered submarines.
Australia had a major bust-up with France in 2021 when it cancelled a multi-billion-dollar deal to buy a fleet of diesel-powered submarines from Paris and went with the AUKUS programme instead.
The pact was thrown into doubt last June when Washington said it was launching a review into whether it aligned with President Donald Trump's "America First" agenda.
In December, the Pentagon said it had cleared that hurdle and that Trump had ordered it "full steam ahead".

A look at Ramadan and how Muslims observe the holy month
Observant Muslims will soon be united in a ritual of daily fasting from dawn to sunset as the Islamic holy month of Ramadan starts
- Bookmark
Observant Muslims the world over will soon be united in a ritual of daily fasting from dawn to sunset as the Islamic holy month of Ramadan starts. For Muslims, it’s a time for increased worship, religious reflection and charity. Socially, it often brings families and friends together in festive gatherings around meals to break their fast.
Ramadan is followed by the Islamic holiday of Eid al-Fitr.
First day of Ramadan expected around Feb. 18-19
Ramadan is the ninth month of the Islamic lunar calendar; the month cycles through the seasons.
The start of the month traditionally depends on the sighting of the crescent moon. This year, the first day of Ramadan is expected to be on or around Feb. 18 or 19. The actual start date may vary among countries and Muslim communities due to declarations by multiple Islamic authorities around the globe on whether the crescent had been sighted or different methodologies used to determine the beginning of the month.
This year, the start of Ramadan is expected around the same time as Ash Wednesday, a solemn day of fasting and reflection that signals the start of Lent, the most penitential season of the church calendar for Catholics and many other Christians.
Fasting is one of the pillars of Islam
Fasting is one of the Five Pillars of Islam, along with the profession of faith, prayer, almsgiving and pilgrimage.
Muslims see various meanings and lessons in observing the fast.
It’s regarded as an act of worship to attain piety and one of submission to God. The devout see benefits, including practicing self-restraint, cultivating gratitude and empathizing with people who are poor and hungry.
The daily fast in Ramadan includes abstaining from all food and drink — not even a sip of water is allowed — from dawn to sunset, before breaking the fast in a meal known as “iftar” in Arabic.
Muslims typically stream into mosques for congregational prayers and dedicate more time to religious contemplation and the reading of the Quran, the Muslim holy book.
Charity is a hallmark of Ramadan. Among other ways of giving, many seek to provide iftar for those in need, distributing Ramadan boxes filled with pantry staples, handing out warm meals alongside such things as dates and juice or helping hold free communal meals.
Muslims eat a predawn meal, called “suhoor,” to hydrate and nurture their bodies ahead of the daily fast.
Exemptions from fasting
There are certain exemptions, such as for those who are unable to because of illness or travel. Those unable to fast due to being temporarily ill or traveling need to make up for the missed days of fasting later.
Cultural and social traditions associated with Ramadan
Muslims are ethnically and racially diverse and not all Ramadan traditions are rooted in religion. Some customs may transcend borders, while others can differ across cultures.
Many social rituals center on gathering and socializing after the daily fast. Some Muslims decorate their homes, put out Ramadan-themed tableware and centerpieces or throng to markets and Ramadan bazaars.
In Egypt, Ramadan is typically a festive time. Colorful lanterns, in different shapes and sizes, dangle from children’s hands and adorn homes. Ramadan songs may be played to welcome the month.
Ramadan’s soundscape in Egypt has traditionally included the predawn banging on drums by a “mesaharati” who roams neighborhoods, calling out to the faithful, sometimes by name, to wake them up for the suhoor meal.
New TV shows and communal meals
A lineup of new television series is another social fixture of the month in some countries, and advertisers compete for viewers' attention.
In various regions, some Muslims worry that the month is getting commercialized, and say an emphasis on decorations, TV shows, outings or lavish iftar banquets can detract from Ramadan's religious essence. Others say that a balance can be struck and that, in moderation, such rituals are part of the month’s festive spirit.
In Indonesia, Ramadan rituals vary across regions, reflecting the diversity of cultures. In deeply conservative Aceh province, animals are slaughtered during Meugang festivities, the meat cooked and shared with family, friends, poor people and orphans.
Hundreds of residents in Tangerang, a city outside the capital, Jakarta, flock to the Cisadane River to wash their hair with rice straw shampoo and welcome the fasting month with a symbolic spiritual cleansing.
Across the island of Sumatra, after evening prayers, many boys and girls parade through the streets, carrying torches and playing Islamic songs.
In the United States, where Muslims make up a racially and ethnically diverse minority, gathering at mosques and Islamic centers when possible for iftar meals and prayers provides many Muslim families with a sense of community. Some Muslims also organize or attend interfaith iftar meals.

Rubio to visit eastern Europe, bolster ties with pro-Trump leaders
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
MUNICH, Feb 15 - U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio is set to begin a two-day trip on Sunday, to bolster ties with Slovakia and Hungary, whose conservative leaders, often at odds with other European Union countries, have warm ties with President Donald Trump.
Rubio will use the trip to discuss energy cooperation and bilateral issues, including NATO commitments, the State Department said in an announcement last week.
"These are countries that are very strong with us, very cooperative with the United States, work very closely with us, and it's a good opportunity to go see them and two countries I've never been in," Rubio told reporters before departing for Europe on Thursday.
Rubio, who in his dual role also serves as Trump’s national security adviser, will meet in Bratislava on Sunday with Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico, who visited Trump in Florida last month. The U.S. diplomat's trip follows his participation in the Munich Security Conference over the last few days.
WILL MEET VIKTOR ORBAN ON MONDAY
On Monday, Rubio is expected to meet with Hungarian leader Viktor Orban, who is trailing in most polls ahead of an election in April when he could be voted out of power.
"The President said he's very supportive of him, and so are we," Rubio said. "But obviously we were going to do that visit as a bilateral visit."
Orban, one of Trump's closest allies in Europe, is considered by many on the American hard-right as a model for the U.S. president's tough policies on immigration and support for families and Christian conservatism. Budapest has repeatedly hosted Conservative Political Action Conference events, which bring together conservative activists and leaders, with another due in March.
TIES WITH MOSCOW AND CLASHES WITH THE EU
Both Fico and Orban have clashed with EU institutions over probes into backsliding on democratic rules.
They have also maintained ties with Moscow, criticised and at times delayed the imposition of EU sanctions on Russia and opposed sending military aid to Ukraine.
Even as other European Union countries have secured alternative energy supplies after Moscow invaded Ukraine in 2022, including by buying U.S. natural gas, Slovakia and Hungary have also continued to buy Russian gas and oil, a practice the United States has criticised.
Rubio said this would be discussed during his brief tour, but did not give any details.
Fico, who has described the European Union as an institution that is in “deep crisis”, has showered Trump with praise saying he would bring peace back to Europe.
But Fico criticised the U.S. capture of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro in early January.
Hungary and Slovakia have also so far diverged from Trump on NATO spending.
They have raised defence spending to NATO's minimum threshold of 2% of GDP.
Fico has, however, refused to raise expenditure above that level for now, even though Trump has repeatedly asked all NATO members to increase their military spending to 5%. Hungary has also planned for 2% defence spending in this year's budget.
On nuclear cooperation, Slovakia signed an agreement with the United States last month and Fico has said U.S.-based Westinghouse was likely to build a new nuclear power plant.
He also said after meeting the chief of France's nuclear engineering company Framatome during the week he would welcome more companies taking part in the project. REUTERS

US military used Anthropic’s AI model in operation to capture Venezuela’s Maduro: Report
AI tool Claude accessed through partnership with Palantir Technologies, Wall Street Journal says
ISTANBUL
The US military used Anthropic’s AI model Claude during the operation to capture Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, The Wall Street Journal reported Saturday.
The report, citing anonymous sources, stated that Claude was used via Anthropic’s partnership with Palantir Technologies, a contractor for US defense and federal law enforcement agencies.
Following the raid, an employee at Anthropic asked a counterpart at Palantir Technologies how Claude was used in the operation, according to the report.
Anthropic became the first known AI developer whose technology was used in a classified operation by the US Department of Defense, though it remains unclear how the tool, capable of tasks from analyzing PDFs to guiding autonomous drones, was deployed.
A spokesperson for Anthropic declined to comment on whether Claude was used in the operation, said the report.
“Any use of Claude—whether in the private sector or across government—is required to comply with our Usage Policies, which govern how Claude can be deployed. We work closely with our partners to ensure compliance,” the spokesperson told the newspaper.

Caspian Sea faces ‘triple planetary crisis’: Can new cross-border rules save it?

Azerbaijan has highlighted rising environmental threats to the Caspian Sea as UN introduces cross-border environmental assessments.
The Caspian Sea is suffering falling water levels and biodiversity loss.
Azerbaijan recently highlighted these growing environmental risks at the United Nations in Geneva, as new international rules governing large infrastructure projects around the region come into force.
During UN discussions, Leyla Aliyeva, Vice-President of the Heydar Aliyev Foundation, joined senior officials and environmental experts to draw attention to governance challenges affecting the world’s largest enclosed body of water. Delegates stressed the importance of long-term monitoring, improved scientific data, and closer coordination between Caspian littoral states and international partners.
The renewed diplomatic focus coincides with a new Protocol on Environmental Impact Assessment under the Tehran Convention. The legally binding protocol requires major infrastructure projects to assess potential cross-border environmental impacts when requested by another Caspian state.
The projects include oil and gas facilities, pipelines, power stations, dams, transport corridors and large-scale water transfers. Assessments must be publicly available, and approval from affected states is required before construction can proceed.
Regional cooperation is 'vital' as Caspian Sea faces triple threat
“The Caspian Sea is coming under increasing pressure from the triple planetary crisis of climate change, biodiversity loss, and pollution," Arnold Kreilhuber, Director of UNEP’s Regional Office for Europe, tells Euronews.
"Regional cooperation is vital. The Tehran Convention, and its work towards an action plan to fight the Sea’s decline, can unite efforts to help ensure we protect this unique body of water and the communities and species that depend on it.”
The Tehran Convention, formally known as the Framework Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the Caspian Sea, provides the governance framework for regional cooperation. Signed by all five Caspian littoral states - Azerbaijan, Iran, Kazakhstan, Russia and Turkmenistan - it aims to safeguard the marine environment and promote sustainable development.
The Secretariat of the Convention is currently provided by the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) on an interim basis. Since its adoption, the Convention has guided measures on oil spill response, land-based pollution, and biodiversity protection. A fifth protocol on environmental monitoring and information exchange is under negotiation to strengthen long-term sustainability efforts.
Caspian Sea decline could harm ecosystems and the economy
The protocol brings the Caspian region closer to international environmental standards at a time of rapid economic expansion. The sea sits along key Europe–Asia energy and transport corridors, making its environmental health crucial beyond the region. Stronger oversight is needed to prevent habitat loss, pollution and water-level fluctuations from undermining both ecosystems and economic connectivity.
Azerbaijan’s engagement at the UN underscores its effort to elevate Caspian Sea protection from a regional priority to a shared international challenge.
By linking infrastructure governance with environmental responsibility, Azerbaijan is positioning itself as a reliable, forward-looking partner in safeguarding one of the world’s most unique inland seas.

Canada says it will not restore diplomatic ties with Iran without regime change
Foreign minister says Ottawa’s focus is on human rights repression; announces new sanctions linked to Iranian bodies
ISTANBUL
Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Anita Anand said Saturday that Ottawa will not open diplomatic relations with Tehran “unless there is regime change. Period.”
“The repressive Iranian regime must curtail the consistent and illegal violation of Iranian human rights, including by respecting international law and international humanitarian law,” she told the Globe and Mail newspaper in an interview in Germany, where she is attending the Munich Security Conference.
Anand also announced that Canada imposed additional sanctions on seven people who are “linked to Iranian state bodies responsible for intimidation, violence and transnational repression targeting Iranian dissidents and human rights defenders.”
Canada severed ties with Iran in 2012 under then-Prime Minister Stephen Harper for human rights concerns and has since kept sanctions and trade limits in place while pursuing international legal action over the downing of a passenger plane carrying Canadians.
Meanwhile, the US bolstered its Middle East presence by deploying a second aircraft carrier and additional destroyers, fighter jets and surveillance aircraft.
Anand said Ottawa’s regional focus is on addressing human rights repression and declined to say whether Canada would support a US military strike.

IDF increases West Bank security, tightens crossings for Ramadan

The defense establishment has been well prepared for the start of Ramadan. Unlike in the past, terrorism data in the West Bank has been on a steady decline for an extended period, and Central Command’s control over the refugee camps in the northern West Bank continues — meaning the “entry point into Ramadan” is considered favorable compared to previous years.
For large-scale arrest operations, the Judea and Samaria Division in the West Bank has been reinforced with commando units that have already begun carrying out arrests in the area. In addition, as part of the preparations, the police and the IDF have stepped up efforts against significant terrorist operatives and, of course, against inciters, including identifying key figures who could potentially fuel escalation on the ground.
The police are also emphasizing assistance to other districts in apprehending illegal residents. In the IDF, special focus is being placed on the security barrier and known breach points. Beyond that, thousands of Palestinians from the West Bank are expected to travel to pray at the mosques on the Temple Mount, and the Judea and Samaria Police District is preparing accordingly.
The goal is to ensure that everyone who leaves the West Bank returns at the designated time and through the designated crossing. Palestinians permitted to enter under the directives of the political echelon will pass through two crossings that will be reinforced with additional forces — the Rachel Crossing in the south of the city and the Qalandiya Crossing in the north.
The IDF will also increase security around agricultural outposts and along roads in the West Bank due to concerns over potential terrorist incidents. At the same time, the Judea and Samaria Division is continuing its large-scale offensive activity, as it has throughout the recent period.
In addition, the IDF and police have placed special emphasis on protecting agricultural outposts. A procedure has been established under which any shepherd heading out to graze will be required to notify the local brigade of his destination. Meanwhile, a unique exercise will take place this week in the northern West Bank involving the Nahal Reconnaissance Battalion using Eitan armored vehicles.
A project 9 years in the making
The Eitan — an eight-wheeled armored fighting vehicle capable of carrying 12 soldiers and reaching speeds of about 90 kph (56 mph) — is gradually being integrated by the IDF into operations in the West Bank. Soldiers who have already operated it in the West Bank since the war are stationed in the Jenin refugee camp and departed from there for a 24-hour exercise simulating an attack on a Hezbollah operative village along the Lebanese border.
The commander of the Nahal Reconnaissance Battalion, Lt. Col. S., who led the drill, explained that this was the first time the system had been tested in conducting operations deep in the field. “The exercise was divided into several stages — a prolonged night advance battle that included infiltration while employing live fire. Second, the integration of special units and rescue teams,” he said.
“The Eitans are an integral part of the unit," he added. "We are essentially learning through trial and error how to use the vehicle across the IDF. They are with us everywhere. In Judea and Samaria, we use them for very unique operations.”
He also said that “the Eitan enables forces to move at night along routes full of hostile elements and reach the objective in a short time with minimal friction with the enemy. That just demonstrates its tremendous capabilities.”
Maj. N., operations officer of the Nahal Reconnaissance Battalion, described the drill: “The unit has been stationed in the Jenin refugee camp for two months. We conducted the exercise in the Bezek Stream area. We traveled in Eitans for more than 30 kilometers — a distance that would have taken days for a heavier, more armored vehicle. The speed is remarkable. We practiced a scenario simulating what would be required on the Lebanese border. We trained for a situation in which we would have to manage a prolonged battle without receiving assistance.”
Sgt. Maj. O. from the Merkava and Armored Vehicles Directorate at the Defense Ministry said: “I have been accompanying the Eitan project for more than nine years. Seeing it enter full battalion-level operational activity is truly closing a circle.”
Regarding the unit’s preparations for Ramadan, Lt. Col. S. said: “I think in general the Judea and Samaria sector has become a place where the IDF operates extensively. The lessons from the fighting in Gaza are very helpful.” He said the troop are prepared for the Muslim holiday. “In recent weeks we have remained at peak readiness and carried out preemptive actions,” he said.
“The goal is to reduce terrorist activity through targeted strikes and arrest," he said. "We want the enemy operating here to feel hunted, and therefore less able to focus on carrying out attacks. We prepared for this period and are entering it in relatively good condition, but we are always alert — especially after these past two years.”
Maj. N. added regarding Ramadan: “We are making use of technology and operating in a kind of limited maneuver — going out from the refugee camp and returning, similar to Gaza. Even though we are on the eve of Ramadan, we feel that the level of terrorism has declined.”

Nobody knows what would follow regime change in Iran – but what happened in 1979 offers some pointers | Jason Burke

A critical moment looms for Iran, and so for the Middle East. The global consequences of any upheaval in Tehran have been made amply clear since the revolution in 1979 that ushered in the rule of radical Islamist clerics. In Oman, the Iranian foreign minister Abbas Araghchi and his team have begun indirect talks with a high-powered US delegation. Many analysts believe the gap between the two sides is too wide to be bridged, and that a conflict is inevitable. Just this weekend, having already threatened military action, Donald Trump said regime change is the “the best thing that could happen” in Iran. The tension, and risks grow higher.
The hold on Iran of those who came to power in the aftermath of the 1979 revolution is now at stake. The ultimate objective of the US appears to be regime change. This may, in fact, already be under way. In December 2025 and January 2026, the most extensive wave of protest since the early 1980s swept Iran, with hundreds of thousands taking to the streets from Mashhad to Abadan.
Such scenes prompted many to recall the last days of the shah of Iran, when millions took to the streets. And as we live through contemporary events, there are striking similarities between then and now that should inform the debate about what may happen, about our hopes and our fears. One obvious parallel is the central role of economics. Soaring inflation was a key trigger for the most recent unrest. It was almost 50 years ago as well. In 1977, the price of basic consumer goods rose as much as 27%. Then, too, the key actors were shopkeepers and businessmen in Tehran’s bazaar whose livelihoods were threatened.
A second parallel is emerging: a cycle of repression, grief and protest resembling that which unseated the shah. In 1978, this began when a conservative Iranian newspaper printed a scurrilous article about Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, prompting mass protests among his admirers. In the holy city of Qom, hundreds of religious students poured into the streets, attacking symbols of the shah’s rule and the modernisation he had sought to impose. Security forces used live ammunition to restore order and six students were killed. In Tehran there was further unrest.
The protests might have died away but for the tradition among Shia Muslims, who still nominally constitute the vast majority of the Iranian population, to observe a 40-day period of mourning before a final collective commemoration.
Ryszard Kapuściński, the celebrated Polish reporter, described how family, friends, neighbours and acquaintances – “the whole street, the whole village, a crowd of people” – gathered in the home of the deceased. “If the death was natural … this gathering consists of some hours of ecstatic, pathetic discharge, followed by a mood of dulled and humble resignation,” he wrote. But “if the death was a violent one, inflicted by somebody” then “a thirst for revenge seizes the people [and] … they pronounce the name of the killer, the author of their sorrow, and it is believed that, even if he is far away, he will shudder at that moment [for] his days are numbered”.
Exactly 40 days after the protests in Qom in January 1978, new demonstrations led to new killings, along with further mourning and commemorative processions that inevitably turned into new mass protests. These of course prompted further lethal repression. The cycle intensified until in January 1979 the shah, the “author of their sorrow”, left Iran – supposedly for a holiday – never to return.
That cycle could well recur. Last Thursday, the Wall Street Journal reported that merchants at Tehran’s grand bazaar had called on their counterparts across Iran to return to the streets at the end of the traditional 40-day mourning period for killings in the first week of January. The aim of the protest will be to “simultaneously, in their cities, keep the memory of the dead alive and continue the national uprising,” a trade association of bazaar workers quoted by the WSJ said on its Telegram channel. The goal is to “avenge the greatest street massacre in contemporary history”.
This may be a much bigger challenge to the regime than even the threat of US strikes if, as expected, talks fail. Ali Ansari, a leading historian of Iran, has put the total death toll in opposition to the shah in 1978 as approximately 2,800. Some believe up to 30,000 may have died in January. That means a lot of mourners and a lot of 40-day commemorations in the coming weeks.
Kapuściński, along with hundreds of international reporters and photographers, was on the ground in Iran in 1978, but there are no equivalents today, and the regime continues to restrict the internet. This makes it hard to work out exactly who was on the streets of Iran last December and in January. That the unrest was widespread, and an authentic expression of profound anger and alienation, seems clear. But the tragic biographies of casualties that have emerged offer only a fragmentary glimpse of the identities of those risking death and injury in the name of freedom.
We know that the 1978 revolutionary movement was a broad coalition. It included the radical clerics who followed Khomeini and the many millions of often poor, less educated Iranians who saw the exiled ayatollah as, sometimes quite literally, the answer to their prayers. But there were also others, many of whom had worked as hard and made as many sacrifices in the struggle to overthrow the shah.
On the streets in 1978 and 1979 were liberals and nationalists of every possible ideological flavour, socialists and feminists, moderate clerics and their students, even a few old-school communists. There were representatives of Iran’s ethnic, linguistic and religious minorities too. This variety had advantages and disadvantages. As Kapuściński wrote: “Everyone opposed the Shah and wanted to remove him. But everyone imagined the future differently.”
Even if the current regime is toppled, any new direction may not even be immediately clear, for it’s worth noting that Khomeini did not immediately seize power on his return. It took several years for his rule to be fully secured, built on war with Iraq, new institutions, a new constitution, and new security forces such as the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and the Basij. These were deployed to methodically destroy every potential opponent in Iran between 1979 and 1988, and were also the bloody spearhead of the regime’s response to the most recent unrest.
There is a lesson in this for the courageous men and women in Iran who seek the overthrow of their rulers today. Now, as then, their triumph can only come through the mass mobilisation of millions and the construction of a broad coalition. But though all will share many common goals, there will be as many different visions for the future of Iran today as there were among those who felled the shah in 1979. Back then, their sheer diversity became a weakness, allowing the one faction to impose an authoritarian rule and hardline vision at the expense of all others.
So the regime may fall, but if it does, the future is as hard to predict as it was amid the tumult 47 years ago. The people may prevail and find that the real battle for freedom, prosperity and security has only just begun.

No fuel, no tourists, no cash - this was the week the Cuban crisis got real

Among the verdant gardens of Havana’s diplomatic quarter, Siboney, ambassadors from countries traditionally allied to the United States are expressing increasing frustration with Washington’s attempt to unseat Cuba’s government, while simultaneously drawing up plans to draw down their missions.
Cuba is in crisis. Already reeling from a four-year economic slump, worsened by hyper-inflation and the migration of nearly 20% of the population, the 67-year-old communist government is at its weakest. After Washington’s successful military operation against Cuba’s ally Venezuela at the beginning of January, the US administration is actively seeking regime change.
The Guardian spoke to more than five top-level officials from different countries, and heard complaints that the US charge d’affaires, Mike Hammer, has failed to share any sort of detailed plan beyond bringing the island to a standstill by starving it of oil. One said: “There’s talk of human rights, and that this is the year Cuba changes – but little talk of what happens afterwards.”
Some hope that rumoured high-level discussions in Mexico between the Cuban government – in the form of Gen Alejandro Castro Espín, son of Cuba’s 94-year-old former president Raúl Castro – and US officials might produce a deal, but as yet there are no signs of progress.
Instead, diplomats in Havana are preparing for an alternative tactic: the country being starved until people take to the streets and the US can step in. “We’re trying to keep a cool head,” said one ambassador. “Embassies are built on planning for the unexpected – hopefully before it becomes expected,” said another.
Stoking concerns is news that lack of fuel is hampering the UN World Food Programme’s efforts to relieve suffering from last year’s Hurricane Melissa. The organisation, which keeps a low-key presence on the island, is now having to draw up plans for a new, far larger crisis. “We’re already seeing the impact in the availability of fresh produce in the cities,” said Étienne Labande, the WFP’s country director.
Diplomats expressed concern at how fast the lack of fuel – for electricity, water and the transport of food – could cause extreme suffering. “It’s a matter of weeks,” said one. “The view is that people in rural villages like Viñales may be OK, but those in the cities would be at terrible risk.”
Cuba’s latest crisis follows an executive order signed by Donald Trump in January imposing tariffs on any country supplying Cuba with oil. Despite outrage from Cuba’s traditional allies China and Russia, the threat has proved effective.
Even Mexico, which last year supplanted Venezuela as the island’s largest supplier, has ceased sending tankers, although its president, Claudia Sheinbaum, warned of a humanitarian disaster on the island and sent 800 tons of aid. “No one can ignore the situation that the Cuban people are currently experiencing because of the sanctions that the United States is imposing in a very unfair manner,” she said on Tuesday.
At a party at the US residence on 28 January, Hammer referred to the 68-year US embargo on the island, telling guests: “The Cubans have complained for years about ‘the blockade’, but now there is going to be a real blockade.”
He began a tour of eastern Cuba shortly afterwards, distributing US aid, during which small groups of government-backed protesters met him with abuse. He is now believed to be heading to Rome for discussions with the Vatican, increasingly a force on the island.
A spokeswoman for the embassy said they regularly meet with diplomatic colleagues, but “We of course do not discuss the details of our meetings.”
The consequences of the US oil blockade have arrived faster than anyone expected, adding to diplomats’ concerns. All three airlines flying tourists into Cuba from Canada suspended their services this week due to a lack of aviation fuel on the island. Two Russian airlines followed. All five carriers have begun the process of repatriating travellers.
Three-quarters of a million Canadians visited Cuba in 2025, by far the largest group. Russians are the third most numerous category of visitors, after Cuban expatriates. On Wednesday, the UK Foreign Office adjusted its travel advice to recommend only essential travel to the island.
As the oil blockade’s crippling effect on the Cuban government’s ability to earn foreign exchange takes hold, Cubans outside the diplomatic enclaves have begun preparing for life without fuel. “It is starting to feel like the 1962 missile crisis,” said one. “The sun was shining then too, and people went about their business, under a cloud of anxiety.”
Cuba’s government has already shut universities, secondary schools and non-essential state offices and pulled back on public transport in order to preserve resources.
Adrian Rodriguez Suárez has been studying nuclear physics at Havana University. The 22-year-old is from Holguín, a city in Cuba’s east, but lives in student accommodation in East Havana. He has been told to head home to continue his studies by distance learning.
“We heard the news on Thursday and since then, those who can have left,” he said. “Many are using their own means to get home. What worries me is the situation in my province. Although I like the idea of returning to my family, studying is going to be difficult. Outside Havana the electricity availability drops a lot.”
Others have been taking to social media to express their worries. One Facebook user wrote: “I’m getting married in March and I was just advised that the weddings for that month will be cancelled. Does anyone have information?”
Others try to help. “People with chemotherapy, dialysis and emergencies at Calixto hospital [in Havana] travel free,” posted a motorcycle taxi driver.
Then there are those leaning into the situation. A man in La Lisa neighbourhood in Havana is making cast aluminium and galvanised zinc burners for people to cook over wood. At $8 for a single burner and $15 for a double, his tools are proving popular.
“My mother is going crazy with this cooking on charcoal,” said a woman in the rural mid-Cuban town of Sancti Spíritus, who then asked to remain anonymous because otherwise she would have to “make a will to bequeath the charcoal stove to my daughter as her only inheritance”.
Meanwhile, diplomats have been making plans to leave if the situation quickly deteriorates. “What is the point of us being here if we can’t work?” asked one. “We’re prepared, vigilant, and hoping common sense keeps winning a few rounds,” said another.
In the centre of Havana, hotspots that have made the city one of the world’s most loved tourist destinations are falling quiet. Yarini is one of the hippest rooftop bars, named after a famously anti-American pimp of the early 1900s.
Usually it seethes, but on a warm weekday night, only two tables were occupied. Neither of the groups turned out to be local people or regular tourists. Instead they were war correspondents taking a break from winter in Ukraine, in the hope of covering the fall of one of the world’s last communist states.

New photos give glimpse inside Iran’s bloody crackdown on anti-government protests

After imposing a nationwide internet blackout, the Iranian regime appears to have largely obscured the mass killing of protesters. However, a photographer in Tehran has managed to share their documentation of what happened, along with the testimony of those who joined in and survived the protests.
Milad*, 23, Tehran: ‘A Basiji said, “Go tell your prince to pull these pellets out of your body”’
“I was near Yaftabad [an area of Tehran] on Thursday night [8 January] and saw people pouring into the streets, masked and waiting for a spark. Everyone was walking, from a 100-year-old man to a four-year-old kid whose parents were holding his hand. My friend called me and said, ‘Milad, this means revolution.’ I told him, ‘Yeah, brother, this is it.’
“We started chanting and kept going until we reached the main road. Let me tell you we were a huge crowd. From one end of the main road to the other, it was full of people. Where we were on Thursday night, they didn’t shoot. It was just teargas and shots fired into the air.
“One guy was breaking stones and handing them to the young guys; another was making a fire and blowing into people’s eyes to ease the burning after teargas was fired. My own lungs were burning nonstop.
“On Friday, I went back to that same neighbourhood. There were a lot of us and we were no longer afraid. We attacked the Basij [state-backed militia] base and set fire to the motorcycles in front of it and its signs. That same night, I went to Salsabil [an area of Tehran] to look for my girlfriend.
“There, with my own eyes, I saw them killing people with Kalashnikovs. Two girls came and knocked on our car window and said, ‘Please, for God’s sake, let us in, they’re killing everyone.’ We took them in. One of the girls got into the car and broke down crying. She said, ‘They killed four boys right in front of my eyes.’
“When I got back home, several people in our own neighbourhood had been killed. They killed a 16-year-old kid in our area, we all know him. His back, from top to bottom, was full of pellets and he was dead. While he was dying, the Basij were standing over him. ‘Help me,’ my friends say they heard him say, and a Basiji replied, ‘Go tell your prince to come and pull these pellets out of your body.’”
Sara*, 18, Isfahan: ‘I was waiting for the next blow to hit my head’
“The day before the call, at one of the gatherings, I got trapped in a place surrounded by officers. I heard one of them shout, ‘Hit them.’ They started firing pellets from the front and behind. When we tried to run away, they arrested people and beat them with batons.
“I panicked and fell to the ground in front of an officer. He hit my neck hard with a baton. I was waiting for the next blow to hit my head when suddenly a group of protesters – I don’t know how – pulled me up from the ground and saved me.
“That night, from the very beginning, the dominant chant was about [Reza] Pahlavi [the son of Iran’s former shah]. On the day of the call, most of my Instagram followers posted stories and that’s how I realised the crowd was even larger than I had imagined.
“Even a few days later, from the mouth of one of our relatives, whose exact job I don’t know but he probably works in the guard, I understood that they were also shocked by facing a huge crowd that kept growing. He said they kept seeing numerous groups coming from every alley and street.
“I didn’t participate on Friday, but from inside the house I continuously heard gunfire. Although our house is relatively far from the central squares of the city and places that could get crowded, at about 10pm I heard chants. From behind the door I heard people chanting and saw people coming from both sides of our house, officers were chasing and shooting at them.”
Mahsa*, 30, Isfahan: ‘I saw an officer chasing young boys while firing a handgun at them’
“After the protests had started, I went out every day, walking around the bazaar and the central streets to see if anything was happening. In the central areas, the atmosphere was completely securitised, guards and police officers were stationed everywhere.
“People were violently beaten and injured with teargas and pellets and many were arrested. The atmosphere was so suffocating and they reacted so aggressively to just a small gathering, that I never thought a serious gathering could form here.
“So when the call from Pahlavi came on Thursday, I decided not to leave the house. I truly did not think that in this city, filled with armed officers and plainclothes forces, such a large protest could take shape. But chants were coming from all the neighbourhoods around my house. At night, I went outside.
“As well as the usual protest areas in the city centre, the neighbourhoods themselves were full of people. This was very strange to me. Everyone knows how violently and brutally this government suppresses people and yet families were coming out together. I saw a man carrying his three- or four-year-old child, holding his wife’s hand, walking and chanting, and two teenage girls who had come out with their mother.
“But from early evening on Friday, the sound of gunfire began. You could hear ammunition being fired and explosions. I went out of the house and hadn’t even reached the end of the street when I saw an officer chasing seven or eight young boys while firing a handgun at them. It was a shocking scene.
“I went deeper into the neighbourhood to see if anyone was hiding or injured so I could bring them into my house and help them. But gunfire kept coming from the end of the street. It was so constant and so close that after a while I got scared to go any further alone and turned back towards home.
“When I got close to my house, I saw someone running toward me. At first I was scared, but when he saw my fear, he said, ‘I’m one of us, don’t be scared.’ He was out of breath and in bad shape. When he realised I was heading toward a house whose door wasn’t fully closed, he asked if he could come in and sit for a minute. He came into the yard and was clearly unwell.
“He said that just 10 steps away, they had shot a group of people in the head at the end of the street. He didn’t even know how he had escaped; he had lost his friends and said, ‘I think they shot everyone.’ I said, ‘Shot?’ He said, ‘Killed. They’re killing anyone who’s outside.’
“Later, I heard about a young man who was shot a few streets from us. He was still alive, screaming that he had a wife and a small child and begging for help. But before neighbours could reach him, several officers stood over him and prevented anyone from helping.
“They stood there until he died, and then they took his body away. Someone from the neighbourhood said they could have just killed him quickly, like many other wounded people they finished off, but instead they let him suffer and bleed to death to scare everyone else.
“We keep talking about the number of people killed, but many others have been left with severe disabilities, blinded, with pellets still in their bodies that could kill them at any moment. And then there are those who were arrested, with news of executions being carried out quietly. Just a few days ago, I heard that one of my friends who had been in the crowd was identified, taken from her home, and no one knows what has happened to her.”
Hamid*, 40, Tehran: ‘He only managed to say, “I’m burning”, and died in his father’s arms’
“I hadn’t gone into the middle of protests since 2009, but this time I saw everyone going; it felt shameful not to go, so I went. [Hamid later found out his nephew had been killed by a sniper while standing with his father at a protest.]
“As soon as my brother told me, I rushed to Karaj [a small city near Tehran where they had been protesting]. The bullet tore through his collarbone, entered his body, pierced his heart and lungs, and exited the other side. He only managed to say, ‘I’m burning’, and died on the spot in his father’s arms.
“When I got to the clinic, I saw 10 bodies lying on the ground. My mind snapped. At the other clinic in that area, they had stacked 200 bodies on top of each other; there was no space.
“I saw a six-year-old girl, a 70-year-old man. I saw a hundred boys whose moustaches hadn’t even come in yet. They’d all been shot in the neck, the head and the eyes. It’s like they were taking revenge [because] the kids [in our area] are a bit reckless and brave. It was like they were shooting pigeons.”

Koba, London W1: ‘I admire their chutzpah’ – restaurant review

Sometimes, my memories of a restaurant begin at the end, and at Koba in Fitzrovia, central London, the enduring image is the warm, fresh, sugary, bean paste doughnut served with a pot of buckwheat tea. It was an utter delight, but then, Korean sweet bean paste, which is made with adzuki beans, is so very satisfying: pleasantly claggy, almost nutty, and a little decadent, while at the same time still convincing you that it might count as one of your five a day, were it not stuffed inside a hot fresh doughnut with a whopping great dollop of whipped cream. It was a cold winter’s day – the sort where, by lunchtime, my own umbrella had blown inside-out twice and everyone else’s seemed determined to poke my eye out. Against that backdrop, this doughnut was a moment of pure bliss.
Koba, a Korean restaurant by Linda Lee, has been providing moments of such joy for 20 solid years, not least with its traditional tabletop barbecue hot plates on which guests could grill their own dinner. Or, in many cases, have their dinner grilled for them by a kindly server, because nothing says: “Lord God, what time does my shift finish?” more than the face of a tired Korean server watching a gang of tipsy non-Koreans trying to work a tabletop hot plate. After you’ve dropped that first plate of onions into your handbag, you’re often more than grateful for the help. To celebrate reaching 20 years, however, and after an elegant revamp, Lee has now ditched those hotplates altogether. Koba 2.0 has also slung out the black tables, the dangling extraction vents and much of the dark wood, and replaced it with a wabi sabi colour palette that’s pale, dreamy and, in places, even twinkly.
Small, elegant snacks and starters include the likes of deep-fried cuttlefish, neat jeon shrimp, vegetable and fermented sauce pancakes and a really very lovely yook hwei raw beef with pear, seaweed and egg yolk. These starters come with a generous serving of banchan, featuring different types of kimchi, beansprouts and spicy cucumbers. Perhaps the old crowd will miss the grill-your-own element, but, especially with something like Koba’s dak galbi barbecue chicken, I feel it’s much better to let an expert take the strain, not least so you don’t mess up the chicken in its heady marinade of gochujang paste, chilli and garlic served with mixed leaves, pickles and sauces. It’s pretty great, too.
Rest assured, also, that the beef bulgogi with mushrooms is still on the menu and, should you really wish, you can even grill it yourself on one of the few remaining tabletop grills in the downstairs private dining room.
Other parts of Koba’s new menu, however, lean towards delicate, modern fine dining. The mul hwei, for instance, is a pretty bowl of prawn, raw salmon and white fish topped with a generous scoop of vivid orange trout roe and dressed in an iced gochujang vinaigrette. It’s a dish where the Koba reboot goes Insta-friendly, as does the dubu sotbab tofu and vegetable rice pot, which doesn’t sound like much on paper, but which turns up gorgeously staged with piles of wilted greens, sliced nori, green beans and mushrooms on top of rice, all waiting to be mixed in.
That’s a nice touch, and one of many in this new incarnation of a handy little dining spot that has weathered so much change to this area over its two decades. It’s peculiar to think how many great, seemingly invincible restaurants have thrived but then vanished around Charlotte Street, Rathbone Street and down towards Goodge Street. Elena’s Etoile is long gone, and not even the OG Spaghetti House could survive the current climate in this little patch off theatreland, but Koba is somehow still kicking it. Will the decision to whip out those hot plates finally finish the place off? I don’t think so. The go galbi grilled mackerel is just as great as ever, and in fact it’s all the better for not having to endure my amateur antics.
But let’s go back to those desserts. Korean restaurants and the words “let’s linger over pudding” aren’t traditional friends, but at Koba I think it’s worth making time not just for that doughnut, but also for the vast scoop of fresh vanilla ice-cream that’s served with slices of sweet, fresh persimmon and a drenching of spiced, sticky syrup. Absolute joy.
Ripping up your own rulebook after 20-odd years is something only the bravest souls would ever dare to do, but I admire Koba’s chutzpah. More power to its elbow. Use these places or lose them to the death stampede of theatreland stalwarts. I’m helping out one doughnut at a time.

Asia-Pacific properties set to steal spotlight as mega-deals return in the Year of the Horse
Large institutional capital is flowing back into Asia-Pacific property, with offices, retail and hotels leading early recovery signs
As Hong Kong, mainland China and several other Asian markets usher in the Year of the Horse on Tuesday, the region’s commercial real estate sector is expected to draw increased cross-border capital, with certain segments set to outperform as mega-deals make a comeback, analysts said.
Asia-Pacific was set to be a focus among global investors, with data cited by global commercial real estate consultancy Colliers showing that capital raised for the region’s property markets had surged by 130 per cent since 2024.
This capital accounted for 11 per cent of global fundraising in the first three quarters of 2025, higher than the 6 per cent at the end of 2024 – a sign that more funds were likely to be deployed in the region, the consultancy noted.
The anticipated rise in capital allocation followed a year of steady investment activity.
Total commercial property investment reached US$182.9 billion in 2025, broadly in line with 2024 levels, according to global index and investment analytics provider MSCI.
“Volatility and uncertainty post-pandemic have stabilised, providing investors greater confidence in a market recovery,” said Theo Novak, managing director of capital markets and investment services in Asia-Pacific at Colliers.

Indonesians weigh peril and promise of life in Jakarta – the world’s most populous city
Extreme heat, floods, pollution, congested traffic and a tough job market are some of the major challenges faced by the city’s residents
Jakarta overtook Tokyo late last year under new UN criteria that also factor in the city’s wider metropolitan area, moving it to the top of the global rankings by population.
For its residents, the title reflects the harsh realities of daily life – perpetually congested traffic, overbearing heat, regular monsoon floods and a challenging job market.
For 22-year-old midwifery lecturer Fitri Sartika Rama, Jakarta is a place that straddles promise and the tough realities of life.
“It is a good place to live if you are young and focused on your job and making money,” she said. “Jakarta is OK for a short time, but I don’t want to live here in the long term.”
She calls it “a young person’s city” – a place that rewards ambition and speed, even as it exacts a heavy daily toll.

Sybiha, Anand discuss path to peace, Ukraine's recovery
That is according to Global Affairs Canada, Ukrinform reports.
"Minister Anand reaffirmed Canada's unwavering support for the people of Ukraine, as well as for its Minister Anand reiterated Canada's unwavering support for Ukraine's sovereignty, territorial integrity, and its people. She reaffirmed Canada's readiness to contribute to multilateral security guarantees for Ukraine as part of the Coalition of the Willing," the statement said.
Anand also reaffirmed Canada's commitment to strengthening economic pressure on Russia "to degrade its ability to wage war."
"The ministers discussed ongoing efforts toward a just and lasting peace, including developments in the peace process and Canada’s continued engagement on the return of prisoners of war, unlawfully detained civilians and illegally deported and forcibly transferred children," the statement said.
In addition, Anand reaffirmed Canada's commitment to supporting Ukraine's recovery and reconstruction, including energy security.
Earlier, speaking at the Munich Security Conference, Sybiha emphasized that real progress in peace negotiations was possible only with clear, legally binding, and robust security guarantees for Ukraine. These must include support from the United States, elements of an international military presence, EU membership, a strong Ukrainian army, and tough sanctions pressure on Russia.

Lithuanian Americans divided over Trump and US withdrawal from Europe

Anxiety over NATO’s future is palpable on both sides of the Atlantic. In the United States, Lithuanian Americans are also divided over President Donald Trump’s policies.
Members of the Lithuanian American community gathered in Washington to mark Lithuania’s February 16 Independence Day in advance, celebrating with the national anthem, traditional dances and steaming cabbage rolls. But alongside the festivities, conversations reflected unease about Lithuania’s security reminiscent of fears felt in the 20th century and largely forgotten in the 21st.
“It’s important that we, Lithuanian Americans, remember history and do not allow it to repeat itself,” said John Howes, chairman of the Lithuanian community in Washington.
Some attendees said they no longer recognise the America they grew up believing was the guarantor of freedom in Europe.
“Everything I grew up with – that America is an exceptional country, that there is freedom here and that we defend democracy – has collapsed,” said Diana Vidutis, a Lithuanian American.
Others questioned whether the United States remains a country governed by the rule of law, reflecting on Trump’s leadership.
“We all want him to remember that there is the Constitution, that he was elected to be president, and that he must uphold the spirit of the Constitution and be a president for all people,” said Lithuanian American Jūratė Landwehr.
Some expressed shock at what they described as Trump’s treatment of allies.
“We didn’t know he could destroy so much so quickly. I feel I have to apologise to the whole world for the shame this person has caused,” Vidutis said.
But not all Lithuanian Americans share this hostility to the current president.
Saulius Anužis, a longtime Republican who has observed the party’s evolution from Ronald Reagan to Trump, offered a different perspective. He urged people to distinguish between Trump’s rhetoric and his actions.
“Philosophically, we have to remember: he is not a conservative, he is a populist,” Anužis said, while acknowledging that the administration’s approach to NATO has shifted.
“They want Europeans to be in front, to go first, not Americans to go first,” he said. “Over the past 20 years, we have always sent American troops forward – to Lithuania, to Estonia or elsewhere. They were always first. I think that was a smart approach, maybe even the cheapest one, because the Russians did not want to attack Americans. But again, this comes back to Trump’s populism.”
“I don’t think anyone is leaving Europe. This is not a question of not being NATO members or not participating. We just don’t want, as Trump says, to be the first on that wall,” he added.
For many in the community, the possibility of an America stepping back from its active role in Europe represents a new reality, felt not only across the Atlantic, but also at home in the United States.

All eyes on Coles as it fights claims it misled customers on hundreds of products

All eyes on Coles as it fights claims it misled customers on hundreds of products
Claims that Coles misled shoppers with “illusory” discounts on a range of household goods will be tested in the Federal Court this week as the competition watchdog and the supermarket giant square off in a blockbuster case over pricing promotions.
The high-profile case, which will serve as a key test on practices across the industry, will put the microscope on whether promotions on hundreds of products were genuine or misleading, and could leave the supermarket facing hefty fines.
The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) lobbed the bombshell allegations against Coles and rival Woolworths in late 2024, alleging the two retailers misled consumers through pricing promotions that were actually higher, or the same as, the previous regular price.
Coles is defending the case, and has said many of its suppliers who were facing cost pressures asked it to push up prices during the period in question. Woolworths, which is facing similar allegations from the ACCC, is expected to face court in the coming months.
Coles will argue that the ACCC’s case relates to a period when the supermarket and its suppliers were experiencing “significant cost increases including, but not limited to, a surge in global commodity prices, and in the cost of packaging, freight, utilities and international shipping”.
Coles and its suppliers therefore reassessed the pricing of products, according to the firm’s concise response statement, with some products taken off its “Down Down” program and sold at non-promotional price “in substantial volumes” and for up to six weeks before later being returned to the discounted program.
“The non-promotional price was a genuine, undiscounted shelf price,” Coles has told the court. “The subsequent ‘down down’ program price was therefore a genuine discount from that shelf price. The discount was not illusory.”
The 10-day hearing, which will be streamed on the Federal Court’s YouTube channel from Monday morning, will be conducted by Justice Michael O’Bryan, who helped carry out a review of Australia’s competition laws a decade ago.
In the ACCC’s concise statement, it said Coles’ “Down, Down” program was marketed as a campaign designed to reduce the regular shelf price of commonly purchased products, “thereby offering customers predictable and reliable value” and reducing the cost of their shopping basket.
The ACCC alleges Coles increased the price of hundreds of products “for only a relatively short period of time” of up to 45 days, before placing them on the “Down Down” promotion, in most cases advertising that briefly higher price as the relevant comparison price.
“The false or misleading representations concerned the price of household staples at a time of increasing cost of living pressures, and were made in the context of a program which Coles specifically promoted as being designed to help consumers make long-term savings on the cost of their groceries,” the watchdog said. “By its conduct, Coles diminished the ability of consumers to make informed choices about their essential purchases.”
Fines can reach $50 million for each breach, as well as a donation of grocery products to various charities. The ACCC will argue Coles made 255 breaches including some products which were placed on the “Down Down” promotion more than once during the period in question.
For the sake of efficiency, the court hearings are likely to focus on 12 items in particular, including Karicare formula, packets of Arnott’s Shapes and a tub of Danone yoghurt.
Coles’ lead barrister for the case is John Sheahan KC, who has represented a range of large firms including ANZ when the Australian Securities and Investments Commission alleged the bank breached its continuous disclosure obligations during a $2.4 billion capital raising, as well as this masthead’s owner Nine, and journalists Nick McKenzie, Chris Masters, and David Wroe in their defence against defamation claims brought by former soldier Ben Roberts-Smith.
The ACCC’s barristers will be led by Garry Rich SC, who represented the ACCC in proceedings against Meta when the competition watchdog alleged the tech giant had contravened the Australian Consumer Law, as well in proceedings about ANZ’s acquisition of Suncorp bank in 2023.
The case comes as the government faces renewed pressure on the cost of living after inflation rose 3.8 per cent in the 12 months to December and the Reserve Bank lifted interest rates this month.
When the ACCC’s case was launched in September 2024, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese accused Coles and Woolworths of adding to inflation and higher interest rates while ACCC chair Gina Cass-Gottlieb said the companies had used their long-term promotions to convince shoppers that prices were being held steady when in reality they had pushed them up, alleging the discounts were “illusory”.
Coles chief executive Leah Weckert said in October that year that the supermarket chain took the matter very seriously. “All of our specials, discounts and programs like ‘Down Down’, we aim to genuinely provide genuine savings for our customers, and that goes to the heart of customer trust,” she said.

Man dead after spate of stabbings across Sydney
A man is dead and two are seriously injured after three separate stabbing incidents broke out across Sydney since midnight, sparking three police investigations.
Emergency services were called to a unit in Lethridge Park in Sydney’s north-west at 1.55pm on Sunday.
Paramedics treated a 34-year-old man with stab woulds, but he died at the scene. A 25-year-old man who had also suffered stab wounds was taken to hospital in a stable condition.
A spokesperson for NSW Police said it was too early to say if the men were known to each other, or what may have sparked the incident, but there is no ongoing risk to the public.
Police had attended two other stabbings in western Sydney in overnight.
Emergency services were called to Hoxton Park Road, in Hoxton Park, in the moments after midnight. Police officers discovered a man in his 20s with multiple stab wounds.
Paramedics treated the man for wounds to the chest and back. He was taken to Liverpool hospital in a serious but stable condition.
Shortly after, a group of men forced their way into a house on Oleander Road, in North St Marys, and stabbed an 18-year-old man in the leg before fleeing, police were told.
Paramedics treated the young man for a stab wound to the back of his left thigh, before rushing him to Westmead Hospital in a stable condition.
The three stabbings are being treated as separate incidents.

Former CNN anchor pleads not guilty to charges in Minnesota church protest
Don Lemon denies allegations he helped block worshippers during anti-immigration agency demonstration, says he acted as journalist, vows to fight ‘baseless charges’
ISTANBUL
Former CNN journalist Don Lemon pleaded not guilty to federal civil rights charges for an incident in which anti-immigration agency protesters interrupted a church service in the US state of Minnesota.
Lemon appeared before Magistrate Judge Douglas Micko in federal court Friday in St. Paul following his arrest last month in Los Angeles.
Micko previously declined to issue arrest warrants for Lemon and his producer, court filings showed, approving warrants for three others while finding no probable cause for the remaining five tied to the incident.
Speaking outside the federal courthouse, Lemon said, "I will not be intimidated, I will not back down, I will fight these baseless charges and I will not be silent."
He was taken into custody by federal agents last month in Los Angeles. He joined dozens of protesters opposing Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) who surged into the Cities Church in St. Paul, Minnesota, earlier in January, disrupting a worship service and sparking heated confrontations.
The US Justice Department alleged the nine defendants intimidated church congregants and pastors by blocking aisles and acting in a threatening manner during a disrupted St. Paul service, and claimed that Lemon physically obstructed people trying to leave.
The indictment cited Lemon’s own video, alleging he told viewers the goal was to disrupt operations, while Lemon maintained he attended as an independent journalist, posting footage of the protest and indicating he was there only to report, not participate.
Following a bail hearing in Los Angeles last month, Lemon, who was released on his own recognizance, and said he was arrested for “something that I’ve been doing for the last 30 years, and that is covering the news,” vowing to continue his work.

Obama calls Trump-shared racist video ‘deeply troubling,’ cites erosion of public decorum
Former US president responds to interview question about post depicting him, wife as apes, as Trump condemns, declines to apologize
ISTANBUL
Former US President Barack Obama on Saturday indirectly addressed a video shared by President Donald Trump depicting him and former first lady Michelle Obama as apes, calling it “deeply troubling.”
“Just days ago. Donald Trump put a picture of you, your face on an ape’s body.” Brian Tyler Cohen asked Obama about the image in an interview, and said it reflected a decline in public discourse. “How do we come back from the place that we have fallen into?”
“First of all, I think it’s important to recognize that the majority of the American people find this behavior deeply troubling,” responded Obama. “It is true that it gets attention. It’s true that it’s a distraction, but as I’m traveling around the country, as you’re traveling around the country, you meet people -- they still believe in decency, courtesy, kindness.”
Obama said there is a “sort of clown show” playing out on social media and on television. “What is true is there doesn’t seem to be any shame about this among people who used to feel like you had to have some sense of decorum and a sense of propriety and respect for the office. So, that’s been lost.”
The White House defended the post with spokesperson Karoline Leavitt initially calling the criticism "fake outrage" Hours later, the video was removed from the president's Truth Social account, with reports citing an anonymous official who blamed a staffer for the video being posted.
The apparently AI-generated video was set to the "Lion Sleeps Tonight," a song made famous by Disney's The Lion King film. In it, the faces of the Obamas are placed atop the bodies of apes, widely smiling, perpetuating several tropes made against Black people.
The post mocking America's first Black president was made during Black History Month, a time dedicated to honoring the milestones, contributions and history of Black Americans.
The video faced sweeping backlash, including from Trump’s fellow Republicans.
Trump later condemned the video, but refused to apologize. "Of course I do," Trump said when he was asked by a reporter on Air Force One if he condemns the racist parts of the video.
But asked if he would apologize, Trump remained defiant, blaming the post on a staffer who he said posted the video on his behalf without him seeing the part that included the racist depictions of the Obamas, maintaining that he "didn't make a mistake."

New world for users and brands as ads hit AI chatbots
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
PARIS - The introduction of advertisements and sponsored content in chatbots has spawned privacy concerns for artificial intelligence users as brands scramble to stay relevant in a fast-changing online environment.
ChatGPT developer OpenAI began showing ads in chatbot conversations for free and low-cost users to start balancing its hundreds of billions in spending commitments with new revenue sources.
It swiftly came in for mockery from rival Anthropic, which has staked its reputation on safety and data security.
Anthropic’s advertisement broadcast during last week’s Super Bowl showed a man asking advice from a conversational AI, which then shoehorns advertising copy for a dating site into its otherwise relevant response.
OpenAI boss Sam Altman shot back that the clip was “clearly dishonest”.
Beyond OpenAI, Microsoft has been running contextual ads and sponsored content in its Copilot AI assistant since 2023.
AI search engine Perplexity has been testing ads in the United States since 2024, while Google is also testing ads in the AI “overviews” its namesake search engine has been offering since 2025.
Data privacy
Google has repeatedly denied wanting to run ads in its Gemini chatbot, with Sir Demis Hassabis – head of the search giant’s DeepMind AI arm – saying that ads “have to be handled very carefully”.
“The most important thing” in AI is “trust in security and privacy, because you want to share potentially your life with that assistant”, he added.
OpenAI has sought to reassure users that ChatGPT’s responses will not be modified by the ads, which are shown alongside conversations rather than being integrated into them.
It has also promised not to sell user data to advertisers.
Mr Nate Elliott, an analyst with US data firm Emarketer, said that AI companies are “concerned that selling ads will scare away users”.
But, said Mr Jerome Malzac of AI consultancy Micropole, “when it’s free, you’re the product. It’s a risk we’re all more or less aware of already”.
“We accept it because we find value in it.”
If that proves true, advertisers will be delighted to surf the AI wave as it crashes over the world’s internet users.
Game changer
“It’s going to be a game changer for the entire industry,” said Mr Justin Seibert, head of Direct Online Marketing.
“We’re already seeing how high the conversion rates (interactions resulting in a purchase) are for people that are coming in from ChatGPT and the other LLMs (large language models),” he added.
HSBC bank analysts suggested in a report that AI assistants could account for up to 2 per cent of the online advertising market by 2030.
Many brands are already prioritising visibility on the new channel, including US supermarket chain Target and software maker Adobe.
Beyond buying a spot on users’ screens, companies are also pushing for their products to appear in chatbots’ organic responses.
The practice is known as GEO (generative engine optimisation) – an evolution of the search engine optimisation strategy during the era of Google’s dominance over the web.
“We identified 90 rules that can make sure the content you create is valued by AI and spread to the right places,” said Ms Joan Burkovic, head of French GEO start-up GetMint.
The company already claims 100 clients, including fashion brand Lacoste.
Micropole’s Mr Malzac highlighted techniques like including references to scientific papers, adding a “frequently asked questions” section to your website, and posting information that’s structured and regularly updated.
“If your brand isn’t referenced (by chatbots) it no longer exists” for some users, he warned. AFP

Saudi foreign minister says Gaza ceasefire should pave way for 2-state solution
Faisal bin Farhan tells Munich panel truce must restore stability, support reconstruction of Palestine
ISTANBUL
Saudi Arabian Foreign Minister Faisal bin Farhan said Saturday that the ceasefire in the Gaza Strip should be used to advance the establishment of an independent Palestinian state within a two-state framework.
Speaking at the Munich Security Conference, Farhan reaffirmed Saudi Arabia’s support for initiatives aimed at resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, saying the kingdom is acting out of the need to achieve peace.
Farhan said the Gaza Peace Board established under the second phase of the Gaza ceasefire, along with its 20-point framework, should first ensure an end to hostilities and then help advance the Palestinian people’s right to self-determination.
He said the ceasefire should be used to restore stability, rebuild and take real steps toward Palestinian statehood -- the only path to lasting regional peace.
- Syrian administration pursues constructive approach
Turning to Syria, Farhan said the country is pursuing a constructive approach toward minorities and ethnic groups while navigating a difficult transition after years of civil war.
He added that reconstruction would ultimately be led by Syrians, with regional and international actors playing supporting roles.
Bin Farhan also said an agreement with the SDF terror group is being advanced in a way that respects Kurdish rights, expressing confidence that continued government progress would bring broader gains.
Conflict breeds conflict
Addressing regional instability, the Saudi minister said conflicts tend to reinforce one another, citing how violence in Sudan has fueled tensions in neighboring areas and stressing the need to address root causes and promote coexistence.
He urged parties to move beyond narrow calculations that perpetuate unrest, arguing that current developments, particularly in Syria, demonstrate the possibility of a more stable path.
Bin Farhan added that ending clashes in Sudan between the army and the Rapid Support Forces could serve as a source of hope for the wider region.

Paratroopers show how they eliminate Russian forces on approaches to Myrnohrad
The brigade released a relevant video on Facebook, according to Ukrinform.
"Fighters of the 79th Separate Tavrian Air Assault Brigade of the 7th Rapid Response Corps continue to conduct search-and-strike operations in Myrnohrad and its outskirts," the statement reads.
The military noted that Russian forces persist in trying to outflank the city from the north in order to encircle Ukrainian Armed Forces units.
Thanks to coordinated actions by aerial reconnaissance and strike units, the enemy is mostly detected and neutralized in advance – on the approaches to the city, the brigade said.
"The enemy continues to use the tactic of small infantry groups – this is the only way the occupiers can achieve any advancement at all, but it critically exhausts Russian manpower," the statement said.
Attempts to break through into the city using armored vehicles were also recorded. However, they were quickly detected and destroyed, the brigade said.

Anthony Albanese dismisses AUKUS concerns, as Adelaide shipyard cost revealed
Unknown

At least $30 billion will be spent building a construction yard to eventually build nuclear submarines for Australia under the AUKUS agreement.
The federal government announced on Sunday it had pledged $3.9 billion as a down payment to secure the future of the Submarine Construction Yard in the northern Adelaide suburb of Osborne.
The government hopes the project will create 10,000 jobs in design and construction as well as up to 1,000 apprentices per year at an onsite training facility.
The staggering cost of the facility is laid bare by the sheer size of the footprint being designed.
Enough steel to make 17 Eiffel Towers as well as 710,000 cubic metres of structural concrete will be used in the construction of the 420 metre-long fabrication hall.
Prime Minister Anthony Albanese insists the $3.9 billion would "pale in comparison" to the $30 billion in investment associated with the construction of the yard.
"This infrastructure alone, $30 billion before a single widget on the submarine is built, is something that will set our economy up well and truly for the next decade and beyond," Albanese told reporters on Sunday.
The future of AUKUS has been under a cloud for months since the United States announced it would review the terms of the agreement.
But Albanese dismissed concerns that the promised shipyard would never see an AUKUS vessel.
"This is in the interest of the United States, in the interests of the UK and in the interests of Australia," he said.
The eye-watering price tag comes from an estimate provided by Australian Naval Infrastructure, the government's hand-picked company tasked with delivering the AUKUS facility.
As well as construction, the new yard will include capability for the testing and commission of the submarines.
An estimate for how long the yard will take to complete or whether the $30 billion figure will increase was not confirmed.
Defence has become a boom industry for South Australia with the country's first missile factory recently opening in Port Wakefield.
Osborne already hosts the existing facilities for Collins-class and Hunter-class subs.
"There were 1200 people working at Holden when it closed, 4000 will be required to construct this facility," Premier Peter Malinauskas said.

Trump, Netanyahu agree to intensify economic pressure on Iran, targeting oil sales to China: Report
Strategy pairs sanctions push with nuclear diplomacy, regional military buildup to keep strike option on table, say US officials
ISTANBUL
US President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu agreed to step up economic pressure on Iran, particularly targeting its oil sales to China, Axios reported Saturday.
The report, citing two American officials briefed on the issue, said the agreement occurred when Trump and Netanyahu met Wednesday at the White House.
"We agreed that we will go full force with maximum pressure against Iran, for example, regarding Iranian oil sales to China," according to a senior US official.
But they differed on how to achieve that goal, with Netanyahu telling Trump that a reliable agreement with Iran is unattainable and would likely be violated, while Trump said he believes a deal is possible.
“We’ll see if it’s possible -- let’s give it a shot,” Trump said, according to the US official.
American officials said Washington will pursue its maximum pressure campaign on Iran alongside nuclear negotiations and a continued military buildup in the Middle East to maintain the option of strikes if diplomatic efforts collapse.
With more than 80% of Iran’s oil exports going to China, any reduction in Chinese purchases would sharply intensify economic pressure on Tehran and could shift its calculations toward greater concessions on its nuclear program.
Additionally, an executive order signed by Trump recently allows the US to intensify economic pressure on Iran, including provisions enabling the heads of state and commerce departments to recommend tariffs of up to 25% on countries that maintain trade ties with Tehran.

Polish premier rejects ‘transactional’ world order at Munich Security Conference
Donald Tusk says Ukraine’s resistance to Russia’s aggression ‘defining moral test for Europe,’ reminder of principles West has taken for granted
WARSAW
Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk delivered a rebuttal Saturday to claims that Europe is in decline and NATO is obsolete, calling it “nonsense” at a ceremony honoring Ukraine at the Munich Security Conference.
Tusk said Ukraine’s resistance to Russian aggression was a defining moral test for Europe and the West. “I hear opinions that Europe is on the brink of collapse, that NATO is obsolete, that the time has come for a transactional policy and a concert of great powers,” said Tusk. “Nonsense. Those who think that everything can be bought should also remember that, according to this philosophy, anyone can be sold.”
His remarks come amid heightened tensions within the transatlantic alliance over Ukraine, NATO burden-sharing and future relations with Moscow, as well as a renewed debate about whether Europe must assume greater responsibility for its own security.
Speaking as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy accepted the Ewald von Kleist Prize on behalf of Ukraine, Tusk stressed that no formal recognition could adequately reflect the scale of Ukraine’s sacrifice.
“There is no prize good enough. Even the Nobel Prize would not be sufficient,” he said, adding that the rest of Europe should be grateful to Ukraine.
Tusk rejected arguments that the war in Ukraine was avoidable or the result of Western provocation. “The war was not a choice of Ukraine or of President Zelenskyy,” he said. “Their choice was to defend themselves.”
He also warned against a vision of international politics based on deals between great powers at the expense of smaller states. That worldview, he argued, undermines the moral foundations of the postwar Western order.
“A united West is the best political creation in human history,” Tusk said, cautioning that its values are under threat not only from external aggression but also from internal complacency and cynicism.
Tusk framed Ukraine’s resistance as a reminder of principles the West has taken for granted. “You know how terrifying a reality without principles is,” he said. “This is a Ukrainian lesson for all of us. Long live a free and independent Ukraine.”
“Long live a strong and united Europe,” he added.

Morning Briefing: Feb. 15, 2026
Anadolu’s recap of top stories from around the globe
ISTANBUL
Here’s a rundown of all the news you need to start your Sunday, including a partial government shutdown at the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) began after Congress failed to pass a funding bill; Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi emphasizing the importance of EU's participation in peace negotiations to end the Russia-Ukraine war; and the UK saying it confirms that Russian opposition figure Alexei Navalny died in prison in 2024 after being poisoned with the dart frog toxin.
TOP STORIES
- Partial government shutdown at US Homeland Security Department begins after funding lapse
A partial government shutdown at the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) began after Congress failed to pass a funding bill before the deadline.
The shutdown follows weeks of negotiations between Democrats and Republicans on reforms to immigration enforcement and oversight of agencies such as Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP).
DHS is now the only federal agency without funding for the remainder of fiscal year 2026, which continues through Sept. 30, while lawmakers have already approved spending bills covering the rest of the government since a record-long shutdown ended in November.
- China’s top diplomat urges EU to engage Russia over Ukraine war
Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi emphasized the importance of the EU's participation in peace negotiations to end the Russia-Ukraine war, urging Europe to be "not on menu" but the "table."
Asked what China could do to convince Russia to end its war on Ukraine at the Munich Security Conference, Wang said: "Europe should not watch this from the sidelines. Right here, in Munich last year at that time United States had started engagement with Russia, and Europe seemed to be left watching from the sidelines ... Europe has every right to participate in the negotiation in due course. ... Europe should not be on the menu, but should be at the table."
- UK says Russian opposition figure Alexei Navalny poisoned with dart frog toxin in prison
The British government said it has confirmed that Russian opposition figure Alexei Navalny’s death in prison in 2024 came after he was poisoned with the dart frog toxin.
"UK and partners are today exposing the tragic circumstances surrounding Alexei Navalny's death and have confirmed there was poison found in samples from his body," the Foreign Office said in a statement.
It noted that consistent, collaborative work has confirmed through laboratory testing that the deadly toxin found in the skin of Ecuador dart frogs (epibatidine) was found in samples from Navalny’s body and it likely resulted in his death.

Kristi Noem says she will ensure the ‘right people’ vote in midterms and elect ‘the right leaders’
The Homeland Security Secretary said her department was responsible for election security
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
Kristi Noem appeared to suggest the Department of Homeland Security was responsible for election security and said she would ensure the “right people” were voting to elect “the right leaders.”
“Elections is another one of those critical infrastructure responsibilities that I have as well, and I would say that many people believe that it may be one of the most important things that we need,” the DHS Secretary said at a press conference Friday.
“To make sure we trust is reliable, and that when it gets to election day that we've been proactive to make sure that we have the right people voting, electing the right leaders to lead this country through the days that we have – knowing that people can trust it.”
During the conference in Arizona, which has been one of the hotspots of national election fraud conspiracies, Noem said she had the authority to identify “vulnerabilities” in the election system and implement “mitigation measures” to ensure elections are “run correctly” at both a state and national level.
The comments sparked outrage online, with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer added: “This is Trump’s idea of democracy: leaders get to select their voters instead of the other way around.”
Homeland Dems added: “DHS talking about the ‘right people’ voting should alarm every American.After the President threatened to nationalize elections, the threat is unmistakable.”
Republicans Against Trump rote on X: “Saying the quiet part out loud.”
The Independent has contacted the DHS for clarification on Noem’s remarks.
It comes after the House passed the SAVE America Act Wednesday, a bill that would require Americans to provide proof of U.S. citizenship to register for federal elections through showing a photo ID.
If signed into law, the legislation would also force states to remove non-citizens from electoral rolls, though it must still pass the Senate, where some Republicans have indicated they may not support its passage.
On Friday Donald Trump appeared to suggest that he would sign an Executive Order forcing photo ID to be shown at elections, even if it was not congressionally approved. “There will be Voter I.D. for the Midterm Elections, whether approved by Congress or not!” Trump wrote on Truth Social.
The president’s words have led to critics' concerns over potential for tampering with the midterm elections in Novembers, and the potential for legal voters to be dismissed over technicalities with their documentation.
Noem pushed back on such suggestions on Friday, saying: “Each of the arguments laid out to criticize this bill are baseless speculation from the radical left because they want illegal aliens to vote in our elections.”
It comes after a bombshell report alleged that the DHS is in a state of “constant chaos” under Noem’s leadership, and that of her top adviser Corey Lewandowski.
The Wall Street Journal cited sources within the department who are highly critical of Noem and described her as a politician who has sought to “burnish her personal stardom at every turn.”
Noem has “staged a headline grabbing immigration crackdown while sidelining rivals and dissenters,” the newspaper states, noting the secretary’s penchant for posing in agency-branded flak jackets and caps and bearing guns as props “all with an eye to her style, with TV-ready hair and makeup.”
It reports that President Donald Trump has entertained calls to fire Noem and Lewandowski amid discontent about their management of the department, although he has so far refrained from doing so.

Police find man on island after bizarre museum heist

Police find man on island after bizarre museum heist
A man has been charged over a bizarre museum heist in which he allegedly took priceless Egyptian artefacts, before attempting to flee to Russell Island.
Police charged the 52-year-old, who had no fixed address, with multiple offences after he allegedly smashed a window of the Abbey Museum of Art and Archaeology on Friday at 3am, and took multiple artefacts.
On Saturday afternoon, police found a Toyota HiAce camper in the car park of the Redland Bay ferry terminal.
“Detectives found all of the stolen Egyptian artefacts except a wooden cat sculpture,” police said, adding that the items were intact, with only minor damage.
A few hours later, police found the 52-year-old on Russell Island, where they transported him to the Cleveland watchhouse.
Police say he was found in possession of the last missing artefact.
Detective Inspector David Harbison said police did not suspect the man was attempting to sell the items, but would not elaborate specifically on the motive.
He said the man was travelling down the coastline, and believed the alleged theft was opportunistic.
“It was a concerning offence for us, the property is priceless, it’s worth a lot of money, and we naturally came to the conclusion that perhaps it was stolen by organised criminals,” he said.
“It became apparent fairly quickly that this wasn’t an organised offence, it was actually quite amateurish.”
Harbison said it was not often that items like that would be taken, and if artefacts were stolen, it was usually through organised criminals.
In a statement online, the museum expressed its heartfelt thanks to police for their response throughout the investigation.
“Their dedication has made the recovery of these treasured objects possible. We are also deeply grateful to the media for their support and responsible coverage, which helped raise awareness and ensured these items could not be quietly moved,” the statement read.
“Most importantly, we thank our extraordinary staff, volunteers, and the wider Abbey Museum community. The way everyone has rallied together with compassion and determination has allowed the museum to keep moving forward positively and continue welcoming visitors during a difficult time.
“While we are relieved and grateful to have the artefacts returned, they cannot immediately go back on display. Each piece must first undergo professional assessment and conservation to protect its long-term future.
“The exhibition area also sustained damage and will require careful repair and rebuilding before the objects can safely return to display.
“These objects belong to the shared story of our community, and preserving them properly is our highest priority. Although this process will take time, it gives us an opportunity to rebuild the space thoughtfully and respectfully.”
The museum covers a broad range of history, including prehistoric Europe, the Bronze and Iron Ages, and the Roman Empire, and houses artefacts from across the globe, including from Ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, Israel, and Persia.
The 52-year-old was charged over the alleged break-in, as well as wilful damage.
He was also charged with trespassing and assault occasioning bodily harm over an incident at a Hastings Street, Noosa, property on February 12.
Police say the man was trespassing on the property and assaulted a resident when asked to leave.
The man is scheduled to appear in the Cleveland Magistrates Court on Monday.

ASTANA, February 15. /TASS/. Relations between Russia and Kazakhstan reached an unprecedentedly high level following the state visit of President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev to Moscow in November 2025, Russia’s ambassador to Astana Alexey Borodavkin said in an interview with TASS.
"Our cooperation with Kazakhstan at the level of the foreign ministries fully corresponds to the spirit of Russian-Kazakh relations, which, as is known, in November of last year reached a new, unprecedentedly high level of comprehensive strategic partnership and alliance following the historic state visit of President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev to Russia," he said.
The ambassador also added that the procedure for opening another Russian consulate general in Kazakhstan — in the Caspian city of Aktau in the west of the republic — is at its final stage.
"The procedure for opening the Consulate General of Russia in the city of Aktau is at its final stage. It will make it possible to expand Russia’s diplomatic and consular presence in fraternal Kazakhstan," the ambassador said.
Tokayev paid a state visit to Russia on November 11-12, 2025. During the visit, he held talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin, and a declaration was signed on elevating bilateral interstate relations to the level of a comprehensive strategic partnership and alliance.

Ukrainian drones strike oil depot in Russia's Krasnodar Krai, local authorities claim
Editor's note: This is a developing story and is being updated.
Ukrainian drones struck several targets throughout southern Russia's Krasnodar Krai overnight on Feb. 14-15, including an oil depot, Governor Veniamin Kondratyev said.
The Oil depot was struck in the coastal village of Volna alongside a warehouse and shipping terminal, he claimed.
Two people were injured in the Russian village, and several fires broke out, leading to an emergency response comprised of 126 individuals.
Volna is located just east of Crimea's Kerch Peninsula and about 325 kilometers (200 miles) from Ukrainian-controlled territory near Nikopol.
In Sochi, a house was damaged by fallen debris, Kondratyev said, adding that windows were shattered.
Air raid sirens in the city sounded several hours earlier in response to the attack, Telegram news channel Astra reported.
The several-hour-long drone attack exhausted air defense systems in Krasnodar Krai, with explosions heard in several settlements across the region, Telegram news channel Exilenova+ reported.
Kyiv considers energy infrastructure to be a military target as they directly fund Russia's war. Ukraine regularly strikes military infrastructure deep within Russia in an effort to diminish Moscow's fighting power as the Kremlin continues to wage its war against Ukraine.
An oil terminal near the village of Volna was also struck on Jan. 21, sparking a blaze, killing three people and injuring eight others, Kondratyev and independent media previously reported.
On Feb. 12, Ukraine struck a Russian 55Zh6U "Nebo-U" long-range radar station, estimated to be worth approximately $100 million, near Yevpatoriia in occupied Crimea, the General Staff of Ukraine’s Armed Forces later reported on Feb. 13.
The Alpha unit of Ukraine's Security Service (SBU) destroyed half of Russia's stockpile of the coveted Pantsir air defense system with the "systemic destruction" of the system, the SBU announced Feb. 14.

Sybiha, Kallas discuss tougher sanctions on Russia, Ukraine's path to EU
Sybiha shared details of the meeting in a post on social media platform X, Ukrinform reports.
"I had a very insightful meeting with Kaja Kallas focused on three key topics," Sybiha said.
In particular, the parties discussed peace efforts and how to speed them up with the engagement of the U.S. and the EU.
They also addressed strengthening sanctions pressure on Russia, including a swift adoption of the strong 20th package, maritime services ban for Russia's shadow fleet, and an entry ban for participants of Russian aggression against Ukraine.
Another key issue, Sybiha said, was "Ukraine's EU membership as one of the key security guarantees for our country and the entire Europe." Sybiha said Ukraine was ready to complete all necessary work as soon as possible.
The minister added that the sides coordinated further steps ahead of the fourth anniversary of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
Earlier, speaking at the Munich Security Conference, Sybiha emphasized that real progress in peace negotiations was possible only with clear, legally binding, and robust security guarantees for Ukraine. These must include support from the United States, elements of an international military presence, EU membership, a strong Ukrainian army, and tough sanctions pressure on Russia.

MOSCOW, February 15. /TASS/. The American side understands that any forceful provocation by Kiev narrows the possibilities in negotiations on the Ukrainian settlement, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Galuzin said in an interview with TASS.
"Those in Kiev should understand that any such action narrows the opportunities for resolving the conflict through political and diplomatic means. As far as we can judge, representatives of US President Donald Trump’s team, who have been tasked with the difficult job of compelling the Kiev regime toward peace, are also aware of this," he noted.
The first round of trilateral security consultations involving Russia, Ukraine, and the United States took place on January 23-24 in Abu Dhabi. A second round of trilateral talks was held there on February 4-5.

Independent Spirit Awards celebrate indie movies and TV in Los Angeles
The Film Independent Spirit Awards shine a spotlight on indie movies and TV as stars like Ethan Hawke, Rose Byrne, and Keke Palmer compete for prizes
- Bookmark
Ethan Hawke,Rose Byrne and Keke Palmer are just a few of the actors up for prizes at the Film Independent Spirit Awards on Sunday in Los Angeles. Comedian and “Saturday Night Live” veteran Ego Nwodim is hosting the celebration of independent film and television, which will be livestreamed on YouTube starting at 5 p.m. ET.
Top nominees going into the 41st edition of the show include Ira Sachs’ “Peter Hujar’s Day,” which recreates an interview with the 1970s photographer, played by Ben Whishaw; Clint Bentley’s lyrical Denis Johnson adaptation “Train Dreams,” with Joel Edgerton; and Eva Victor’s “Sorry, Baby,” about life after an assault.
The show, which serves as a fundraiser for Film Independent’s year-round programs, is being held at the Hollywood Palladium for the first time, as its longtime beachside perch in Santa Monica undergoes renovations.
The awards sometimes overlap significantly with major Oscar contenders and winners, as it did with “Anora,” and “Everything Everywhere All At Once,” and sometimes not. Organizers limit eligibility to productions with budgets less than $30 million, meaning more expensive films like “One Battle After Another” are not in the running.
Byrne is one of the few actors nominated for both a Spirit Award and an Oscar, for her performance as a mother on the edge in Mary Bronstein’s “If I Had Legs I’d Kick You.” In the lead performance category, she’s up against the likes of Edgerton (“Train Dreams”), Dylan O’Brien (“Twinless”), Palmer (“One of Them Days”), Tessa Thompson (“Hedda”) and Whishaw. The organization switched to gender-neutral acting categories in 2022.
Supporting performance nominees include Naomi Ackie (“Sorry, Baby”), Zoey Deutch (“Nouvelle Vague”), Kirsten Dunst (“Roofman”), Nina Hoss (“Hedda”) and Archie Madekwe (“Lurker”).
Films nominated in the international category include “Sirāt,”“The Secret Agent” and “On Becoming a Guinea Fowl.” “Come See Me in the Good Light,” “My Undesirable Friends: Part I — Last Air in Moscow” and “The Perfect Neighbor” are also up for the documentary prize.
Hawke, who is nominated for an Oscar for “Blue Moon,” is up for a Spirit Award for his leading performance in the television series “The Lowdown,” where other nominees include Seth Rogen for “The Studio,” Stephen Graham for “Adolescence” and Noah Wyle for “The Pitt.”

‘First feline’ Larry marks 15 years as Britain’s political top cat
Larry the cat is marking 15 years as Britain’s Chief Mouser at 10 Downing Street, a symbol of stability in turbulent political times
- Bookmark
In turbulent political times, stability comes with four legs, whiskers and a fondness for napping.
Larry the cat celebrates 15 years on Sunday as the British government’s official rodent-catcher and unofficial first feline, a reassuring presence who has served under six prime ministers. Sometimes it seems like they have served under him.
“Larry the cat’s approval ratings will be very high,” said Philip Howell, a Cambridge University professor who has studied the history of human-animal relations. “And prime ministers tend not to hit those numbers.
"He represents stability, and that’s at a premium."
The gray-and-white tabby’s rags-to-riches story has taken him from stray on the streets to Britain’s seat of power, 10 Downing St., where he bears the official title Chief Mouser to the Cabinet Office.
Adopted from London’s Battersea Dogs and Cats Home by then-Prime Minister David Cameron, Larry entered Downing Street on Feb. 15, 2011. According to a profile on the U.K. government website, his duties include “greeting guests to the house, inspecting security defenses and testing antique furniture for napping quality.”
Larry roams freely and has a knack for upstaging world leaders arriving at 10 Downing St.’s famous black door, to the delight of news photographers.
“He’s great at photo-bombing,” said Justin Ng, a freelance photographer who has come to know Larry well over the years. “If there’s a foreign leader that’s about to visit then we know he’ll just come out at the exact moment that meet-and-greet is about to happen.”
Larry has met many world leaders, who sometimes have to step around or over him. It has been observed that he is largely unfriendly to men, though he took a liking to former U.S. President Barack Obama, and he drew a smile from President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on one of the Ukrainian leader’s visits to London.
When U.S. President Donald Trump visited in 2019, Larry crashed the official doorstep photo and then took a nap under the Beast, the president’s armored car.
Reports of Larry’s rodent-catching skills vary, though he has been photographed snagging the occasional mouse – and, once, a pigeon, which escaped.
“He’s more of a lover than a fighter,” Ng said. “He’s very good at what he does: lounging around and basically showing people that he’s very nonchalant.”
Larry has cohabited, sometimes uneasily, with prime ministerial pets including Boris Johnson’s Jack Russell cross Dilyn and Rishi Sunak’s Labrador retriever Nova. He is kept well away from current Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s family cats, JoJo and Prince, who inhabit the private family quarters while Larry rules the working areas of Downing Street.
He had a volatile relationship with Palmerston, diplomatic top cat at the Foreign Office across the street from No. 10. The pair were caught tussling several times before Palmerston retired in 2020. Palmerston died this month in Bermuda, where he was serving as “feline relations consultant” to the governor.
Meanwhile, Larry abides. He is 18 or 19, and has slowed down a bit, but continues to patrol his turf and to sleep on a window ledge above a radiator just inside the No. 10 door.
He is British soft power in feline form, and woe betide any prime minister who got rid of him.
“A cat-hating PM, that seems to me to be political suicide,” said Howell.
He said Larry’s status as nonpartisan “official pet” sets him apart from the American presidential pets – most often dogs – that U.S. leaders have sometimes deployed to soften their image.
“The fact that cats are less tractable is part of the charm, too,” Howell said. “He’s sort of whimsically not partisan in a political sense, but he tends to take to some people and not to others and he won’t necessarily sit where you want him to sit and pose where you want him to pose.
“There is a certain kind of unruliness about Larry which I think would endear him, certainly, to Brits.”

Hungarians have had enough of Viktor Orbán. But Trump’s tailwind could save his skin

After 16 years of uninterrupted power, Viktor Orbán is facing his biggest electoral challenge. For years Hungary’s prime minister has spun weak policy performance as success. The rise of a rival, Péter Magyar, and the opposition Tisza party has exposed the limits of that strategy.
The economy is stagnating, despite repeated promises of a long-awaited takeoff. Over the past decade and a half, Hungary has slipped from being one of central and eastern Europe’s strongest performers to one of its weakest. Public services, from healthcare to transport, are widely seen as neglected, and Policy Solutions surveys show that voters have noticed. Hungary is not alone in facing a cost of living crisis, but comparisons offer little consolation to voters who were assured that Orbán’s model would deliver exceptional results.
Tisza has unified a previously fragmented opposition and turned the April 12 parliamentary election into a genuine contest. At this stage, nearly half of Hungarians say they want a change of government.
Yet preference is not the same as confidence. Many voters still doubt that change is within reach. This tension between dissatisfaction with the status quo and nervousness about the feasibility of political change has created an unpredictable electoral landscape. Frustration with Orbán may not be sufficient to overcome fear of the unknown.
Orbán also has something his rival can’t match: he has a tailwind from Washington. While he may have little to shout about at home, Orbán has gained new momentum in Donald Trump’s volatile second term.
Orbán’s campaign narrative now rests on the boast that he is simultaneously on good terms with the leaders of the United States, Russia and China. In a world of strongmen, Hungary needs a leader who can sit at their table.
Expect Trump’s name to feature increasingly in the campaign as Orbán seeks to reinforce the claim that he – and only he – has the ear of the world’s most powerful leaders. His recent White House audience was proof of international relevance and this weekend’s visit of Marco Rubio to Budapest will only reinforce that narrative.
What is striking about this campaign is that Fidesz, Orbán’s party, is no longer asking voters to reward it for a record of good governance. Rather, it is warning people that however dissatisfied they may be, Hungary could be a lot worse off. The aim is not to mobilise hope, but to suppress it – to make sure voters see the ballot box not as an opportunity for change, but as a risk.
“The safe choice”, as the Fidesz party slogan goes, is designed to respond to an increasingly anxious mood in an uncertain and dangerous world. With war in Europe, migration, culture wars and geopolitical upheaval, the message runs, this is an age of danger, and change at the top is a gamble the country cannot afford.
Everything Orbán presents as dangerous – European military support for Ukraine, migrants, expanding LGBTQ+ rights – is lumped together as the “Brussels path”. By contrast, peace, a migration-free country and the rejection of “gender ideology” are framed as the uniquely “Hungarian path”. The choice, voters are told, is civilisational, a message that echoes the Trump administration’s warning about European liberal democracy.
Trump’s scepticism towards Ukraine and his readiness to blame Kyiv for the war with Russia also closely align with Orbán’s position. This has emboldened Orbán, allowing him to be even softer on Russia and harsher on Ukraine, while presenting this stance as vindicated by global power shifts.
Two strategies now stand in stark opposition. Orbán derives his political relevance from the international environment: from global instability, from war and from the claim that only he can navigate this dangerous world. Magyar, by contrast, grounds his message in domestic reality: the cost of living, failing public services and the sense that the state delivers far less than it should.
Orbán’s worldview underpins this contrast. For him, international treaties and multilateral organisations matter less and less in a new global order defined by power and bilateral deals. What count now, he argues, are personal relationships and strength.
Despite Tisza leading in independent and opposition-leaning polls (while trailing in Fidesz-friendly polling), Orbán retains a credible path to victory. This is partly due to the structural advantages embedded in Hungary’s electoral system, which Fidesz designed in 2010. Biases built into the constituency map – with Fidesz-leaning districts on average smaller than those favouring the opposition – mean that the governing party can still win a parliamentary majority even if it narrowly loses the popular vote. To overcome this, Tisza would probably need a lead of at least five percentage points nationally – a high bar in an uneven playing field.
The greatest opportunity for Tisza lies in convincing those disappointed with the government that it can offer a credible alternative and tangible improvements in everyday life. Orbán wants voters to believe that change itself is the greatest danger. Magyar wants them to believe that stagnation is. For the first time in 16 years, the outcome is genuinely open. And that uncertainty alone marks a profound break with Hungary’s political past.

Man under ASIC investigation allowed to leave Australia to visit Mecca

Man under ASIC investigation allowed to leave Australia to visit Mecca
An unwell finance guru with “cognitive issues” who received $31 million in allegedly illegal commissions from two collapsed investment funds will be allowed to travel to Dubai and Mecca after his travel ban was temporarily lifted.
Osama Saad got the good news about his travel ban being varied after a hearing at the Federal Court on Friday, but not before a judge demanded to see him in person because if he was “well enough to travel he’s well enough to attend court”.
The Australian Securities and Investments Commission initially opposed the request by Saad, who is the subject of a major investigation following the $1 billion collapse of the Shield Master Fund and the First Guardian Master Fund in 2024 and 2025 which wiped out the super savings of 12,000 people.
The former financial planner operated a website that is alleged to have fed people into the scheme in return for payments.
The talented amateur footballer has been subject to asset freezing orders and travel restraints since last July as part of the investigation. Those orders followed an earlier request by Saad to visit Dubai and Mecca for religious reasons, which was denied.
ASIC took action against Saad to freeze his assets in February 2025 as part of its investigation into whether he and others broke the law by accepting the payments.
Despite those orders, he has not been charged with any offence and there is a chance that ASIC’s investigation will not lead to any action against the financial planner, whose businesses directed more than 1000 clients into the funds.
During a hearing on Friday, ASIC had initially opposed Saad’s request to travel, claiming there was a real risk he would not return to face further questioning in April as part of its investigation.
ASIC’s counsel, St John Hibble, SC, told the court that another person under investigation for receiving more than $30 million in commissions for promoting the Shield and First Guardian funds to investors – Melbourne cafe owner and marketing guru Rashid Alshakshir – had left the country and not returned to Australia after ASIC’s request for a travel ban was denied.
“For example, Mr [Rashid] Alshakshir, where ASIC was unsuccessful in getting a travel restraint order extended, he’s left the country and not returned despite alleging that he would. And so ASIC can’t be criticised for being concerned about these types of issues in this investigation.”
This masthead is not suggesting Alshakshir has broken any laws in either receiving the payments or by travelling overseas, just that he is subject to the ASIC investigation and his travel was used by the corporate watchdog to advance its claims in court.
Saad and Alshakshir have told the court previously that they believe the payments they received were for marketing services and entirely legal.
Justice Mark Moshinsky raised concerns about the length of Saad’s existing travel ban and ASIC’s lack of evidence that Saad would not return.
Moshinsky suggested that to allay ASIC’s concerns Saad could provide the court with a formal undertaking in person on Friday afternoon that he would return to the country on a specified date and provide the court and ASIC with his travel itinerary once he had bought the tickets.
Saad’s legal team initially resisted this request, telling the court he was not well enough to attend court but would instead provide a statement to the court.
“Mr Saad has a serious medical condition. He strongly prefers not to come to court. He would certainly give an affidavit, which includes an undertaking,” solicitor Stanley Drummond told the court.
Moshinsky instead insisted Saad attend in person, saying: “If he’s well enough to travel overseas, I would think he’s well enough to come to court.”
Saad appeared in court on Friday and provided the undertaking in person.
The actual nature of Saad’s illness remains unclear, but earlier Drummond told the court: “Over the past few months, Sam has been quite forgetful and has been complaining of significant cognitive issues.”
Despite his health problems, Saad agreed to attend court in person on Friday afternoon to provide a formal undertaking that he would return to Australia on a specific date.
ASIC’s counsel, Hibble, told the court he would not oppose orders allowing Saad to travel to Mecca for two weeks if he provided the undertaking.
Saad’s other request, to withdraw $15,000 from a bank account to fund the trip, was denied by the court due to concerns it would reduce the amount of money left over for victims of the two fund collapses.
Moshinsky suggested Saad could be gifted the cash he needed to travel.

A Kurdish-majority neighborhood in Syria recovers from clashes with hope for the future

A Kurdish-majority neighborhood in Syria recovers from clashes with hope for the future
A month after violent clashes in a Kurdish-majority neighborhood in Syria's Aleppo, tens of thousands of residents have returned
- Bookmark
A month after clashes rocked a Kurdish-majority neighborhood in Syria ’s second-largest city of Aleppo, most of the tens of thousands of residents who fled the fighting between government forces and the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces have returned — an unusually quick turnaround in a country where conflict has left many displaced for years.
“Ninety percent of the people have come back,” Aaliya Jaafar, a Kurdish resident of the Sheikh Maqsoud neighborhood who runs a hair salon, said Saturday. “And they didn’t take long. This was maybe the shortest displacement in Syria."
Her family only briefly left their house when government forces launched a drone strike on a lot next door where weapons were stored, setting off explosions.
The Associated Press visited the community that was briefly at the center of Syria's fragile transition from years of civil war as the new government tries to assert control over the country and gain the trust of minority groups anxious about their security.
Lessons learned
The clashes broke out Jan. 6 in the predominantly Kurdish neighborhoods of Sheikh Maqsoud, Achrafieh and Bani Zaid after the government and the SDF reached an impasse in talks on how to merge Syria’s largest remaining armed group into the national army. Security forces captured the neighborhoods after several days of intense fighting during which at least 23 people were killed and more than 140,000 people displaced.
However, Syria's new government took measures to avoid civilians being harmed, unlike during previous outbreaks of violence between its forces and other groups on the coast and in the southern province of Sweida, during which hundreds of civilians from the Alawite and Druze religious minorities were killed in sectarian revenge attacks.
Before entering the contested Aleppo neighborhoods, the Syrian army opened corridors for civilians to flee.
Ali Sheikh Ahmad, a former member of the SDF-affiliated local police force who runs a secondhand clothing shop in Sheikh Maqsoud, was among those who left. He and his family returned a few days after the fighting stopped.
At first, he said, residents were afraid of revenge attacks after Kurdish forces withdrew and handed over the neighborhood to government forces. But that has not happened. A ceasefire agreement between Damascus and the SDF has been holding, and the two sides have made progress toward political and military integration.
“We didn’t have any serious problems like what happened on the coast or in Sweida,” Sheikh Ahmad said. The new security forces “treated us well,” and residents’ fears began to dissipate.
Jaafar agreed that residents had been afraid at first but that government forces “didn’t harm anyone, to be honest, and they imposed security, so people were reassured.”
The neighborhood’s shops have since reopened and traffic moves normally, but the checkpoint at the neighborhood's entrance is now manned by government forces instead of Kurdish fighters.
Residents, both Kurds and Arabs, chatted with neighbors along the street. An Arab man who said he was named Saddam after the late Iraqi dictator — known for oppressing the Kurds — smiled as his son and a group of Kurdish children played with a dirty but friendly orange kitten.
Other children played with surgical staplers from a neighborhood hospital that was targeted during the recent fighting, holding them like toy guns. The government accused the SDF of taking over the hospital and using it as a military site, while the SDF said it was sheltering civilians.
One boy, looking pleased with himself, emerged from an alleyway carrying the remnant of an artillery shell.
Economic woes remain
On Friday, SDF leader Mazloum Abdi said he had held a “very productive meeting” with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Syrian Foreign Minister Asaad al-Shibani on the sidelines of a security conference in Munich to discuss progress made on the integration agreement.
While the security situation is calm, residents said their economic plight has worsened. Many previously relied on jobs with the SDF-affiliated local authorities, who are no longer in charge. And small businesses suffered after the clashes drove away customers and interrupted electricity and other services.
“The economic situation has really deteriorated," Jaafar said. "For more than a month, we've barely worked at all.”
Others are taking a longer view. Sheikh Ahmad said he hopes that if the ceasefire remains in place and the political situation stabilizes, he will be able to return to his original home in the town of Afrin near the border with Turkey, which his family fled during a 2018 Turkish offensive against Kurdish forces.
Like many Syrians. Sheikh Ahmad has been displaced multiple times since mass protests against the government of then-President Bashar Assad spiraled into a brutal 14-year civil war.
Assad was ousted in November 2024 in an insurgent offensive, but the country has continued to see sporadic outbreaks of violence, and the new government has struggled to win the trust of religious and ethnic minorities.
Hopes for reconciliation
Last month, interim President Ahmad al-Sharaa issued a decree strengthening the rights of Syria's Kurdish minority, including recognizing Kurdish as a national language along with Arabic and adopting Nowruz, a traditional celebration of spring and renewal marked by Kurds around the region, as an official holiday. Kurds make up about 10% of Syria's population.
The decree also restored the citizenship of tens of thousands of Kurds in northeastern al-Hasakeh province after they were stripped of it during the 1962 census
Sheikh Ahmad said he was encouraged by al-Sharaa's attempts to reassure the Kurds that they are equal citizens and hopes to see more than tolerance among Syria's different communities.
“We want something better than that. We want people to love each other. We've had enough of wars after 15 years. It's enough,” he said.

MOSCOW, February 15. /TASS/. Baku could make a gesture of goodwill in the spirit of good neighborly relations by releasing 11 Russian citizens, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Galuzin said in an interview with TASS.
"Such a decision by Baku regarding our citizens (the release of 11 Russians - TASS) could become a gesture of goodwill in the spirit of good neighborliness and contribute to the further strengthening of multifaceted cooperation between our countries," he said.
"The earliest possible release of the Russians is our unconditional priority," he said, adding "our embassy remains in close contact both with them and with their relatives."
The Russian citizens were detained by Azerbaijani law enforcement authorities in late June 2025. On July 1, the Sabail District Court ordered their pretrial detention for a period of four months. On October 28, a decision by the Khatai District Court extended the detention for an additional three months. The Russian nationals are accused of drug trafficking and cyber fraud.

Allan releases CFMEU letter to bolster claims the government is acting on rogue union

Allan releases CFMEU letter as opposition says its royal commission will include government culpability
A referral letter sent from Premier Jacinta Allan to the state’s corruption watchdog has been released publicly for the first time, as the government seeks to cast claims of a $15 billion corruption blowout on the Big Build as an attack on workers.
At the same time the opposition released the terms of reference for the Royal Commission it plans to call into misconduct within the CFMEU, which includes delving into the flow of taxpayer funds to organised criminals and the government’s culpability. A new construction sector watchdog, Construction Enforcement Victoria, would also be set up under Liberal leader Jess Wilson’s plan.
A report last week into the CFMEU, by integrity expert Geoffrey Watson, alleged serious criminal behaviour, including drug distribution and sexual exploitation, on the state’s Big Build program, while a redacted section criticised the government and authorities for failing to address the problem.
Allan responded to the report and these criticisms by repeatedly stating that she has referred all allegations of misconduct that came her way to relevant authorities.
She also has said she only became aware the behaviour was systemic following this masthead’s Building Bad investigation in July 2024, when she referred matters to the Independent Broad-based Anti-corruption Commission.
The government provided a letter to the media on Sunday after requests for it to be released amid criticisms that the government failed to act on graft on taxpayer funded projects.
“I am concerned to ensure that any allegations of serious corruption that are within the remit of IBAC, are identified, investigated and appropriate action taken by IBAC,” says the letter dated July 14, 2024 – a day after the Building Bad media investigation was published.
“Given these serious allegations relate to major projects commissioned by the Victorian Government, I request that IBAC use its investigatory powers to assess, investigate and take action where there is any serious corrupt conduct within IBAC’s jurisdiction.”
Allan said in the letter the allegations included that a CFMEU health and safety official was using a car assigned for their job for “bikie gang activities” and that a person used a car from a state government project to drive to Footscray Hospital while bleeding from a gunshot wound.
Other allegations she outlined were that bikie gang members and associates were employed in union delegate roles and influencing the operations of contractors on major projects, that CFMEU officials were advising companies to hire bikie-controlled subcontractors or retain standover men.
Finally, the premier raised the allegation that the CFMEU was using its influence to ensure work was awarded to companies that had enterprise or labour hire agreements backed by the union.
“Accordingly, I am referring these matters to IBAC for investigation,” the letter says.
IBAC does not comment on investigations underway and told a parliamentary inquiry last year under its rules it could not confirm whether a probe was underway as a result of this letter.
Allan’s government has been under increasing pressure to address ongoing issues within the CFMEU, particularly from the opposition benches which has promised to crack down on the militant union and curb its influence.
On Sunday, Opposition Leader Jess Wilson unveiled her terms of reference for a Royal Commission into CFMEU misconduct a Coalition government would hold if elected.
These include an investigation into the “nature, extent, and impact of misconduct involving the CFMEU on Victorian Government projects, particularly the quantum of the cost to taxpayers”.
Other terms include the flow of funds from these projects, particularly towards organised crime and investigating connections between CFMEU misconduct and departmental management practices.
“We are announcing a Royal Commission to get to the bottom of this $15 billion dirty deal activity that’s been occurring on Victorian government work sites,” Wilson said.
“And we have a commitment to Victorian taxpayers, to every criminal out there that has made money off Victorian taxpayers, to every bikie that’s made money off Victorian taxpayers, to any associated organisation that has made money off Victorian taxpayers, we are going to get you.
Terms of reference for planned Liberals-Nationals Royal Commission into CFMEU misconduct
- Investigating the true extent of the cost to Victorian taxpayers of misconduct on Victorian major projects.
- The flow of taxpayer funds to organised criminals, outlaw motorcycle gangs and political parties, arising from CFMEU misconduct on Victorian Government projects.
- Examining the Victorian Labor Government’s culpability, including what Premier Jacinta Allan and Labor Ministers knew and when.
- Recommending measures to prevent similar misconduct occurring in the future, including by reviewing the effectiveness of current legislation and regulatory frameworks.
Wilson decried how long it had taken the Allan government to properly respond to the allegation aired by this masthead 20 months ago.
“After days of deflection and denial by Premier Allan, Victorians still don’t have the straight answers they deserve,” Wilson said.
“Only a Royal Commission will get to the bottom of this shameful saga, identify how much taxpayer money has been rorted and ensure corruption on this scale is never allowed to occur again.”
Commissioner Victoria Elliott has already asked Allan for powers to follow taxpayer dollars to subcontractors not directly employed by government, an area where much of the alleged behaviour takes place.
Since 2022, IBAC has also asked the government to lower the threshold needed to launch investigations.
Last week, Watson provided a rough estimate that the cost of corruption on Big Build worksites had added $15 billion to the total cost of the state’s infrastructure program, a figure Fair Work Commission chief Murray Furlong said was in line with what he’d been told by government officials.
CFMEU administrator Mark Irving excluded this claim from the final version of Watson’s report, arguing it was untested, but released the redacted comments to a Queensland inquiry following questions from this masthead about their removal.
Allan has dismissed the figure as unsubstantiated, a sentiment echoed by a government spokesperson on Sunday.
“These claims don’t stack up. That’s why the independent administrator dismissed them,” the spokesperson said.
“Here’s what this is really about: in Victoria, we pay workers properly and some people don’t like that.
“Tens of thousands of workers doing dangerous, highly skilled jobs received a pay rise through lawful enterprise agreements negotiated by their union.
“We’re cracking down on dodgy labour hire businesses that underpay or exploit workers, and bosses who expose their workforce to serious injury or worse.”

Kiev’s sponsors drew conclusions after attack on Putin residence — Galuzin

MOSCOW, February 15. /TASS/. The sponsors of the Kiev regime drew appropriate conclusions and assessments following the attack on the residence of Russian President Vladimir Putin in the Novgorod Region, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Galuzin said in an interview with TASS.
"Fortunately, all of these strikes were repelled. This attack was condemned in many countries. Our partners once again saw firsthand the terrorist nature of [Vladimir] Zelensky’s junta. Everyone saw the footage of our military in Moscow handing over to the Americans a flight mission controller from one of the Ukrainian UAVs shot down while targeting the residence of the Russian president," he added.
"Appropriate conclusions and assessments have been made, including by those who sponsor the Kiev regime," Galuzin noted.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said that on the night of December 29 Kiev carried out an attack using 91 unmanned aerial vehicles against President Putin’s state residence in the Novgorod Region. All of the drones were destroyed. As the Russian Defense Ministry reported on January 9, in response Russian forces launched a massive strike, including with the Oreshnik missile system, targeting critically important facilities in Ukraine.

Japan's Motegi, NATO's Rutte discuss further support for Ukraine
That is according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan, Ukrinform reports.
At the beginning of the meeting, Motegi emphasized that the security of the Euro-Atlantic and Indo-Pacific regions is inseparable. Therefore, cooperation between NATO and Japan, as well as other partners such as Australia, New Zealand, and South Korea, is strategically important.
"He [Motegi] added that Japan intends to elevate relations with NATO to new heights through concrete cooperation in various fields including defense equipment and industrial cooperation," the statement said.
For his part, Rutte said he fully shares this view and would like to further develop the Japan-NATO relationship in various fields.
Rutte also highly valuated Japan's cooperation with NATO, including its support for Ukraine through NATO.
The statement added that Motegi and Rutte exchanged views on regional situations, including Russia's aggression against Ukraine and the Indo-Pacific, and confirmed that Japan and NATO, as well as NATO and its Indo-Pacific partners will continue to work closely together.
In recent years, Japan has been actively developing cooperation with NATO. In January 2025, the country opened a separate permanent mission to NATO headquarters in Brussels. In April, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte visited Tokyo. Then-Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba agreed with him to expand cooperation in the defense industry.

Hong Kong’s transport chief has pledged to fully review the ill-fated mandatory seat belt rule for bus passengers, including improving strap designs and examining possible exemptions, before relaunching the policy.
Secretary for Transport and Logistics Mable Chan said on Sunday the government would adopt a four-pronged approach to address public concerns over the requirement, starting by working with franchised bus operators to improve the installation, design and maintenance of seat belts to ensure safety and convenience.
Authorities would also commission experts to analyse the risks associated with different seating layouts and route types, while stepping up publicity to strengthen passenger awareness and responsibility, she said.

The minister added that the government would re-examine policy details covering implementation, exemptions and penalties to ensure the revised requirements balanced law, reason and empathy.
“Regarding the requirement to wear seat belts on buses, we will conduct a fresh and comprehensive review and widely consult the community before drawing up an optimised proposal,” Chan said.

Crisafulli faces questions about rebel MP’s bid to put abortion back on agenda

Crisafulli faces questions about rebel MP’s bid to put abortion back on agenda
Premier David Crisafulli is again facing questions over the rebel Liberal-National MP who crossed the floor in a bid to reignite the abortion debate in Queensland.
The premier on Sunday said he had spoken to Mackay MP Nigel Dalton, and confirmed he was expected to remain a member of the LNP.
The move by Dalton earlier this week was in support of a Katter’s Australian Party push to reverse a gag introduced by Crisafulli after the 2024 Queensland election, as the premier sought to silence political rivals and shut down moves from his own backbench who wanted to repeal the state’s termination of pregnancy laws.
The motion banned any bills or amendment to the termination of pregnancy act, after debate threatened to derail Crisafulli’s election campaign.
Dalton told reporters after crossing the floor on Tuesday that abortion reform was a “deeply personal issue”. He later told abortion reform advocate Joanna Howe that he was motivated to break ranks because he was uncomfortable having supported the gag in 2024.
“This is my time to redeem myself in the eyes of the public, say sorry, but also in the eyes of God – that’s who I serve, I don’t serve anybody else,” he said in the interview posted online.
He also said he hoped by standing up, “we can actually draw attention to what the abortion act actually says in Queensland”.
One Nation leader Pauline Hanson later backed Dalton, saying abortion was an important issue to many Australians.“I’ve actually had my concerns about it greatly,” she said.
When asked about Hanson on Sunday, Crisafulli simply replied: “I made a promise to Queensland and I spoke to you guys, and we’ve honoured that promise.”
In commenting about Dalton’s remarks in the video, Crisafulli said he had honoured the things he had told Queenslanders he would do.
“I made some responses on the floor of parliament about it and probably the most perfect one is the scare campaign that the state was subjected to,” he said.
When asked if he expected Dalton to remain part of the LNP, Crisafulli said yes and confirmed he had spoken with Dalton.
“Just remember, I stood up on the day it happened, and then I addressed it again in parliament. So we’re doing what we said we’d do.”
The Labor opposition earlier this week pressed Crisafulli in parliament about the government’s position, where the premier deflected questions on the issue as a scare campaign. He told parliament: “I said there’d be no change, there is no change.”
On Sunday, deputy Labor opposition leader Cameron Dick said any revisit to abortion laws would take Queensland backwards, and that would be through criminalising women for decisions they make about their own bodies.
But Labor had supported the motion, with the deputy opposition leader saying this was because Labor did not believe members of parliament should be limited in what they say because a premier was concerned about what his own party members would do.
“What we saw this week was the truth from the LNP. There are a number of members of the LNP who want to change Queensland abortion laws and I think that should be of deep concern, not just to every Queensland woman, but every Queenslander.
“Nigel Dalton said he didn’t believe his leader and his fellow LNP MPs when they said there would be no change to the law in Queensland, and we know that MPs like Amanda Stoker have promised the anti-abortion movement in Queensland that those laws will be revisited in future.”
When asked about Hanson and the rising support for One Nation, Dick said: “I’m deeply concerned that the flames of hate are being fanned by the far right in this state.”

Statues unveiled of opera star who succeeded before Melba

Statues of Amy Sherwin, Australia's first opera star, unveiled at Hobart's Hadley's Hotel in bid to cement legacy
In short:
An effort to bring new recognition to a Tasmanian opera star who became world famous, but who died poor, has culminated in the unveiling of two statues of her likeness.
Amy Sherwin toured the world as the country's first opera celebrity, years before Dame Nellie Melba would eclipse her in the public's mind as Australia's premier opera star.
What's next?
Bob Brown, one of the drivers behind the effort to celebrate Sherwin, hopes her story of humble beginnings to world fame can inspire future generations.
The Australian opera star who was famous before Dame Nellie Melba arrived on the scene, but who died penniless, has finally been immortalised in stone and bronze, in a bid to enshrine her legacy.
Amy Sherwin, known as "the Tasmanian Nightingale", was one of the greatest sopranos of her era.
Born in Huonville, in rural southern Tasmania, Sherwin rose to international fame — but died in 1935 at age 81 in a London nursing home "lonely and penniless", as one US newspaper reported at the time.
Sherwin has been largely eclipsed in the public's mind by Dame Nellie Melba as Australia's first international opera star.
In 2023, a fund was established to give Sherwin "the hometown recognition she deserves".
The fruits of that were officially unveiled today at Hobart's Hadleys Hotel, in the form of a life-size marble statue, with a bronze replica, created by artist Peter Schipperheyn.
A street festival, which included a re-enactment of Sherwin arriving in Hobart, was held outside the hotel, in Hobart's CBD, to mark the unveiling.
The bells of St David's tolled as Tasmanian soprano Jacqueline Ward, playing the part of Sherwin, rode in on a carriage before entertaining the crowd with two musical performances.
President of the Amy Sherwin Fund, Bob Brown, said Sherwin "took the world by storm" in the 1870s.
"She's inspiring because she came out of the bush, and she said, 'When you want to go for something, go for it and keep going,'" Dr Brown said.
"She personifies that; she was the most famous Tasmanian in the world."
The Amy Sherwin Fund has raised $200,000 for the marble statue, with an additional $50,000 still required to fully fund the artwork.
The separate bronze replica, which was installed on the balcony of Hadley's, was funded by the hotel.
Dr Brown hopes the two statues will ensure Sherwin is remembered.
"Tasmanians don't know about her, but she's coming back now. She's firing back and everybody is going to know about her, and she'll inspire young Tasmanians,"Dr Brown said.
Sculptor's 'adventure' in bringing Sherwin out of stone
Peter Schipperheyn has been sculpting since 1979, after he travelled from Australia to Italy at just 19 and fell in love with the artform.
The Melbourne-based sculptor said his involvement in the Amy Sherwin statue project started with a phone call "out of the blue" from Bob Brown.
The more he learned about Sherwin, the more he wanted to pick up his chisel and bring Sherwin's legacy back to life.
"I thought it's a lovely project, a great thing for me to be involved in,"Schipperheyn said.
As part of an extensive research phase, Schipperheyn reviewed many photographs of the opera singer, with one in particular creating a "flash" in his mind of a concept for the statue
"I saw a beautiful photograph of her in a 19th-century dress, which is very ornate with all the pearls and lace work and these big puffy sleeves. I immediately saw that in stone and how I might be able to do that," he said.
Taking inspiration from the photograph, he created a maquette, a small-scale model used to help artists visualise what a larger sculpture could look like.
He sought advice from a fashion designer friend to help recreate the back of the gown, as no photographs of it existed.
The next step saw him create a full-size model, but rather than heading straight to stone, Schipperheyn used clay to create a plaster mould of his final design.
He then took that plaster mould all the way to Italy, where he hand-picked a block of white marble from the country's famous quarries in Carrara.
"This particular block is exceptional, the one I've made Amy out of. I'm really blessed with that and it's because it's never easy getting the right block."
Schipperheyn explained the block had been sitting around for 20 years, as no one had previously been willing to pay its advertised price.
"They won't sell them unless they get a certain price for them, and fully understandable. They'll keep them there. And lucky me, I got a beautiful block."
Schipperheyn said he found the process of bringing Sherwin out from the rock to be "like an adventure".
"I do like spending my time in this way, and always with the hope and aspiration that the time I've put into it is meaningful, and that it will have some value to current times and also future times,"he said.
"It was great to get to know another piece of history in the form of Amy Sherwin when it was being forgotten, and now there's a focus on her again and what she achieved."
Schipperheyn said he hopes the work will remind anyone who takes pleasure in viewing it "of the better things that human beings are capable of".

A major trade deal with the EU may be closer than ever. Here's how Aussies stand to benefit

Australia is closer than ever to striking a long-awaited free-trade pact with the European Union after Donald Trump's tariff wars brought a fresh focus to years of stop-start negotiations.
Trade Minister Don Farrell is confident the stalled deal is close to being secured after constructive discussions with EU commissioners.
"We're closer than we have been in 25 years to getting a free-trade agreement with the Europeans," Senator Farrell told Sky News on Sunday.
"Unfortunately, I can't say that we have an agreement yet, but we have significantly reduced the issues between us."
The two-day negotiations took place in Brussels before Senator Farrell arrived back in Australia on Saturday night.
What would the deal mean for Australians?
A free-trade deal would give Australian exporters greater access to global markets of more than 450 million people, while also removing tariffs on European imports and offering a potential billion-dollar boost to the economy.
It would end tariffs on products like European cars in Australia, likely bringing more competitive prices.
Negotiations over a proposed free-trade agreement have previously ended without a deal over sticking points that include greater access to European markets for Australian beef and sheep.
Australia initially pushed for more than 30,000 tonnes of beef, while Europe tried to whittle down the quota to protect domestic farmers who oppose greater competition from imports.
In turn, EU officials have pushed to end Australian producers using terms like prosecco and feta for products that aren't sourced from specific European regions.
Despite Farrell's bullish tone, he admitted that negotiators were still at an impasse over certain import restrictions.
"That was an issue that continued to be discussed extensively on Friday, so we haven't resolved those yet," Farrell said.
The deal could be struck within weeks, Farrell said, pulling Australia and the EU closer together as United States President Donald Trump upends global trade with unilateral tariffs.
The news comes months after EU trade commissioner Maros Sefcovic travelled to Australia, where he revealed the final stages of negotiations could be finalised in 2026.

MOSCOW, February 15. /TASS/. The idea of introducing external governance in Ukraine under the auspices of the United Nations following the completion of the special military operation is one of the possible options for resolving the conflict, and Russia is prepared to discuss it with other countries, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Galuzin said in an interview with TASS.
"The idea of introducing external governance in Ukraine under the auspices of the UN after the completion of the special military operation is not new. In March 2025, Russian President Vladimir Putin stated that, in the case of Ukraine, the establishment of an external administration under the auspices of the UN is one of the possible options. Such precedents have occurred within the framework of the world organization’s peacekeeping activities. In general, Russia is ready to discuss with the United States, European and other countries the possibility of introducing temporary external governance in Kiev," he said.
The Russian deputy foreign minister believes that such a step "would make it possible to hold democratic elections in Ukraine, bring to power a capable government with which a full-fledged peace treaty could be signed, along with legitimate documents on future interstate cooperation."
"At the same time," the senior diplomat continued, "it should be taken into account that the United Nations does not formally have a standardized mechanism for establishing temporary international administrations in territories affected by conflict."

MOSCOW, February 15. /TASS/. Moscow has indeed toughened its negotiating position following Kiev’s attack on the residence of Russian President Vladimir Putin, and this position was conveyed to participants in the talks in Abu Dhabi, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Galuzin said in an interview with TASS.
"With regard to changes in the negotiating position, I can only confirm that they do exist. I would prefer not to make public the nuances. I will only note that our tougher position was communicated to the participants of the February 4-5 meeting in Abu Dhabi of the working group on security issues in the Russia-US-Ukraine format," the deputy minister noted.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said that on the night of December 29 Kiev carried out an attack using 91 unmanned aerial vehicles against President Putin’s state residence in the Novgorod Region. All of the drones were destroyed. As the Russian Defense Ministry reported on January 9, in response Russian forces launched a massive strike, including with the Oreshnik missile system, targeting critically important facilities in Ukraine.

Hamas disarmament could begin as early as March 2026, according to two sources in US President Donald Trump's Gaza Board of Peace who spoke to KAN News.
The disarmament process will begin once the new technocratic government takes over from Hamas in the Gaza Strip, the Saturday night KAN report added.
The Peace Council is expected to meet in late February in Washington, DC, with Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar representing Israel at the summit.
The Board of Peace initiative was originally designed with the intent of bringing the war in Gaza to a close, but Trump later said that it would resolve conflicts globally.
Preparations have already begun in the Gaza Strip for the transition of power, per the KAN report, which added that Israel has begun building IDF bases in Israel-controlled territories in the Strip. The IDF has also begun arming anti-Hamas militias, such as Abu Shabab, according to KAN, citing foreign reports.
Israel-aligned Gazan militia operating in Rafah tunnels, aim to disarm Hamas
Ghassan Duhine, head of the Abu Shabab militia in the Gaza Strip, revealed that his forces were operating within Hamas tunnels in Rafah, KAN News reported on Friday.
According to a Thursday Facebook post from Duhine, the anti-Hamas militia has begun dismantling the tunnels, which they consider to be the most impactful weapon Hamas possesses. "Afterwards," he added, "we'll destroy weapon manufacturing, rockets, and finally move onto guns."
Earlier this week, KAN also confirmed that Abu Shabab, also known as the Popular Forces, would be involved in the security protocols surrounding the recently-reopened Rafah Crossing.

US military weighs sustained Iran strikes, casting shadow over diplomacy
The plan raises regional conflict fears and comes ahead of next week’s talks between the two sides in Geneva
The US military is preparing for the possibility of sustained, weeks-long operations against Iran if President Donald Trump orders an attack, according to two US officials, in what could become a far more serious conflict than previously seen between the countries.
The disclosure by the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitive nature of the planning, raises the stakes for the diplomacy under way between the United States and Iran. US envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner will hold negotiations with Iran on Tuesday in Geneva, with representatives from Oman acting as mediators.
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio cautioned on Saturday that while Trump’s preference was to reach a deal with Tehran, “that’s very hard to do”. Meanwhile, Trump has amassed military forces in the region, raising fears of new military action.
US officials said on Friday the Pentagon was sending an additional aircraft carrier to the Middle East, adding thousands more troops along with fighter aircraft, guided-missile destroyers and other firepower capable of waging attacks and defending against them.
Trump, speaking on Friday after a military event at Fort Bragg in North Carolina, openly floated the possibility of changing the government in Iran, saying it “seems like that would be the best thing that could happen”. He declined to share who he wanted to take over Iran, but said, “there are people”.
“For 47 years, they’ve been talking and talking and talking,” Trump said. Trump has long voiced scepticism about sending ground troops into Iran, saying last year, “the last thing you want to do is ground forces” and the kinds of US firepower arrayed in the Middle East so far suggest options for strikes primarily by air and naval forces.

Cyclone Gezani kills four in Mozambique as Madagascar assesses damage
Powerful storm batters Mozambique’s Inhambane a day after killing at least 41 people in Madagascar.
Cyclone Gezani has hit Mozambique’s southern coastal province of Inhambane, killing at least four people, according to officials.
The toll in Mozambique on Saturday came a day after the cyclone tore through Madagascar, killing at least 41 people and leaving a trail of destruction across the island.

The AFP news agency, citing meteorologists, said the storm lashed Inhambane with winds of up to 215km per hour (134mph).
It brought down trees and power lines, leaving more than 13,000 people without power, the national electric company said.
Water supplies were also cut off in several districts of the city of Inhambane.
The city is home to some 100,000 people.
Mozambique has been hit by frequent weather-related disasters that scientists say have been exacerbated by climate change.
The Southern African country is only just recovering from severe flooding that affected more than 700,000 people and damaged more than 170,000 homes in recent weeks, according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.
In Madagascar, the government declared a national emergency and said the storm had caused an estimated $142m in damage.
In addition to the deaths, at least 427 people were injured, and some 16,300 were displaced, according to officials.
The eye of the cyclone passed on Tuesday over Madagascar’s second-largest city, Toamasina, which has a population of 400,000, leaving it devastated.
The Indian Ocean island’s leader, Colonel Michael Randrianirina, said about 75 percent of the city had been destroyed.
Tania Goosens, the World Food Programme’s (WFP) Madagascar director, said on Friday that “the scale of destruction is overwhelming” in Toamasina. “The authorities have reported that 80 percent of the city has been damaged,” she told reporters.
“The city is running on roughly 5 percent of electricity, and there is no water,” she said, adding that the WFP’s office and one warehouse “were also completely destroyed”.

Standing room only: Melbourne’s busiest tram routes revealed

Standing room only: Melbourne’s busiest tram routes revealed
Melbourne is home to the largest operational tram network in the world, carrying more than 200 million passengers each year. But have you ever wondered which route is the most popular?
Tram passenger data accessed by The Age shows the monthly patronage on 22 of the city’s 24 tram routes between January 2019 and June 2025.
Route 96 takes the crown for Melbourne’s busiest service. Patronage numbers for the St Kilda Beach to East Brunswick route have consistently sat above one million people per month since September 2022.
The 96 runs through high-density residential areas in Melbourne’s inner-north, many of which are not serviced by trains, and stops at popular attractions including Bourke Street Mall, Crown Casino, MSAC and Melbourne Museum, which might be why it’s the most crammed.
Other popular services include the routes 109 and 86, which are among the longest routes, as well as the 58 and 19, which both stop near The University of Melbourne and run through the CBD.
Katya Finnegan is primarily a train user, but catches the 96 tram between her work and university. She said that the trip is generally efficient, but the design of the E-class trams means people often block the doors.
“No one really gets off when someone’s trying to get off, which I guess makes them feel even busier,” Finnegan said.
For Petra and Matthew, who are on holiday from Germany and didn’t want to give their last names, the 96 trams felt busier than the other routes they’d travelled on.
“A lot of the time I feel squeezed in. And we’d [rather] walk!” Matthew said.
Comparatively, route 82 is Melbourne’s quietest tram. Servicing a short 9.2km distance between Footscray and Moonee Ponds, its patronage hovers around the 100,000 people per month mark.
The 82 tram is one of two services that are entirely outside the Melbourne CBD – along with the route 78 between North Richmond and Balaclava. The 78 is also among the quietest tram services, as are routes 57 and 64.
Yudha Korwa, who lives in Melbourne’s west and regularly catches the route 82 tram as part of his work commute, said he was surprised to hear about its low patronage rates.
He has a couple of local transport options – including two bus routes – but prefers to catch the tram as its path is more direct.
“The tram is more [safe]. It’s easy to go to the train station,” Korwa said.
Talia Dalipis used to be a regular on the route 82 tram when she was attending high school – but this time she’s catching it to Highpoint Shopping Centre.
The service is often full of students outside of school hours because Footscray High and Maribyrnong College are both close to stops, she said.
“During the day it’s pretty chill … But definitely in the mornings and the afternoons it gets really crowded,” Dalipis said.
Tram patronage numbers are calculated by counting the number of people who board a tram service and touch on their myki card. This is then cross-referenced with Automatic Vehicle Monitoring data to provide a final estimate.
Passenger numbers weren’t available for tram routes 30 and 35, as passenger counts are impacted by their placement in the CBD’s free tram zone.
Tram patronage took an unsurprising dive during the COVID lockdowns – when public transport use in Melbourne was limited. Most of these numbers are now trending upwards towards their pre-pandemic levels.
A spokesperson from the Department of Transport and Planning said that a range of tram timetable changes were rolled out across most routes following the final lockdown period in 2021.
With more people gravitating to remote work, passenger feedback indicated a lesser demand for trams during morning rush hour. Instead, there was a new emphasis on increased services on weekends, evenings, and during major events, they said.
The spokesperson also acknowledged that use of trams had been steadily climbing and that there was a possibility of future timetable changes.
“Patronage continues to increase and we will monitor services and make adjustments as travel patterns evolve,” they said.

Israeli forces kill nine Palestinians in Gaza, attack southern Lebanon
Medical sources say Israeli forces killed five Palestinians in southern Khan Younis and four in northern al-Faluja.
Israeli forces have killed at least nine Palestinians in new attacks across Gaza, in yet another violation of the United States-brokered “ceasefire” in October, according to medical sources.
The attacks on Sunday came as the Israeli military launched several attacks on southern Lebanon, targeting what it called warehouses used by the Hezbollah armed group.

In Gaza, a source at the Nasser Hospital told Al Jazeera Israeli forces killed at least five Palestinians in the southern city of Khan Younis.
The attack took place beyond the so-called “yellow line”, where Israeli troops are stationed in Gaza, the source added.
The other four Palestinians were killed when Israeli forces attacked a tent for displaced people in the al-Faluja area of northern Gaza, a source at al-Shifa Hospital said.
There was no immediate comment from Israel.
The Israeli military, however, said in a statement early on Sunday that it struck a building in an unspecified part of northern Gaza shortly after several armed fighters entered the structure.
At least two of the fighters were killed, it said.
The Israeli military also said it killed another person in Gaza on Sunday who allegedly crossed the yellow line and posed “an immediate threat” to its forces there.
It did not provide evidence for its claims.
In Lebanon, the Israeli military said it struck warehouses used by Hezbollah for storing weapons and launchers in the southern parts of the country.
The Israeli military and Hezbollah, which began attacks on northern Israel in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza in 2023, agreed to a ceasefire in November 2024.
There was no immediate comment from Lebanon on Sunday’s attacks.
According to authorities in Gaza and Lebanon, the Israeli military continues to launch near-daily attacks despite agreeing to halt the fighting.
In Gaza, Israel has violated the US-brokered “ceasefire” more than 1,500 times since it came into effect on October 10. At least 591 people have been killed and 1,590 wounded since then.
In addition to the near-daily killing of Palestinians, Israel also severely restricts quantities of food, medicine, medical supplies, shelter materials and prefabricated houses from entering Gaza, where some 2 million Palestinians – including 1.5 million displaced – live in catastrophic conditions.
Israel launched its genocidal war on Gaza on October 8, 2023, with support from the US, killing 72,032 people, wounding some 171,661, and destroying 90 percent of the territory’s infrastructure.
The United Nations estimates it could cost more than $70bn to rebuild Gaza.
In Lebanon, the Israeli military launched more than 10,000 air and ground attacks in the year since it agreed to halt hostilities, according to the UN.
The organisation’s rights office said in November last year that it verified at least 108 civilian casualties from Israeli attacks since the ceasefire, including at least 21 women and 16 children.
At least 11 Lebanese civilians were also abducted by Israeli forces during that time period, the office said.

Doctors Without Borders report validates what the IDF has been saying for years - editorial

When Médecins Sans Frontières (Doctors Without Borders) revealed over the weekend that it had suspended all noncritical operations at Nasser Hospital in January after staff reported armed men moving weapons and interrogating patients, it did something no other major medical or humanitarian organization has done since October 7.
It inadvertently validated what Israel has been saying for years.
According to the organization’s statement, armed individuals had been seen in recent months using the hospital compound for military-related activity.
More specifically, MSF stated that its medical teams witnessed suspected movement of weapons, as well as incidents of intimidation and arbitrary arrests of patients by armed terrorists, noting an uptick in such activity since the ceasefire began.
MSF’s acknowledgment is limited and cautious. It does not mention any terrorist organization by name, and includes a call on “all armed groups, as well as Israeli forces, to respect medical facilities.”
MSF recognition of armed groups operating within a Gaza hospital echoes IDF statements
However, its significance cannot be understated.
For the first time during the war, a major international organization has publicly recognized the presence of armed groups operating within a Gaza hospital.
For years, the IDF has maintained that Hamas systematically embedded itself in and beneath civilian infrastructure, including medical facilities. Hospitals across Gaza, including Nasser Hospital, were exploited by Hamas terrorists and used as command centers, weapons storage, and an operational human shield against Israeli strikes, the army has repeatedly said.
Some hospitals even served as links in Hamas’s vast tunnel network, which the group poured millions into building, while Gaza’s civilians were left to fend for themselves above ground.
These claims were often dismissed or downplayed by international NGOs and UN agencies, many of which accused Israel of exaggeration or fabrication to justify military action. Now, MSF’s own words echo the IDF’s continued warnings about Hamas’s militarization and exploitation of Gaza’s hospitals.
The topic of Gaza’s medical institutions has fueled a fiery debate over the course of the war due to Hamas’s use of them and the question of whether Israel should strike targets in or near those facilities. That debate has led to some of the harshest criticism against Israel during the war, not all of it unjust.
In August of last year, a mistaken attack on the same Nasser Hospital prompted Israel’s Foreign Ministry to release a statement, expressing its “deep regrets” over the strike that killed several journalists.
The IDF admitted in this instance that the attack on the hospital was approved, meaning there was some Hamas target in place. Still, it also said it was probing the attack, meaning significant aspects of the strike and its results were viewed as a major mistake, as per reporting by The Jerusalem Post’s Yonah Jeremy Bob.
Yet, Israel has consistently argued that Hamas’s strategy relies precisely on the expected backlash; the terrorist organization embeds itself in sensitive civilian sites intentionally, knowing Israel will either be deterred or condemned.
Reaching past mutual mistrust
In admitting such activity was seen by its staff, MSF also stepped beyond a fraught relationship with Israel, one which was further strained in recent weeks due to its refusal to provide Israel with a list of its Palestinian and international staff in order to resume operations in Gaza and the West Bank.
Israel eventually said it would move to terminate MSF from acting in Gaza, after the organization backtracked on its public agreement to provide the list.
Further, as exclusively reported by the Post’s Mathilda Heller, Israeli ministry documents viewed exclusively by the Post alleged that MSF had “practiced advancing an extreme anti-Israeli narrative under the guise of humanitarian activity.”
This reflects the mutual mistrust that has plagued Israel’s relationship with some global NGOs during the war. International organizations have often portrayed Israel as uniquely dismissive of humanitarian law. Despite that, what MSF has now acknowledged could prompt a reassessment.
It should also serve as a wake-up call to other international organizations and officials who have repeatedly belittled or dismissed Israel’s claims about Hamas’s use of medical facilities. If armed terrorists are exploiting hospitals, the first obligation of humanitarian groups should be to acknowledge that reality publicly.
Doing so is not a public endorsement of all Israeli military action in Gaza, nor does it undermine concern for civilians, who should remain the main focus for NGOs operating in Gaza. Instead, it coincides with what MSF wrote – the use of hospitals for military purposes endangers everyone at the facility, from medical staff and aid workers to Gazan patients and Israeli soldiers.
If more international organizations are willing to recognize what Israel says it has long known, the public discourse on Gaza’s hospitals may finally begin to align more closely with reality. What happens underground may not be visible to cameras above. But the truth, sooner or later, surfaces.

Obama breaks silence after racist video shared by Trump

Obama breaks silence after racist video shared by Trump account
Washington: Former US president Barack Obama has addressed for the first time a racist video of him and Michelle Obama posted on President Donald Trump’s Truth Social account, saying most Americans found the current level of political discourse “deeply troubling”.
The February 6 post, which briefly included a depiction of Obama – the country’s first black president – and his wife as apes, was deleted after a furious backlash, including from Republicans.
During a recent appearance on Democratic influencer Brian Tyler Cohen’s podcast, Obama was asked to comment on the “level of cruelty” in public discourse. Cohen noted White House officials’ description of two people shot by immigration agents in Minneapolis as “domestic terrorists”, as well as the post on Trump’s account.
“Just days ago, Donald Trump put a picture of you, your face on an ape’s body – and so again, we’ve ... seen the devolution of the discourse,” Cohen said in the 47-minute interview that aired on Saturday. “How do we come back from the place that we have fallen into?”
“First of all, I think it’s important to recognise that the majority of the American people find this behaviour deeply troubling,” Obama responded.
“You know, it is true that it gets attention. It’s true that it’s a distraction. But, you know, as I’m travelling around the country, as you’re travelling around the country, you meet people. They still believe in decency, courtesy, kindness.”
Obama didn’t mention Trump by name or directly reference the post, but lamented that “a sense of propriety and respect for the office … that’s been lost”.
“There’s this sort of clown show that’s happening in social media and on television, and what is true is that there doesn’t seem to be any shame about this among people who used to feel like you had to have some sort of decorum,” he said.
But Obama said ultimately the answer would come from the American people, pointing to the “extraordinary” community spirit shown by ordinary people during the recent Immigration and Customs Enforcement surge in Minneapolis.
“… At the end of the day, the way we get a democracy that’s working and the way we get policies that actually are helping working families get ahead, the way that we restore norms, rule of law, decency, it’s going to be because we, citizens, are activated and paying attention and saying ‘enough’,” he said.
Trump’s Truth Social account regularly re-posts memes, videos and other content from the US’ large ecosystem of conservative and conspiratorial fringe media outlets.
White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt initially defended the February 6 post, describing it as an “internet meme” and urging reporters to “report on something today that actually matters to the American public”.
However, backlash from across the political spectrum followed, and the video was removed after being online for nearly 12 hours.
Republican senator from South Carolina Tim Scott – the only black Republican senator – called the post “the most racist thing I’ve seen out of this White House”.
After its removal, the White House said the post, which began with a video about alleged voter fraud, had been shared “erroneously” by an unnamed staff member.
Hours later, Trump appeared to contradict that explanation, saying he “didn’t make a mistake” and had instead passed the video along for an aide to post.
“I liked the beginning. I saw it and just passed it on, and I guess probably nobody reviewed the end of it,” Trump said.
An Obama spokeswoman at the time said the former president had no response when asked about the video.

2026 European cruise travel trends: Smaller ships, cultural exchanges and F1
Unknown

Europe’s cruise sector is ushering in a new era as it adapts to overtourism pressures and shifting traveller priorities.
Faced with growing concerns around overtourism, environmental impact and port congestion, cruise lines are rethinking not just where they sail, but how they operate. In Europe’s cruise sector, the result is a shift away from high-volume itineraries towards smaller ships, longer stays and curated routes that balance visitor demand with the needs of local communities.
Cruises are also becoming more experience-led. From Formula 1 Grand Prix packages to expedition voyages in the Arctic and immersive cultural exchanges in remote coastal villages, cruise holidays are expanding beyond traditional sightseeing trips by incorporating sport, adventure, wellness and education tourism.
Here Euronews Travel takes a look at some of the biggest trends driving the European cruise industry in 2026.
Smaller ships and smarter itineraries
As European cities tighten regulations on cruise travel, amid overtourism and congestion issues, 2026 is seeing a strategic shift towards smaller ships and secondary ports. Destination-focused brands such as Azamara Cruises and Viking Cruises are benefitting from policies favouring longer stays and reduced congestion. Hurtigruten and Ponant, which operate smaller vessels, are also well positioned as ports prioritise sustainability, local engagement and manageable visitor numbers over high-volume cruise traffic.
Community and cultural exchange
European cruising is moving towards community-led shore experiences, prioritising cultural exchange over mass excursions. Hurtigruten has recently expanded its popular “Open Village” programme, which invites guests into small Norwegian coastal communities to experience everyday life, local food and traditions. Expedition-focused operators are adopting similar models, reflecting a wider industry push to reduce overtourism while delivering more socially responsible travel. Another growing trend is learning-led sailings with cruise lines offering education, storytelling and cultural exchange rather than pure leisure.
F1-themed packages
In 2026 several operators are offering Formula 1 Grand Prix cruise travel packages, with curated land-sea itineraries. As a partner of F1, MSC Cruises and its luxury brand Explora Journeys offer themed events and exclusive experiences around key European races, including Monaco. Cruise lines such as Cunard and Azamara Cruises also offer all-inclusive luxury trips to races like Monaco and Barcelona, which include race tickets.
Luxury experiences
Luxury cruising is evolving, with travellers prioritising curated experiences, wellbeing and personalisation. Brands such as Regent Seven Seas Cruises and Silversea Cruises are focusing on immersive shore programmes and longer port stays. Newer entrants like Explora Journeys are positioning Europe as a slow travel destination, favouring smaller ships, understated luxury and culturally driven onboard experiences.
Adventures and expeditions
Expedition cruising is no longer niche in Europe, with 2026 seeing strong demand for adventure-led itineraries across Norway, Iceland, Greenland and the Arctic Circle. Operators such as Hurtigruten and Lindblad Expeditions are attracting travellers seeking wildlife encounters, expert-led exploration and deeper engagement with nature.
Slow travel on a river cruise
River cruising continues to gain momentum as travellers seek slow, scenic and culturally immersive journeys through Europe’s historic waterways. Operators such as Viking Cruises, AmaWaterways and Uniworld are expanding thematic itineraries focused on gastronomy, wine and heritage. Docking directly in city centres, river cruises offer ease of access and align with growing demand for lower-impact, experience-led travel.
Sustainability and green technology
Sustainability is influencing itinerary planning and traveller choice for European cruises in 2026. MSC Cruises is investing heavily in LNG-powered ships and shore power infrastructure, while Hurtigruten continues to focus on emissions reduction and local sourcing. German brand AIDA Cruises is also integrating greener technologies across its European fleet, as cruise lines respond to mounting regulatory pressure and rising consumer expectations.
A younger audience
Cruising in Europe is attracting a younger demographic in 2026, driven by flexible itineraries, strong value and social onboard environments. Cruise lines attracting a younger audience include Virgin Voyages, which is appealing to Millennials and Gen Z with adults-only sailings and port-rich Mediterranean routes. Meanwhile, Norwegian Cruise Line and MSC Cruises are also tailoring shorter European itineraries to younger travellers seeking cultural depth without long-haul flights.
Health and wellbeing
Wellness cruising is booming in 2026 as operators embed holistic wellbeing into itineraries. Explora Journeys emphasises ocean-inspired spa, fitness and mindfulness programmes, while Sail Croatia has adopted the wellness trend with hike and cycle cruise itineraries for this year. AmaWaterways also provides fitness, relaxation and wellbeing facilities on scenic European river cruise routes.

How a ‘military vacuum’ in West and Central Africa opened new markets for China
Beijing has increased engagement with countries in the Sahel following the French military exit, and with Russian weapons in short supply
As France’s influence fades and with Russian weapons in limited supply, a “military vacuum” has been created in West and Central Africa that China is uniquely positioned to fill, according to analysts.
This follows a wave of military coups across the Sahel since 2020 – including in Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger – that has ended traditional alliances and security frameworks, with French forces withdrawing from the region after a long-running counterterrorism campaign.
The French “military vacuum” was identified as providing “space for the expansion of China’s military trade”, the report in the journal of the State Administration of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defence said.
The report also said there were “market substitution opportunities” for Chinese weapons in the region as the use of French and Russian arms declined.

‘Don’t worry about it’: Welcome to Trump’s voyage of the damned
Washington: When President Donald Trump vitiated scientific facts on Thursday, helping fossil fuel fat cats by eliminating the government’s ability to regulate treacherous gases, a reporter asked what he says to people worried about the very real hazards of a hotter planet.
“I tell them don’t worry about it,” he shot back.
The administration has even coined a word to denigrate those who push back on Trump’s rash policies: “panican”, as in one who panics.
In a world steeped in violence and menace, we are constantly being told by the people in charge not to worry.
Don’t worry about a sweltering Earth. Don’t worry about all those powerful creeps getting away with abusing young women exploited by Jeffrey Epstein. Instead, just behold the beauty of the rising Dow, as the abrasive, evasive Pam Bondi suggested at a congressional hearing on Wednesday.
Don’t worry about the Trump family’s unethical get-rich-quick schemes. Don’t worry about an economy increasingly catering to the well connected. Don’t worry about the president threatening to unilaterally set the rules for state elections — Congress be damned.
The pueri aeterni of Silicon Valley have greased the palm of our King Joffrey in the White House. And now we are told not to worry about safeguards for artificial intelligence, the most spine-tingling technology ever created.
I interviewed Elon Musk in 2017, when he still cared about AI safety as much as he once cared about going to the wildest party on Epstein’s island and now cares about constantly sharing deranged posts about race on X. He told me that the fate of humanity depended on not allowing the algorithms to be concealed and concentrated in the hands of tech and government elites.
“It’s great when the emperor is Marcus Aurelius,” Musk said then. “It’s not so great when the emperor is Caligula.”
Let’s just say that our man in the White House is no Marcus Aurelius.
When I reported in Silicon Valley back then, the debate was whether AI would jump to the dark side once it got smarter than we are.
But since then, even the tech gods who once had good intentions have gone to the dark side, seduced by the billions to be made on AI, including on erotica. These geniuses who were supposed to escort us into a better, safer future turned out to be the biggest sellouts of all time.
Sam Altman, OpenAI’s CEO, has welcomed erotica, or “adult mode”, as it’s called, saying he wants to “treat adult users like adults”.
Once Musk put up an AI-generated picture of himself in a bikini to demonstrate his AI model’s new feature, people used it to manipulate pictures of women online, stripping off their clothes.
The tech bros are thrilled with their ability to buy influence in Trump world. (Yes, Jeff Bezos, I’m talking about Melania.)
As Wired reported, the president of OpenAI, Greg Brockman, was one of Trump’s biggest individual donors in 2025, to the tune of $US25 million ($35 million). Another $25 million is on the way to a PAC that fights politicians who favour regulating AI. OpenAI’s original mission was to protect humanity, but where’s the money in that?
The tech universe shuddered this past week at alarms from several Paul Reveres.
An urgent post on X titled “Something Big Is Happening” by Matt Shumer, CEO of two small tech companies, went viral. He warned that AI is leaping ahead faster than we think.
“The future is being shaped by a remarkably small number of people: a few hundred researchers at a handful of companies … Open AI, Anthropic, Google DeepMind,” he wrote, adding: “I am no longer needed for the actual technical work of my job … I tell the AI what I want, walk away from my computer for four hours, and come back to find the work done. Done well, done better than I would have done it myself.” Now, he wrote, OpenAI’s newest model is showing judgment, and it knows how to make the right call on its own.
On Monday, an Anthropic AI safety researcher, Mrinank Sharma, quit his job, posting an apocalyptic warning on X that the “world is in peril” from AI, bioweapons and cascading crises.
Anthropic’s CEO, Dario Amodei, has been the most responsible tech executive in acknowledging the awesome, hair-curling power of AI, saying it will “test who we are as a species” and reveal whether humanity has the maturity to handle this “almost unimaginable power”. (The Wall Street Journal reported on Friday that the company’s AI tool, Claude, had helped the US military capture Venezuela’s president, Nicolás Maduro.)
Sharma is not sure if humanity has the maturity to handle AI. “I’ve repeatedly seen how hard it is to truly let our values govern our actions,” he wrote.
He said he will disappear to England and pursue a poetry degree, signing off with a William Stafford poem containing a line that augured AI dominance: “Nothing you do can stop time’s unfolding.”
Zoe Hitzig, a researcher at OpenAI, also quit on Monday. In a guest essay for The New York Times, she said she had lost faith that OpenAI still wanted to back her work on the two outcomes she fears most: “a technology that manipulates the people who use it at no cost and one that exclusively benefits the few who can afford to use it.”
Another OpenAI executive, Ryan Beiermeister, lost her job in the safety division after complaining about ChatGPT’s rollout of AI erotica, the Journal disclosed.
Beiermeister, the Journal said, did not think the company had enough guardrails in place to stop child-exploitation content and wall off adult content from teens.
OpenAI contended that Beiermeister’s departure was due to sexual discrimination against a male colleague. She adamantly denied that to the Journal.
Despite the smarmy reassurances of the tech lords, some AI insiders are alarmed by what they’re seeing.
The people in charge tell us not to worry. But we should worry. It’s getting scary out there. There’s nothing artificial about that.

Obama slams ICE raids in Minnesota, says tactics resemble 'dictatorships'

Former US president Barack Obama on Saturday condemned the operations of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers in Minnesota, comparing their behaviour to conduct seen "in dictatorships".
Thousands of federal agents including ICE agents carried out weeks of sweeping raids and arrests in what the Trump administration claims were targeted missions against criminals, until the operation was ended this week.
Obama had criticised the actions of ICE agents as unlawful last month, but went further in an interview with political commentator Brian Tyler Cohen released on Saturday.
"The rogue behaviour of agents of the federal government is deeply concerning and dangerous," he said.
He called the behaviour of federal officers, which included two fatal shootings that sparked mounting pressure on President Donald Trump's mass crackdown, as the sort that "in the past we've seen in authoritarian countries and we've seen in dictatorships".
But Obama, the only Black president in American history, said he had found hope in communities pushing back against the operations.
"Not just randomly, but in a systematic, organised way, citizens saying, 'this is not the America we believe in', and we're going to fight back, and we're going to push back with the truth and with cameras and with peaceful protests," he said.
"That kind of heroic, sustained behaviour in subzero weather by ordinary people is what should give us hope.
"As long as we have folks doing that, I feel like we're going to get through this."
Trump's pointman Tom Homan on Thursday announced the end of the aggressive immigration operation in Minnesota that triggered large protests and nationwide outrage.
In the wide-ranging podcast interview, Obama also criticised a lack of shame and decorum in the country's political discourse, responding for the first time to a post on President Donald Trump's social media that depicted him and first lady Michelle as monkeys.

'Our life is gone': Ex-hostage couple exhanged letters while in Hamas captivity - N12
Unknown

Released hostage Arbel Yehoud told The Daily Mail that she was sexually assaulted "almost every single day in captivity" in a Friday interview.
She noted that she did not wish to go into the details of the abuse, but shared that it was so significant and repeated that it made her want to end her own life.
"I tried to end my life three times," Yehoud said. "I felt like I couldn’t go on. There were moments when I thought it was the only way out."
However, her love for her partner, former hostage Ariel Cunio, and protests at Hostages Square kept her going. In the crowds, she saw signs of herself, Cunio, and other people she knew from Nir Oz. "From the moment I saw that, I didn't try to end my life on my own there," she told N12 in a separate Friday interview.
"I had a very strong intention and desire to hold on to this thing of mine until Ariel comes back, because he is the person closest to me and the one I want to share it with and tell it to, and we are both not there yet. It is very hard,” she said.
“I so deeply appreciate and admire the hostages who manage to sit and open their mouths and tell, and open their trauma," she said, adding that Romi Gonen's testimony changed her feelings on the matter. "Until then, I suppressed it well; I held it together well.”
“I identified with many of the things she said there, in terms of the gap she felt when she met the girls in the tunnel, when each one told what she had been through,” Arbel explained. “But even after I was able to see the horrors Romi had to endure, the gap remained. Because it is a very, very long time, and the things I went through, I went through from beginning to end, so they are in a closed, closed suitcase.”
Ariel Cunio, Arbel Yehoud, reflect on October 7 massacre
Yehoud and her partner, Cunio, spoke to N12 about their relationship, their time as hostages, and their attempts at recovery.
"I've known Arbel my whole life," Cunio said about the start of their connection. "Since I was born. We were neighbors."
The two started dating in 2018. Five years later, on October 7, they were kidnapped from their home in Nir Oz by terrorists, taken into Gaza, and separated.
"We held hands, he said something, I said something, we said 'Our life is gone,'" Yehoud recalled.
Cunio added, "I told her, 'The most important thing is that we stay together. As long as they don't split us apart, we're ok.' Half an hour later, that's what happened."
"I didn't even get a chance to say bye, couldn't even look him in the eyes," Yehoud said.
Both were taken by Palestinian Islamic Jihad terrorists, and kept in separate locations - Yehoud in a house, and Cunio, after initially being brought to a different house, in an empty space in the ceiling of a store.
"I was there for three and a half months, bent over all the time," he recounted. "Windows closed, door closed all day, it got so warm you could barely breathe."
Cunio was also forced to remain silent in his hiding space, under threat of being given over to Hamas.
Exchanging letters through their captors
The couple developed a way to stay in contact during part of their captivity.
"After a few days of pressuring them for information about Arbel, they offered to let me write her a letter," Cunio said.
"I was in shock from the first letter," Yehoud said, "They told me he drove them crazy."
Their captors ferried letters and notes back and forth between the couple, although they were never allowed to have any contact in person. After only a couple of months, however, the notes became shorter, as their captors allowed them to write only a sentence or two. Soon after, they were told there would be no more letters.
"His last letter was a short note," Yehoud remembered, "But he was able to fit some sort of code in it, and that's how I learned that my notebook was with him."
Yehoud had filled a notebook with drawings and doodles from her first 50 days as a hostage. Cunio's captor had given him the notebook, he said, in order to keep him calm.
"She wrote prayers, dreams she had," Cunio recalled, "I was on almost every page. There were whole pages with hearts with my name and 'My Ariel.'"
Cunio was able to keep Yehoud's notebook with him until the end of his captivity, when Hamas refused to allow him to take it back to Israel.
Despair leading to suicidal thoughts
Both of them struggled to maintain hope, diving into thoughts of self-destruction and suicidality.
Cunio also had moments of despair. "Sitting by yourself for so long drives you crazy," he said. "I had times when I said 'Come on, drop a bomb on me and that's it.' Like, get this saga over with already. Like, 'Come on, shoot me in the head.' I used to tell my captors, 'Shoot me, end this.'"
All his kidnappers would respond with was, "It'll be alright. Gilad Schalit was held for five years; in the end, they freed him in exchange for a thousand terrorists. You'll be released."
Yehoud was released at the end of January 2025, after 482 days. Cunio was given a chance to see her release in a video on Telegram that his captor showed him. "This giant boulder, which was on my heart, simply vanished," he said.
Yehoud also caught a glimpse of Cunio on video, just a few days before she was freed. In a tunnel below Gaza, she was able to spot Cunio, pale and holding a sign with the date and his details, in a video that terrorists were watching.
"I had to keep a poker face up so that I wouldn't agitate things down there," she said. "He looked completely pale, white, but I got here with something to tell his parents."
Cunio was released in October 2025, two years after he was abducted.
"They prepared me, told me at three-four in the morning that they were transferring me to Hamas," he recalled. He had a last conversation with one of his captors, who told him, "You look like a good guy, it's a shame you're a Jew. Why not convert to Islam?"
"Why?" Cunio asked.
"Because if you convert to Islam, you won't go to Hell, you'll go to paradise," his captors answered.
"Ah," Cunio said. "So you think those Hamas members who came in and murdered and raped and slaughtered and burnt all the kibbutzim, they all went to paradise?"
"Yes," the captor told Cunio.
Hostage couple finally reunited
When the couple finally reunited, they had no words.
"I don't think we spoke during that first meeting, only afterwards," Yehoud added.
But after the joy of the initial meeting, Cunio and Yehoud faced lingering challenges and struggles from their extended time as prisoners.
"Waking up in the morning, after being imprisoned, everything is strange," Cunio described. "There are times when I'll go for a walk with the dog, and I'll see the sky and the plants, and suddenly this feeling of freedom hits me, that I can do whatever I want."
Yehoud described her emotions and memories of her time in Gaza as being like a closed suitcase. "We're both not there yet," she said about the difficulties in talking openly with Cunio about the traumas they'd been through. "I have so much respect and appreciation for the hostages who are able to sit down and open their mouths and tell their stories."
Cunio also said he was afraid that the hostages would be forgotten after a few years, "like Holocaust survivors." When asked whether any ministers had called to welcome them home, the couple said that nobody had.
But the two ex-hostages also expressed strong hope in their mutual ability to support each other, to rise above the trauma they'd experienced, and build a family together.
"We'll try to get closer to the life we had before October 7," Yehoud concluded, "with a clear understanding that it can never be the same. But to try to approach it - a simple, modest life, a house that's ours, that we can raise a family in. I can sit here for hours and cry, and it's difficult, but in the end - I'm here."

Barack Obama says aliens are real – but shoots down conspiracy theory about Area 51
‘They're real, but I haven't seen them,’ the former president teases

For decades Americans have wondered about the existence of aliens and the mysterious desert holding facility Area 51, and now Barack Obama – after two terms as president – has finally given an answer.
“They're real, but I haven't seen them, and they're not being kept in – what is it?” Obama said, speaking during the No Lie podcast with Brian Tyler Cohen. “There's no underground facility, unless there's this enormous conspiracy and they hid it from the president of the United States.”
“What was the first question you wanted answered when you became president?” Cohen asked.
“Where are the aliens?” Obama replied, with a laugh.
The idea that a facility housing the remnants of aliens and Unidentified Flying Objects (UFO) exists under the highly classified Area 51 military base in southern Nevada has long-since obsessed conspiracy theorists.
Among the theories about the secret activities going on at the facility include the storage, examination, and reverse engineering of crashed alien spacecraft, including materials supposedly recovered at Roswell, New Mexico, in 1947.
Others speculate that the facility is dedicated to developing all manner of things including intergalactic weapons, time travel and teleportation technology or even some form of weather control.
Obama’s comments on Area 51 and aliens come several months after the director of a documentary, alleging a major government cover-up of non-human intelligence, suggested that Donald Trump may soon confirm the existence of extra-terrestrial life forms.
"I think it's only a matter of time before the release of this film is followed by a sitting president stepping to the podium and telling the world, 'We're not alone in the universe,'" Dan Farah, director of The Age of Disclosure, told Entertainment Weekly in late November.
"It's the most significant moment a leader could possibly have." The Independent contacted the White House for comment at the time.
Despite Farah’s claims Trump has not yet come forward publicly with a definitive answer about the existence of aliens, but mused over the possibility of extraterrestrial life during several interviews before his return to the White House.
In July 2024, Trump told influencer Logan Paul that he wasn’t a “believer.” He added: “Probably I can’t say I am. But I have met with people that are serious people that say there’s some really strange things that they see flying around out there.”
Months later, in September 2024, when podcaster Lex Fridman asked the president whether he would push to release more footage of UAPs – or unidentified aerial phenomena – Trump replied: "I’ll do that. I would do that. I’d love to do that. I have to do that."
The following month, Trump discussed the idea of intelligent life beyond Earth with Joe Rogan, saying the subject has “never been my thing.”
When Rogan asked what he thought about the existence of alien life, Trump said: “There's no reason not to think that Mars and all these planets don't have life.”

'Not changing what I've said': Chris Minns firm on Sydney protest amid investigation

A 76-year-old man who says he was injured after being violently tackled to the ground by police during a Sydney protest against the visiting Israeli president is exploring his legal options.
Video footage shows filmmaker James Ricketson being forced to the ground by several officers after placing his hand on the back of an officer at the pro-Palestinian demonstration at Town Hall on Monday evening.
Ricketson — who says he was detained for about five hours before being released without charge — spoke exclusively to SBS News at a free pop-up legal centre in Sydney's west on Sunday, set up to provide advice to demonstrators.
Up until his arrest, Ricketson recalled he had not seen any aggression from police or protesters.
He said the demonstration had "tailed off" and he was preparing to leave when he was stopped by a wall of police and directed to take another route.
"I had a little bit of an argument with the policeman, and decided to just sit on the wall and wait until it was possible to go through," he said.
Minutes later, he said scuffles broke out as police began to push protesters who were attempting to walk towards the Queen Victoria Building.
"The scuffles got more intense, and then suddenly, the next thing I knew, I was lying on the ground covered in policemen," he said.
"My body was not feeling good."
While Ricketson does not clearly recall the moment of his arrest, footage shows him placing his hand on the shoulder of an officer who was scuffling with another protester.
Other officers then grab Ricketson's hand and drag him into a group of six officers.
A struggle follows before Ricketson is put in a headlock, dragged to the ground and piled on by several officers.
Ricketson said he likely placed his hand on the officer's shoulder in an attempt to calm him down "because he was behaving very aggressively".
He said he was placed under arrest for assaulting an officer and taken to a police station where he was interviewed and detained for five hours.
After police reviewed body cam footage of the arrest, Ricketson said he was released without charge.
He suffered cuts and bruising to his arms but said his injuries could have been more serious.
"At the age of 76 ... a broken hip at that age can be a death sentence," he said.
"It's lucky that nobody died, including me, but if they're allowed to behave in this way in the future, eventually, someone is going to die."
Ricketson said was he was speaking out because he wanted to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future.
"Anybody who's seen the footage, anybody who was there, knows that this is not the kind of thing that has ever happened before in Australia," he said.
"It's the kind of thing that is happening now in the United States with ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement)."
He said he had spoken with a lawyer about possible legal action against police.
"Not so much in my case, with a view to kind of suing the police ... but to guarantee, insofar as it's possible, that something like this never happens again," he said.
Lawyer Osman Samin, who helped set up the legal clinic, told SBS News many officers were doing the "right thing".
"We're very grateful for that, but unfortunately, we have witnesses, complainants, and streams of footage which suggests that certain police officers did do the wrong thing," he said.
In response to SBS News, NSW Police said it could not comment on Ricketson's testimony as a critical incident investigation and a separate probe by the Law Enforcement Conduct Commission (LECC) were underway.
NSW Premier 'not changing' remarks on protest
On Sunday, NSW Premier Chris Minns stood by police after the state's police watchdog announced an investigation into alleged misconduct at the rally.
Social media footage showed Muslim men being physically dragged away by police while praying, triggering outrage among the Muslim community.
Other videos showed officers pinning down and repeatedly punching protesters and charging at, and pepper-spraying demonstrators.
On Friday, the LECC said it had received a "significant number of complaints" and it was in the public interest to investigate any alleged misconduct by police.
NSW Police also on Friday admitted that a senior officer had given the prayer the go-ahead, before it was broken up.
On Sunday, Minns — who previously defended NSW Police and declined to apologise to the Muslim community — stood by his remarks.
When asked about recent revelations and whether he had any messages for the Muslim community, Minns said: "I've spoken many times with the Muslim community over the last week but I'm just not going to get into a long public commentary over and above what I've repeatedly said last week."
The NSW premier said it was important that an independent investigation take place, but declined to offer further explanation.
"We can't have a situation where it's fierce denunciations day after day after day, and that we get whipped into a political situation where we get more chaotic scenes or more clashes in the streets," he said.
"No, I'm not changing what I've said.
"It was a difficult situation. I believe police were in a really tough spot, but I'm not going to keep offering a commentary about it."
New Liberal leader condemns protest chants
Minns' comments come after Prime Minister Anthony Albanese called on NSW Police to provide a "full explanation" over the disruption of the Muslim men praying.
"I think that is something that needs a full explanation. I know that that has caused a great deal of distress," he told the Sydney Morning Herald's Inside Politics podcast.
On Sunday, newly-elected Opposition leader Angus Taylor said people had the right to pray but police had a "tough job".
"They have been making those difficult calls, and I have great respect for the police who do that hard work," he said.
"These were protests where we heard people calling for violence," Taylor said, referring to the "Globalise the Intifada" chant.
Herzog was invited to Australia by Albanese after the Bondi Beach terror attack on 14 December, which killed 15 people when two gunmen targeted a Jewish Hanukkah event.
His visit was welcomed by members of the Jewish community mourning the antisemitic attack. It was also met with protests around the country by demonstrators against Israel's bombardment of Gaza, which has killed more than 70,000 Palestinians since October 2023, according to Gaza's health ministry.
It followed Hamas' October 7 attack on Israel in which more than 1,200 people, including an estimated 30 children, were killed and 251 hostages taken, according to the Israeli government.

'I'm tired of this crap:' Lindsey Graham attacks Gulf leaders, compares Iranian leader to Hitler

Republican US Senator Lindsey Graham expressed frustration with Gulf leaders during an interview with Christiane Amanpour at the Munich Security Conference on Friday, saying, "I'm tired of this crap."
Graham was interviewed alongside Iranian Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi and European Parliament President Roberta Metsola.
Graham claimed that the Iranian regime is currently at its weakest point and that the time has come for US military intervention promised in US President Donald Trump's January statement that "help is on the way."
He also likened Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khameini to Adolf Hitler, saying:
"Hitler wrote a book [saying that] he wanted to kill all the Jews. Nobody believed him. I believe the Ayatollah and his regime - not the Iranian people - are religious fanatics, religious Nazis. Hitler wanted a master race; they want a master religion."
He then compared Trump's "help is on the way" post to Ronald Reagan's address at the Berlin Wall in 1987, in which he famously said, "Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall!"
He clarified that both he and Trump would prefer a diplomatic solution, but the Iranian regime - which he referred to as "the mothership of terrorism" - must fall one way or another.
Asked about the possibility of someone worse than Khameini taking over Iran in the power vacuum which could result from the US dismantling the regime, Graham assured Amanpour that the likelihood of that outcome was "pretty low."
"The risk associated with a regime change is real," he admitted, "but we have troops in the region... we're still the United States... We have incredible capability. I know we would win a conflict."
If Iran's regime remains standing, Graham argued, it would be a disaster for the region, with all Iranian dissidents being killed off, and Hezbollah, Hamas, and the Houthis growing stronger over time.
He added that he is planning to visit Israel, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE this coming week, with the following message: "If we can [take down the Iranian regime] through diplomacy, fine. But we've had it with this regime. Think big...Don't let this moment pass."
Graham then addressed the rift between Saudi and Emirati leaders, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Emirati President Mohamed bin Zayed al-Nahyan.
"Knock it off, Saudi Arabia, I'm tired of this crap. MBZ is not a Zionist, and you're emboldening Iran by having this conflict. I know they've got differences in Yemen and Sudan, but we've got to think big picture."
Why are Iran and Saudi Arabia at odds?
The two Gulf powers have both been highly involved in the power struggle in nearby Yemen, each backing opposing factions.
The dispute broke into the open last year when UAE-backed separatist fighters pushed Saudi-backed forces aligned with the internationally-recognized Yemeni government out of key provinces.
In late December, Saudi Arabia struck what it said was an Emirati shipment of weapons and equipment destined for the STC, Yemen's main separatist group, at the port of Mukalla, before backing an offensive that saw the STC collapse and the UAE withdraw after nearly a decade as the main force on the ground in Yemen.
Disagreements between Riyadh and Abu Dhabi span the region and range across topics from geopolitics to oil output. The two countries are also engaged in fierce economic competition, including over who can attract more foreign capital and visitors and take the biggest share of the global AI boom.

Palestinian NGO condemns Ben-Gvir's Palestinian prisoners video
A Palestinian NGO has denounced what it called an Israeli act of revenge after a video showed far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir overseeing the abuse of detainees in a military prison.
Just days before the start of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, Ben Gvir held a tour of Ofer Prison in the occupied West Bank, Israel's Channel 7 reported.
In footage filmed on Friday and broadcast by the channel, around 20 police officers are seen storming a hallway leading to prison cells, brandishing their weapons and firing stun grenades.
They then pull five detainees from their cells, their hands tied behind their backs, forcing them face-down onto the floor.
The operation took place as a bill proposing the death penalty for Palestinian prisoners convicted of terrorism awaited a final vote in the Israeli parliament.
"This is all part of ongoing displays meant to take revenge on Palestinian detainees," Abdallah al-Zaghari, head of the Palestinian Prisoners' Club, told AFP on Saturday.
"Everything Ben Gvir and the far-right government are doing affects not only the Palestinian people and prisoners in detention camps - it also impacts the global legal and human rights system," he added.
Ben Gvir, known for his inflammatory rhetoric, is considered one of the hardest-line members of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's ruling coalition.
"It is simply a source of pride - arriving at a prison like this, a prison for terrorists, the vilest of the vile, seeing them like this," Ben Gvir said in the video.
"I want one more thing: to execute them - the death penalty for terrorists," he added.
Palestinian Islamist movement Hamas on Saturday said the remarks were "a new war crime and a blatant challenge to international humanitarian law regarding prisoners".
International rights groups have repeatedly warned of alleged abuse and mistreatment inflicted in Israeli prisons since the outbreak of Israel's war on Gaza.
While the death penalty exists for a small number of crimes in Israel, it has become a de facto abolitionist country, with the Nazi Holocaust perpetrator Adolf Eichmann the last person to be executed in 1962.

New Taliban penal code puts husbands on par with ‘slave masters’ and legalises domestic violence
United Kingdom

The Taliban has published a new penal code enshrining some of its most backward practices into the law of the land in Afghanistan, with women in particular set to suffer at the hands of the courts.
Signed by the hardline Islamist group’s supreme leader Hiabatullah Akhundzada, the 90-page criminal code includes anachronistic stipulations harking back to Islamic scripture, such as different levels of punishment depending on whether the offender is “free” or “a slave”.
It effectively creates a new caste system of upper and lower members of Afghan society, allowing religious leaders or mullahs at the top virtual immunity from criminal prosecution and setting out the harshest punishments for those of the working class.
Perhaps most alarmingly, the code effectively appears to put women on a par with “slaves”, with clauses stating that either “slave masters” or husbands can mete out discretionary punishment in the form of beatings to their wives or subordinates.
The Independent has seen a copy of the criminal code, called De Mahakumu Jazaai Osulnama, which has been distributed across courts in Afghanistan.
Many people are afraid to speak out against the code for fear of recriminations from the Taliban, even on condition of anonymity. After ripples of discontent started spreading online and via activists based outside the country, the Taliban has now issued a separate ruling stating that even discussing the new code is itself an offence, rights groups say.
The code states that corporal punishment for serious crimes will be carried out not by the correctional services, but by Islamic clerics.
It encourages less serious misdemeanours to be dealt with through a “ta’zir” (discretionary punishment) – in other words, in cases where the “offender” is a wife, a beating by her husband.
The code does provide a route to justice for women who are assaulted, but they are required to prove they have suffered serious bodily harm by showing their wounds to the judge – while at the same time being required to remain fully covered. They are also required to be accompanied to the court by their husband or male chaperone (mehram) – even though the majority of offenders in such cases are the husbands themselves.
A legal adviser working in the Afghan capital, speaking on condition of anonymity, told The Independent that women faced an “extremely lengthy and difficult” process to get justice for assaults under Taliban law.
She cited one of her recent cases where a woman was beaten by a Taliban guard during a visit to her husband in prison. When she complained to the authorities, she was told her plea would not be heard without her male chaperone being present – the husband who was behind bars.
She told them if she had a chaperone, a mehram, the Taliban guard would not have assaulted her in the first place, the legal adviser said. “She cried and shouted in the public that death is better [than the process she is going through],” she said. “It is impossible for women to get any justice for an assault that happens to them.”
It is a stark deterioration from the progress made under the previous Nato-backed Afghan administration, which had introduced tough new measures against forced marriage, rape and other forms of gender-based violence. Domestic violence against women invited punishment from three months to one year.
Under the new code, even if an Afghan woman gets through all the legal and social hurdles to prove she has been the subject of a serious assault by her spouse, the husband will be given a maximum sentence of 15 days.
The Taliban has neither condemned or explicitly prohibited physical, psychological or sexual violence against women in the new code, human rights experts told The Independent.
Rawadari, a human rights movement tracking the hardline Islamist regime in Afghanistan that mostly operates in exile, said another part of the code does not allow women to take safe sanctuary at their parents’ home.
“Article 34 states that if a woman repeatedly goes to her father’s house or that of other relatives without her husband’s permission and does not return home despite her husband’s request, the woman and any member of her family and relatives who has prevented her from going to her husband’s house are deemed criminal and will be sentenced to three months’ imprisonment,” the organisation said in a statement.
“This provision, particularly in the case of women who take refuge at their parents’ house and relatives’ homes from violence and maltreatment by their husbands, exposes them to continued domestic violence and strips them of family and community protection, the only remaining protection for women victims of domestic violence in absence of formal and legal remedies,” Rawadari said.
Shaharzad Akbar, Rawadri’s executive director, told The Independent that the code makes religious scholars responsible for enforcing systemic restrictions on the rights of women, girls and minorities, while the mullahs themselves are granted sweeping immunity from legal consequences.
The new legal system also effectively institutes a caste system in which punishment is decided not by the nature of the crime, but the social status of the criminal. At the top of the hierarchy are religious scholars, followed by the elites, the “middle class” and the “lower class” at the bottom.
If a religious scholar commits a crime, they will receive “advice” regarding their actions. A member of the social elite would receive a maximum punishment of “advice” and a court summons if needed. For the “middle class” the maximum punishment is imprisonment, while for the “lower class” it is imprisonment combined with corporal punishment.
“So the mullah is king now,” Akbar says. “The mullah calls the shots, and the mullah gets all the privileges that ordinary people can’t, because they're put even above elites.”

UK and four other European countries say Navalny was poisoned in prison
This was reported in a joint statement published on the UK government website, Ukrinform reports.
"Two years after the Munich Security Conference was shocked by the news of the leading Russian opposition figure's death, consistent, collaborative work has confirmed through laboratory testing that the deadly toxin found in the skin of Ecuador dart frogs (epibatidine) was found in samples from Alexei Navalny's body and highly likely resulted in his death," the statement said.
It was noted that only Russia had the means, motive, and opportunity to use this lethal toxin against Navalny while he was held in a correctional colony in Siberia.
"And we hold it [Russia] responsible for his death," the statement added.
Epibatidine is found in Ecuadorian frogs in the wild in South America. In captivity, the frogs do not produce this toxin, and it is not found in Russia.
"There is no innocent explanation for its presence in Navalny's body. Russia has brazenly developed and deployed this poison in violation of the Chemical Weapons Convention," the statement said.
The UK informed the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons about Russia's blatant violation of the Chemical Weapons Convention.
"Alongside partners the UK will continue to hold Russia to account for its actions," the statement added.
As reported, Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalny died on February 16, 2024, in a Russian prison colony. His wife, Yulia Navalnaya, and the politician's associates accused Vladimir Putin of orchestrating his murder.

Why it’s troubling that Hong Kong board-member pay ranges from US$850 to US$1.67 million
Far wider disparity than other markets may indicate talent issues on the low end, lack of independence on the high end, lawmaker says
The highest-paid independent non-executive director (INED) of a Hong Kong-listed company in 2024 made US$1.67 million, nearly 2,000 times what the lowest-paid INED received, drawing attention to a potential disconnect between pay and the responsibilities of the role.
The lowest-paid INED received 6,000 yuan (US$867.94) in 2024, according to a survey by the Hong Kong Independent Non-Executive Director Association (HKINEDA), which was based on the 2024 annual reports of more than 2,600 listed companies.
While some fee disparity was normal depending on specific role and skill set, the gulf among Hong Kong-listed companies was much wider than in other major markets, which could raise questions over the ability of INEDs to ensure strong governance and effective risk management, according to experts.
“Too wide of a disparity may indicate quality issues with attracting talent in the case of low fees, or a lack of independence if fees are too high,” said Robert Lee Wai-wang, lawmaker for financial services. “Striking a proper balance helps companies attract suitable personnel to join boards.”
The company with the top-paid director was United Company Rusal, Russia’s largest aluminium producer, while the company with the lowest-paid director was Haina Intelligent Equipment International, a Fujian province-based producer of automated machines for manufacturing disposable hygiene products like baby diapers, according to the survey.
Pay for the top 10 earners in the association’s survey averaged HK$4.34 million (US$555,333), 202 times the average of HK$21,466 for the bottom 10. By comparison, retainers for US S&P 500 constituents last year ranged by a factor of 12, from US$28,000 to US$360,000, according to a report by recruitment firm Spencer Stuart.

Qld premier says ramping at five-year low. The opposition’s not convinced
Ambulance ramping has fallen to the lowest level in half a decade, the state government has claimed, but the opposition says Queenslanders are still struggling to even get a hospital appointment.
Premier David Crisafulli on Sunday announced ramping reached a five-year low in the last quarter of 2025, at 37.3 per cent.
“Over the last decade, ambulance ramping has tripled in Queensland,” Crisafulli said at QEII hospital on Brisbane’s south side.
“This [the latest figure] is the best result that has been recorded in half a decade, and it shows that the changes that have been made are starting to bear fruit, but we’ve got a long way to go.”
The government claimed elective surgery waitlists remained stable at almost 62,000, which was down from 66,632 just after the election.
But deputy Labor opposition leader Cameron Dick said 300,000 Queenslanders were still waiting to get an appointment at a public hospital.
He said that number was the equivalent to the population of Townsville and Cairns combined.
He said the average monthly specialist waiting list was growing twice as fast under the LNP as it was in the last year of the Labor government.
“The LNP want to give themselves a medal today about their performance when it comes to ramping in public hospitals, but this is the oldest trick in the book,” Dick said.
“If you can’t get an appointment with a doctor, you never get your treatment journey started, and you’ll never need a hospital bed.
“Now that may open up more beds for patients coming into hospitals through emergency departments, but it leaves hundreds of thousands of Queenslanders languishing on the waitlist for the waitlist.”
Health Minister Tim Nicholls said the figures would move around, and that more work needed to be done, but the trend was in the right direction.
According to the Queensland Health data from December, patients waited 29 days for an initial specialist appointment.
The data also shows that it took 14 minutes to be seen in an emergency department. There were more than 207,000 arrivals at emergency departments across the state. The number of arrivals by ambulance was 64,625.
The figures come as the premier on Sunday marked a milestone for the QEII hospital expansion, with the top floor completed and the fitout expected to begin shortly.
The expanded hospital will bring 112 new inpatient beds, upgraded surgical facilities, and a new car park.

Gunmen kill at least 32 people in northern Nigeria, residents say
Witnesses say the motorcycle riding gunmen attacked three communities in northern Nigeria, killing and abducting dozens.
Gunmen on motorcycles have rampaged through three villages in northern Nigeria, killing at least 32 people and abducting several more, according to witnesses and local police.
The raids on Saturday in the Borgu area of Niger State came amid a complex security crisis in northern Nigeria, featuring armed groups affiliated with ISIL (ISIS) as well as gangs that abduct people for ransom money.

Wasiu Abiodun, the Niger State police spokesperson, confirmed the attack in one of the villages.
“Suspected bandits invaded Tunga-Makeri village,” he said. “Six persons lost their lives, some houses were also set ablaze, and a yet-to-be ascertained number of persons were abducted.”
He added that the assailants had moved on to Konkoso village, while details of other attacks remained unclear.
Jeremiah Timothy, a resident of Konkoso, told the Reuters news agency that the attack on his village began in the early hours with sporadic gunfire.
“At least 26 people were killed so far in the village after they set the police station ablaze,” said Timothy, adding that the attackers entered Konkoso around 6am (05:00 GMT), shooting indiscriminately.
He said residents heard military jets flying overhead.
Abdullahi Adamu, another resident of Konkoso, said 26 people were killed. “They were operating freely without the presence of any security,” he told The Associated Press news agency.
The AFP news agency, citing an unnamed humanitarian source, put the death toll in Konkoso at 38. The source said the victims were shot dead or had their throats slit.
Most of the homes in the village were burned down, and apart from those already counted as dead, “other bodies are being recovered”, the source told AFP.
The agency cited a Konkoso resident as saying that the gunmen had killed his nephew and abducted four women.
“After Konkoso, they went to Pissa, where they set a police station on fire and killed one person.”
“At the moment, many people are missing,” he said.
The AP also reported an attack in Pissa, without providing details.
The attacks in Niger State followed a deadly attack by armed fighters earlier this month in neighbouring Kwara and Katsina states that killed nearly 200 people.
The border between Niger and Kwara states is home to the Kainji Forest, a known haven for bandits and fighters, including from the armed group Boko Haram. Last October, the al-Qaeda affiliated Group for the Support of Islam and Muslims (JNIM) also claimed responsibility for its first attack on Nigerian soil, near Woro, in Kwara State.
Religious and community leaders from the Borgu area in Niger State last week called on President Bola Tinubu to establish a military base in the area to put an end to the recurring attacks, Nigerian media reported.
Nigeria is also under pressure to restore security since United States President Donald Trump accused it last year of failing to protect Christians.
Authorities, however, denied that there is systematic persecution of Christians, while independent experts say Nigeria’s security crises kill both Christians and Muslims, often without distinction.
Nigeria’s government, meanwhile, has stepped up cooperation with Washington to improve security, and in December, the US military carried out air strikes in Sokoto State, targeting what Washington said were armed fighters.

Taxi driver, 79, arrested after elderly woman knocked down in Hong Kong
Police officers arrest cabby on suspicion of dangerous driving causing grievous bodily harm, with woman taken to hospital for treatment
Hong Kong police have arrested a 79-year-old cabby on suspicion of knocking down an elderly woman with his vehicle in Hong Kong’s North Point in the early hours of Sunday.
The force said the taxi driver was driving along Java Road when he allegedly struck the 74-year-old woman as she was crossing the street shortly before 3am.
The victim, who was found in a semi-conscious state, was rushed to Pamela Youde Nethersole Eastern Hospital for treatment.
Police officers subsequently arrested the cabby on suspicion of dangerous driving causing grievous bodily harm. He is currently being held for questioning.
Authorities have faced renewed calls for stricter health checks on older cabbies after a Filipino tourist was killed last year by a taxi driven by an 80-year-old. The incident was among a series of serious accidents involving elderly drivers.
The government subsequently suggested lowering the age threshold for mandatory medical certification for commercial vehicle drivers from 70 to 65 under legislative proposals to be submitted in the first quarter of this year.

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Saturday that US President Donald Trump would prefer resolving issues with Iran through negotiated deals.
“The president has said that his preference is to reach a deal with Iran. That’s very hard to do, but he’s going to try. And that’s what we’re trying to do right now,” Rubio said in an interview with Bloomberg.
Stating that nation-states need to interact with one another, Rubio said he serves “under a president that’s willing to meet with anybody”.
“I’m pretty confident in saying that if the Ayatollah (Ali Khamenei) said tomorrow he wanted to meet with President Trump, the president would meet him, not because he agrees with the Ayatollah, but because he thinks that’s the way you solve problems in the world,” he added.
Asked about the deployment of a second US aircraft carrier to the Middle East, Rubio said Iran obtaining a nuclear weapon “will never be allowed”, calling it a threat to the US, Europe, the region and global security.
“We obviously want to have forces in the region because Iran has shown the willingness and the capability to lash and strike out at the United States’ presence in the region,” he said, noting that Washington has bases because of their alliances in the region.
“Iran has shown in the past that they’re willing to attack us and or threaten our bases,” he said, and the US has to have “sufficient firepower in the region to ensure that they don’t make a mistake and come after us and trigger something larger”.

Symbolism over strength: Costly mistake of today’s Jewish philanthropic approach - opinion

Once again, American Jews were invited to watch themselves portrayed as powerless. This time, it was by our own people, which, in many ways, makes it worse.
This year’s Super Bowl anti-antisemitism advertisement, funded by Robert Kraft’s Blue Square Alliance, was intended as a moral wake-up call. Instead, it revealed the exhaustion – and strategic bankruptcy – of an entire approach.
A Jewish boy is humiliated. He does not respond. He does not resist. He does not stand upright. He waits. His dignity is restored not through Jewish agency, but through the intervention of a kind bystander who covers the insult and offers reassurance. It is a familiar image – and that familiarity is precisely the problem.
For decades, the Jewish establishment has responded to antisemitism with awareness campaigns, slogans, symbols, and increasingly expensive acts of moral theater. The logic has remained consistent: if the world understood Jewish pain, it would stop inflicting it; if Jews were seen as wounded enough, sympathy and protection would follow.
But they never do. Antisemitism is not rising because Jews are misunderstood: It is rising because Jews are once again perceived as weak, fragmented, apologetic, and dependent on the goodwill of others. Nothing reinforces that perception more efficiently than a $15 million Super Bowl ad that trains the viewer – consciously or not – to associate Jews with helplessness.
Today's antisemitism is ideological, institutional
The antisemitism depicted in the ad belongs to another era: a slur in a school hallway, a discrete act of prejudice, a problem solved by kindness. That is not the antisemitism Jews face in 2026. Today’s version is ideological, institutional, and global. It is embedded in universities, NGOs, international bodies, digital networks, and political movements. It cloaks itself in the language of “human rights” and “anti-colonialism.” It is coordinated, normalized, and increasingly violent.
Responding to this reality with symbolism is not merely insufficient – it is delusional. This is the defining failure of the boomer philanthropic class: they are fighting the current war with the last generation’s instincts. They believe antisemitism can be managed through optics, that acceptance is the goal, and that Jews survive by being liked. Zionism was founded on the opposite insight.
Zionism did not emerge because Jews lacked sympathy: it emerged because sympathy did not save them. Max Nordau diagnosed the disease with brutal clarity, arguing that European Jewry had been physically and psychologically deformed by centuries of exile. The remedy was not persuasion, but regeneration.
“We must think of creating a Jewry of muscles,” he wrote – Jews with bodies, confidence, and self-respect equal to their intellect. Ze’ev Jabotinsky went further, rejecting the fantasy that Jews could secure their future by appealing to the conscience of others. Rights, he insisted, are not granted to those who ask nicely: they are secured by those prepared to defend them. Zionism was not a branding exercise – it was a civilizational correction, a refusal to remain small. The concept of the “New Jew” was not an aesthetic preference; it was an existential necessity. And yet, nearly eighty years after Jewish sovereignty was restored, American Jewish leadership keeps resurrecting the image Zionism was meant to bury.
Let us dispense with the fiction that $15 million is symbolic money: It is not. It is civilizational money – if used seriously. Costing a conservative $150 per hour for certified Krav Maga instruction, one weekly group class of twenty participants costs $7.50 per person. Over a full year, even after accounting for space, insurance, administration, equipment, and periodic intensive training, serious year-round self-defense instruction costs approximately $1,000 per Jew. That means $15 million could train 15,000 Jews every year – not for awareness, but for posture, confidence, and deterrence.
The same math applies to Hebrew. Meaningful Hebrew immersion – after-school frameworks, early childhood programs, or caregiver-led models – costs roughly $2,000 to $3,000 per child per year. That same $15 million could place 5,000 to 7,500 Jewish children into real Hebrew identity pipelines. This is not symbolism; it is infrastructure.
With that level of funding, one could also build leadership academies, campus legal and security response units, and a pipeline of Hebrew-speaking, self-defense-capable Jewish educators and counselors. One could begin – not complete, but begin – a genuine civilizational reboot. And at $100 an hour – easily achievable at scale – that same $15 million could train nearly 20,000 Jews a year, exposing this as a failure not of money, but of will and vision.
Instead, the money was spent on a feeling.
This was not an isolated misjudgment. It reflects an ecosystem that has learned how to monetize Jewish fear while avoiding the harder work of rebuilding Jewish strength. Large budgets, polished branding, and minimal deterrent effect have become the norm. Optics come first; capability comes last. The result is a generation of Jews trained to signal virtue rather than project confidence.
Most revealing of all is what the ad omits. There is no Zionism, no Hebrew, no Jewish peoplehood beyond injury, and no acknowledgment that Jews are not merely a religious minority but a nation with a homeland, a language, and the means to defend themselves. Zionism is absent because Zionism disrupts the victim narrative. It replaces pleading with posture and reminds Jews – and the world – that Jewish history did not end in exile.
A necessary reckoning is unavoidable – not because Jewish leaders are immoral or indifferent, but because the Jewish philanthropic industry itself was built for a world that no longer exists. It was designed for an era when antisemitism was episodic, socially embarrassing, and largely outside the centers of cultural and institutional power.
In that environment, awareness campaigns, moral appeals, and symbolic gestures made strategic sense. In today’s world – where antisemitism is ideological, normalized, and embedded in universities, NGOs, media, and political movements – they do not.
This explains the paralysis we are witnessing. The problem is not a lack of money – Jewish philanthropy in North America alone distributes billions of dollars annually, and major organizations like the ADL and JNF-USA operate on budgets approaching $100 million. The problem is design. Institutions optimized for optics and acceptance are now confronting a moment that demands strength, identity, and deterrence.
When an ecosystem with that level of capital responds to the present crisis with branding instead of backbone, the failure is not generosity, but strategic imagination. It is precisely this structural failure that makes the $15 million choice not merely misguided but emblematic.
Fifteen million dollars could have trained Jews to stand, speak, and defend themselves. Instead, it was spent teaching them how to be seen as wounded. That is not a failure of resources: it is a failure of imagination. Zionism was born to end the era of the pleading Jew. Yet here we are, spending a fortune to resurrect him on the world’s biggest stage – not because we lacked alternatives, but because we chose comfort over courage.
This was not an unavoidable mistake. The money existed. The solutions exist. What failed was not awareness, but nerve. And history has never been kind to a people who confuse sympathy with survival. No people who refuse to invest in their own strength, identity, and self-respect can reasonably expect the world to care more about their survival than they do.

Russia-Ukraine war: List of key events, day 1,452
These are the key developments from day 1,452 of Russia’s war on Ukraine.
Published On 15 Feb 2026
Here is where things stand on Sunday, February 15:
Fighting
- Russian forces launched a drone attack on the Ukrainian city of Odesa overnight on Saturday, killing an elderly woman and damaging residential buildings, Ukraine’s State Emergency Service said.
- A Russian civilian was killed in a Ukrainian drone attack on Russia’s border region of Bryansk on Saturday, according to Governor Alexander Bogomaz.
- Ukrainian forces also launched a “massive drone attack” on a village in the Russian-occupied Luhansk region of Ukraine, wounding at least 19 people, the Russian TASS news agency reported on Saturday, citing local officials.
- At least one person was wounded in a Ukrainian attack on the Russian-occupied Zaporizhia region of Ukraine, TASS reported.
- Two others were injured in another Ukrainian attack on the Russian border region of Belgorod, TASS reported on Saturday.
- NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte said Russia is suffering “crazy losses” in Ukraine, losing about 65,000 soldiers over the last two months. He also told a media roundtable at the Munich Security Conference that the NATO alliance was strong enough that Russia would not currently try to attack it.
- United States Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in Munich that Russia was losing 7,000 to 8,000 soldiers a week in its ongoing war on Ukraine.
- Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Russian attacks across Ukraine had damaged every power plant in the country, as he denounced Russian President Vladimir Putin as a “slave to war”.
Ceasefire talks

- Zelenskyy wrote on X that he had spoken by phone to US envoy Steve Witkoff and US President Donald Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, ahead of the next round of ceasefire talks in Geneva.
- Earlier in Munich, Zelenskyy voiced hope that the Geneva talks would be substantive, but added that Ukraine was being asked “too often” by the US to make concessions. He said he also wanted to hear what compromises Moscow would be ready to accept.
- Zelenskyy said he was feeling “a little bit” of pressure from Trump, who recently said the Ukrainian should not miss the “opportunity” to make peace with Russia soon, and urged him “to get moving”.
- He also accused Moscow of seeking to delay decisions by changing its lead negotiator – from the military intelligence chief Igor Kostyukov during Abu Dhabi talks to President Vladimir Putin’s adviser, Vladimir Medinsky, in the Geneva round.
- Zelenskyy said that US negotiators had told Ukraine the Russians had promised a swift end to the war if Ukrainian forces immediately withdrew from the part of the eastern Donetsk region that it still controls. Ukraine had rejected that idea and instead expressed a readiness to discuss a US plan for a free trade zone in the region, while freezing the rest of the 1,200km (745-mile) front line.
- Ukraine’s chief negotiator, Rustem Umerov, said the only two options Kyiv is willing to accept are sticking to the current lines of control or the establishment of a free trade zone.
- Zelenskyy said he hoped the US would stay involved in the negotiations and that there would be an opportunity for Europe to play a bigger role. “Europe is practically not present at the table,” he said.
- Chinese Minister of Foreign Affairs Wang Yi told his audience in Munich that he agrees with Zelenskyy’s assessment that Europe should be more involved in efforts to end the war in Ukraine.
- Zelenskyy added that Russia had to accept a ceasefire monitoring mission and an exchange of prisoners of war. He estimated that Russia currently had about 7,000 Ukrainian troops, while Kyiv had more than 4,000 Russians.
- He also suggested that Moscow was opposed to the deployment of French and UK troops in Ukraine after the war, which Paris and London have said they are willing to do, because Russia’s Putin “wants to have the opportunity to come back”.
Politics and diplomacy
- French Minister of Foreign Affairs Jean-Noel Barrot said some G7 countries had expressed a willingness to move ahead with a maritime services ban on Russian oil, and France is “reasonably optimistic a deal can be reached”. He said the EU is currently preparing its 20th sanctions package against Moscow.
- Ukraine and the International Monetary Fund agreed to ease some conditions, including sensitive tax increases, for a new $8.2bn lending programme, Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko said.
- The European Union should “bring to life” a mutual defence pact anchored in its founding treaty, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in Munich, as the regional bloc faces new threats from Russia.

Olympics
- Zelenskyy awarded a top state honour to Olympic skeleton racer Vladyslav Heraskevych, who was disqualified from the Winter Olympic Games in Italy for wearing a helmet commemorating athletes killed in the war with Russia. Speaking in Munich, Zelenskyy said he had great respect for “all the Olympians who supported you and your position”.

The British Council is preparing to shed hundreds of jobs and scale back operations across Europe as the fallout from Keir Starmer’s aid cuts collides with years of financial strain at one of the U.K.’s key soft power institutions.
The Council, which is tasked with promoting British culture and education overseas, is grappling with the looming repayment of a government loan of almost £200 million dating back to the pandemic. In the midst of bruising negotiations with the Foreign Office, it has begun formal consultations on a sweeping restructuring that could lead to around 400 roles cut across Europe and the U.K., according to four people familiar with the plans.
An internal consultation document emailed to staff and seen by POLITICO lists 784 jobs “in scope” across the U.K. and Europe, with at least 404 roles expected to be “displaced” — 15 percent of total current staff, according to one of the people familiar with the plans.

New Zealand catches flak for ‘secret’ US critical minerals talks
Opposition parties accuse the ruling coalition of keeping voters in the dark, fearing a fast track to environmental damage
Analysts say Wellington is reluctant to promote any formal agreement with Washington or invite public debate on the issue, even as both governments have confirmed that they are “exploring further opportunities” on critical minerals cooperation.
In a joint statement released after a meeting in Washington on February 2, the two sides said they would deepen collaboration on critical minerals, energy, emerging technologies and the digital economy “to ensure economic resilience and mutual prosperity”.
That commitment followed the pair’s annual “strategic dialogue”, which this year featured US Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau and New Zealand’s Secretary of Foreign Affairs and Trade Bede Corry.

Barack Obama blasts ‘clown show’ after Trump’s racist monkey video
The ex-president said most Americans ‘find this behaviour deeply troubling’ and it will hurt the Republicans in the midterm election
Former US president Barack Obama criticised a lack of shame and decorum in the country’s political discourse, responding on Saturday for the first time to a post on Donald Trump’s social media account that depicted him and his wife Michelle as monkeys.
The video shared on Trump’s Truth Social account on February 5 sparked censure across the US political spectrum, with the White House initially rejecting “fake outrage” only to then blame the post on an error by a staff member and take it down.
Near the end of a one-minute-long video promoting conspiracies about Trump’s 2020 election loss to Joe Biden, the Obamas – the first black president and first lady in US history – were shown with their faces on the bodies of monkeys for about one second.
Obama responded to the video for the first time in an interview with left-wing political podcaster Brian Tyler Cohen released on Saturday.
“The discourse has devolved into a level of cruelty that we haven’t seen before … Just days ago, Donald Trump put a picture of you, your face on an ape’s body,” Cohen said in the interview.
“And so again, we’ve seen the devolution of the discourse. How do we come back from a place that we have fallen into?”

'Don't be the generation to stuff it up': The reality of running the family business
Unknown

From succession planning to inherited debt, there's pressure and joy in taking on a family business
Sam Mackaway's future has been planned for as long as he can remember.
"I always wanted my family to grow up on a farm," he says.
He's a third-generation cattle farmer in Walcha, New South Wales, and now with a young family of his own, he's realising his dream.
"The property's been in our family for 27 years. It's 2,800-and-a-bit acres and a beautiful part of the world to raise my kids," he tells ABC iview's Muster Dogs.
Eventually, Mackaway will inherit the family business, but it comes with conversations about succession, debt and leaving his mark.
According to the Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman, seven out of 10 businesses in Australia are family-owned.
While family businesses are in every industry, 25 per cent of workers are in agriculture, forestry and fishing.
Corrina Wright is the sixth generation to run her family's business, Oliver's Taranga Vineyards in McLaren Vale, South Australia, and says it's a privilege to continue the legacy.
"You're very lucky that you've landed in the spot where you are and being able to be part of such a long family lineage," she says.
"But then there's a little bit of pressure in that, because you don't want to be the generation to stuff it up."
Eyes on the future
While Mackaway always knew he wanted to settle on the farm, he had to work hard to earn his place.
"My brother and I got told when we were younger that we needed to go and do something before we came back to the farm, we needed to get a trade or go to uni or just do something, because anything that you come back with to the farm helps," he says.
"I was quite keen on becoming a sparky [electrician], so I moved away and did that. I don't use it every day, but I use it quite a lot on the farm, just being able to make stuff."
Despite the generations of knowledge passed down, Mackaway knows he needs to look to the future if he wants the business to thrive for years to come.
In doing so, he's introduced modern technology into his day-to-day work.
"I'm driving around in a tractor with a GPS and auto steer, whereas Dad's driving around in a tractor just using his eyes, trying to see the lines," he says.
While his father is an expert in using machinery to move cattle, Mackaway has taken on the challenge of learning how to introduce working dogs onto the farm.
He's also introducing a data-tracking system to streamline his processes, which will enable him to track cattle weights and growth, as well as lineage and which bulls are working with which cows.
"I'm a few weeks away from releasing a farm management app. We do have a fair few headaches just tracking our cattle."
In Wright's family business, each generation has brought its own focus to the business. In her case, it was expanding from just selling grapes to starting their own brand.
"You've gone from a business that didn't really care about what happened at the farm gate, your grapes were gone, and you didn't need to worry about marketing or any of that sort of stuff," she says.
"Now you're running a business that can employ a whole pile of different people, not just tractor drivers, and you've got customers coming to you, and you've got marketing to do, you've got design and social media and all those sorts of things — the generational difference is huge."
Those changes took a little while to get used to.
"The pressure back in the early days was to not stuff that up and to respect the family name that was going on a wine label," Wright explains.
"Now I feel a bit more proud that our generation has been able to contribute significantly to assisting the business and strengthening it into the future as well."
Planning ahead
Every five years, Mackaway sits down with his family to discuss succession planning.
His father's own experience has influenced the handover process with his son.
"My grandfather decided that he wasn't ready to retire. He wanted to keep going for a bit longer, and Dad thought, 'I'm going to be 65 by the time you want to retire and not run [the] place how I want to run it'. So he's very aware of that in the discussion about succession planning."
But while family businesses can bring some challenges, Mackaway says having family support has offered vital help with the costs of expanding and setting up the property he owns with his wife, Laura.
"As long as we're happy to all work together, we can get that debt down a lot quicker than if Laura and I were to move away and do our own thing. That'd take us a long time."
For Wright, she says it's been important to have advisers who are non-family members, to keep their vision on track — but she's looking forward to creating opportunities for more family members in the future.
And while past generations were limited to farming work, roles could now be anything from a graphic designer to a lawyer.
"Legacy just means we've left it in a better spot than what we received it," Wright says.
Her daughter is already working for the company one day a week.
Meanwhile, for Mackaway and prospects of a fourth generation in the business, only time will tell.

An explosion of jazz-era decadence, this Gatsby is one wild party, old sport
THE GREAT GATSBY ★★★★
Playhouse, QPAC, until March 8
The Great Gatsby turned 100 last year, and the novel’s vision of an apocalyptic void at the heart of the American Dream seems to be reaching an apotheosis in 2026.
In the character of lovelorn bootlegger Gatsby squandering his wealth on debauched Long Island parties, it’s hard not to think of tech billionaires foisting their unhealthy products on a bewildered populace and using the proceeds to fund narcissistic schemes while the planet burns.
Not that this new stage adaptation, a co-production of Queensland Theatre and local independents Shake & Stir, indulges in any tricksy updating, apart from a few techno dance sequences. It’s rather a faithful, fast-moving rendition that explodes with Jazz Age decadence and is fleshed out with witty dialogue courtesy of co-adaptors Daniel Evans and Nelle Lee.
The human drama hits harder here than in Baz Luhrmann’s 2013 version, but the film’s sensory overload is clearly a touchstone. Co-directors Evans and Nick Skubij offer enough sumptuous staging to equal the images that F. Scott Fitzgerald’s masterpiece conjures in the mind’s eye, from orgiastic New York speakeasies to desolate dump the Valley of the Ashes. It’s a showcase for designer Christina Smith, whose sets and costumes conjure the 1920s with hyper-real brilliance.
Of particular note is the use of computer-controlled black screens that facilitate quick scene changes and concentrate the field of vision: at times the action seems to take place within a square silent-film ratio.
The endearingly nervy Ryan Hodson (Shake & Stir’s Fourteen) has the arduous task of playing Fitzgerald’s narrator, Nick Carraway, and is barely off stage for over two hours. Carraway is the bonds salesman and would-be writer who moves to Long Island after serving in the war and stumbles into the love triangle between his waifish cousin, Daisy (Jess Vickers), her bigoted and abusive husband, Tom Buchanan (Jeremiah Wray), and the mysterious millionaire Gatsby (Shiv Palekar).
Nick’s PTSD is made palpable by the presence of a shadowy soldier in a doughboy helmet dogging his heels. In the title role, pink-suited Palekar gets a flamboyant entrance befitting his iconic status, but the character’s flimsy aspirations are soon apparent in Palekar’s aptly boyish and tentative performance. (You can read what you like into the casting of an Indian-born actor as the object of the racist villain’s scorn.) As his old-money nemesis Buchanan, the towering Wray is a proto-MAGA bully, but an equally lost soul: having played the creature in Shake & Stir’s Frankenstein, Wray has a way with piteous monsters.
The production brings two of the female supporting roles to life impressively. As the pansexual lady golfer Jordan Baker, Libby Munro is the very image of a 1920s garconne, and her banter with the smitten Nick, daring him to take a “big swing”, is priceless. Nelle Lee plays Buchanan’s reckless mistress, Myrtle Wilson, and imbues her with Cyndi Lauper vibes. Musical theatre star Loren Hunter, meanwhile, augments Guy Webster’s excellent score with powerful renditions of period songs like I Get Along Without You Very Well (Except Sometimes).
Evans’ emerging vision for Queensland Theatre seems to be as a timely interpreter of familiar IP. (His triumphant staging of Aaron Sorkin’s A Few Good Men last year sadly dovetailed with the death of the film version’s director, Rob Reiner.) This makes him a kindred spirit to Brisbane independent success story Shake & Stir, adaptors of everything from Dickens to Dahl, and future collaborations seem like a done deal. Can you repeat the past? Sure you can, old sport.

Russia promotes 'territorial' peace scenario without security guarantees for Ukraine – ISW
The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) stated this in an article, Ukrinform reports.
Analysts highlighted reports from Western media that the U.S. allegedly agreed to Russia's demand for Ukraine to cede part of its territory before receiving official security guarantees, and that the U.S. would not conclude a security agreement with Ukraine until Ukraine and Russia reach a peace agreement.
The report notes that the Kremlin continually tries to portray territory as the only remaining important issue in negotiations, while presenting Ukraine as an intransigent party refusing to cede land that Russian forces could not capture by force. At the same time, Russia itself refuses to compromise on its territorial claims.
"The Kremlin has been publicly focusing on territory in part to distract from its own rejection of any meaningful Western security guarantees for Ukraine," the analysts said.
They believe Russia is unlikely to agree to any security guarantees for Ukraine, even if Ukraine cedes territory. Thus, agreements Russia insists on—and reportedly accepted by the U.S.—would effectively force Ukraine to capitulate on critical territorial issues without any guarantees against future Russian aggression. A peace agreement acceptable to Russia would undoubtedly include territorial provisions according to its current demands, and reports that the U.S. will not sign a security agreement with Ukraine until the country agrees to cede territory mean that territorial terms would take effect before any U.S.-Ukraine security guarantees are implemented, without any assurance that Russia will honor them. This sequence of agreements poses a high risk of leaving Ukraine "exposed" to a renewed Russian attack without military support guarantees from the U.S. or other partners to deter or respond to such an attack.
"The Kremlin likely sees an opportunity to manipulate the US-led negotiations process into another means through which Russia can achieve its unchanging military and political objectives, which it has failed to achieve in nearly four years of war. Russia's demand that Ukraine withdraw from the remainder of Donetsk Oblast without preconditions and the Kremlin's rejection of a ceasefire to conduct negotiations are further evidence that Russia will accept nothing short of its full war demands," the analysts concluded.
As Ukrinform reported, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called on the Trump administration to increase pressure on Russia to end the war, and suggested that Congress might need to vote to strengthen any postwar security guarantees for Ukraine.

Will a new government breathe life into Thailand’s gasping cannabis industry?

Will a new government breathe life into Thailand’s gasping cannabis industry?
Bangkok: If you’ve spent any time on the streets here in the last few years, you would have almost certainly caught the unmistakable waft of marijuana. Maybe you even indulged, and why not? It has been legal, after all.
When Thailand removed cannabis from its narcotics list in 2022 – the first Asian country to do so – 18,000 or so marijuana parlours popped up around the country.
The shops were everywhere, like pubs in London. And if you didn’t smell them first, you couldn’t miss their flashing green neon signs in the shape of a marijuana leaf.
The idea behind decriminalisation was to boost Thailand’s brand as a wellness destination, give farmers a new cash crop and free up space in overcrowded prisons.
Coming out of the COVID-19 pandemic, it seemed just the trick. Tourism makes up roughly 15 per cent of Thailand’s GDP.
Tycoon turned pro-business politician Anutin Charnvirakul was the champion behind decriminalisation. If that name sounds familiar, it’s because he has been Thailand’s prime minister since September, essentially in a caretaker role.
On Sunday, his Bhumjaithai Party surpassed all expectations to win the most seats in the country’s snap elections, meaning he’s almost certain to stay in the job.
On the face of it, this would be a positive for the cannabis industry’s long-term health, no?
Well, not necessarily.
The cannabis trade has been a debacle of the former government’s own making. With few regulations in place, it boomed in 2022, becoming an out-of-control beast that ensnared previous non-users, including minors.
Family holidaymakers, meanwhile, were turned off because who wants to be walking the kids through streets thick with the smell of drugs?
A local backlash followed and, midway through last year, the ruling Pheu Thai party declared that cannabis could be sold only to someone with a doctor’s prescription. The burgeoning industry was decimated overnight.
Shops were already struggling because there was too much low-priced cannabis, too many outlets and too few customers. Many closed. Some began looking the other way on prescriptions, spawning a black market that operates not just in plain sight, but under big glowing signs.
Survival has meant new strategies. One shop in the Sukhumvit area, for example, redesigned its frontage to resemble a pharmacy.
I ask the server, Ramil, 26, if Bhumjaithai romping home in the election (though the party still needs to cobble together a coalition) is good news for the industry.
“Maybe,” he says, with an inflection of enthusiasm. “We’ll just have to see.”
It has been a tough game for a long time now, he says. Cannabis flooded the market in 2022, cutting profit margins. “And then maybe it stabilised. But then with the prescriptions, that hurt.”
The most novel approach I’ve seen is at a shop called Cloud Nine, also in Sukhumvit.
On the footpath outside, an A-frame sign declares “free prescription with every purchase”.
We asked the friendly, English-speaking server what it’s all about. (English speakers are vital because the customers are mostly foreigners, with Australians high on that list.)
It’s all very simple, she says, asking not to be named or photographed.
“If you purchase the flower, you’ll be consulting with a doctor. The doctor will diagnose you, asking ‘what do you need it for and how much do you need?’.”
Then, hey presto, a prescription!
There’s no in-house doctor, she says. It’s a telehealth hook-up to a nearby clinic.
Does the doctor ever say no? “Not really,” she says.
There’s no need to book in advance and the whole process takes just a few minutes.
“We won’t sell without [a] prescription. That’s the golden rule here,” she says.
“Talking to my customers, a lot of them say, ‘Oh, why do we have to do it here? Other shops, they don’t do it’. But we’re doing it the right way.”
She says she has no idea whether Bhumjaithai will do away with the prescription law introduced by the previous government.
It seems unlikely. Though we could not get a response from Bhumjaithai amid its post-election bargaining with other parties, Anutin has previously argued that the loosening of the laws was always focused on medicinal marijuana, rather than recreational, use.
No party wants to touch the law now. Surveys show the overwhelming majority of Thais don’t want recreational cannabis use legalised in their country.
Meanwhile, even tourism bodies, concerned at losing high-value family holidaymakers, support reclassification. Visitor numbers in Thailand remain below pre-COVID levels.
Thousands of Thais invested their savings to open cannabis businesses that have already closed their doors. Others cling on precariously.
The Thai government’s experiment with marijuana has not only been sloppy. For some people, it has been a disaster.

‘Makes our city less liveable’: Residents win fight against 24/7 Barangaroo venue

‘Makes our city less liveable’: Residents win fight against 24/7 Barangaroo venue
A plan to boost Sydney’s 24-hour economy has hit a major obstacle, with the NSW government scaling back plans for around-the-clock trading at a new $100 million inner-city cultural venue after the proposal sparked a wave of community objections over late-night noise.
The NSW government has walked back a contentious trading plan for The Cutaway cultural hub in Barangaroo after the site was earmarked for 24/7 operations as part of broader push by Premier Chris Minns to “bring Sydney back to life”.
When completed this year, The Cutaway will include multiple event spaces carved into the headland beneath Barangaroo Reserve, with room to host large art installations, performances, festivals, concerts, gala dinners, fashion shows and events including Vivid Sydney.
But less than a year after the 24/7 operating hours were proposed, those plans have been scaled back, with most events to be capped at midnight, with limited exceptions for major occasions such as New Year’s Eve.
Originally, Placemaking NSW, the government agency overseeing the development, argued that 24-hour operations would advance the state’s vision to boost nightlife, tourism and Sydney’s global standing.
The venue’s location next to Barangaroo Metro station was cited as a major advantage, allowing for extended trading supported by improved public transport access.
The proposal quickly drew objections from residents of high-rise towers and community groups in Barangaroo and Millers Point. Concern centred on the cumulative impacts of late-night events, particularly noise, crowd control and disruption to residential amenity.
Anne Crabb, president of the Millers Point Community Resident Action Group, said the scale and design of the venue heightened those fears.
“Unlike current 24/7 venues such as The Crown casino and The Star, this is a huge and open cavernous space located on the harbourfront,” she said.
“Barangaroo can and should be a vibrant cultural precinct, but this must not come at the expense of our long-standing residential community who will have to deal with the late-night impacts.”
Resident Rosalind Lehane said uninterrupted sleep would be jeopardised under a 24-hour trading model.
“The proposed changes to The Cutaway of 24-hour noise and vibration are incompatible with this aim,” she said.
Strata representatives from neighbouring towers also raised concerns about the venue’s acoustic design. Strata managing agent Kate Maclachlan warned that the semi-enclosed structure could amplify sound and create “reverberation” impacts.
In a submission to the NSW government, Robert Spears claimed noise levels could be comparable to a “Formula One grand prix race”.
“If you wanted to devise a scheme to make our city less liveable than it already is, then you would come up with this new Cutaway proposal,” he wrote.
In response to what planning documents described as “strong concerns”, Placemaking NSW has scaled back the operating hours to 8am to midnight. Some noise controls will be applied from 10pm.
Event patrons will be directed toward Barangaroo and Wynyard Walk, rather than through residential streets in Millers Point, and integrated ticketing will be encouraged to promote use of the metro.
Business Sydney executive director Paul Nicolau described the decision to wind back the 24-hour operations as “disappointing”, arguing the city needed more late-night venues to counter the lingering effects of the pandemic and increased working from home.
“If you choose to live in Barangaroo – in the heart of a global city – a level of noise should be expected,” he said.
“We desperately need to ensure there are enough venues and facilities that are open 24/7.
“The venue could have hosted overnight concerts, creative events or live broadcasts of international sporting competitions. At the very least we should have given it a trial.”
He said expanding public transport to 24-hour operations could have also supported the safe dispersal of late-night crowds.
NSW 24-Hour Economy Commissioner Michael Rodrigues had supported the original operating hours, saying extended trading would facilitate a diverse range of events and encourage tourism.
In revised plans, Placemaking NSW said the midnight finishing times would provide “a more clearly defined and constrained operating regime that balances the role of The Cutaway as a thriving, unique and industry-leading cultural venue with the need to protect the amenity of surrounding residential areas.”
A spokeswoman said operations would begin with a three-month trial and that trading hours “may be further relaxed to support what Sydneysiders and visitors are seeking”. The changes remain subject to final approval from the NSW Department of Planning.
The NSW government is taking steps to enhance the nighttime economy through reforms that have included simplified noise regulations, support for outdoor events and improvements to liquor licensing.
Construction of The Cutaway is more than 85 per cent complete and the first events are expected to start by July.

Liberals beware: voting One Nation often leads to Labor governments

Opinion
Liberals beware: Voting One Nation often leads to Labor governments
On a sweltering summer’s day last month, the political tribes gathered at St Stephen’s, Brisbane’s Catholic cathedral, to commit Ron Boswell to eternal rest. Most of the important figures in non-Labor politics, past and present, were there. So too were Labor politicians, including Anthony Albanese, who had graciously approved a state funeral. John Howard delivered the eulogy.
Bozzie, as he was universally known, was an immensely popular figure. He was a National Party senator for over 31 years: only five other people since Federation served in the Senate for longer. Although defined by his deep social conservatism, he had friends across the political spectrum. While his disposition was generous and avuncular, he was also fearless to the point of ferocity in standing up for the things he believed in.
That fearlessness was never more on display than in his attitude to One Nation. He absolutely loathed them – not just for the threat they posed to his beloved National Party, but for the cheap populism, the ersatz conservatism which he saw as an insult to genuine conservatives such as him. In his eyes, they were charlatans, hucksters, political snake oil salesmen.
As was typical of so forthright a politician as Ron Boswell, he believed that the only way to deal with One Nation was head-on. No pulling of punches. No weasel words. No mealy-mouthed compromise. Boswell would not have a bar of the race-baiting and prejudice-mongering that were – and still are – One Nation’s brand. He called them out for what they are – just as, in the 1980s, he had taken the fight to another racist right-wing movement, the League of Rights.
Boswell’s Senate campaign in 2001 has entered the folklore of Australian politics. One Nation had achieved great success at the Queensland state election of 1998, winning 11 seats and paving the way for years of Labor state governments. (Conservative apologists for Pauline Hanson, please note: if you vote One Nation, you usually end up with a Labor government.) Three years later, Hanson turned her eyes to the Senate. He was her target.
Boswell campaigned on the slogan “He’s not pretty but he’s pretty effective”. (He did himself less than justice; he had a face full of character, although he always did look like an unmade bed.) He took to the highways and byways of Queensland – right into the heart of some of the most ultra-conservative parts of Australia – to evangelise his message that One Nation had no answers to the issues that troubled them. He won, and so stopped the early rise of One Nation in its tracks. It would be 15 years until Hanson found her way into the Senate.
As Ron Boswell showed, the way to deal with One Nation is not to chase it in a race to the political bottom. You’ll never out-Pauline Pauline, and it is a fool’s errand to try. And, in the process, you lose middle Australia.
It is particularly important for the new Liberal leadership to remember that. Angus Taylor has already identified immigration as one of his key issues. It is perfectly appropriate – indeed timely – for a debate about population policy. I have no doubt that the public is up for just such a debate.
Inevitably, Labor and the Greens will misrepresent that legitimate national discussion as Hansonism lite, as dog-whistling. That makes it all the more essential for Taylor to demonstrate, as he addresses an issue of genuine concern to both Hanson supporters and many other Australians as well, that he has absolutely no time for One Nation and the type of politics it practises. To have a sensible national debate on immigration is not to be a pale echo of One Nation, but the surest way for Taylor to protect himself from that calumny is to take the same approach as Ron Boswell so successfully did.
On 7.30 last Friday, Tony Abbott – who was in the late 1990s tasked by Howard to kill off One Nation in its infancy – claimed that it is a different party than it was 30 years ago. It isn’t. One of the very reasons for Hanson’s success has been her consistency. Ever since the day in 1996 when she used her maiden speech to claim that Australia was “in danger of being swamped by Asians”, One Nation has been an overtly racist party. It is core to its brand. There is no subtlety or ambiguity about it: Pauline doesn’t do dog-whistling.
Her messaging has never changed. Even her gimmicks are the same: only three months ago, she reprised the burqa stunt, which she first tried in the Senate in 2017.
As I said on that occasion, it is perfectly possible to be a good law-abiding Australian and a strict adherent Muslim. It is as unjust to taint half a million Australian Muslims with the criminality of the Islamist extremists who exist within their community as it was, in the sectarian Australia of a century ago, for Protestants to stigmatise Irish Catholics as disloyal, because of a few Fenian revolutionaries in their midst.
Of course, Pauline Hanson has every right to prosecute her views. Her supporters have every right to vote for her. That’s the way free societies work. But Liberal leaders have to be prepared – as Boswell did – to call out One Nation for what it is. Keeping a fastidious distance, but otherwise remaining silent, won’t do.
As his coffin, draped in the Australian flag he loved so much, was borne from the church, the congregation rose as one to sing that fine old hymn Be Not Afraid. Ron Boswell wasn’t afraid of anything – or anyone. He certainly wasn’t afraid of Pauline Hanson.
George Brandis is a former high commissioner to the UK and a former Liberal senator and federal attorney-general.

Fans who raised Greenland's flag at US-Denmark Olympic hockey game say it was a pro-European gesture
Two fans who raised a flag of Greenland as the United States played Denmark in men’s hockey at the Winter Olympics say they did so as a gesture of European support for the island and for Denmark

Two fans who raised a flag of Greenland as the United States played Denmark in men's hockey at the Winter Olympics Saturday in Milan say they did so as a gesture of European support for the island and for Denmark.
Vita Kalniņa and her husband, Alexander Kalniņš — fans of the Latvian hockey team who live in Germany — held up a large red and white Greenland flag during warmups and again when the Danish team scored the opening goal of the preliminary round game against the U.S., which ultimately beat Denmark 6-3.
"For us as Europeans it was important to show up (with) this symbol as a symbol of a European unity that we support Greenland,” Kalniņš told The Associated Press.
Trump’s rhetoric in recent weeks about taking control of Greenland has stirred up national pride in Denmark, which oversees the semiautonomous island, as well as support from across the European continent.
Yet inside the hockey area on Saturday, Kalniņa and Kalniņš say they were told by venue staff that they could not continue to hold up the flag, even as American flags were waved throughout the stands.
“He said it was due to safety reasons, because there could be American aggressive people,” Kalniņš told The Associated Press.
Kalniņa and Kalniņš complied because they wanted to watch the game. After all, they said, they'd made their point because anyone inside the arena — and those watching on TV — had already seen the flag.
“I think the message was sent,” Kalniņš said.
The Greenland flag’s status at the Games is unclear because Greenland doesn’t participate with its own team. Greenlandic athletes, such as biathlete siblings Ukaleq and Sondre Slettemark, compete as part of Denmark's team.
A guide on the official Olympic website for the opening ceremony specified that fans can only bring “flags of countries and territories participating in the Games.”
Greenland is a self-governing territory of the kingdom of Denmark.
Kalniņa and Kalniņš said they want Greenlanders to know that Europe supports the Arctic island whether it stays a part of Denmark or ultimately chooses full independence.
“It’s not OK that Trump and America are this aggressive and try to incorporate the island into their country,” Kalniņš said
Meanwhile, the Danish athletes playing in the so-called “Greenland Derby" said politics never made it to the ice.
As for the strained relationship between the U.S. and Denmark, “we didn’t even mention it” within the team, captain Jesper Jensen Aabo said. “We just wanted to win a hockey game against a world-class team. We didn’t need extra fire to fire us up. We were ready for the game even though there’s stuff going around in the real world, so that’s nothing that affected us at all.”
The captain said the players did not notice the Greenland flag in the stands.
“I didn’t see it, but that was nice,” Jensen Aabo said. “So hopefully they supported us.”
Other American and Danish fans who watched their teams face off said they believe sports transcends politics amid recent tensions between their governments over Greenland.
“It doesn’t matter whatever sport it is — it could be tennis, it could be bobsledding, it can be ice hockey, it could be football — it has nothing to do with politics," Danish fan Dennis Petersen, his face covered in red and white paint to symbolize the kingdom's flag, told the AP ahead of the game. "They are athletes, not politicians.”
American fan Rem de Rohan, sporting a stars and stripes jacket, agreed that politics should be left at the stadium gate.
“I think this is the time for people to kind of put that down and compete country versus country and enjoy," he said. “We love rooting on every country that’s been here.”

Trump administration sued after taking over DC public golf courses
The president, an avid golfer, has begun moves to take control of Potomac Golf Links and other public courses, arguing that they are in need of significant refurbishment

A pair of golf enthusiasts have sued the Trump administration over a plan to overhaul a public golf course in Washington D.C. to make way for a new “world-class” green, championed by the president.
Dave Roberts and Alex Dickson, who are bringing the lawsuit, say the Interior Department has overlooked important health reviews when moving forward with the project that would see East Potomac Golf Links remade, The Washington Post reports.
Trump, who is an avid golfer, has begun moves to take control of Potomac Golf Links and other public courses, arguing that they are in need of significant refurbishment.
“We’re going to make it a beautiful world-class U.S. Open-caliber course,” the president told reporters in January. “Ideally, we’re going to have major tournaments there and everything else. It’s going to bring a lot of business into Washington.”
Last year, the Interior Department terminated the lease of the National Links Trust which managed the Potomac Golf Links site and two other courses, clearing the way for the spaces to be taken under federal control.
Roberts and Dickson’s suit echoes concerns that should the courses fall under the control of Trump and his allies, the course will become much less accessible. Though specific plans have not yet been revealed Trump has suggested he would totally rebuild the course, which has views of the Washington Monument.
“East Potomac Golf Links is a testament to what’s possible with public land and why public spaces matter,” Roberts said in a statement shared with The Post. “It deserves better than becoming a dumping ground for waste and yet another private playground for the privileged and power.”
The lawsuit aims to halt any reassignment of the course’s lease before a full review, citing potential violations of the National Environmental Policy Act, the National Historic Preservation Act and the Administrative Procedure Act.
It also alleges a violation of a congressional act that called for the park on which the course is built to be “forever held and used as a park for the recreation and pleasure of the people.”
The DC Preservation League, a nonprofit that advocates for protecting historic sites, has also attached itself to the suit, The Post reports.
The Independent has contacted the Interior Department for comment about the lawsuit brought by the golfers.
Trump already owns golf clubs around the country and the world, with courses in Florida, New Jersey and Scotland and has made extensive use of them since returning to office in January last year.
The website didtrumpgolftoday.com was launched in order to track the number of days the president has spent on the course, noting that by July 2025, Trump had spent around a third of his time back in office playing golf.
As of Saturday, according to the site Trump has golfed 93 days out of 392 days since returning to office, calculated to be around 24 percent of his time. It has also cost the taxpayer an estimated $130,200,000.
While the president has been said to play quite well, there have long been allegations that he receives some assistance, with some even going so far as outright accusing him of cheating.

‘Major downfall’: Concerns for people with disabilities as council moves to sell care centre

‘Major downfall’: Concerns for people with disabilities as council moves to sell care centre
There are fears the lives of vulnerable adults with disabilities will be upended after the City of Stonnington council voted to sell off a prized pocket of land in Melbourne’s south-east used by a much-loved disability centre and food bank.
Thirty-six adults with disabilities attend the Fisher Street Centre in Malvern East for care and activities, and the centre has over decades developed into a tight-knit community that families say has given purpose to their loved ones.
However, it’s set to shut, the building demolished and the land subdivided after the council this month unanimously approved the sale.
Elena Christie’s brother, Damien, 55, has a high-needs disability and she fears he could become non-verbal when the centre closes, as he was heading down that path before first attending about a year ago.
Damien attends four days a week and Christie said her brother had become noticeably more chatty and animated since making many friends there.
“Damien will actually lose probably the most important thing for him in terms of his outward look onto life,” Christie said.
“I know it sounds overblown, but his reason for living may totally digress – I can see a major downfall for Damien’s life.”
Damien’s father, Peter, cares for both his wife, Jean, who is on dialysis, and their son.
The Christies fear that once the centre closes, Damien would end up watching television all day at home instead of participating in activities, as alternative NDIS services highlighted by the council don’t suit his needs.
Care provider Mecwacare has for years paid a peppercorn rent to the council to use the building for disability programs, including life skills such as cooking, handling money, communications and other activities. The centre is also used by the Malvern Emergency Food Program.
‘Don’t take this from them. They have nothing else in their lives but each other.’A submission to the City of Stonnington on the closure of the Fisher Street Centre
Council documents say there is “low usage” among Stonnington residents, as just four people involved with disability programs lived in the municipality at mid-2025.
During last Monday’s council meeting, councillor Jami Klisaris said selling the land was a very difficult decision, but it was not a site Stonnington had a use for.
She said the council was reassessing old agreements amid a “tightly constrained budget environment” and rent for the facility paid to the council was essentially $10 a year.
“At the end of the day, the City of Stonnington is not an NDIS provider,” Klisaris said.
The land was originally two separate blocks measuring about 655 square metres each, and while the value of each block has not been made public, a nearby four-bedroom property on similar-sized block sold for more than $3.6 million in April 2025.
Proceeds from the sale of the Fisher Street Centre will go to the council’s future fund to pay for infrastructure projects.
The council last year received 44 submissions about the proposed sale, and the majority made public opposed the move.
“Don’t sell it, it’s my favourite place in the whole world,” one participant said in a submission.
One worker wrote: “Don’t take this from them. They have nothing else in their lives but each other.”
‘At the end of the day, the City of Stonnington is not an NDIS provider.’City of Stonnington councillor Jami Klisaris
Some family members of participants said they would have to reduce or stop working to care for their loved ones, and they were stressed by the challenge of finding alternative services.
Deirdre McNally, who lives nearby, said she wished the centre could stay as it is, but hoped that it would become a community centre if used for another purpose.
“To sell off something like this just to make money is just a slap in the face,” McNally said.
Steven Lambert, Mecwacare’s executive director of client experience and growth, said the council offered the service provider the chance to buy the land, but Mecwacare’s capital was “fully committed elsewhere” so it declined.
Stonnington Mayor Melina Sehr said the council carefully considered a range of options including ways to support services continuing at Fisher Street.
Sehr said there was no offer to bump up the rent as Mecwacare had already indicated an “intention” to transfer the service to another external provider.

They’re loving it: How McDonald’s drove the biggest increase to their restaurants in two years
Restaurant chain is tapping into nostalgia and value, reviving its Monopoly game promotion in October after nearly a decade
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
McDonald’s is welcoming more customers and seeing sales climb as its value meals, discounted combos, and fun limited-time deals bring budget-savvy diners back through the doors, company officials have revealed.
U.S. sales for the fast-food giant jumped 6.8 percent in the fourth quarter, well above analysts’ 4.9 percent expectation, according to the company’s earnings release. Executives credited lower-priced deals and promotions for driving traffic, particularly among lower-income customers who have been hardest hit by inflation, according to CEO Chris Kempczinski.
“As I’ve said before, and I will say again, McDonald’s is not going to get beat on value and affordability,” Kempczinski said during an earnings call Wednesday, Restaurant Business reports. “It’s in our DNA, and we remain agile to respond as appropriate to a dynamic, competitive landscape.”
Holiday-themed promotions also gave the chain a merry boost. In December, McDonald’s Grinch-themed meal generated what executives described as "the highest single sales day in history."
The company has also leaned into a mix of nostalgia and affordability to win back customers. In October, it revived the popular Monopoly promotion after nearly a decade, turning meal purchases into a chance to win prizes.
In September, McDonald’s ramped up its value strategy by slashing prices on U.S. combo meals, adding to earlier 2025 discounts like the McValue menu. The return of $2.99 Snack Wraps in July also helped strengthen the chain’s value appeal.
Industry analysts say that while these promotions are effective, consistency will be key, as consumers remain selective about where they spend their money.
McDonald’s approach stands out in an industry where many U.S. restaurants struggle to maintain foot traffic. Lower-priced chains, in general, have fared better than higher-end competitors as diners continue to trade down in response to inflation and tighter budgets.
Other fast-food chains are seeing similar trends. Taco Bell reported a 7 percent increase in same-store sales in the latest quarter, while KFC posted 3 percent growth, according to parent company Yum Brands.
Meanwhile, higher-priced chains like Chipotle saw a 1.7 percent sales decline earlier this month, highlighting how consumers are gravitating toward more affordable options.
The renewed momentum is translating into stronger-than-expected financial results across the industry. Discount-driven traffic not only brings diners back through the door but also boosts overall profits. Analysts say these patterns underscore the importance of strategic pricing and promotions, particularly in a challenging economic environment.
McDonald’s fourth-quarter global comparable sales rose 5.7 percent, exceeding expectations, while adjusted earnings beat Wall Street estimates as revenue topped $7 billion, according to the earnings report. Growth was not limited to the U.S. as steady demand in international markets, including Britain, Germany and Australia, also contributed.
Moving forward, McDonald’s plans to build on its value-focused strategy while expanding beverage offerings. The company is introducing cold coffees, crafted sodas, and energy-style drinks to encourage repeat visits, especially among younger consumers.
A new McCafé-branded drink lineup is set to launch in the U.S. and select international markets this year, following a successful 500-store test that exceeded expectations, company officials said.

Obama deplores lack of shame after Trump’s racist monkey clip
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
WASHINGTON – Former US president Barack Obama criticised a lack of shame and decorum in the country’s political discourse, responding on Feb 14 for the first time to a post on Mr Donald Trump’s social media account that depicted him and former first lady Michelle as monkeys.
The video shared on Mr Trump’s Truth Social account on Feb 5 sparked censure across the US political spectrum, with the White House initially rejecting “fake outrage” only to then blame the post on an error by a staff member and taking it down.
Near the end of a one-minute-long video promoting conspiracies about Mr Trump’s 2020 election loss to Mr Joe Biden, the Obamas – the first black president and first lady in US history – were shown with their faces on the bodies of monkeys for about one second.
Mr Obama responded to the video for the first time in an interview with left-wing political podcaster Brian Tyler Cohen released on Feb 14.
“The discourse has devolved into a level of cruelty that we haven’t seen before... Just days ago, Donald Trump put a picture of you, your face on an ape’s body,” Mr Cohen said in the interview.
“And so again, we’ve seen the devolution of the discourse. How do we come back from a place that we have fallen into?”
Without naming Mr Trump, Mr Obama responded by saying that the majority of Americans “find this behaviour deeply troubling”.
“There’s this sort of clown show that’s happening in social media and on television, and what is true is that there doesn’t seem to be any shame about this among people who used to feel like you had to have some sort of decorum and a sense of propriety and respect for the office, right? That’s been lost.”
Mr Obama predicted such messaging will hurt Mr Trump’s Republicans in midterm elections and that “ultimately, the answer is going to come from the American people”.
Mr Trump has told reporters he stood by the thrust of the video’s claims about election fraud, but that he had not seen the offensive clip at the end.
ICE criticism
Turning to Mr Trump’s policies, Mr Obama criticised his immigration crackdown in Minnesota and blasted the conduct of agents during the controversial weeks-long operation that was brought to an end this week.
Mr Obama called the behaviour of federal officers, which included two fatal shootings that sparked mounting pressure on Mr Trump’s mass crackdown, as the sort that “in the past we’ve seen in authoritarian countries and we’ve seen in dictatorships”.
Thousands of federal agents – including those with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) – carried out weeks of sweeping raids and arrests in what the Trump administration claims were targeted missions against criminals.
“The rogue behaviour of agents of the federal government is deeply concerning and dangerous,” Mr Obama said.
But he added he had found hope in communities pushing back against the operations.
“Not just randomly, but in a systematic, organised way; citizens saying ‘this is not the America we believe in’, and we’re going to fight back, and we’re going to push back with the truth and with cameras and with peaceful protests,” he said.
“That kind of heroic, sustained behaviour in sub-zero weather by ordinary people is what should give us hope.
“As long as we have folks doing that, I feel like we’re going to get through this.”
The aggressive immigration operation in Minnesota had triggered large protests and nationwide outrage.
The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) was subject to a partial government shutdown on Feb 14 as US lawmakers fought over funding the agency overseeing much of Mr Trump’s immigration crackdown.
Democrats are opposing any new DHS funding until major changes are implemented over how ICE conducts its operations. AFP

US deports 9 to Cameroon despite court protections, NYT says

Feb 14 - The Trump administration secretly deported nine people to Cameroon, despite many of them having U.S. court protections against such action and none of them hailing from that African nation, the New York Times reported on Saturday.
Several of the men and women sent to Cameroon on a January 14 flight from Alexandria, Louisiana, did not know their destination until they were put on a Department of Homeland Security flight and placed in handcuffs and chains, the newspaper said, citing government documents and attorneys for the deportees.
DHS, the State Department and Cameroon's Ministry of External Affairs did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment. Reuters could not immediately reach attorneys representing the detainees.
The administration of President Donald Trump has not announced any deal in which Cameroon agreed to accept deportees from other nations. REUTERS

Danish PM says Trump's 'desire' to own Greenland persists
Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said Saturday she believed US President Donald Trump still desires to own Greenland despite dialling back his recent threats to seize it by force.
Asked at a security conference in Munich if Trump still wanted to own the Arctic island, Frederiksen said: "Unfortunately, I think the desire is the same."
Trump's designs on Greenland have caused tension to soar between the United States and Europe.
Last month, he backed down from his threats to seize the island, an autonomous territory of ally Denmark, after striking what he called a "framework" deal with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte.
But relations have remained strained.
"Everybody asks us, do we think it's over? I mean, no, we don't think it's over," Frederiksen said, participating in a panel discussion on Arctic security.
Trump insists mineral-rich Greenland is vital for US and NATO security against Russia and China as a melting Arctic opens up and the superpowers jostle for strategic advantage.
Frederiksen and her Greenlandic counterpart, Jens-Frederik Nielsen, said the pressure on the island's people was "unacceptable".
But Nielsen said "some steps" had been taken "in the right direction".
A US-Denmark-Greenland working group has been established to discuss Washington's security concerns in the Arctic, but details have not been made public.
"We now have a working group, it's good. We will try to see if we can find a solution... But of course, there are red lines that will not be crossed. And we will stick to our strategy," Frederiksen said.
The remarks came after Frederiksen and Nielsen had a 15-minute meeting with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Friday on the sidelines of the security conference, which Frederiksen afterwards described as "constructive".

China’s box office presales topped 200 million yuan (US$28.9 million) by Saturday ahead of the coming Lunar New Year holiday, led exclusively by domestic productions – a decline of more than 60 per cent from about 600 million yuan over the same period last year, according to Taopiaopiao, the online ticketing arm of Alibaba Pictures.
Presales are closely watched by distributors and investors as an early indicator of holiday audience demand.
Long seen as a crucial pillar of China’s film market, the Spring Festival season is facing cautious expectations for its 2026 releases, analysts said.

The holiday season’s box office has expanded dramatically over the past decade, growing from 336 million yuan in 2011 to over 9.51 billion yuan (US$1.37 billion) last year – accounting for nearly one-fifth of annual takings and becoming a crucial determinant of the industry’s full-year trajectory.
That success has also raised the bar. The 2025 Spring Festival season shattered multiple records in China’s film market, attracting 187 million film-goers, making it one of the strongest holiday performances in China’s film history.

A single domestic animated feature, Ne Zha 2, defined that peak, with 4.8 billion yuan in holiday takings. The film not only captured a dominant share of season revenue but also contributed about 30 per cent of China’s annual box office in 2025.
Against that high base, the overall supply for this year’s Spring Festival season has yet to show comparable breakout potential, independent film producer and commentator Guan Zhi said.

These are the games Nintendo hopes will help make Switch 2 its biggest ever hit

These are the games Nintendo hopes will help make Switch 2 its biggest ever hit
The Switch is officially Nintendo’s best-selling game machine of all time, second only to Sony’s landmark PlayStation 2 for overall sales. And the follow-up Switch 2 is off to a good start, moving more than 17 million units in its first half-year to become the fastest-selling game system ever.
But with global component shortages, rising prices and slow adoption of the Switch 2 from some major game-makers, Nintendo faces serious challenges in keeping the momentum up throughout 2026.
Announcing the latest sales figures recently, president Shuntaro Furukawa said the rising price of memory — driven by the AI boom — wouldn’timmediately affect the Switch 2 price, which is currently $700, but an increase may happen eventually.
“We do not expect major impact during the fourth quarter of this year. However, from the next fiscal year onward, if this price hike lasts longer than anticipated, it could potentially put pressure on our profitability,” he said, according to Bloomberg.
So, what does the company have planned for 2026 to keep demand high enough to counter the headwinds?
Nintendo’s own offerings
With 155 million Switch consoles sold, Nintendo and other game publishers are keen to continue selling games on the eight-year-old device. Indie games and less graphically intensive games in particular continue to release for the original Switch, and also work on Switch 2. But slowly and surely, players will be encouraged to upgrade to the more expensive and much more powerful new machine.
Nintendo’s approach with its own software is to introduce some games that are exclusively for Switch 2, and some that work on either console but are significantly better on the beefier hardware, while also issuing free and paid updates that bring new Switch 2 features to older games.
Animal Crossing: New Horizons, which was a huge driver of sales for Nintendo during the COVID lockdowns, received an update recently that bumps the game’s graphics up to 4K, makes use of the Switch 2’s mouse-style controls and microphone, and expands the multiplayer features. Next month, a Switch 2 update for Super Mario Bros. Wonder will add extra characters, modes, levels and minigames.
The advantage here is that the upgrade to Switch 2 gets more appealing the more original Switch games a person has, especially in the case of games like Super Mario Odyssey where the improvements are free. But it also means some games getting more expensive; if you don’t already have Mario Bros. Wonder and want to buy it with the Switch 2 content included, it will cost $110.
At a recent event at Nintendo’s Melbourne headquarters I was able to play early versions of some new and upcoming games. Mario Tennis Fever is exclusive to Switch 2, and it turns tennis into a party game akin to Mario Kart or Super Smash Bros, with powerful racquet effects and weird optional rules on certain courts giving players heaps to keep track of.
On the other hand, Pokémon Pokopia is clearly aiming for the broadest possible audience and is coming to both Switch and Switch 2. Co-developed by The Pokémon Company, Game Freak and Koei Tecmo, it blends the collecting of Pokémon and the social nature of Animal Crossing with the building recipes of Minecraft, but with the addition of some story elements to follow. Players take the role of a shape-shifting Ditto which has chosen the form of a human, and work to make a barren world habitable for a range of friendly creatures. It’s surprisingly engrossing, and could turn out to be one of the year’s sleeper hits.
Later in the year Nintendo is planning to release all-ages platformer Yoshi and the Mysterious Book, anime tactics RPG Fire Emblem: Fortune’s Weave, and multiplayer action adventure The Duskbloods, from the developer of Dark Souls and Elden Ring From Software. The three are exclusive to Switch 2. The company often also announces new games before mid-year.
The wider ecosystem
As development of big-budget games has moved to more capable hardware, including the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X, fewer have been released on the low-powered original Switch. The extra grunt of the Switch 2 could potentially correct that, but many major studios are yet to announce their blockbuster games for the portable system. Some analysts point to reports that Nintendo was unable to furnish many studios with Switch 2 hardware ahead of its launch.
Major third-party games planned for, or recently released on, Switch 2
- Square Enix’s Final Fantasy VII Remake, with sequel Rebirth coming in June.
- Ubisoft’s Assassin’s Creed: Shadows and Star Wars Outlaws.
- Microsoft’s South of Midnight, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, Fallout 4 Anniversary Edition and Oblivion Remastered, all due this year.
- Anticipated James Bond game 007 First Light, Sega’s Yakuza Kiwami 3, and Capcom’s Resident Evil Requiem will all launch on Switch 2 at the same time as other platforms in the coming months.
- Resident Evil 7 and Village are arriving along with Requiem.
- EA and 2K’s licensed sports games are supported on the system.
- Cyberpunk 2077 and Street Fighter 6 were included at the system’s launch.
- Elden Ring is due to arrive this year.
At the event I was able to preview a pair of upcoming Capcom games; Resident Evil Requiem and Pragmata. These are games that would never have been able to run on the original Switch, but on Switch 2 they feel great and are visually impressive. If you had this version of Resident Evil side-by-side with a PlayStation 5 Pro running it at 4K and 60 frames per second with ray tracing, you’d immediately spot that the Switch 2 isn’t hitting the same resolution, performance or settings. But then a Switch 2 is almost half the price, and has the advantage of portable play. Both games looked awesome on the small handheld screen.
So the issue currently isn’t that the console is underpowered, but keen gamers still can’t be assured the titles they’re excited for on PC and consoles will come to Switch 2, purely because it would be an extra lift for studios that plan their releases years in advance. It’s a catch-22, but more players may have to invest in Switch 2 before the studios consider it worth their while.
Meanwhile, Nintendo continues to expand its brand in all directions, outside new release games. A second Super Mario movie hits cinemas this year, with a live action Legend of Zelda currently filming. The Pikmin Bloom smartphone app, a take on Pokémon GO which encourages users to explore by walking, is going strong after five years. And the company runs a subscription on Switch and Switch 2 that gives families access to classic games originally published in the ’80s, ’90s and 2000s.
The latest console added to this collection, the Virtual Boy, is notable because it was originally a financial disaster. The heavy and headache-inducing 1995 VR headset sold less than a million units, had 22 games published for it and was pulled from shelves within a year, with Nintendo all but refusing to acknowledge it until recently. Next week, subscribers will be able to play games from the worst-selling Nintendo system ever on the best-selling, with Virtual Boy on Switch and Switch 2.
In my brief testing of the system, which requires a sold-separately viewer you slide your console into (Nintendo is selling both a $140 replica of the original headset and a $30 cardboard version), I was surprised to find the games still feel novel and interesting. They’re monochrome, but the 3D visuals work. Smart filters and display options make them comfortable to look at, and it’s all a reminder of what’s changed and what’s stayed the same in the past 30 years.
If half a per cent of the Switch and Switch 2 audience get a new Virtual Boy, it will have reached more players than the original did back in the day.

Taylor, Hume vow to lower taxes, flag budget cuts

Taylor, Hume vow to lower taxes, flag budget cuts
Updated ,first published
The Coalition’s new leadership will seek to win back a reputation as the party of lower taxes and better economic management after former leader Peter Dutton nixed their tax cut proposals before the last election.
Opposition Leader Angus Taylor and deputy Jane Hume said on Sunday they wanted to return their party to its roots and reprioritise boosting productivity, leaving the door open to budget cuts.
The pair held the shadow treasury and finance portfolios at the last election, when the Coalition under Peter Dutton opposed Labor’s marginal tax cut and suggested the money be spent on defence instead. Taylor immediately conceded after ousting former leader Sussan Ley on Friday that policy had been a mistake and began pitching a directional change.
“All Liberals know instinctively that the Liberal Party should always be, and must always be, a party of lower taxes because we know that when taxes are lower, Australians get a chance to get ahead,” Jane Hume told ABC’s Insiders on Sunday. “We know when taxes are lower, the economy grows without creating inflation.”
Taylor identified the lack of tax cuts as a bad call in his first press conference as leader on Friday, and on Sunday said the best place to find money was through a non-inflationary, fast-growing economy.
Asked about Dutton’s decision to oppose Labor’s tax cut, Taylor said: “I proposed a way forward with lower personal income taxes, and that is already something I’ve put on the record.”
“We need to convince Australians that we will be the party of lower taxes, and we will take a strong, strong policy package to the next election,” Taylor said, speaking separately on Sky News.
“Under Labor, we are seeing rising personal income taxes. I mean, they carry on about how they’re bringing down personal income taxes. Well, fine, we made a mistake in the election campaign. But let me tell you, when inflation rages – and it goes up as it is under this hopeless treasurer – people pay more taxes as a proportion of their income,” he said.
Taylor said he had always advocated for lower taxes. Niki Savva, a columnist for this masthead, has reported Taylor and Hume had wanted to offer their own tax cut as a contrast to the surprise $5 a week tax cut Albanese revealed in the March budget last year. Dutton, according to Savva, was not interested in Taylor’s plan to offer a tax-back guarantee for those forced into a higher tax bracket by inflation.
Taylor also denied he had worked to undermine Ley when he was on her frontbench.
“I sought to be a supporter of her leadership every single day,” Taylor told Sky News. “We got to a point… where the view of the party room (was that) there needs to be a reset.”
While Taylor and Hume were on Sunday reluctant to detail policy so soon after taking control of the party, Hume said they would oppose any plan to reducing the capital gains tax discount – something neither Treasurer Jim Chalmers and Prime Minister Anthony Albanese have denied.
This masthead revealed the government was considering a cut in the CGT concession as part of a broader tax reform package aimed at helping younger Australians to buy their own home.
“That discussion has been had in the party room for some months,” Hume said. “Whether it be changes to negative gearing, whether it be changes to capital gains tax… Liberals know instinctively, when we talk to each other, that we are a party of lower taxes, and that if you tax something, there is less of it.”
“If you tax residential housing, there will be less of it. That would be a disaster. No one has yet come out and demonstrated that a wholesale change to capital gains tax on residential housing will create more houses or provide more rental opportunities for rental houses for those that are yet to purchase their first home.”
Hume would not commit to any specific tax reforms but conceded “more of the same clearly isn’t good enough”.
“I’m not making policy on the run on Sunday morning, 48 hours after I’ve become deputy leader,” she said. “Angus Taylor and I instinctively will always say lower taxes are better than higher taxes, and they’re better for all Australians.”
Hume, who will get to choose her portfolio, foreshadowed an economic role.
“I am particularly interested in making sure I have an opportunity to talk about what’s important to me, which is making sure that we have a far more productive economy,” she said.
Albanese attacked the new Coalition line-up on Sunday, saying his government would in July deliver the $5 a week tax cut they promised in the last election and one next year “after Angus Taylor led the charge to not only suppose but to say that he would legislate, if he hadn’t been elected treasurer in the election less than a year ago, that he would legislate to actually increase taxes for all 14 million Australians”.

When prayer is weaponized: Preserving faith’s sincerity in a politicized world - opinion
Unknown
Unknown Publisher

What is prayer?
The Oxford Dictionary defines prayer as “spoken or unspoken words addressed to God, specifically to give thanks or ask for help.”
It is a simple definition, almost disarmingly so.
Words spoken. Words unspoken. Gratitude. Need. A reaching upward or inward.
The late Rabbi Jonathan Sacks described prayer as “the food of the soul.”
For several years now, I have been teaching a class on tefilah – the Jewish word for prayer. Like so many things in Jewish life, the Hebrew word carries more depth than its English counterpart. Tefilah shares a root with lehitpalel, a reflexive verb – to judge oneself, to examine oneself.
'Allowing God to speak to us'
Prayer, in Judaism, is not merely speaking to God: It is allowing God to speak to us. It is introspection wrapped in liturgy; it is vulnerability structured into words.
My life has been immeasurably enhanced by teaching this class – not only by my own preparation but, even more so, by the insights of my students. They ask questions I would never have thought to ask. They challenge assumptions I did not realize I held. They remind me that prayer is not an abstract theological exercise but a lived human experience.
Last week, I began teaching a new class to my Nigerian friends – about whom I wrote in these columns back in September (see link below).
None of them came with preconceived Jewish notions about prayer. I asked each one a simple question: “What does prayer mean to you?”
The responses were beautiful.
“Prayer comes from the heart.”
“Prayer is a deep connection to a greater and higher being.”
“Prayer lights up my life and lightens my burden.”
There was no cynicism. No politics. No performance. Just sincerity, longing, and hope.
Prayer, in their words, was light.
And then, almost jarringly, I read of the events surrounding the visit of President Isaac Herzog to Sydney.
The president had traveled to show solidarity with the devastated Bondi community following the horrific Hanukkah massacre.
It should have been a moment of collective mourning and moral clarity.
Instead, it became something else.
A protest march to the NSW State Parliament had been banned by police and the ban upheld by the court.
Despite this, the march went ahead.
When police attempted to enforce the law and prevent the illegal procession, violence erupted.
And then something extraordinary happened.
Members of the Muslim crowd suddenly dropped to their knees to pray.
Let us be clear: this was not a spontaneous realization that the time for prayer had arrived.
It was not an urgent, unrepeatable moment of religious devotion.
It was an orchestrated act – a calculated tactic.
Prayer was weaponized.
Instead of being a bridge to heaven, it became a shield against law enforcement.
Instead of being an intimate act of humility before God, it became a public relations tool.
There was mock indignation that the police had the temerity to remove illegal protesters while they were “praying.”
The footage is painful to watch. As officers tried to perform their civic duty, screams were hurled at them: “They are f**ing praying. F** off and leave them to pray!”
The profanity is not the worst part. The tragedy is deeper.
Prayer – something sacred, something intimate, something that countless human beings across faiths have clung to in moments of despair – was reduced to a stick with which to beat the police.
When prayer is used this way, it strikes at the very heart of all faiths.
I have stood in hospital corridors as families whispered Psalms while waiting for news of a loved one.
I have seen soldiers murmur words of faith before going into danger.
I have watched parents pray for their children, their lips barely moving, their eyes moist with hope.
No cameras. No slogans. No choreography.
Just fragility.
To cynically twist such a moment into a political tactic defiles not only one religion but the very concept of faith.
It cheapens every sincere act of devotion.
It makes prayer suspect.
It turns the sacred into theatre.
And perhaps worst of all is the self-righteous indignation that accompanies it. “How could the wicked police interrupt a prayer session like this?”
It is a moral inversion.
If prayer is sacred, then it must be sincere.
If it is sincere, it cannot simultaneously be a calculated strategy.
One cannot both manipulate and sanctify at the same time.
Of course, public prayer has its place.
Judaism itself mandates communal prayer. We gather three times a day. We stand together; we respond together.
Faith is not purely private.
But communal prayer is meant to elevate the public square, not hijack it.
It is meant to remind us that there is something higher than politics, not to serve as a political weapon.
The Talmud tells us that prayer without intention – kavanah – is like a body without a soul.
What we witnessed in Sydney was worse. It was a body deliberately animated for effect. It was prayer emptied of its transcendence and filled with tactical purpose.
That should disturb every person of faith – Muslim, Jewish, Christian, or otherwise.
Because once prayer becomes a tool, it loses its purity.
Once it becomes a shield for lawlessness, it ceases to be a submission to God and becomes an assertion of power.
And power dressed up as piety is among the most dangerous of human combinations.
The irony is that the Nigerian students in my class, thousands of miles away, understood prayer more profoundly than those who weaponized it in Sydney.
“Prayer lights up my life and lightens my burden,” one of them said.
Light. Burden. Connection. Heart.
There is humility in those words.
True prayer diminishes the ego. It does not inflate it.
It softens anger. It does not harden it.
It opens us to accountability. It does not insulate us from it.
When I stand in synagogue and whisper the silent Amidah prayer, I am not making a statement to the world: I am confronting myself. Have I lived up to who I am meant to be? Have I shown kindness? Have I acted justly?
Prayer is precious precisely because it is vulnerable.
It is the admission that I am not self-sufficient. That I need help. That I am not the center of the universe.
To weaponize and politicize prayer is to sink to new depths. It is to take something luminous and use it as camouflage. It is manipulation draped in sanctity.
We must call it out – not out of hostility to any faith, but out of loyalty to all faiths.
If prayer means anything, it must mean sincerity. If it is to remain sacred, it must be protected from being twisted into a tactic.
Otherwise, the next time someone kneels in genuine anguish, or bows their head in quiet gratitude, we will all be poorer – because we will wonder whether we are witnessing devotion or strategy.
Prayer deserves better than that – and so do we.

West’s role in bloody coup in Ukraine must be remembered — Peskov

MOSCOW, February 15. /TASS/. The bloody coup in Ukraine was orchestrated by the West, and it is important not to forget this, Russian presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in an interview with TASS.
"After 2014, everything changed. Events in Europe, in Eastern Europe, in Ukraine. The organization of a violent, bloody state coup in Ukraine by Western countries with the direct participation of the US, the UK, France, and Germany — all of them took part in organizing this coup and we must remember this," the Kremlin spokesman stressed.
In 2014, a coup took place in Ukraine following a three-month standoff between supporters and opponents of European integration, which became known as the "Euromaidan." President Viktor Yanukovych was removed from power. The population of the southeastern regions, predominantly Russian-speaking, refused to support Ukraine’s new authorities. A referendum was organized in Crimea, and as a result, in March 2014 Crimea and Sevastopol were reunified with Russia.
In the spring of 2014, the self-proclaimed Donetsk and Lugansk People’s Republics, not controlled by Kiev, were declared in the Donetsk and Lugansk regions. In response, the Ukrainian authorities accused the population of Donbass of "separatism" and launched a military operation in the region, which escalated into full-scale hostilities. Over the eight years of the armed conflict, around 14,000 people were killed.

Syria FM says talks with Israel exclude occupied Golan Heights
Syrian Foreign Minister Asaad al-Shaibani said on Saturday that negotiations on a security deal with Israel were focused on areas Israel has recently occupied and excluded the broader issue of the occupied Golan Heights.
Since the 8 December 2024 overthrow of Syria's longtime ruler Bashar al-Assad, Israel has sent troops into a UN-patrolled buffer zone that separated Israeli and Syrian forces on the Golan Heights.
Israel captured most of the plateau from Syria in the 1967 War and later illegally annexed the areas under its control, in a move not recognised by most of the international community.
Israel and Syria's new authorities have held several rounds of direct talks in recent months, and after negotiations in January - and under US pressure - they agreed to establish an intelligence-sharing mechanism as they edged towards a security agreement.
When asked at the Munich Security Conference about the scope of the talks with Israel, Shaibani said discussions were on "the withdrawal of Israel" from Syrian territory occupied after Assad's ousting, "not from the Golan Heights, and this is another issue".
To reach a security deal, Israel should "respect the security of Syria and withdraw from these territories" recently occupied, he added.
"These negotiations will certainly not lead to forcing an acceptance of the fait accompli imposed by Israel in southern Syria," he said.
"The end of these negotiations will be the withdrawal of Israel from the areas where it advanced" since December 2024, and with Israel refraining from "interfering in Syria's internal affairs" and sovereignty, Shaibani added.
Israel, which has demanded a demilitarised zone in southern Syria, has also launched hundreds of strikes on its neighbour and has carried out regular incursions.
Shaibani on Friday met US Secretary of State Marco Rubio in Munich and discussed a recent agreement between Damascus and the Kurds.
Mazloum Abdi, chief of the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), was also in attendance.
Syria's government and the Kurds last month signed an agreement to gradually integrate Kurdish forces and institutions into the state, after the SDF ceded territory to advancing government troops.
Shaibani told the Munich conference that the Rubio meeting involving Abdi "confirms the new mindset Syria is adopting today".
"We do not view our national partners as enemies," he said, adding that the country's national identity is "completed by Syria's diversity".
The US military said on Friday it had completed the transfer of thousands of Islamic State group suspects, including many Syrians, to Iraq, after they were held in Kurdish-run prisons in northeast Syria for years.
Shaibani said Damascus was "prepared in future to take back" Syrian detainees "to ease the burden on Iraq".

US military used Anthropic's Claude AI in Maduro abduction raid: report

The US military used Anthropic’s AI model Claude during the operation to capture Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, The Wall Street Journal reported on Saturday.
The report, citing anonymous sources, stated that Claude was used via Anthropic’s partnership with Palantir Technologies, a contractor for US defence and federal law enforcement agencies.
Following the raid, an employee at Anthropic asked a counterpart at Palantir Technologies how Claude was used in the operation, according to the report.
Anthropic became the first known AI developer whose technology was used in a classified operation by the US Department of Defense, though it remains unclear how the tool, capable of tasks from analysing PDFs to guiding autonomous drones, was deployed.
A spokesperson for Anthropic declined to comment on whether Claude was used in the operation, said the report.
“Any use of Claude — whether in the private sector or across government — is required to comply with our Usage Policies, which govern how Claude can be deployed. We work closely with our partners to ensure compliance,” the spokesperson told the newspaper.

Israel-aligned Gazan militia operating in Rafah tunnels, aim to disarm Hamas - report

Ghassan Duhine, head of the Abu Shabab militia in the Gaza Strip, revealed that his forces were operating within Hamas tunnels in Rafah, KAN News reported on Friday.
According to a Thursday Facebook post from Duhine, the anti-Hamas militia has begun dismantling the tunnels, which they consider to be the most impactful weapon Hamas possesses. "Afterwards," he added, "we'll destroy weapon manufacturing, rockets, and finally move onto guns."
Earlier this week, KAN also confirmed that Abu Shabab, also known as the Popular Forces, would be involved in the security protocols surrounding the recently-reopened Rafah Crossing.
IDF kills four Hamas terrorists who tried to cross Israeli defense lines from Rafah tunnel
Hamas terrorists used a tunnel to try to penetrate Israeli defense lines in Gaza, the IDF announced on Monday.
The attempt was made in eastern Rafah, which is within the Israeli side of the Yellow Line, the 53% of the Gaza Strip is currently under IDF control.
During the incident, four Hamas terrorists exited a tunnel and opened fire on the 7th Armored Brigade.
The soldiers returned fire, killing the four attackers.
It was unclear whether the Hamas move was a coordinated attack or the fighters had been hiding in the tunnel areas in Rafah for months and were slowly cornered by ongoing IDF tunnel-clearing activities until they were forced out in the open.
What is the Abu Shabab group?
Abu Shabab, named for their founder, Yasser Abu Shabab, is an anti-Hamas, Israel-aligned resistance group operating within the Gaza Strip.
Ghassan Duhine took over leadership of the group after Yasser Abu Shabab died in December, when he was killed while trying to solve a local clan dispute, not by members of Hamas.
The group's stated goal is "to meet the need for civilian protection, humanitarian aid distribution, and securing areas that will not fall victim to terror or local extremism," Abu Shabab said in a conversation with Walla before his death.
"We will protect civilians, create international pressure, and push for an end to the violence that no one wants to escalate."

Italy may join Trump's Board of Peace as observer – Meloni
According to Ukrinform, Bloomberg stated this in an article.
In an interview with local media, Meloni said Italy was invited as an observer country to the Board of Peace meeting scheduled in Washington on February 19.
"I believe an Italian and European presence is necessary, so I think we will respond positively to this invitation," she said.
According to her, Italy will likely participate in the Board's work as an observer.
It is noted that the creation of the Board of Peace was a key element of Trump's 20-point plan, which helped achieve a ceasefire in the war between Israel and Hamas in October.
In January, Meloni said she would not immediately sign the Board’s charter as a member, signaling that it could create legal risks.
"Some elements are incompatible with our constitution," she said at the time.
As Ukrinform reported, the EU has questioned the new U.S. peace initiative for Gaza, citing Trump's effectively unlimited powers on the Board of Peace and the concentration of authority in a single person's hands.

Trump’s Valentine’s Day cards feature Maduro, Greenland and boasting
The messages praised the president’s achievements, derided Democrats and made fun of Secretary of State Marco Rubio
US President Donald Trump on Saturday celebrated Valentine’s Day by sharing a series of cards that praised his accomplishments while predictably slamming Democrats and even poking fun at his own secretary of state.
The cards, posted by the White House on social media, kick off with a picture of a handcuffed and blindfolded Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro following his capture from his country in January.
It is made to look a classic Valentine’s Day card, with the phrase: “You captured my heart.”
Next, there’s a photo of Senator Chris Van Hollen meeting former ICE detainee Kilmar Abrego Garcia in El Salvador. The caption reads: “My love for you is as strong as Democrats’ love for illegal aliens. I’d fly 1,537 miles to have a drink with you!”
Trump also shouted out Greenland on another Valentine’s Day card.
“It’s time we define our situationship,” it says, alongside an image of the semi-autonomous Danish territory framed in a heart.

Opinion | How recent graduates entering the job market can outperform AI
As automation erodes cognitive and interpersonal skills, those who embrace the struggle of enhancing offline reasoning will thrive
Artificial intelligence (AI) is eroding the very capabilities young professionals need to remain valuable in a machine-automated era. That is the real challenge facing graduates entering the workforce. It is not simply a case of AI destroying jobs – though it is – but that it is undermining our cognitive and interpersonal skills.
Hiring managers make decisions based on economics, not social good. They need to be convinced that a young human worker is a better investment than a machine. Many employers are reluctant to bet on people with no practical experience and no domain knowledge.
Management may prefer to upskill experienced staff to use AI to do more of what they already do. A perceived preference for job-hopping among younger workers only compounds the disincentive. This conforms to our experience as a small company paying high Hong Kong rents.
The “productive struggle” of thinking through hard problems, failing, retrying and eventually making breakthroughs has always been at the core of genuine learning. That this struggle is increasingly bypassed is what keeps educators and developmental psychologists awake at night. It’s also what troubles managers when junior staff expect work to be easy. The friction of navigating daily life, of developing street smarts, is being removed for AI natives.

Thousands rally for Iran regime change in cities around the world
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
MUNICH, Germany – Protesters demanding regime change in Iran converged on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference on Feb 14, a day after US President Donald Trump said a change in government would be the best outcome for a country reeling from deadly unrest.
Earlier in February, Mr Reza Pahlavi, the son of the country’s deposed shah and an opposition figure in exile, had encouraged protesters to take to the streets on Feb 14 to put pressure on the Iranian government. Speaking at the Munich conference on Feb 13, Mr Pahlavi renewed an appeal for American intervention in Iran.
Large demonstrations also took place in other cities across the globe, including Melbourne, Athens, Tokyo and London.
Nuclear talks between the United States and Iran were expected to resume on Feb 17 in Geneva, according to two US officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive diplomacy.
Mr Trump has ordered warships to the Persian Gulf, signalling readiness for a potential strike should the negotiations collapse.
Around 200,000 people attended the protest in Munich, according to Ms Tamara Djukaric, a spokeswoman for the city’s police, where Mr Pahlavi, along with US Senator Lindsey Graham, addressed the crowd.
Many demonstrators waved a version of the Iranian flag that bears a lion-and-sun motif, which was in use before the 1979 revolution that ousted the shah.
Some carried images of Mr Pahlavi and chanted phrases like “Regime change in Iran”, while others wore red baseball caps emblazoned with the phrase “Make Iran Great Again”, a reference to the hats worn by supporters of Mr Trump.
During a visit on Feb 13 to troops in Fort Bragg, North Carolina, Mr Trump said that replacing Iran’s current leadership would be “the best thing that could happen”, adding that “for 47 years, they’ve been talking and talking and talking”.
The demonstrations across the globe came after weeks of protests in Iran that began in late December 2025 over economic issues and broadened into a nationwide movement challenging the country’s authoritarian clerical rulers. Security forces crushed those demonstrations with deadly force, killing thousands.
In London, a number of protesters took to the streets carrying photographs of family members or friends who they said were killed or detained during the recent unrest. Some staged mock killings, while others chanted slogans denouncing the government, including “Death to Khamenei”, a reference to Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran’s Supreme Leader. NYTIMES

Brisbane outranks Sydney, Melbourne as world’s most family-friendly city
Brisbane parents can sit at home with a smile on their face, knowing their kids are growing up in the world’s most family-friendly city.
New data from Compare the Market analysed green spaces per capita and safety to identify the top cities in the world to raise a family. Brisbane, which scored 6.4 out of 10, ranked the highest of 50 cities, with Sydney coming fifth and Melbourne seventh.
Filling out the rest of the top five were London, Auckland and Helsinki.
Brisbane had 84.89 parks and playgrounds per 100,000 people, compared to Sydney’s 7.62, Melbourne’s 2.73, and London’s 30.49.
“Brisbane’s many parks and playgrounds, including the beautiful South Bank precinct, Roma Street Parklands and the Botanic Gardens (of which the city has two), are a highlight and offer families with children wonderful outdoor play time,” Compare the Market’s James McCay wrote alongside the data.
In terms of safety, Brisbane was trumped only by Helsinki in Finland, which scored 95 to Brisbane’s 90. This score was based on resident safety polls and police crime reports.
The River City, however, had far fewer activities for kids – 107 – while Sydney and Melbourne boasted 246 and 166, respectively.
Brisbane’s high ranking is the latest accolade for the Queensland capital, which has previously been lauded as one of the world’s 50 most extraordinary destinations, one of the top 20 friendliest cities, and with the world’s second-best cost of living.
To highlight our family-friendly status, here are some free activities in the Brisbane region to add to your list of weekend adventures.

French gaming giant Ubisoft's future uncertain despite steady third-quarter 2025 results

When announcing Ubisoft's latest results, CEO Yves Guillemot did not hide his satisfaction: "We delivered a solid third-quarter performance (...) exceeding our expectations." In fact, compared to the same period in 2024, revenue remained stable at €318 million between July and September 2025, while "net bookings" – an indicator close to revenue – rose by nearly 12% year-on-year, reaching €338 million.
Is this enough to reassure markets? Not necessarily. Shares of the French video game giant bounced back slightly on Thursday, February 12, closing at €4.17. But the value remains far from the more than €95 reached in August 2018 or the €85 mark it crossed in January 2021, buoyed by the appeal of video games during Covid-19 lockdowns. Since then, the stock price has only continued to decline.
Amid a toxic workplace environment and a series of unfortunate strategic choices, Ubisoft has lost its way over the past five years. After the disappointing reception of games like Star Wars Outlaws in 2024, the abrupt discontinuation of XDefiant six months after its launch that same year, and the outright cancellation of new titles, the company found itself forced to implement cost-cutting measures since 2023: €300 million in cumulative savings across 2023 and 2024, then another €200 million announced for the 2026-2027 period on January 21, 2026. This period of austerity has included workforce reductions, with several studios shut down abroad (San Francisco in California, Osaka in Japan, Halifax in Canada, etc.), and now, a plan to cut 200 jobs at its headquarters in Saint-Mandé, Val-de-Marne (Paris region).

WASHINGTON - The US Department of Justice sent a letter to lawmakers regarding redactions in the files pertaining to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, Politico reported on Feb 14.
The letter, required by law, includes a general description of the types of redactions made, and a list of notable people mentioned in the files in any way.
The letter also includes an extensive list of high-profile people or “politically exposed persons” referenced in the files, even if they had no interactions with Epstein or his longtime associate, Ghislaine Maxwell, but were mentioned in sources such as press clippings.
The letter, sent to the leaders of the Senate and House Judiciary committees, does not state in what context a name appears.

Palestinians report 8 killed in overnight IDF airstrikes on Gaza

The Times of Israel is liveblogging Sunday’s events as they unfold.
Iran will consider nuclear compromises if sanctions on table: ‘Ball is in America’s court’
Iran is willing to consider compromises on its nuclear program if the US is ready to discuss lifting sanctions, Iran’s Deputy Foreign Minister Majid Takht-Ravanchi tells the BBC in an interview in Tehran.
Takht-Ravanchi says the ball is “in America’s court to prove that they want to do a deal.”
“If they are sincere, I’m sure we will be on the road to an agreement,” he tells the British broadcaster.
When asked whether Tehran would agree for its highly enriched uranium to be shipped out of Iran, the official says it is “too early to say what will happen in the course of negotiations.”
The Iranian official reiterates that Tehran’s ballistic missile program is not up for discussion.
“When we were attacked by Israelis and Americans, our missiles came to our rescue so how can we accept depriving ourselves of our defensive capabilities,” Takht-Ravanchi claims.
Asked about Trump’s apparent support for regime change in Iran, Takht-Ravanchi says: “We are not hearing that in the private messages.”
Iran, whose leaders are sworn to destroy Israel, denies seeking to acquire nuclear weapons, but has enriched uranium to levels that have no peaceful application, obstructed international inspectors from checking its nuclear facilities, and expanded its ballistic missile capabilities.
Reports: Israel’s ZIM to be sold to German shipping giant Hapag-Lloyd for over $3 billion
Israel’s ZIM will be sold to German shipping giant Hapag-Lloyd in a deal worth over $3 billion, Hebrew-language media reports.
The deal, which has been under discussion for some six months, involves Israeli private equity firm FIMI, the Calcalist financial newspaper reports.
The newspaper says the parties have agreed on the details of the deal, which is expected to be signed soon.
According to Calcalist, Hapag-Lloyd will purchase all of ZIM’s shares, leading to the Israeli firm’s delisting from the New York Stock Exchange.
The newspaper says the agreement is slightly unconventional, in that Hapag-Lloyd will take over the international operations while FIMI will control ZIM’s Israeli operations, rather than a more standard equity partnership.
The Globes financial newspaper says that workers unions are expected to meet with management in the coming hours after they were “surprised” to hear about the closing of the deal. According to Globes, there is a possibility of industrial action.
The Israeli government holds a so-called “golden share” in ZIM, giving it special rights.
According to Calcalist, the golden share provision in this case means that ZIM’s management must stay in Israel and a certain number of ships must remain Israeli-owned to ensure maritime traffic continues even in times of war.
Obama addresses racist video shared by Trump: ‘There doesn’t seem to be any shame’
Former US president Barack Obama criticizes a lack of shame and decorum in the country’s political discourse, responding for the first time to a post on US President Donald Trump’s social media account that depicted him and former first lady Michelle as monkeys.
The video, shared on Trump’s Truth Social account on February 5, sparked censure across the US political spectrum, with the White House initially rejecting “fake outrage” only to then blame the post on an error by a staff member and taking it down.
Near the end of a one-minute-long video promoting conspiracies about Trump’s 2020 election loss to Joe Biden, the Obamas — the first Black president and first lady in US history — were shown with their faces on the bodies of monkeys for about one second.
“The discourse has devolved into a level of cruelty that we haven’t seen before…Just days ago, Donald Trump put a picture of you, your face on an ape’s body,” asks left-wing political commentator Brian Tyler Cohen in a wide-ranging podcast interview.
“And so again, we’ve seen the devolution of the discourse. How do we come back from a place that we have fallen into?”
Without naming Trump, Obama responds by saying the majority of Americans “find this behavior deeply troubling.”
“There’s this sort of clown show that’s happening in social media and on television, and what is true is that there doesn’t seem to be any shame about this among people who used to feel like you had to have some sort of decorum and a sense of propriety and respect for the office, right? That’s been lost.”
IDF says it will hold pre-planned drill today in Modiin
The IDF says it will be conducting a military exercise in the central city of Modiin today.
“As part of the drill, there will be an increased movement of security forces and vehicles in the area,” the army says.
The IDF says the drill, which was pre-planned, will take place during the morning and afternoon hours.
8 reported killed in overnight IDF strikes in Gaza, after army said gunmen approached troops in violation
Palestinian media reports at least eight killed in overnight Israeli airstrikes in the Gaza Strip.
One strike in the Khan Younis area in southern Gaza killed four, and four others were killed in a strike near Jabalia in the Strip’s north, the reports say.
There is no immediate comment from the IDF on the reports, but the strikes come after five gunmen approached troops on the Israeli side of the Yellow Line last night, in what the army said was a “blatant violation” of the ceasefire.
IDF says its series of Lebanon strikes targeted Hezbollah arms depots, rocket launchers
A wave of Israeli airstrikes in several areas of southern Lebanon this evening targeted Hezbollah weapon depots and rocket launchers, the military says.
The IDF says Hezbollah continues to attempt to rebuild its infrastructure in southern Lebanon, and that the presence of the arms caches and rocket launchers is a violation of the November 2024 ceasefire.
Crew commanded by Jewish American Jessica Meir docks with International Space Station
WASHINGTON — Four astronauts dock at the International Space Station for a months-long research mission, replacing a crew forced to return to Earth early over a medical issue.
The US space agency’s Crew-12 arrives at the orbiting laboratory after a journey of about 34 hours that started with blastoff from Cape Canaveral, Florida aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket.
“We have bridged the legacy of humankind’s continuous presence in space spanning more than 25 years at this very site,” Jewish American astronaut Jessica Meir says after docking at the ISS.
“As we look back at Earth from these windows, we are reminded that cooperation is not just possible, it is essential. Up here, there are no borders and hope is universal.”
Other members of Crew-12 are American Jack Hathaway, French astronaut Sophie Adenot and Russian cosmonaut Andrey Fedyaev.
The foursome is replacing Crew-11, which returned to Earth in January a month earlier than planned, in the first medical evacuation in the space station’s history.

Mansour Abbas: Foreign-linked actors wanted Ra’am coalition with Netanyahu, who sought deal with Hamas
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sought a “long-term arrangement” with Hamas in order to keep the Palestinian national movement fractured, claims Ra’am chairman Mansour Abbas in an interview with Channel 12 News.
Speaking to the outlet, the Arab lawmaker says foreign-linked actors pressured him to persist in coalition talks with Netanyahu rather than join with opposition parties, due to the premier’s pre-October 7 policy on the terror group.
When asked whether he received messages from Qatar urging him to stay with Netanyahu, Abbas refuses to confirm or deny but says he was contacted by “people from here [Israel] with links to countries abroad.”
“These people encouraged me to continue and try to form a government with Benjamin Netanyahu and not with the other side [opposition]” because Netanyahu “doesn’t do wars,” Abbas says.
“I understood that Benjamin Netanyahu had an interest in ensuring that the fragmentation on the Palestinian side was preserved,” he says, adding that the premier sought to “advance a long-term arrangement with Hamas in the Gaza Strip.”
When asked whether Netanyahu made an explicit reference to this, Abbas says: “There was reference to this issue” in coalition talks. “I understood from his words that he was in favor of an arrangement [with Hamas],” he continues, claiming that such an arrangement stood to benefit both Netanyahu and the terror group.
Later on in the interview, Abbas recalls that Netanyahu gave him “lectures” on Zionist leader Zeev Jabotinsky during the since-scuttled coalition talks between the two.
He says it was as if the premier “wanted to stress that Likud is precisely the party that is trying to advance Arab society’s standing” and thus quoted Jabotinsky’s saying that “if there is a Jewish prime minister, his deputy should be Arab.”
Abbas takes a swipe at Netanyahu, saying that “they [in Likud] aren’t faithful to the path of Jabotinsky, who is considered the right-wing party’s ideological forebear.
IDF says it has launched strikes on Hezbollah sites in south Lebanon
The IDF says it has launched a wave of airstrikes on Hezbollah infrastructure in southern Lebanon.

To Jeff Bezos: A legacy Washington paper must include the Middle East - opinion
Unknown

A robust and balanced press should constitute the bedrock of democracy. When The Washington Post laid off hundreds of journalists and discarded sectors, it pulled the plug on the MENA region, and that a great mistake.
Washington DC, home to the United States Capitol, is the epicenter of the transmission of global news. It is where our president leads, our legislature sits, and every global ambassador makes their second home. It is also where a significant amount of news is made, reported, and shared.
When Jeff Bezos fired Middle East reporters, he consciously closed the door to Israel, Gaza, Iran, Iraq, and Syria to name some of the most pressing places which alone could fill news sites.
The Washington Post is an industry icon, that needs Middle Eastern reporting to be taken seriously. If the business worldview solely looks at spreadsheets and fails to understand that the job of a news organization is to inform the people about local and global events, journalism will die in darkness.
The collapse of The Washington Post signals the failure of the health of the integrity of the paper and the unquestionable reliance on the bottom line. The paper should not lean Left or Right. It should not be guided by politics or money but by the truth.
Role of journalists in a nations survival
If artificial intelligence (AI) replaces the incredible talent of deep-thinking journalists, and clickbait rules, policy will suffer, and America will not be able to protect the nation that promises freedom for all.
Americans need to know when US hostages are taken by Hamas terrorists, such as happened on October 7, 2023.
They also need to be informed that over a span of two years all 251 hostages taken that day were returned, both dead and alive, including two hostages that abducted in previous years. Leaving that mission to the world of cyber-punditry is a frightening alternative.
Americans need to understand oil price fluctuations tied to the Middle East, which have stock market impact.
They need to be knowledgeable about the trade deals the US has with Qatar, Israel, and Saudi Arabia – and why those details matter. They also must be made aware when dangerous captigon drugs are making their way to the US through Syria, and the Iranian regime has slaughtered thousands or tens of thousands of protestors, many with relatives in the United States.
The great cooperative stories in tech and AI, defense, and agriculture will not see the light of day either, nor will the heartwarming pieces on Middle Easterners who have family and companies in the US. Simple reporting cannot replace deep, personal dives.
One day after the billionaire tycoon slashed reporters at The Washington Post, $200 billion in investments were staked to Amazon, where Bezos sits as executive chair of the board of directors. The Post, being one of the oldest American papers, has shifted gears to keep up with the changing media landscape. It is counting on AI and robotics to bring in strong, long-term returns. Much of this is aimed at a younger audience.
The Washington Post was one of the first news outlets to utilize TikTok – opening the door for other legacy media to follow. Its “shorts” are videos aiming to captivate, entertain, or shock, and often created without substance or context.
Catering to the Gen Z community, a current focal point, is key and necessary as it makes up almost one quarter of the market, but not at the expense of challenging them intellectually. This should include hard and soft news, often associated with the Middle East.
The Post should know that a 2023 Portland State University study on how Gen Z and Millennials use public libraries and identify through media showed that these is room for engagement. Charts indicated that about 50 percent still read books, and a similar figure visits news sites.
I understand the business side drives decisions, but critical thinking is needed here and a rethink on the historical importance of The Washington Post.
Coupled with the greater loss of the press-and-policy relationship, which the capital city must sustain, economic growth needs to be measured, taking all factors into account.
You simply cannot be the leading Washington paper without Middle East reporters, let alone a Middle East section, Mr. Bezos. You have competition in DC from Conservatives and Democrats.
You owe your readers loyalty in educating them, and you owe loyalty to all Washingtonians and lovers of news – from both sides of the aisle – who have stood by your paper for generations, since its founding in 1877.
The writer is president and CEO of The Media Line news agency and founder of the Press and Policy Student Program, the Mideast Press Club, and the Women’s Empowerment Program. She can be reached at ffriedson@themedialine.org.

Iran’s internet goes dark as US agencies spar on VPN funding
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
WASHINGTON – US agencies are struggling to find the best method to fund additional software for millions of Iranian civilians to get around their government’s strict internet censors, amid a surge in demand over weeks of domestic unrest.
The State Department, US senators from both parties, and other US agencies have advocated for funding virtual private networks and anti-censorship technology programs that would allow about a quarter of the people in Iran to access the internet without the Islamic Regime’s restrictions.
But the offices involved can’t seem to agree on the best way to get US$10 million (S$12.6 million) to the Open Technology Fund, which finances programs to circumvent online censorship worldwide and has seen demand for VPNs in Iran rise to US25 million from the US7.5 million that it’s resourced to support.
Without a resolution, some Iranians may not be able to safely get online in the coming weeks.
“We need these funds yesterday,” said Ms Laura Cunningham, president of the Open Technology Fund (OTF). “If we don’t have these resources immediately, we will be forced to make difficult decisions about cutting off millions of VPN users in Iran as soon as next week.”
Since 2022, OTF has been receiving State Department funds consistently through the same mechanism, with State providing money to the US Agency for Global Media, which in turn gives it to OTF, Ms Cunningham said.
The process typically takes one or two weeks.
Deputy CEO of USAGM and an ally of Mr Trump, Ms Kari Lake, suggests that the traditional method “would take months,” and proposes that OTF use funds from its own budget to support the additional VPNs, according to a Feb 5 letter to Republican Senator Lindsey Graham seen by Bloomberg.
This solution, however, is “not viable”, according to a Feb 10 reply from Mr Graham and fellow Republican Senator James Lankford also seen by Bloomberg.
The letter explains that advancing US$10 million to the organization’s yearly appropriation is “not surge funding” and would take away from other VPN support that OTF provides in China, Cuba and Russia.
“We are working hand-in-glove with the State Department to deliver on President Trump’s priorities,” USAGM’s Ms Lake said in a statement.
“Support is on the way to ensure a steady flow of information – as fast as possible – through VPNs and a variety of other mechanisms,” Ms Lake added. “We will continue working tirelessly to deliver in this historic moment despite the Iranian regime’s suppression.”
The State Department echoed the need to help Iranians access information and to “have a voice despite the regime’s attempts to silence them,” according to a statement. “We are expanding these capabilities and working with international partners to share the costs of that expansion.”
Mr Zack Cooper, OTF’s board chair, rejected Ms Lake’s explanation. “The State Department immediately found $10 million for OTF to support VPN users in Iran,” he said in a statement. “If USAGM wanted OTF to have these additional resources to support VPN users in Iran, we would.”
US President Donald Trump has repeatedly cheered on protesters who began challenging Tehran’s clerical leadership since late 2025, said on Feb 13 that regime change would be “the best thing that could happen” to Iran.
Democratic Senators Jacky Rosen and Cory Booker joined forces with Mr Graham and Mr Lankford in late January, penning a letter to Secretary of State Marco Rubio that emphasised the importance of funding the software.
“Without the continuous operation of internet freedom programming carried out by the State Department and Open Technology Fund, millions of Iranians will lose their last secure window and voice to the outside world,” according to the Jan 28 letter seen by Bloomberg.
Because of US sanctions on Iran, civilians can’t pay for these services themselves so nonprofits like the OTF fund the technology that they can use for free.
Without VPNs to enable secure, uncensored internet usage, Ms Cunningham argues that Iranians risk being persecuted by the government, which has imposed an extremely aggressive censorship apparatus around the country.
The VPNs also help hide people’s IP addresses, making it safer to use Starlink terminals that Mr Elon Musk has set up to help Iranians access the internet when the regime has turned it off. BLOOMBERG

Hong Kong court grants couple parenting rights in mainland Chinese surrogacy case
Couple turned to court after failing to secure identification cards, but ruling not expected to set precedent, lawyer says
A Hong Kong court has granted a local married couple a parental order for two boys born following a verbal surrogacy agreement in mainland China, ruling that the applicants were merely ignorant that the arrangement was illegal.
But a lawyer said the ruling was unlikely to set a precedent as the circumstances of surrogacy cases varied.
Commercial surrogacy arrangements are illegal in both Hong Kong and on the mainland.
The High Court granted parenting rights to the couple on Tuesday.
According to court documents, the husband, aged 61, and wife, aged 59, commissioned two surrogates via an agent in Shenzhen in July 2023 to each carry embryos created using his sperm and donors’ eggs. The boys were born in the mainland city by caesarean sections the following year.
They turned to the court after failing to secure identification documents for the boys to move to Hong Kong from Shenzhen. They were denied the documents because the wife was not the birth mother, although the couple were both Hong Kong permanent residents.
She was also unable to have her status as a mother legally recognised on the mainland after a court in Shenzhen refused to accept her case, as it involved commercial surrogacy.

China dating scene sees rise in ‘hunter-style lovers’ known for attentiveness and caring nature
Growing number of love seekers are on the lookout for observant and thoughtful partners; experts say trend is based on science
A new type of partner is heading towards becoming the next big thing in China’s dating market – so-called hunter-style lovers.
This does not mean they work as hunters or see their dates as prey, but instead bring their lovers “prey” in the form, for instance, of tasty snacks they receive at work or beautiful items they discover on the street.
According to Chinese social media users, the value of the “prey” does not matter. Even a milk tea costing less than 20 yuan (US$3), or even a cost-free fallen leaf that looks beautiful.
What matters is the lover’s true sense of caring revealed in the gift-bringing gesture.
That said, a “hunter-style lover” cannot just bring anything; they should put thought into the choice of gift.

Europe forfeited seat at Ukraine talks — Russian deputy foreign minister

MOSCOW, February 15. /TASS/. Due to its ideological rigidity and refusal to engage in direct dialogue with Russia, Europe has effectively deprived itself of a seat at the negotiating table on the Ukrainian settlement, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Galuzin said in an interview with TASS.
He noted that because of their "ideological rigidity and outright incompetence," those currently responsible for shaping the foreign policy guidelines of "united Europe" have made a strategic miscalculation.
"By refusing direct dialogue with our country, Brussels has essentially deprived itself of a place at the negotiating table," Galuzin emphasized.
Responding to a question about the Russian Foreign Ministry’s assessment of the European Union’s intention to appoint its own negotiator for dialogue with Moscow on Ukraine, the Russian deputy foreign minister indicated that this initiative "is currently at the stage of internal discussion within the EU."
"It is typical that this initiative belongs to individual politicians from EU member states rather than to EU officials," he noted. "As for Brussels itself, judging by statements from officials, it regards the idea of appointing a special envoy rather coolly, since such a move would run counter to the Russophobic line of the EU’s foreign policy service — and personally of its head, Kaja Kallas — aimed at isolating our country and minimizing any contacts with Russia," Galuzin added.
He also noted that at present "EU bureaucrats are absolutely incapable of reaching agreements," as they operate exclusively in the language of ultimatums, demand unilateral concessions, and are focused on inflicting maximum damage on Russia.

Vatican asks ultraconservative Society of Saint Pius X to 'suspend' its plan to ordain bishops

In the photo, the two clergymen in cassocks wore almost benevolent smiles, suggesting that the meeting they had just had, on Thursday, February 12, had been cordial. Yet, relations between Cardinal Victor Manuel Fernandez, prefect of the dicastery – the Vatican's equivalent of a ministry – of the Doctrine of the Faith, whose mission is to uphold orthodoxy within the Catholic Church, and his guest, Don Davide Pagliarani, superior general of the Society of Saint Pius X (in Latin: Fraternitas Sacerdotalis Sancti Pii X, FSSPX), a traditionalist and ultraconservative organization, remained extremely tense.
The two men met in Rome to discuss the Society of Saint Pius X's intention, announced on February 2, to ordain new bishops without the approval of the Holy See. The Catholic Church, however, requires papal approval for an episcopal consecration to be valid. Defying this requirement would constitute a schismatic act that would separate the FSSPX from the Roman Catholic Church. If they carried out their plan, the FSSPX prelates would be automatically excommunicated.
This was confirmed by the Vatican's response on Thursday. The pope holds "supreme, full, universal, immediate and direct ordinary power" in this matter, and episcopal ordinations without his approval "would entail a decisive break in ecclesial communion with grave consequences for the Society as a whole," Cardinal Fernandez said in a statement following the meeting. Rome, he specified, is ready to engage in theological dialogue, but on the express condition that the Society "suspends the decision to proceed with the announced episcopal ordinations."

Investigators converge on residence near Nancy Guthrie’s home
Tucson: Law enforcement investigating the disappearance of Today show host Savannah Guthrie’s mother sealed off a road and converged on a residence in an affluent neighbourhood near Nancy Guthrie’s home in Arizona late on Friday night (Tucson time).
A parade of sheriff’s and FBI vehicles, including forensics vehicles, passed through the roadblock that was set up about three kilometres from the house.
The Pima County Sheriff’s Department confirmed on Saturday that a federal court-ordered search warrant was executed at a home on Friday in connection with the Guthrie case. The warrant was based on a lead the agency had received. No arrests were made.
CNN reported that roads were reopened after about four hours.
The two agencies also tagged and towed a Range Rover SUV from a nearby Culver’s restaurant parking lot.
Separately, a traffic stop was conducted, and while someone was questioned, no arrests were made, the sheriff’s office said.
No additional information was released on Saturday.
Guthrie, 84, was reported missing on February 1. Authorities say her blood was found on the front porch of her Tucson-area home. Purported ransom notes were sent to news outlets, but two deadlines for payment have passed.
On Friday, the sheriff’s office said DNA from people other than Guthrie or “those in close contact to her” had also been collected from her property, and investigators were “working to identify who it belongs to”.
Authorities have expressed concerns about Guthrie’s health because she needs daily medication. She is said to have a pacemaker and has dealt with high blood pressure and heart issues, according to a sheriff’s dispatcher audio on broadcastify.com.
Investigators have studied surveillance video, sorted through thousands of tips and submitted DNA and other evidence for laboratory analysis.
The FBI said it had collected more than 13,000 tips since Guthrie was reported missing. The sheriff’s department, meanwhile, said it had taken at least 18,000 calls.
On Tuesday, authorities released footage showing an armed, masked person at Guthrie’s doorstep on the night she was abducted. The videos – less than a combined minute in length – gave investigators and the public their first glimpse of who was outside Guthrie’s home in the foothills outside Tucson.
Experts say the video could contain a mountain of clues.

Steve Bannon discussed how to ‘take down’ Pope Francis with Jeffrey Epstein, DOJ files suggest
‘Will take down [Pope] Francis,’ the MAGA political strategist appears to have written in a message to the pedophile financier in June 2019

Steve Bannon discussed plans to “take down” Pope Francis with Jeffrey Epstein, according to new files shared by the Department of Justice.
“Will take down [Pope] Francis,” Bannon appears to have written in a message to the pedophile financier in June 2019. “The Clintons, Xi, Francis, EU – come on brother.”
Bannon, a former presidential advisor to Donald Trump and who reportedly identifies as a Roman Catholic, was highly critical of Francis, viewing his progressive global agenda as contrary to his own “sovereigntist” stance. In a 2018 interview with The Spectator Bannon described the Pope as “beneath contempt,” and accused him of “siding with globalist elites.”
The exchange with Epstein appears to show Bannon trying to further his plans, asking whether the financier has read In the Closet of the Vatican, a 2019 book by French journalist Frédéric Martel that included the bombshell claim that 80 percent of the clergy working in the Vatican are gay.
Bannon had previously appeared to have expressed interest in turning the book into a film, telling Epstein “you are now exec producer of ‘ITCOTV’.” It is unclear how serious that offer was.
The financier replies saying “Chomsky asking when film,” in apparent reference to intellectual Noam Chomsky with whom Epstein was known to be close with.
Elsewhere in the files, documents show that Epstein emailed himself on April 1 2019 a message reading “in the closet of the Vatican,” and also sent Bannon an article titled “Pope Francis or Steve Bannon? Catholics must choose.”
“Easy choice,” Bannon replied.
The Independent has contacted representatives of Steve Bannon for comment.
Bannon is not the only MAGA acolyte to have run-ins with Pope Francis. Though he paid tribute to the pontiff following his death last year, describing him as “a good man, [who] worked hard and loved the world,” Donald Trump also had historic disputes with Francis.
Ahead of Trump’s first presidency in 2016, Francis criticized the incoming president over this vow to build a wall between Mexico and the U.S., saying “a person who thinks only about building walls, wherever they may be, and not building bridges, is not Christian.”
In January last year, one day before Trump’s second inauguration, Francis spoke out about the Republican president’s plans to carry out mass deportations.
"If it is true, it will be a disgrace, because it makes the poor wretches who have nothing pay the bill for the imbalance. It won't do. This is not the way to solve things," the Pope wrote.
The Pope also clashed with Vice President JD Vance, who is a Roman Catholic. In an interview Vance had put forward an idea known as ordo amoris, saying: “There’s this old school – and I think it’s a very Christian concept, by the way – that you love your family and then you love your neighbour and then you love your community and then you love your fellow citizens and your own country, and then after that you can focus and prioritise the rest of the world.”
Francis contradicted the idea that there should be a hierarchy of love, writing: “Christian love is not a concentric expansion of interests that little by little extend to other persons and groups.”
Vance later met the pontiff during his trip to Rome, meeting with him on Easter Sunday last year and sharing a homily with him. Pope Francis died a day later on April 21 2025.

Indonesia's troops in Gaza will avoid combat, stay under Jakarta command, gov't says
Indonesian troops set for deployment to Gaza as part of a planned International Stabilization Force will remain under Jakarta's command, avoid combat, and will be withdrawn if the mission deviates, authorities said on Saturday.
In a written statement, the Foreign Ministry said Indonesia's participation would remain under national command and be carried out in line with United Nations Security Council Resolution 2803, international law, and the country's non-aligned foreign policy.
Indonesian Army Chief of Staff General Maruli Simanjuntak said the country could send between 5,000 and 8,000 personnel, though negotiations are ongoing and no final decision has been made. Preparations, including training, have begun, but a deployment timeline has not been confirmed.
"Indonesian personnel will not be involved in combat operations or any actions leading to direct confrontation with any armed parties," the ministry said.
The government added that force may be used only for self-defence or to maintain the mission mandate and only as a last resort. Jakarta also stressed that any deployment would require the consent of the Palestinian Authority and reaffirmed its support for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
Indonesia said it would withdraw its troops if the mission deviates from national operational conditions, while pledging to oppose any forced displacement or demographic changes affecting Palestinians.
Overnight death toll in IDF strikes across Gaza rises to 10, medics say
The number of Palestinians who were killed in Gaza following Israeli strikes overnight has risen to 10, according to health officials in the Strip.
According to the Palestinian Red Crescent, six people were killed following an Israeli strike that hit a tent camp of displaced Gazans west of Jabaliya, in the northern Strip.
Four casualties were reported at a Hamas outpost near the Umm al-Nasr Mosque in the southern Gaza city of Khan Yunis. Eyewitnesses said that an Israeli drone prevented medical teams from arriving at the scene.
Report: Iran willing to compromise in nuclear talks if U.S. prepared to discuss lifting sanctions
Iran is willing to consider compromises to reach an agreement with the Trump administration, provided that the United States is prepared to discuss lifting sanctions, according to Iran's deputy foreign minister in an interview with the BBC.
According to Majid Takht-Ravanchi, Iran is ready to discuss a compromise if the United States is "ready to talk about sanctions," but he would not confirm whether this meant lifting all or some sanctions.
As to whether Iran would agree to ship its stockpile of more than 400kg of highly enriched uranium out of the country, Takht-Ravanchi said that "it was too early to say what will happen in the course of negotiations."
The deputy minister added that the issue of zero enrichment "is not on the table," a claim that contradicts U.S. President Donald Trump's statement on Friday that the administration "doesn't want any enrichment."
The deputy minister also reiterated Iran's refusal to discuss its ballistic missile programme, which has been a key demand of Israel.
Opinion | How the Netanyahu government spins October 7
Raise the flag to full mast and stop whining about October 7. "Hurricane," the lamented Israeli entry in the 2024 Eurovision song contest, presented in sexy shroud-like garments, is a thing of the past.
Yoel Elbaz from the Prime Minister's Office called on Wednesday for the word "massacre" to be removed from a bill designed to commemorate the "events of Simchat Torah on October 7." He explained to the Knesset Education Committee that instead of "massacre," one should write "events" or "incidents," such as the 1929 riots were called, rather than the "massacre of 1929." Besides the massacre, he said, there was also fighting.
Culture Minister Miki Zohar said he supported the initiative. "We can unequivocally be vulnerable, but we are not massacred," he said in a radio interview. "I'm less into victimhood. We're a powerful state." What can we say about such lucid remarks, which, some might say, are even impressive in their maturity? We have finally developed, as a nation, our sovereignty muscle. It seems that all this time it was hiding in Zohar's body.
Gaza reports: Eight Palestinians killed in IDF bombings in the Strip
Eight people were killed in IDF bombings across the Gaza Strip, Arab media reported early on Sunday.
A source at Shifa Hospital told Al Jazeera that four of them were killed in a bombing of a displaced persons camp in the Jabaliya area. Another source at Nasr Hospital told Al Jazeera that the other four were killed in a bombing south of Khan Yunis.
IDF says it struck Hezbollah weapons sites in southern Lebanon
The IDF announced that it struck weapons storage facilities and rocket launchers belonging to Hezbollah in several areas in southern Lebanon on Saturday night.
"The Hezbollah terrorist organization continues to attempt to reestablish terror infrastructure in southern Lebanon in order to harm Israeli civilians," said the announcement, and "the presence of the weapons struck constituted a violation of the cease-fire understandings between Israel and Lebanon, and endangered the civilians of the region."
United Arab List leader tells Channel 12 officials with ties to Qatar attempted to pressure him to join Netanyahu
United Arab List Chairman Mansour Abbas hinted to Channel 12 that officials with connections to Qatar attempted to pressure him to join Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government.
"People from here who have connections abroad encouraged me to continue trying to form a government with Netanyahu and not with the other side," he said in an interview broadcast on Channel 12.
Anti-gov't protests gather across Israel: Bereaved hostage family says officials seek to 'manipulate public consciousness'
Thousands of anti-government protesters gathered on Saturday evening across the country, including a demonstration outside the Prime Minister's residence in Jerusalem after months of no protests. Three protesters were detained as police ordered the crowd to disperse.
In Haifa, the mother of late hostage Ron Sherman, who was killed as a result of an Israeli air strike, told the audience, "Last week, we were exposed to the Prime Minister's Office's attempt to remove the word 'massacre' from the October 7 memorial law. The word is an accurate factual description of what happened, and those who seek to erase it seek to manipulate public consciousness."
RECAP: 49 homicides in 45 days; Israel's foreign minister to attend Board of Peace launch in Washington this week
Here are Saturday's latest updates from Israel, Gaza, the West Bank and the Middle East:
■ The IDF say that at least three people were killed in the Gaza Strip by Israeli strikes, including two militants, as the army continues to search the northern part of the enclave's Israeli-controlled area for remaining armed forces.
■ Thousands of anti-government protesters gathered across the country, including a demonstration outside the Prime Minister's residence in Jerusalem after months of no protests. Three protesters were detained as police ordered the crowd to disperse.
■ Close associates to President Isaac Herzog said U.S. President Donald Trump is undermining Israel's sovereignty by exerting pressure to pardon Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
■ Saudi Foreign Minister Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud said that his country would need to see "a real end to the conflict" before committing to their contribution to help fund reconstruction efforts in the Gaza Strip, when asked on the subject by Haaretz.
■ Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar is expected to represent Israel at a Board of Peace launch set to convene in Washington this week.
■ U.S. envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner will hold negotiations with Iran on Tuesday in Geneva, with representatives from Oman acting as mediators.
■ A young man of about 20 was fatally shot in the northern Israeli Arab city of Nazareth, marking the 49th homicide in the 45 days since the start of the year.
■ Medical charity Médecins Sans Frontières (Doctors Without Borders) said it has halted non-critical operations at Nasser Hospital in Khan Yunis, southern Gaza, citing reports of armed men inside the facility and suspected movement of weapons.
■ The U.S. military announced that it struck more than 30 ISIS targets in Syria this week using drones.

European allies say Navalny was poisoned by dart frog toxin
Five European allies on Saturday blamed Russia for killing late Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny using toxin from poison dart frogs while he was held in an Arctic penal colony two years ago, a claim Moscow rejected as propaganda.
In a joint statement, Britain, France, Germany, Sweden and the Netherlands said analyses of samples from Navalny's body "conclusively" confirmed the presence of epibatidine, a toxin found in poison dart frogs in South America and not found naturally in Russia.
The Russian government, which has repeatedly denied any responsibility for Navalny's death, dismissed the latest allegations as "a Western propaganda hoax," according to the Russian state's TASS news agency, while the Russian embassy in London said: "One must ask what kind of person would believe this nonsense about a frog." Britain on Saturday said the poisoning demonstrated "an alarming pattern of behaviour".
The country held a public inquiry into the poisoning in Britain of Russian double agent Sergei Skripal in 2018. It concluded last year Russian President Vladimir Putin must have ordered the Novichok nerve agent attack.
"When the test results are available and the formulas for the substances are disclosed, we will comment accordingly," Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova was quoted as saying by TASS.
"Until then, all such assertions are merely propaganda aimed at diverting attention from pressing Western issues," the news agency cited her as saying. The report also said she described Navalny as a blogger "officially designated as a terrorist and extremist in Russia".
The British government declined to comment to a Reuters query about how the samples from Navalny's body were obtained or where they were assessed. Foreign Minister Yvette Cooper told reporters that "UK scientists worked with our European partners to pursue the truth" on Navalny's death.
Second anniversary of Navalny's death
Russian opposition leader Navalny died in an Arctic prison colony in February 2024, after being convicted of extremism and other charges, all of which he denied.
His death was announced minutes before the opening of the Munich Security Conference in 2024. In response, the conference made a rare schedule adjustment to allow his widow, Yulia Navalnaya, to address the conference and she called for Putin to be held accountable.
"I was certain from the first day that my husband had been poisoned, but now there is proof ... I am grateful to the European states for the meticulous work they carried out over two years and for uncovering the truth," she said on social media while attending this year's Munich conference on Saturday.
The Russian embassy spokesperson said the European allies' move was "not a quest for justice but a mockery of the dead."
"Even after the death of the Russian citizen, London and the European capitals cannot allow him to rest in peace - a fact that speaks volumes about those who instigated this campaign," the spokesperson added.
Saturday's statement from the European allies, almost exactly two years after Navalny's death, said Moscow had the means, motive and opportunity to administer the poison as Navalny died in prison.
"Russia claimed that Navalny died of natural causes. But given the toxicity of epibatidine and reported symptoms, poisoning was highly likely the cause of his death," the joint statement said.
His death was followed by memorial gatherings and protests across Europe, with demonstrators in cities including London, Berlin, Vilnius and Rome condemning the Kremlin and demanding accountability.
The joint statement added that the latest findings underlined the need for Russia to be held accountable for "its repeated violations of the Chemical Weapons Convention and, in this instance, the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention."

A man has been arrested in New York after one woman was pushed onto the subway tracks and another was repeatedly punched in the face, police said.
Curtis Signal, 25, was arrested following the violent attack in Brooklyn Saturday and at a nearby men’s shelter.
The incident occurred around 8.45 a.m. on the R subway line at 53rd Street and Fourth Avenue in Sunset Park, sources toldThe New York Post.
A man first pushed the 51-year-old onto the tracks without warning, causing her to suffer three broken ribs, then turned on another woman, 43, who was standing on the platform. She was taken to hospital with facial injuries.
“The guy was sitting on the platform and they were standing,” bystander Al Rivera told The Post. “All of a sudden he pushed her on the tracks and then he turned around and pounced on the other lady. He was hitting her, punching her in the face.”
Two other people immediately rushed to help the woman who had been pushed onto the tracks and dragged her back onto the platform, eyewitnesses said.
“I can only imagine how petrified they were,” Rivera said.
Signal was charged with reckless endangerment, assault, and harassment, police said. The Independent has contacted the NYPD for more information on the incident.
The Post reports that Signal is a repeat offender and is on probation until June 2027. Saturday’s incident was not the first assault at a subway station he is alleged to have been involved in.
In early September 2023, he allegedly punched a 67-year-old woman multiple times in the face while waiting for an F train at 169th Street in Jamaica, Queens. Signal allegedly fled and was only connected to the assault months later when he was arrested for fare evasion.
Less than a week later he also assaulted a cop at the Grand Concourse/Tremont Avenue station in the Bronx, leaving the officer with a broken nose, sources told The Post.
In that incident he was charged with assault on a police officer, resisting arrest, disorderly conduct and obstruction of governmental administration.
Signal was also charged with assault in May 2022 and acting in a manner injurious to a child, after allegedly hitting his 13-year-old sister and giving her a black eye.

Ukraine destroys half of Russia's 'key' Pantsir air defense systems, security service says
The Alpha unit of Ukraine's Security Service (SBU) destroyed half of Russia's stockpile of the coveted Pantsir air defense system, the SBU announced Feb. 14.
"The 'Pantsir' is one of Russia's modern and key air defense systems. The cost of a single system ranges from $15 to $20 million. These anti-aircraft missile systems are the most effective in countering Ukrainian long-range drones," the announcement read.
The "systemic destruction" of the air defense system has the "strategic goal" of making Russia vulnerable to long-range strikes as Moscow continues to wage its war, the SBU said.
A diminished arsenal allows the Armed Forces to effectively strike Russian "military bases, warehouses, airfields, and other occupied facilities."
Ukraine regularly strikes military infrastructure deep within Russia and its own occupied territories in an effort to diminish Moscow's fighting power.
The SBU claimed on Jan. 19 that its long-range strikes during the year of 2025 either "destroyed or disabled" Russian air defense systems worth a total of approximately $4 billion.
On Feb. 12, Ukraine struck a Russian 55Zh6U "Nebo-U" long-range radar station, estimated to be worth approximately $100 million, near Yevpatoriia in occupied Crimea, the General Staff of Ukraine’s Armed Forces later reported on Feb. 13.
Meanwhile, the 1st Separate Center of the Unmanned Systems Forces (USF) on Feb. 12 struck an airfield in the village of Hvardiiske in Crimea, the Kirova electrical substation in Luhansk, and a data center in Prymorsk, Zaporizhzhia Oblast.
Ukrainian long-range cruise "Flamingo" missiles struck a major Russian arsenal storing missiles, ammunition, and explosives in Kotluban, Volgograd Oblast, overnight, Ukraine's General Staff reported on Feb. 12.
The facility belongs to Russia's Main Missile and Artillery Directorate (GRAU) and is described as one of the largest ammunition storage sites used by the Russian army. Powerful explosions and secondary detonations were recorded at the site.
In addition to the strike on the arsenal, Ukrainian forces on Feb. 12 hit the Progress Plant in Michurinsk, Tambov Oblast. The enterprise produces high-tech equipment for aviation and missile systems and is involved in supporting Russia’s military.

France’s Macron urges calm after right-wing youth fatally beaten
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
LYON - French President Emmanuel Macron on Feb 14 urged calm and restraint after the fatal beating of a 23-year-old French youth aligned with the far-right on the sidelines of a conference by a hard-left lawmaker in the south-eastern city of Lyon.
The death of the young man – identified only as Quentin – has intensified tensions between France’s far-right and hard-left who are both eyeing 2027 presidential elections.
He had been hospitalised in Lyon on Feb 12 after being attacked while providing what his supporters said was security for a protest against an appearance by hard-left MEP Rima Hassan at the Lyon branch of the Sciences Po university.
The office of the Lyon prosecutor on Feb 14 told AFP he had died of his wounds. An investigation has been opened into suspected aggravated manslaughter, it added.
Mr Macron said on X that Quentin had been the victim of “an unprecedented outburst of violence.
“Hatred that kills has no place in our country. I call for calm, restraint and respect,” he added.
‘Organised’ attack
According to the Nemesis collective, which is close to the far-right, Quentin was part of the security team responsible for ensuring the safety of its activists.
They were demonstrating against the conference by Ms Hassan, who is known for her outspoken criticism of Israel.
The family’s lawyer said in a statement that Quentin appeared to have been ambushed by “organised and trained individuals, vastly superior in number and armed, some with their faces masked”.
Prosecutors have yet to give details on the circumstances of his death.
Nemesis accused members of a local anti-fascist association that was banned by the government in June of being behind the killing.
Three-time presidential candidate Marine Le Pen, who is still hoping to stand in 2027 despite a graft conviction, said on X that the “barbarians responsible for this lynching” should be brought to justice.
With Quentin’s death sparking a wave of alarm across the political spectrum, concern also spread to the hard-left party of Ms Hassan, France Unbowed (LFI).
“What I have feared for years in Lyon is continuing,” said LFI French parliament MP Raphael Arnault.
“I offer my condolences to the family of this young man and I hope that the truth will be uncovered about this tragedy,” he added.
Le Pen’s far-right National Rally (RN) is the biggest single party by seats in the French lower house while the LFI is the biggest left-wing faction.
In the wake of the incident, Interior Minister Laurent Nunez urged authorities to “increase vigilance around political gatherings, as well as around campaign offices”. AFP

Mud-covered revelers took over the beach in Paraty, Brazil, on Saturday as part of a Carnival tradition that has grown steadily since it began 40 years ago. In the seaside town near the country’s historic colonial center, participants coated themselves in gray sludge, rolled through the silty shallows and emerged caked head to toe before dancing along the sand chanting “Uga! Uga!”

Weet-bix kimchi: Glynn's experiment with Australian and Korean favourites may be a hit

Key Points
- A Korean Australian fermenter in regional Tasmania has created an "Australian kimchi" using Weet-Bix
- Sue Glynn moved from Sydney to Tasmania a decade ago and went on to establish a kimchi business
- Glynn encourages migrants to look beyond big cities and consider regional Australia as a place of opportunity
In Korea, 2026 is the Year of the Red Horse, which has its origins in the traditional 60-year cycle combining Chinese zodiac animals with elements and colours.
As the Lunar New Year begins, red — a colour linked to energy, renewal and vitality — appears across many celebrations, decorations and food. Few dishes reflect that symbolism as vividly as kimchi, Korea's iconic fermented dish.
In a small town in regional Tasmania, Korean Australian fermenter Sue Glynn is redefining what "local food" can look like.
Glynn runs a small-scale kimchi business and workshop program called KimchiMe, where she produces kimchi using organically grown cabbage and an unexpected Australian ingredient — Weet-Bix.
The result is what she calls an "Australian kimchi", designed to support slow, stable fermentation and gut health.
Glynn moved to Tasmania with her Australian husband more than a decade ago, after spending around 25 years living and working in Sydney. Seeking a different pace of life, she didn't want to repeat the same urban routine in a regional setting.
"I was interested in seeing people grow their own vegetables and make their own food," she said.
"Once, a local farmer who was very kind gave me a piece of land and said, ‘Why don't you try growing something here?' I really enjoyed planting seeds and watching something grow."
Her first Tasmanian settlement was in Stanley, a small fishing town on the north-west coast with fewer than 600 residents. There, she began farming organically, growing up to 5,000 napa cabbages a year and supplying them to local markets.
While she had established herself as an organic grower, a chance encounter with locally-made kimchi in Tasmania became a turning point.
"That kimchi wasn't the kimchi I had grown up with," she said.
"I felt I wanted to make an authentic, genuine kimchi — something rooted in our culture — and my customers encouraged me by saying, 'Show us your culture.' That became my motivation."
Glynn began making kimchi using the cabbage she grew herself. Her kimchi differs from many commercially available versions in Australia, with a lighter, cleaner flavour and less reliance on fish sauce. The style reflects family recipes passed down through generations.
"My parents came to South Korea from the North after the Korean War," she said.
"I grew up watching my grandmother and mother make kimchi, and those North Korean family recipes stayed with me."
What is kimchi?
Kimchi is a fermented dish typically made from vegetables such as napa cabbage, radish, spring onion and cucumber, seasoned with chilli, garlic, ginger and salt.
According to Korea's food and drug safety ministry, there are more than 2,000 varieties of kimchi.
It's a cornerstone of Korean cuisine — more than just a side dish, but a soul food served with almost every meal, from simple home-cooked dinners to Korean barbecue and special celebrations.
In an era when kimchi is easily bought, making it by hand remains something special for many Koreans — a way of staying connected to culture, family and tradition.
Kimchi, a new taste for Tasmanians
When Glynn first sold kimchi at Tasmanian markets, many locals were unfamiliar with it, and she often had to offer tastings to introduce people to the flavour.
Over time, as global interest in Korean culture grew through films, television dramas and K-pop, kimchi became more widely recognised.
Glynn said it has been particularly well received by people interested in health and wellbeing, drawn to its fermented nature and probiotic benefits.
"People in their 30s through to their 70s show strong interest," she said.
"Especially those who want to improve their gut health. It's not limited to one age group."
Her produce and kimchi have been assessed by several Australian food awards programs, including the Royal Tasmanian Fine Food Awards, Royal Hobart, Melbourne Royal, and Australian Food Awards, where they received multiple acknowledgements for quality.
In 2022, Glynn was also named a finalist in the Australian Organic Industry Awards' farmer of the year category.
Two years ago, Glynn relocated to Evandale, around 10 minutes from Launceston airport.
While she scaled back farming production, she shifted her focus toward people — creating more opportunities to connect, share and exchange culture through hands-on kimchi workshops.
At one workshop, local resident Clare tried kimchi for the first time. "It's amazing — tasty, fresh, and beautifully balanced," she said.
"It's something completely different from anything I've had before. I really enjoyed it."
Another participant, Di, said the experience made fermentation feel accessible.
"I loved using natural ingredients and knowing exactly what goes into it," she said.
"The hands-on process was so much fun, and it was great doing it together. It makes you want to experiment more."
A very Australian replacement
The most surprising element of the workshop was Glynn's Weet-Bix kimchi.
"When making kimchi, Koreans usually add starch, such as glutinous rice or wheat starch, to feed the microorganisms and support fermentation," Glynn explained.
"One morning after breakfast, I thought — Weet-Bix is also made from grain. Why not?"
By blending Weet-Bix with garlic and ginger, then mixing it with Korean chilli powder, coconut soy sauce and white peach paste, she creates a rich wet mix that coats the salt-pickled cabbage and supports fermentation — without the need to cook a separate starch.
"Using Weet-Bix makes the process much simpler," she said.
"It stabilises fermentation and helps develop flavour beautifully."
Workshop participant Carol was intrigued by the idea.
"Using something as simple as Weet-Bix — something everyone has in their pantry — as a fermentation base is fascinating," she said.
"It makes fermentation feel uncomplicated and approachable."
Tassie's future for fermentation
Glynn believes Tasmania's cooler climate — similar to Korea's winters — makes it particularly suitable for fermented foods like kimchi. She notes that this aligns with the Tasmanian government's broader push to increase value-adding in agriculture and food production through fermentation.
Through collaboration with local councils, the Tasmanian government has invested $1.7 million in a 1,800-square-metre fermentation hub near Launceston, designed to support small-scale fermenters. Glynn has also participated in the project.
Tasmania's population stands at around 570,000, with 15.3 per cent born overseas, according to the latest Census. By comparison, more than 40 per cent of Sydney's population was born overseas.
Despite its smaller migrant population, Glynn believes regional areas like Tasmania offer genuine opportunities for migrants.
"Many migrants live within bubbles in big cities like Sydney and Melbourne," she said.
"But if you look at Australia more broadly, there are real opportunities in regional areas."
She points to demand in agriculture, dairy farming, beef farming and skilled trades, where labour shortages persist.
"Cities may have more jobs, but competition is fierce," she said.
"Here, if you have skills, a strong work ethic and a positive mindset, it's much easier to build something sustainable."
In Evandale, Glynn's kimchi has already found a home. Richard, a local shop owner who stocks her products, said her presence has brought new energy to the town.
"Having Sue living here, and potentially running more workshops in the future, could really shape the town," he said.
"Who knows — Evandale could one day become the kimchi capital of Tasmania."
In Glynn's hands, kimchi becomes more than food — showing how migrant traditions can impact Australians all over the country.

'Standards too low, numbers too high': Refreshed Liberal Party poised for immigration cuts

The freshly-minted Liberal leader has doubled down on plans for a hardline immigration policy, pledging to cut migrant numbers and focus on those who reject Australian values.
But Angus Taylor has offered few details of how the Coalition he now leads will deliver on the promise to weed out those who "reject our way of life".
The new Opposition leader, who toppled Sussan Ley in a party room vote on Friday, has been laying out his plan for the Liberals as the conservative party bleeds votes to the anti-immigration One Nation.
Taylor and his new deputy, Senator Jane Hume, have been quick to vow to lower taxes, focus on housing affordability and take "green ideology" out of energy policies.
But the leaders have also been vocal on immigration, saying that migrant numbers needed to be driven down.
"Standards have been too low, numbers have been too high and we haven't explicitly shut the door on people who reject our way of life, who don't believe in our core values," Taylor told Sky News on Sunday.
High migration put stress on housing and infrastructure, he added, suggesting intelligence agencies could play a greater role in assessing would-be residents.
"It's important … they do assess whether or not these people have demonstrated in the past that they reject our way of life or whether they want to bring the hate and violence from another place," Taylor said.
Challenges ahead for the Liberals
But even with an injection of new leadership energy, the party finds itself in a difficult position, pollster Kos Samaras said.
The Liberals faced the same challenges as those present under Ley, including the loss of support among most voter groups.
Samaras said some Gen X and right-wing cohorts who formerly voted for the Liberals were rejecting the established centre-right political party, while progressive voters and women were also being driven away.
"Angus Taylor cannot be ultra conservative on certain issues and then try to pretend he can talk to progressive Melbourne and Sydney," he told AAP.
"He's going to get wedged as Sussan Ley was wedged."
Founder of Liberal women's network resigns
The founder of a key Liberal women's network has quit her organisation and the party two days after its first female leader was turfed out in the leadership spill.
Charlotte Mortlock founded Hilma's Network in 2021 to boost female representation in the Liberal party.
She worked on the proposal to have gender quotas in the party, which was recently dumped by the NSW branch.
"Due to recent events I have decided there are other ways I can support women and Australia," Mortlock said.
"I have decided the time has come for me to step down as executive director of Hilma's Network and I have also relinquished my Liberal Party membership."
Taylor toppled Ley 34 votes to 17 in the ballot, ending her tenure after only nine months.
Shortly after the spill, Ley revealed she would spend the coming weeks in her regional NSW electorate of Farrer before resigning from parliament.
A by-election will then be needed to choose a new MP for Farrer in what looms as a significant early test for Taylor.
He will need to prove he can stave off challenges from independents and One Nation, which has been polling above the Coalition.

E-bike rider critically injured after crashing into pole while allegedly fleeing police
Updated ,first published
A man who was riding an e-bike without a helmet is in a critical condition after crashing into a pole while allegedly fleeing police in Sydney’s south-west.
Officers had tried to stop the 39-year-old man after seeing him riding along Bungulla Street, Sadleir, without a helmet about 11pm on Saturday.
After seeing the officers, the rider allegedly rode away before crashing into a pole, police said. He was treated at the scene for serious injuries, and taken to Liverpool Hospital, where he underwent surgery and remains in a critical but stable condition.
Police have declared the crash a critical incident, and an investigation overseen by the Law Enforcement Conduct Commission has been launched into the circumstances around the incident.
Assistant Commissioner Brett McFadden said officers had followed the rider along several streets and were “very close” to the man when he collided with the pole.
McFadden said the e-bike did not have pedals and was solely powered by its motor.
The police officers in the car when the rider collided with the pole had not been interviewed as of noon on Sunday, McFadden said.
McFadden said it was unclear how fast the e-bike was travelling, but that the impact with the pole was “significant”.
Both officers have undergone mandatory drug and alcohol testing. It is unclear if the car was behind the rider or alongside him when he crashed.
The crash comes as emergency doctors welcomed a crackdown on illegal e-bikes after several Sydney hospitals reported a doubling in serious e-bike related injuries.
New figures show trauma doctors at St Vincent’s Hospital in Darlinghurst last year treated 200 patients for injuries sustained while riding e-bikes.
The Children’s Hospital at Westmead and Sydney Children’s Hospital at Randwick as of last week had treated 35 children injured by e-bikes and e-scooters this year, ranging from scrapes and fractures to suspected spinal and severe head injuries.
There were at least five e-bike related deaths in NSW last year. In July, a 14-year-old boy was killed coming off his bike, which his parents bought online and believed was an e-bike but was actually closer to a motorbike in its construction. A 65-year-old male pedestrian was killed after being hit by an e-bike in Toongabbie in October.
In December, an e-bike rider in his 30s was killed in a collision with a garbage truck in Ultimo.
Under proposed new laws, police will be given powers to seize and crush illegal e-bikes amid growing concern over the popularity of the high-powered vehicles dubbed “fat bikes”.
The state government will also introduce technology that allows police to carry out roadside testing to determine whether e-bikes exceed power limits.
The new portable “dyno units”, which measure a vehicle’s power output, would be used to determine whether an e-bike’s power assistance cuts at 25 kilometres per hour, the legal limit in NSW.
Instances of dozens of e-bike riders swarming locations have increased, part of a growing trend among teenagers riding the vehicles.
Earlier this month, about 40 e-bike riders descended on the Sydney Harbour Bridge and CBD in a mass rideout that police described as “incredibly irresponsible, stupid and downright dangerous”.

Scottish Secretary to pursue shipbuilding deals in Indo-Pacific
United Kingdom

09:01:14 KST

The UK Government has announced that Scottish Secretary Douglas Alexander will travel to Australia, New Zealand and Singapore on a week-long trade and defence mission aimed at strengthening security cooperation and expanding economic ties across the Indo-Pacific.
The visit is expected to focus on opportunities for closer defence-industrial collaboration, including in naval shipbuilding and advanced defence manufacturing, while also promoting Scottish exports and inward investment. According to the Scotland Office, trade and international security will be central themes throughout the trip, with Alexander due to meet government ministers and business leaders across all three countries.
The programme will also include attendance at two overseas performances of the Royal Edinburgh Military Tattoo, in Brisbane and Auckland, which the Government described as a showcase of one of Scotland’s major cultural exports.
The Government said the visit comes at a time of “heightened global instability” and will place emphasis on strengthening defence partnerships with close allies.
Australia is a key element of the AUKUS partnership, and the UK signed a treaty in 2025 committing to 50 years of security cooperation in the region. Officials said Alexander’s meetings will explore further collaboration, particularly in areas where Scotland’s industrial base is considered competitive.
The Scotland Office said discussions are expected to include naval shipbuilding and defence manufacturing, describing Scottish industry as having “world-leading expertise” in those sectors. The mission will also focus on trade expansion, with Alexander expected to promote Scottish businesses and encourage new investment into Scotland.
Speaking ahead of the visit, Alexander said the trip was designed to support exporters and reinforce Scotland’s position within UK-wide trade relationships. “This visit is about speaking up for Scottish businesses and Scottish exporters,” he said.
He added that Scotland benefits from UK-wide influence and trade reach, stating: “Scotland benefits from the strength, reach and connections that come from being part of the UK.”
Alexander also linked the trip to wider defence cooperation, saying: “At a time of significant global uncertainty, it has never been more important to stand shoulder to shoulder with our closest allies, and I look forward to discussing how we can deepen our defence cooperation and work together to keep people safe.” On trade, he said: “I will also be banging the drum for Scottish business… This visit is an opportunity to open doors for Scottish exporters, attract the investment that creates economic growth and well paid jobs back at home, and show that Scotland is open for business on the global stage.”

Women losing £2,548 a year to pay gap, TUC says
Women have effectively been working for free for the first month and a half of the year compared to men, says the TUC General Secretary

- CommentsGo to comments
The gender pay gap in the UK is not projected to close for another three decades, according to a new analysis by the Trades Union Congress (TUC). At the current rate of progress, women will have to wait until 2056 for pay parity.
The TUC’s findings reveal that the average woman effectively works for 47 days of the year without pay, only beginning to earn from today compared to her male counterparts. The union body states that the gender pay gap currently stands at 12.8 per cent, equating to a loss of £2,548 annually for the average female worker.
Disparities are particularly stark in certain sectors, with the pay gap in education reaching 17 per cent, while in the finance and insurance industry, it escalates to 27.2 per cent.
Paul Nowak, TUC General Secretary, highlighted the severity of the situation. "Women have effectively been working for free for the first month and a half of the year compared to men," he said.
"Imagine turning up to work every single day and not getting paid. That’s the reality of the gender pay gap. In 2026 that should be unthinkable."
Mr Nowak emphasised the financial strain on women amidst the cost of living crisis. "With the cost of living still biting hard, women simply can’t afford to keep losing out. They deserve their fair share."
He added that the Employment Rights Act represents a crucial step towards achieving pay parity, as it will ban exploitative zero-hours contracts, which disproportionately affect women.
The Act will also mandate employers to publish action plans for tackling their gender pay gaps, though Mr Nowak stressed these plans "must be tough, ambitious and built to deliver real change, otherwise they won’t work."

Photographer Richard Young speaks of ‘dear’ relationship with Amy Winehouse
Young best known for photographing icons likes of Elizabeth Taylor and Mick Jagger, was speaking on ‘Desert Island Discs’
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
Celebrity photographer Richard Young has offered a rare glimpse into his illustrious career, sharing poignant anecdotes about Amy Winehouse and Princess Diana during his appearance on BBC Radio 4’s Desert Island Discs.
Young, renowned for capturing icons like Elizabeth Taylor and Mick Jagger, spoke fondly of his "dear" relationship with Winehouse.
He recounted being invited to photograph the singer on the night she won her first Grammy awards, as she was unable to attend the ceremony in the US. Young was en route to a hotel when Universal Music’s PR called, asking him to Riverside Studios in Hammersmith. "We’ve got this thing going on... Amy’s here. There’s a possibility she might get one or two awards. We would love you to come down and photograph it," he was told.
During the evening, Winehouse’s mother, Janis, offered Young a bagel, prompting a playful interjection from Amy: "he’s fat enough as it is, he can’t have another bagel." Young described the atmosphere as vibrant, culminating in Winehouse securing five Grammys.
He captured an "incredible photograph" of her cuddling her crying mother on stage, a moment he described as "just so beautiful." He chose Winehouse’s hit "Rehab" as one of his desert island discs, noting it "tells the story of the night."
Young also reflected on his "very, very nice" relationship with Princess Diana, citing an early portrait of her in a black Elizabeth Emanuel dress as his favourite.
His own journey into photography began after being expelled from school at 14 alongside his best friend, Mark Feld, who would later become Marc Bolan of T. Rex. Young, who was also acquainted with Leonard Cohen, admitted he loved musicians, having once aspired to be one himself.
Among his other musical selections were T Rex’s "Cosmic Dancer" and Bob Dylan’s "Positively 4th Street." He told presenter Lauren Laverne that many of the artists he chose had welcomed him "into their homes, into their work environment."
Reflecting on his craft, Young stated: "The most important thing about a photograph is, if it doesn’t tell a story, then it’s not really worth having." He acknowledged some regrets over his 52-year career but expressed gratitude for the trust placed in him by his subjects. "A lot of people know that they can trust me and they like me, so I’ve been very, very fortunate," he concluded.

Stephen Flynn says Starmer’s Labour has ‘downed tools’ amid crisis
‘The cost of chaos under the Labour Party is growing and getting worse’, says the SNP Westminster leader
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
Stephen Flynn, the SNP Westminster leader, has warned that the "cost of chaos" within the UK Government is directly harming Scottish families and businesses.
He accused ministers of being "so caught up in their own civil war that they are completely ignoring Westminster’s never-ending cost-of-living crisis". Flynn specifically pointed to Labour's internal strife, which he claimed followed Scottish leader Anas Sarwar’s calls for the Prime Minister to resign amid revelations concerning Peter Mandelson’s association with Jeffrey Epstein.
The MP for Aberdeen South argued that Labour ministers are "downing tools" to focus on party divisions, leading to "economic and political paralysis". He cited sluggish economic growth, the repercussions of Brexit, and the declining value of the pound against the euro as evidence.
Mr Flynn stated: "The cost of chaos under the Labour Party is growing and getting worse – Keir Starmer’s Labour Party are so caught up in their own civil war that they are completely ignoring Westminster’s never-ending cost-of-living crisis."
He added: "When it comes to managing the economy, tackling Westminster’s cost-of-living crisis or even the basics of passing promised legislation – Keir Starmer’s distracted and divided Labour Party have blatantly downed tools."
Flynn suggested the public is "wise to the fact" that while Labour deals with "fighting amongst themselves, they will never fight for them". He further commented: "Another week of Westminster scandal has come with real costs and consequences – the pound plummeted, borrowing rates soared and even passing laws came to a standstill – people were promised ‘change’; Keir Starmer’s Labour Party has only delivered chaos."
In contrast, Flynn highlighted the SNP's focus in Scotland on "our people’s priorities", citing the opening of the first GP walk-in clinic, frozen rail fares, five years of the Scottish child payment, and a resident doctor pay deal.
He praised First Minister John Swinney, stating: "Under John Swinney, our NHS is turning a corner with waiting times falling thanks to that relentless focus on improving our health service."
Flynn concluded: "While the Labour Party rips itself apart, John Swinney’s SNP Government can always be trusted to be on Scotland’s side."

The Scottish Secretary, Douglas Alexander, is embarking on a significant visit to the Indo-Pacific region in the coming days, aiming to bolster defence ties and stimulate trade with Australia, New Zealand, and Singapore. His itinerary over the next week includes meetings with government and business leaders, a move he anticipates will unlock new opportunities for Scottish enterprises in these key markets.
Beyond fostering economic links, Mr Alexander is expected to explore potential collaborations in naval shipbuilding and advanced defence manufacturing. The visit underscores a dual focus on increasing Scottish exports and attracting crucial inward investment back to Scotland.
A notable aspect of the trip will see the Scottish Secretary attend two international performances of the Royal Edinburgh Military Tattoo, scheduled for Auckland and Brisbane, adding a cultural dimension to the diplomatic efforts.
The Scotland Office has highlighted the historical significance of the journey, noting that Mr Alexander will be the first Scottish Secretary to visit New Zealand in recent times.
Speaking ahead of the trade mission, Mr Alexander emphasised the purpose of his journey: "This visit is about speaking up for Scottish businesses and Scottish exporters." He further asserted, "Scotland benefits from the strength, reach and connections that come from being part of the UK."
He stressed the importance of international alliances amid current global uncertainties, stating it has "never been more important to stand shoulder to shoulder" with the UK’s closest allies. This, he explained, is to explore "how we can deepen our defence cooperation and work together to keep people safe."
Mr Alexander also pledged to champion Scottish commerce, adding: "I will also be banging the drum for Scottish business. From whisky and seafood to financial services and renewable energy technology, Scotland has world-class products and expertise that are in demand across Australia, New Zealand and Singapore." He concluded that the visit represents "an opportunity to open doors for Scottish exporters, attract the investment that creates economic growth and well paid jobs back at home, and show that Scotland is open for business on the global stage."

Why South Korea’s Hallyu heroes find taxes so … taxing
As K-culture conquers the world, its wealthy stars keep falling foul of a tax system ‘that has not yet fully caught up’
Then a new controversy hit – this time, over taxes.
The 39-year-old star of Can This Love Be Translated? has not been charged with any criminal offence, but the revelations – originally reported by media outlet Sports Kyunghyang – had an immediate impact, with one prominent fashion brand distancing itself from Kim in the aftermath.
As K-pop and K-dramas have produced global stars commanding vast appearance fees, tax disputes have become a recurring flashpoint. They expose a grey zone between aggressive tax planning and unlawful evasion, while raising a broader question: has the tax system kept pace with the industry’s explosive growth?

UN chief renews push for 'immediate ceasefire' in Sudan
The United Nations is "fully committed" to piling on pressure for an immediate ceasefire in Sudan, which has been devastated by nearly three years of civil war, Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said on Saturday.
Since April 2023, the Sudanese army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces have been locked in a bitter struggle for control of the country.
The conflict has killed tens of thousands of people and forced more than 11 million from their homes, sparking what the UN has called the world's worst humanitarian crisis.
"We have been very actively engaged... with the African Union, with the Arab League, with the Quad and with other key actors, in order to put effective pressure for an immediate ceasefire," Guterres said.
"We must look first of all to create the conditions to put pressure on the two parties of the conflict," he told reporters on the sidelines of an African Union summit in Ethiopia.
He also stressed the need to tackle foreign actors "supporting and arming" both sides - "some in the African continent and some outside".
The United Arab Emirates has repeatedly been accused of supplying the RSF with weapons, fuel and mercenaries - allegations Abu Dhabi denies despite the findings of UN experts, US lawmakers and international monitoring groups.
The UN chief also addressed fraught relations in the Horn of Africa after renewed fighting in northern Ethiopia sparked fears of a fresh conflict that could again draw in neighbouring Eritrea.
"Ethiopia and Eritrea are two neighbours and two countries that have had a common past struggle," Guterres said.
"My strong hope is that the two countries will be able to reconcile and will be able to, with that, contribute to the peace and stability in the continent," he added.
Eritrea, one of the world's most closed-off countries, gained independence in 1993 after decades of armed struggle against Ethiopia.
The two later fought a 1998-2000 border war in which tens of thousands died.
Their governments cooperated against rebels from Ethiopia's Tigray region during the 2020-2022 conflict but fell out over the peace accord, from which Eritrea was excluded.

Unions and Labour MPs call on Starmer to end ‘narrow factional agenda’

Union leaders and 25 Labour MPs have urged Keir Starmer to end a “narrow, factional agenda” within the Labour party.
A letter signed by the MPs, by the leaders of several Labour-affiliated trade unions and by campaign groupings within the party, claimed the approach from the top was “increasingly unpopular with the public”.
A number of serial Labour rebel MPs are among the signatories, including Clive Lewis and Brian Leishman, as well as senior figures such as John McDonnell.
They suggested the approach by the party’s leadership could undermine the ability to win elections.
The letter comes after Starmer has faced a turbulent few weeks in his premiership, with his judgment coming into question over the decision to appoint Peter Mandelson as ambassador to Washington DC, despite his links with the child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.
The prime minister’s top adviser Morgan McSweeney quit over his part in Lord Mandelson’s appointment, while Labour’s Scottish leader Anas Sarwar said Starmer should resign as a result of the scandal.
Further questions about the PM’s judgment were thrown up later in the week in a row over the appointment of his former spin doctor Matthew Doyle to the House of Lords after the aide campaigned for a sex offender.
Dubbed the Restore Labour Democracy statement, the letter hit out at the culture within Downing Street and Labour’s ruling team.
It said: “It’s increasingly clear that a narrow, factional agenda is being imposed upon the party and that this is increasingly unpopular with the public.
“This approach is wrong in principle and damaging in practice. When the Labour party sidelines its members, it weakens Labour’s roots in our communities, alienates voters and undermines Labour’s ability to win both people’s trust and elections.”
The signatories pointed to the candidate selection for the upcoming Gorton and Denton byelection, which Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham was blocked from standing in.
“Denying local members in Gorton and Denton the right to choose their candidate looks like part of a pattern, alongside the widespread barring of hard-working councillors and the withdrawal of the whip from MPs standing up for their constituents,” the letter said.
Labour MP for Leeds East, Richard Burgon, who helped to coordinate the statement, said: “Under Keir Starmer and Morgan McSweeney, there has been a clampdown on the democratic rights of Labour members.
“This has led to a small clique making out-of-touch decisions that have left the prime minister and the government deeply unpopular – from the mess over winter fuel payments to the appalling decision to make Peter Mandelson the US ambassador.
“We need an urgent end to this nasty factionalism coming from the top of the party where the views of Labour members and trade unionists are treated with contempt.
“Restoring democracy in the Labour party is essential if we are to reconnect with voters and prevent the election of a Trump-style Reform government.”
The general secretaries of Unison, Unite, the CWU, the FBU and Aslef, all Labour-affiliated unions, had signed the letter, as had the groups Campaign for Labour Party Democracy, Momentum, the Labour Muslim Network, and Labour Assembly Against Austerity.
Labour members and trade unionists will be able to add their names to the letter from 15 February.
This date has been chosen as it is the 120th anniversary of the formal adoption of the name “The Labour Party” in 1906, according to the letter’s coordinators.
A Labour party spokesperson said: “The Labour party is proud to be powered by our brilliant party members as we work to bring about the vital change we were elected to deliver.
“Our Labour government is delivering for families across the country, including tackling the cost of living, cutting NHS waiting lists and restoring pride in local communities.”

MOSCOW, February 15. /TASS/. Countries must cooperate with one another to prevent the outbreak of World War III, Russian presidential envoy and head of the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) Kirill Dmitriev said.
"We need to work together to reduce the risks of World War III," he wrote on his page on the social network X, commenting on a publication by The New York Post.
The article cited the results of a poll among residents of the United Kingdom, Germany, the United States, and France who believe that World War III could begin within the next five years.

Regular visitors to the site are likely to be surprised when they discover, for the reopening of the Musée de la Vie Romantique in Paris on Saturday, February 14, after a year and a half of renovations, the brown hue now adorning the shutters, which were previously a lovely almond green. This new note lends the two-story house, nestled at the back of a garden shaded by century-old trees, the appearance of an Italian villa (though some other trees have unfortunately been cut down).
"For the woodwork and window frames, we tried to restore the house's original color, as it was built in 1830," explained Gaëlle Rio, the museum's director. In the absence of more precise documentation, the teams – Basalt Architecture and Atelier àkiko Designers – relied on a painting of the house held in the Netherlands' Dordrechts Museum for guidance. In the same spirit, the facade now sports a more noticeable ecru shade, achieved with a limewash "made using traditional methods," which also provides better insulation for the building.

Russia Mediates Between Israel and Iran, Ready to Help With the U.S

Russian Ambassador to Israel Anatoly Viktorov confirmed on Saturday that Moscow held secret diplomatic contacts last month with Israel and Iran, at the request of both countries, in order to prevent a military confrontation.
Russia is prepared to offer its "good services, without imposing them," Viktorov said, adding that "when the United States and Iran reach an understanding, Moscow will be ready to assist in implementing it." The ambassador clarified that these are classic diplomatic channels that are not made public prematurely.
Against the backdrop of rising tensions and preparations for a possible U.S. military action against Iran, Viktorov stressed in an interview with the news website RIA Novosti that Russia "has an orderly course of action that proved its effectiveness during the confrontation in the summer of 2025."
According to him, "we are prepared for any change in the security situation, but prefer not to have to activate the plan. Russia continues to adhere to a political and diplomatic solution to conflicts in the region and is ready to coordinate positions with international and regional partners in order to prevent further escalation."
In the interview, the Russian ambassador added that relations between Moscow and Jerusalem, renewed in 1991, "have stood the test of time and continue to be based on intensive political dialogue, deep cultural ties, and impressive trade volume - even amid international turbulence and regional conflicts."
In October, the two countries will mark 35 years since the renewal of diplomatic relations. According to Viktorov, from the late 1980s and early 1990s, an extensive legal framework for cooperation was built, laying the foundations for expanding ties in almost every field. However, he acknowledged that "in recent years, events have occurred that did not contribute to the development of relations, including the political crisis in Israel in 2019–2021, the COVID-19 pandemic, international polarization surrounding the crisis in Ukraine, and the escalation in the Middle East after October 7, 2023.
Nevertheless, Viktorov noted that a tradition of open dialogue and trust between the countries’ leaderships had taken shape already in the 2000s. "Even today, the solid foundation of cooperation is intensive political dialogue, first and foremost at the highest level", he said.
According to him, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held six phone conversations in 2025, with an additional call already taking place in January of this year. Viktorov noted that ongoing contacts are maintained between the Security Councils, the foreign and defense ministries and other government bodies. He emphasized that cultural ties play a central role, particularly thanks to the large community of immigrants from the former Soviet Union and Russia living in Israel.
He also stressed the importance of preserving the memory of World War II and the Great Patriotic War, and the struggle against Nazism and the extermination of the Jewish people and the Soviet people. According to Viktorov, despite Western pressure and sanctions, mutual trade has never ceased. He emphasized that Israel has not imposed any restrictions on Russia, although measures taken by Western countries complicate full economic activity, mainly due to challenges in carrying out international bank transfers. Despite this, bilateral trade in 2025 amounted to more than $2 billion. The main areas of trade include agriculture, food products and metals, with Israel continuing to purchase Russian wheat on a large scale.
'About two million Israelis speak Russian'
Viktorov noted that a legal process to restore Russian ownership of the Alexander Courtyard in Jerusalem has been underway since late 2019. According to him, a special Israeli interministerial committee is discussing the matter and held professional hearings in November 2025 with the participation of Russian representatives, including officials from the Prosecutor General’s Office of the Russian Federation. "We expect that this holy and important site will be returned to its lawful owners, the Russian Federation, and that historical justice will be restored in the foreseeable future," he said.
The ambassador described a particularly tense atmosphere during the 12-day war between Israel and Iran last June, which saw Israel targeted with daily missile fire. According to him, windows were shattered in several apartments rented by the embassy during one of the attacks, and the family of one employee - with three children - was saved by a miracle after entering a protected space in time. The embassy in Tel Aviv and the Consulate General in Haifa switched to round-the-clock emergency operations.
"We activated a round-the-clock hotline that received thousands of inquiries", he said. Consular teams provided expedited services to citizens seeking to return to Russia, and alternative exit routes were explained due to the closure of Israeli airspace. According to him, families of embassy staff were temporarily evacuated via Egypt, and families of Russian citizens receiving medical treatment in Israel - including three children suffering from serious illnesses - were evacuated to Jordan with medical accompaniment.
Viktorov noted that the level of development of trade and logistics systems in Israel is high, and there is no shortage of products. According to him, products familiar to immigrants from the former Soviet Union are widely available, and "Russian" stores and products from Eastern Europe are an integral part of the Israeli landscape. According to the embassy’s estimates, about two million Israelis speak Russian to some degree. "We speak the same language, celebrate similar holidays and preserve shared traditions. This connection is not subject to political conjuncture", he said.
The ambassador concluded that despite disagreements and challenges, there is a mutual desire to maintain an open, respectful and constructive dialogue. "The work continues, sometimes quietly, away from the spotlight, but aimed at results and at strengthening the ties between Russia and Israel," he said.

Origin coaches hail the successful return of interstate Aussie rules

AFL State of Origin coaches hail success of concept following Victoria's win over Western Australia
In short:
Both head coaches for Victoria and Western Australia are hailing the success of AFL State of Origin's return.
Victoria defeated Western Australia in front of a sellout crowd at Perth Stadium, the first Origin match since 1999.
Victoria coach Chris Scott says he believes the Origin concept has the ability to be a viable product, long term.
Winning Victoria coach Chris Scott and his Western Australia counterpart Dean Cox have called for State of Origin to be played every year after the concept's stunning return in Perth.
A sellout crowd of 58,141 fans turned up to Perth Stadium on Saturday night to watch Victoria hold on for a hard-fought 24-point win, 18.17 (125) to 15.11 (101).
WA closed to within six points early in the final quarter following three quick goals to Jesse Hogan, but Victoria's star-studded squad was able to manage the heat and see out the win.
It marked the first AFL Origin match since 1999, and the resounding success of its return has already sparked calls for the concept to continue.
"I would love nothing more than to see this grow," Scott said.
"I'm obviously a huge advocate. And I think this has got the potential to be something big.
"I don't see any reason why it shouldn't be every year.
"Maybe if the player interest does wane a little bit, maybe then you think about adjusting it, but I can't imagine that being the case.
"I think it will only grow legs. I mean, as a coach, I think it's the best time now in pre-season.
"For example, our players have a practice match against Hawthorn on Monday. I know where I'd rather my players be playing."
Importantly, players from both sides went all-out in their attempt to win the game, and a number of the league's biggest stars have already signalled their desperation to represent their state next year.
Scott said WA had the "front running" to host Origin again, given the way fans in the state embraced it, but he knew there would be other states knocking down the door to take part.
"It really has got some potential," Scott said.
"If you were a South Australian-aligned player or an Allies-aligned player, you had to watch that game thinking, 'How can you leave us out of this contest?'"
Cox is equally optimistic about Origin's future.
"I think State of Origin should be every year," Cox said.
"It's for the AFL to work out who plays in that, whether it's a carnival, whether it's a standalone game.
"The WA government, WA Tourism and the WA public showed that they'll support it no matter what time of the year it comes, and they probably deserve to hold it."
Not one AFL star who was fit and eligible to play for either Victoria or Western Australia turned down the opportunity to take part.
The huge buy-in from players was arguably the biggest reason for the concept's success, and even the glut of injuries to come out of Saturday's game did not dampen the excitement.
Carlton defender Jacob Weitering was taken to hospital with possible neck, rib and shoulder damage after being crunched in a marking contest.
Adelaide recruit Callum Ah Chee, Port forward Mitch Georgiades and GWS defender Sam Taylor had their games cut short due to hamstring niggles, while Gold Coast's Brownlow medallist Matt Rowell injured a finger.
Nevertheless, Hogan said the players had embraced the concept.
"This year was a little bit of the unknown," Hogan said.
"I mean, all the players were excited for it, but we weren't really sure what to expect.
"As we were getting closer, as the teams getting announced, the excitement kind of grew.
"I think everyone that played under-age footy or wants to play for their state or watched tonight. I think this could blossom into something special.
"There's absolutely no reason why the players wouldn't want to buy into this every single year. Hopefully it's here to stay."

Israeli warplanes carried out air strikes late on Saturday targeting the outskirts of Houmine al-Fawqa in the Iqlim al-Tuffah area of southern Lebanon, according to Lebanese state media.
Lebanon’s National News Agency (NNA) reported that the strikes hit the al-Hamila area near the town at around 10.15 pm local time (2015 GMT).
No immediate information was available regarding casualties or damage.
The attacks come amid repeated Israeli violations of a ceasefire agreement reached in November 2024.
Israel continues to occupy five Lebanese hilltops seized during the latest war that began in October 2023, in addition to other Lebanese areas it has held for decades.
The Israeli attacks have killed more than 4,000 people and wounded 17,000 others in Lebanon.

4 astronauts arrive at International Space Station to replace Nasa’s evacuated crew
The unprecedented medical evacuation meant spacewalks were paused and research cut down due to the small crew remaining
The International Space Station returned to full strength with Saturday’s arrival of four new astronauts to replace colleagues who bailed early because of health concerns.
SpaceX delivered the US, French and Russian astronauts a day after launching them from Cape Canaveral.
Last month’s medical evacuation was Nasa’s first in 65 years of human space flight.
One of four astronauts launched by SpaceX last summer suffered what officials described as a serious health issue, prompting their hasty return.
That left only three crew members to keep the place running – one American and two Russians – prompting Nasa to pause spacewalks and trim research.
Moving in for eight to nine months are Nasa’s Jessica Meir and Jack Hathaway, France’s Sophie Adenot and Russia’s Andrei Fedyaev.

Israel never annexed the Golan Heights: Why it still matters - opinion
Unknown

‘The State of Israel took control of the Golan Heights in 1967 to safeguard its security from external threats. I, Donald J. Trump, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim that the United States recognizes that the Golan Heights are part of the State of Israel.”
This was the text of the historic proclamation Trump issued as he stood next to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on March 25, 2019. In response to the president’s proclamation, the United Nations Press Office reported, “Most Security Council members expressed regret today over the decision by the United States to recognize Israel’s sovereignty over the Syrian Golan, stressing the importance of upholding international law, as the 15-member organ heard briefings on the situation in that occupied territory.”
Why was President Trump’s proclamation so controversial?
In the Six Day War of 1967, Israel, facing existential threats from Egypt, Jordan, and Syria, heroically reclaimed its ancient biblical heartlands in a stunning display of resilience and strategy. This triumphant return to historic Jewish lands culminated in securing the Golan Heights from Syrian aggression, ensuring lasting security for Israel’s northern communities.
The world’s opposition to Israel’s control of the Golan Heights stems primarily from the post-World War II principle that the acquisition of territory by force, even in self-defense, is inconsistent with international law, as enshrined in the UN Charter and reinforced by resolutions like Security Council Resolution 497 (1981), which declared Israel’s annexation that year “null and void” and without legal effect.
Israel extended sovreignty, did not annex Golan Heights
Most nations view the area as occupied Syrian territory, demanding withdrawal to the 1967 lines per Resolutions 242 and 338. Critics highlight ongoing settlement expansion, displacement of Syrians, and resource exploitation as violations of the Fourth Geneva Convention. Only the United States recognizes Israeli sovereignty, while the international community, including annual UN General Assembly votes, overwhelmingly rejects it.
A fascinating note to mark is that although most of the world assumes Israel annexed the Golan Heights, and did so illegally, the Jewish state never actually did. Instead, Israel extended its sovereignty to the Golan Heights. The difference between extending sovereignty and annexing is important and instructs Israel’s future policies.
In a 1994 piece for the Brooklyn Journal of International Law, Leon Sheleff explained that Israel’s 1981 Golan Heights Law, pushed through by then prime minister Menachem Begin, never actually annexed the territory Israel took from Syria in 1967. Instead, it simply extended Israeli law, administration, and jurisdiction over the area.
Begin, still recovering from illness at the time, moved fast on this amid ongoing Syrian threats. Notice how the law itself carefully avoids the word “annexation,” a deliberate contrast to something like the explicit unification of Jerusalem.
Back then, after 1967, the Golan had almost no Syrian institutional footprint left. Most people had fled, and the remaining Druze communities were basically running things under their own customary rules. Applying Israeli law filled that empty space without forcing citizenship on anyone. Residents kept their Syrian nationality, and only a small number ever asked for Israeli citizenship voluntarily, a fact Israeli courts later confirmed.
Sheleff pointed out a larger distinction: Applying domestic law isn’t the same as extending sovereignty outright. He brings examples from international practice where laws get imposed on territory without transferring sovereignty, which fits with the rules against one-sided annexation of occupied land.
Philosophically, Begin refused to annex the Golan Heights because he maintained that a nation can’t annex land that has historically always been theirs. He included the Golan Heights in historically Jewish land and therefore felt it could not be annexed.
The Economic Cooperation Foundation is a leading Israeli think-tank that was critical of Israel’s extension of sovereignty over the Golan Heights. It described the Israeli Golan law as unilaterally extending Israeli jurisdiction and administration to the Golan Heights. This effectively constituted an annexation of the territory that was occupied from Syria during the 1967 Six Day War.
Passed almost 40 years ago, it doesn’t seem likely that the Golan law will ever be reversed. The discussion over its legal significance seems largely academic, but in truth, it has significance in today’s discussions over other areas aside from the Golan that Israel took control over in 1967, including Judea and Samaria and even Gaza.
Opponents of an Israeli annexation of the other territories claim that Israel isn’t intending to annex these lands. Instead, they claim, Jerusalem is planning to slowly extend sovereignty over these areas and follow the path taken in the Golan law. Regardless of whether that ever happens, they claim an expanding Israeli footprint in Judea and Samaria is creating de facto Israeli sovereignty.
Proponents of Israeli sovereignty over Judea and Samaria fall into two camps. There are those who campaign for immediate Israeli annexation of Judea and Samaria. Others follow Begin’s path and argue that Israel can’t annex Judea and Samaria because it is historically already Jewish land. They argue for a Golan-like extension of sovereignty over Judea and Samaria.
To summarize, despite widespread assumptions and international condemnation, Israel never formally annexed the Golan Heights in 1981. Instead, through the Golan Heights Law, it extended Israeli law, jurisdiction, and administration, a deliberate distinction allowing governance without explicit sovereignty transfer. This approach, rooted in security needs and historical claims, preserved diplomatic flexibility for potential peace negotiations while achieving de facto control.
President Trump’s 2019 recognition affirmed Israeli sovereignty amid ongoing threats, yet the nuanced legal framing continues to influence debates on whether to apply similar models to other territories like Judea and Samaria, balancing practical retention with sensitivities to international law.

New study examines debate over brain-dead pregnant women kept on ventilator
Unknown

08:32:10 KST

A.S., a pregnant, 30-year-old nurse and mother, was declared legally brain-dead in February 2025 following cerebral thrombosis.
Identified as “Baby Chance,” her male infant was maintained on somatic support – intensive medical care designed to maintain stable blood pressure, temperature, and fluid balance. This technology manages metabolic dysfunction after brain-stem death, sustains organ perfusion for donation, and can even keep the fetus in its mother’s womb alive so it can be delivered later.
The case that occurred at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia, has just been described in an 11-page study in the latest issue of the Rambam Maimonides Medical Journal – published at Haifa’s Rambam Health Care Campus – under the title “The halachic heartbeat at the edge of life: navigating maternal brain death and fetal life” (see link below). It was written by Prof. John Loike, interim director of bioethics at New York Medical College and a professor of biology at New York’s Touro University; Rabbi Prof. Tzvi Flaum, an expert in Judaic studies teaching at Lander College for Women at Touro; and Prof. Alan Kadish, Touro’s president and a well-known cardiologist.
They said that the tragic event “raised profound questions at the intersection of Jewish law and contemporary medical practice, particularly regarding the halakhic definition of death – brain versus cardiac cessation – and the moral status of the fetus.” The paper investigates dissimilar rabbinic opinions on whether sustaining a brain-dead body for fetal viability is halachically permissible or obligatory, and the principle of pikuah nefesh (saving a life), the fetus as a potential such life, and the permissibility of delaying burial to perform a cesarean section.
Jewish law's 'nuanced and compassionate' responses to bioethics
Loike told The Jerusalem Post in an email interview that, “when I read about this case, I was moved by all of the ethical, medical, and halachic controversies that it elicited and decided to write about it with the help of my colleagues in a month-long, intensive collaboration that developed through rigorous cross-disciplinary meetings to ensure medical accuracy and halachic depth.”
The three scholars argued that Jewish law “offers nuanced and compassionate responses to unprecedented bioethical dilemmas and that [it] is ethically responsive, evolving through dialogue with changing human circumstances while remaining rooted in balancing reverence for life with the dignity of death.”
The study stresses the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration among halachic authorities and medical professionals to navigate ethically complex and medically novel scenarios with both compassion and rigor.
“The Talmud permits violating most commandments, including killing a would-be murderer in self-defense or performing medical interventions that save a life, as overriding nearly all commandments,” they wrote, adding that, “It can extend even to cases involving the protection of potential life such as a fetus after 40 days of gestation.”
Hospital doctors decided on somatic support because of the state’s abortion law and to allow the fetus to develop until at least 32 weeks, a stage at which fetal survival outside the womb becomes more likely. The family of A.S. did not agree to or request that he be placed on a ventilator. Instead, family members, including her mother, maintained that they were not given a choice and were told by hospital staff that they had no say, due to Georgia’s restrictive abortion law.
Family calls experience 'torture'
The family described A.S.’s experience as “torture.” Maintaining her on life support demanded more than only mechanical ventilation, nutritional support, and monitoring her vital signs, as doctors gave her a variety of hormones to maintain the pregnancy and support the fetus’s growth.
On June 13, 2025, the brain-dead woman’s baby son was born prematurely via emergency C-section. Although he weighed just 0.82 kilos (1.8 lbs), he was alive and brought to the neonatal intensive care unit. Four days later, A.S. was taken off life support, died soon after, and was buried on June 28.
The case triggered national debate and raised complex ethical questions, especially about the justification for sustaining somatic support in a brain-dead pregnant woman solely to facilitate fetal viability.
“The case of Baby Chance is both a medical marvel and a complex bioethical case,” Loike said. “He has shown remarkable resilience, growing to about five kilos as of last December, but he faces the significant respiratory challenges typical of extreme prematurity. My analysis of this case is based strictly on public records, news reports, and peer-reviewed literature; I have not conducted personal interviews with the parties involved.”
In late December 2025, a Georgia judge awarded the mother’s partner sole legal and physical custody of Baby Chance. This was a significant legal hurdle because, under Georgia law, unmarried biological fathers do not automatically have parental rights. The “legitimation” case was fast-tracked to ensure the infant would not enter the foster care system once discharged.
Loike noted that he always finds it impressive that rabbinical authorities first review the legal/halachic parameters that any case elicits, but they also value the fact that Jewish law is not merely a rigid algorithm. “It is a profoundly person-specific system where a scholar’s ruling on a specific case may change based on a patient’s unique psychological, financial, or spiritual needs,” he said.
The authors said the case and others like it are “remarkable for many reasons. First, in the secular academic world, it reignited fierce debates across legal, medical, and religious circles. American law must wrestle with fetal viability, maternal autonomy, and state-level abortion restrictions. Second, there is concern whether long-term life support or performing a C-section endangers the gestating fetus.” There have been only 40 such cases in medical literature over the past several decades, they wrote, and in at least 28, the baby survived after delivery.
“While American courts grapple with issues of fetal rights and maternal autonomy, continued the authors, Jewish law incorporates a distinct bioethical lens. Before the 1960s, a direct and rapid link existed between the cessation of brain function and the cessation of cardiac function,” they wrote.
“For example, after a cardiac arrest, the brain ceased to function within minutes, and, similarly, following a severe stroke or brain trauma, the heart would stop shortly after the brain – but modern medical technology including respirators has challenged this understanding by allowing a functional heartbeat to be maintained long after the brain has ceased to function. So,” they asked, “does brain cessation or cardiac cessation constitute halachic death?”
The first documented case in the Torah that would allow a pregnant woman to be killed with her fetus is Tamar. Other halachic issues include abortion, heart transplantation, performing a C-section, suffering of the deceased, and destruction of sperm. “What is the humanhood status of a human embryo? This is a crucial question that directly impacts whether one is permitted or even obligated to maintain this brain-dead woman on life support for months in order to deliver the baby,” they declared.
Various experts on Jewish medical ethics in Israel and the US have different views on how Jewish law defines death. The Israeli Respiratory-Brain Death Act of 2008 includes religious accommodations for those who view cardiac cessation as halachic death – the time of death is defined to be either when “respiratory-brain death” is determined under the act, or when cardiac respiratory death is determined.
Respiratory-brain death can be determined if the medical cause leading to cessation of brain function is known and proven; and if there is clear clinical proof of irreversible cessation of whole-brain function (including brain-stem function) and cessation of independent respiration.
After long deliberations in the article and quoting numerous religious scholars through the ages, the authors conclude, inconclusively, that “Judaism teaches responsibility, compassion, and reverence for life. Halacha responds not with legal rigidity but with ethical pluralism, allowing a spectrum of legitimate positions grounded in deep values. This case presents a challenging intersection of medical ethics, legal considerations, and religious beliefs. Jewish law provides a framework for understanding the status of the fetus and the definitions of death, but it also calls for compassion and respect for all lives.”
In Jewish law, “life is not measured solely by the beat of a heart or the hum of a ventilator. The Torah commands us to choose life, but it also commands us to choose wisely. Pikuach nefesh overrides nearly every commandment, yet we are also warned not to desecrate the dead, not to hasten death, and not to confuse compassion with convenience. These tensions are not contradictions – they are invitations to moral greatness,” they concluded.

Francesca Albanese represents UN inability to acknowledge truth and morality - opinion

If you think that killing babies, slaughtering whole families, raping young women, burning down communities, and taking 251 people hostage is exemplary behavior, then you might also agree with UN Special Rapporteur Francesca Albanese that Palestine is the moral compass for the region.
Unashamed to make such a statement, at a recent Al Jazeera conference, one has to wonder if Albanese has any understanding of the concept of good vs evil. Because the suggestion that Palestine represents a moral compass reflects her own broken one.
Also attending were the notorious Hamas leader Khaled Mashaal and Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, who reiterated Albanese’s convoluted notion that Palestine stands as a moral compass, “a test of whether international law has meaning and whether human rights have universal value.”
Sounding the signal to a world that would be well-served to completely ignore Albanese, she took advantage of her platform, provided by the Qatari news media organization, described by Avi Nir-Feldklein, Israel’s European Union Ambassador, as the “Muslim Brotherhood propaganda arm,” to point out that “humanity has a common enemy,” obviously referring to Israel.
Nir-Feldklein asks how Albanese stands alongside the foreign minister of Iran’s terror regime, fresh from killing and executing its own citizens, and alongside a senior leader of Hamas, one of the world’s deadliest terrorist organizations, responsible for the October 7 massacre.
That both Albanese and Araghchi dare to utter such words, acting as if they have any moral high ground, simply confirms the depravity of their own pitiful souls.
The world has forgotten what truth and morality look like
How did they become so hardened to wickedness, unable to identify evil when it stares them right in the face? If nothing else, this is the ultimate indictment, revealing to what depths the UN has sunk. If anyone there had even a drop of integrity, they would renounce what she said and fire her immediately.
But that’s the trouble. The world has forgotten what real truth and morality look like, exchanging it for the likes of corrupt, unscrupulous individuals who are easily bought off for a few pounds of silver, without ever feeling the guilt pangs of a seared conscience.
Devoid of shame, they have desensitized all wrongdoing, making their life choices and evaluations based on what best serves the interests of those to whom they owe their loyalty and allegiance.
Incapable of grasping the great damage done to their own image, they are apathetic to their inhumanity, falsely judging Israel as the villain in this battle of profound evil that seeks to destroy God’s creation.
It's easy to understand how Araghchi got that way, since his 62 years of life were spent in Iran, patterning himself after the mullahs who have held the country hostage for most of that time.
But what about Albanese? How did she end up being the poster child for deception, hypocrisy, and perversion? The 48-year-old Italian-born legal scholar, who claims to be an expert on human rights, lives in Tunisia with her two children and husband Massimiliano Cali, an official of the World Bank.
It seems that her corrupt thinking developed over the course of many years, culminating in allegations of financial misconduct in 2023. Accepting money from organizations that support Hamas, she was accused of violating the UN Code of Conduct for Special Procedures, precluding her from accepting gifts from non-governmental sources.
Her over-the-top antisemitic views seem to be an offshoot of her desire to please her Jew-hating supporters and benefactors – to the point where she even compared Israel to Nazi Germany.
Her personal view that the October 7 massacre was merely a “response to oppression” renders her incapable of being a fair arbiter of what is considered just, honorable, and righteous in the eyes of rational and reasonable human beings.
Her sick contention that “Palestinians have a right to resist oppression” makes her incapable of all objectivity, given that cold-blooded murder of innocent civilians can in no way be justified as a legitimate form of resistance – especially since any oppression suffered by them has come from their own corrupt and evil leaders.
But there have been grave consequences for her controversial positions – one of which was the revocation of her visa, barring her from the US, meaning she cannot even set foot in the UN – which she ironically represents. Additionally, her US assets have been frozen, and she was blacklisted as if she “were a terrorist or drug trafficker.”
“Consequently, all of her transactions involve cash. She cannot receive transfers or donations, collect her salary, or even buy a plane ticket online. She cannot open a bank account anywhere in the world or have a credit card, because she has been placed on the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) list of the US Treasury Department, which targets money laundering and terrorism.”
Although Albanese requested intervention by her home country, given that its leader, Giorgia Melonia – who is a close Trump ally – no assistance has been granted.
Albanese has made herself a pariah, and is responsible for her own undoing. But for someone who longs for the privileges of which she has been stripped, she cannot think that characterizing Palestine, as a moral compass, will be helpful to her cause.
In the end, this is the sad story of a woman who lacks the capacity to judge with any rational or reasoned acumen. Devoid of discernment, or just jaded as a result of unbridled ambition, Albanese is, indeed, paying the price for the folly of provocateur status.
Apparently, resigned to being an outcast, she is the willing abrasive mouthpiece for terror organizations and governments who would like to see a swift end to the Jewish homeland. In that respect, Albanese is a proxy flame thrower, doing the dirty work that others have been too cowardly to take on.
When you think about it, she is nothing more than a useful tool, much in the style of Hezbollah and the Houthis who do the bidding for Iran.

Haredi, Arab children with autism face inequality and delay in diagnosis, study finds

Although early diagnosis and treatment of autism spectrum disorder in toddlers is vital for improving their developmental functioning, haredi (ultra-Orthodox) Jewish and Arab-Israeli families suffer from “extreme inequality” in the availability of help.
This was determined by a new, 30-page, Hebrew-language study by Jerusalem’s Taub Center for Social Policy Studies, conducted in collaboration with the KI Institute, a new, non-profit academic center for applied computational health research in the central Israeli moshav of Kfar Malal.
The Taub Center is an independent and non-partisan research institution that deals with economic and social issues, providing policymakers and the public with research on some of the most important issues facing Israel in the areas of education, health, welfare, the labor market, and economic policy, in order to influence decision-making processes and improve the well-being of all Israelis.
The in-depth research revealed that children in haredi neighborhoods receive eligibility for autism benefits at an average age of 4.7, two years later than children in non-haredi neighborhoods, thus missing the critical window of time for effective treatment.
A significant gap in self-identification was also found in Arab society and in Jewish neighborhoods of low socioeconomic status. Fewer children come for diagnosis despite high exposure to risk factors, the researchers wrote.
New system based on risk-prediction proposed
They proposed an immediate solution in the form of leveraging the existing infrastructure of the tipat halav (well-baby clinic) system for universal coverage based on a risk-prediction model that would make early identification possible without the need for additional budgeting.
Researchers Dr. Sarit Silverman, Dr. Guy Amit, and Dr. Yair Sadaka examined the age of diagnosis and identification of autism in Israel. The most critical stage for effective intervention to advance the child, known as the “golden hour” – depends largely on the area of residence and sector affiliation.
“Similar to the global trend, in the last two decades, there has been a dramatic increase in the incidence of autism diagnoses in Israel. During this period, diagnosis rates increased 20-fold – from about one per 1,000 children in 2005 to about 20 per 1,000 children in 2025, with most of the increase occurring in recent years,” Silverman told The Jerusalem Post in an interview.
She suggested that the significant increase in autism diagnoses around the world in the last decade was largely due to the broader definition of the condition of a “broad spectrum” rather than individual disabilities, as well as earlier diagnosis and greater awareness. “The increase here stems from a combination of raising awareness, state incentives, and social acceptance – but, according to our findings, this growth is not equitable.”
“A paradoxical situation has arisen in which, despite the extensive support set that the state provides – both in terms of budget and treatment – there are gaps in accessibility between population groups,” said Silverman, who is a senior early-children education researcher in learning disabilities. Her doctorate explored the unique relationship between spatial working memory and mathematics performance among primary school-aged children and university students.
Double inequality: ASD diagnoses appear later and at lower rates
Conventional practice recommends diagnosis at ages two to three for optimal intervention results; late diagnosis reduces the effectiveness of the intervention. A two-year delay means that the child begins receiving treatment and assistance only in kindergarten, when the critical time window for early intervention has largely passed. Beyond this delay in the timing, the study also shows that overall identification rates are lower in this community relative to its share in the population.
“In the study, we saw two types of inequality: the first in the haredi community, where we witness a double gap: both in the lower rate of children who have received a diagnosis and official confirmation of being on the autism spectrum compared to the general population, as indicated by the eligibility and confirmation data, and in a critical delay in the age at which children are diagnosed, Silverman said.
“The second is in Arab society and other groups of low socioeconomic status, where the problem focuses on profound under-recognition, which reflects resource gaps in navigating the diagnostic and treatment systems, making it difficult for families from disadvantaged populations,” she said. “In both cases, the sad result is children who do not receive an equal opportunity to integrate into society and reach their potential simply because of their background.”
To bridge the gaps, the researchers recommend a transition to universal coverage for autism at tipat halav clinics. The study proposes using the predictive model developed at the KI Institute, which allows for an accurate assessment of autism risk based on developmental milestones routinely assessed at the well-baby facilities.
Tipat halav is a “treasured system,” but some have an inadequate number of nurses and doctors to take over the task of early diagnosis and referral. They have to be improved, Silverman said. “I didn’t study the ‘why’ – the reasons that haredi and Arab families suffer from extreme inequality. I can’t imagine that it’s intentional; every child should get early intervention. As for the Arab sector, it may also be due to an inadequate number of Arabic-speaking professionals in the field.”
Since well-baby clinics are public institutions and their services are provided to all sectors, “this step will maximize accessibility to autism diagnoses,” the team suggested. “Moreover, because the infrastructure for developmental assessments already exists, the diagnoses can be integrated into existing clinical work processes at no additional cost. This solution will provide a universal approach to developmental monitoring that can identify children at risk for autism before differences in family resources create barriers to identification and intervention,” the researchers wrote.
The universal identification process needs to be complemented by one of targeted interventions for disadvantaged populations that would address the complex barriers faced by families from low socioeconomic status, the report continued.
“This process should include proactive support for families from disadvantaged communities,” it concluded, “from initial screening and access to services through community outreach programs, customized educational material, and cultural-sensitivity training for service providers, to mediation programs that reduce barriers in the existing community framework.”

Obama speaks out on racist video shared by Trump
- A video depicting Barack and Michelle Obama as apes was shared on Donald Trump's Truth Social account last week.
- Barack Obama described the behavior as “deeply troubling” and a “clown show,” stating that most Americans still believe in decency.
- He added that much of the decorum and respect for public office has been lost in social media and television, but he believes the ultimate judgment will come from the American people.
- Trump has refused to apologize for the video or discipline the staffer, asserting he “didn't make a mistake.”
- The video drew widespread criticism, including from Republican Senators Tim Scott and Katie Britt, which reportedly angered Trump.

Four astronauts docked at the International Space Station on Saturday, February 14, for a months-long research mission, replacing a crew forced to return to Earth early over a medical issue.
The US space agency's Crew-12 arrived at the orbiting laboratory after a journey of about 34 hours that started with blastoff from Cape Canaveral, Florida aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket.
"We have bridged the legacy of humankind's continuous presence in space spanning more than 25 years at this very site," American astronaut Jessica Meir said after docking at the ISS. "As we look back at Earth from these windows, we are reminded that cooperation is not just possible, it is essential. Up here, there are no borders and hope is universal."
Other members of Crew-12 are American Jack Hathaway, Russian cosmonaut Andrey Fedyaev and French astronaut Sophie Adenot, the second French woman to fly to space. She follows in the footsteps of Claudie Haignere, who spent time on the Mir space station.
Among other research, she will test a system that uses artificial intelligence and augmented reality to allow astronauts to carry out their own medical ultrasounds. "I am proud to bring France and Europe along on this incredible adventure that transcends borders," Adenot said. "Count on me to share every step with you and bring a sparkle to the eyes of the French people."
During their eight months on the outpost, the astronauts will conduct many experiments, including research into the effects of microgravity on their bodies.
One of the last crews abord the ISS
The foursome are replacing Crew-11, which returned to Earth in January a month earlier than planned in the first medical evacuation in the space station's history. The ISS, which orbits 400 kilometers above Earth, has since been staffed by a skeleton crew of three. NASA declined to disclose any details about the health issue that cut the previous mission short.
Crew-12 will be one of the last crews to live aboard the football field-sized space station. Continuously inhabited for the last quarter-century, the aging ISS is scheduled to be pushed into Earth's orbit before crashing into an isolated spot in the Pacific Ocean in 2030.

Intelligence: North Korean troops use drones, electronic warfare in war against Ukraine
Andrii Cherniak, a representative of the Ukrainian Defense Ministry's Main Intelligence Directorate (HUR), said this in an exclusive interview with MBC TV, a leading South Korean television channel, Ukrinform reports, citing the HUR's Facebook page.
"We can clearly see that according to Ukraine's military intelligence, North Korean servicemen operate and use combat drones. And not only drones. Importantly, they have already learned to use electronic intelligence and electronic warfare systems," Cherniak said.
He stressed that at present only three armies in the world have real combat experience in conducting modern, drone-based technological warfare: the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, and the army of North Korea.
More details about the involvement of the North Korean contingent in the war against Ukraine on Russia's side, the specifics of the alliance between Moscow and Pyongyang, the use by Russian forces of North Korean KN-23/24 missiles to commit war crimes, as well as the conditions under which captured North Korean soldiers are held in a camp on Ukrainian territory, can be found in a documentary film by South Korea's MBC TV.

Forget glitter, this Carnival party in southern Brazil is all about mud
A Carnival party in Paraty swaps glitter and costumes for mud, as crowds cover themselves in gray sludge and celebrate as one group
- Bookmark
Revelers heading to Carnival parties in Brazil typically don colorful, skimpy outfits and splatter glitter everywhere, but near an old colonial town in the south of the country people cover themselves in something very different – mud.
Partakers in this unusual Carnival party in Paraty drape gray sludge on themselves and roll around in the silty shallows of a beach, forming a unified mass.
“Everyone is kind of the same (…), those who have money and those who don’t: everyone comes here to jump into the mud,” said Charles Garcia Pessoa, a 37-year-old entrepreneur.
Under a blazing sun, the mud-covered partygoers danced and grunted cavemen chants — “Uga! Uga!” — while marching along the sand, accompanied by musicians.
The tradition started in 1986, according to Paraty’s tourism site. Friends were playing in the mangroves at Jabaquara Beach, and realized they weren’t recognizable. They went strolling into the city’s historic center and caused a stir.
The next year, a group lathered themselves up with mud to present themselves as a prehistoric tribe for Carnival. They carried skulls, vines and bones as they uttered their chants, the site said.
And so the mud party was born. And in the years since, it has become a beloved tradition.
Matt Bloomfield, a New Zealander who runs a film festival, decided to come to Paraty for the mud party after seeing coverage of last year’s event.
“Everyone’s being so creative, you see people around decorating themselves with leaves,” he said. “It’s a great alternate version of Carnival.”

A Nigerian fishing festival returns to the joy of the community, despite setbacks
Thousands of fishermen have descended on the Matan Fadan river, a UNESCO heritage site that snakes through lush vegetation in the village of Argungu in Nigeria’s northwest

Thousands of fishermen descended Saturday on the milky waters of the Matan Fadan river, a UNESCO heritage site that snakes through lush vegetation at the town of Argungu in Nigeria’s northwest.
Several thousand onlookers, including President Bola Tinubu, cheered them on as they competed to hook the biggest fish, even as security issues kept some people away. Competitors used only traditional angling techniques, such as hand-woven nets and large calabash gourds. Some used their bare hands to demonstrate their skills.
The waterway in Kebbi state was filled with woven nets and canoes as the fishermen forded the river. This year's winner caught a croaker fish weighing 59 kilograms (130 pounds). The winner is paid a cash prize, and the other participants get to sell their catch, boosting the local economy.
The small river is closed for the rest of the year and maintained by a titled chief called Sarkin Ruwa, the chief of the water.
The fishing competition was the culmination of the annual international fishing festival that featured cultural events, including traditional wrestling and music.
“I thank God that I got something to take home to my family to eat. I am very happy that I came,” Aliyu Muhammadu, a 63-year-old fisherman who participated in the competition, told The Associated Press.
The festival dates back to 1934, when nearly 100 years of hostility between the ancient Sokoto Caliphate — a sprawling 19th-century Islamic empire reaching from Nigeria to parts of modern-day Burkina Faso — and a holdout Argungu emirate ended.
The fishing festival is regarded as a symbol of unity, and it has run for decades until it was paused in 2010 following infrastructural problems and because of festering insecurity in Nigeria’s northern region. The festival returned in 2020 but was paused again until this year.
Nigeria is facing a complex security crisis, especially in the north, which for years has witnessed attacks that have left several thousand people dead. The attacks have been blamed on fighters with Islamist insurgent groups and criminal armed groups. The attacks are now spreading to the southern region.
Tinubu said the festival is a return to stability but for many the festival's return restores a sense of communal pride.
“Our challenge now is that people are scared of coming. A lot of people don’t attend the event like before because of insecurity," Hussein Mukwashe, the Sarkin Ruwa of Argungu, told The Associated Press.

Iran is turning Trump's strategy of chaotic communication confusion against him - opinion

During the twelve-day war of June 2025, the United States and Israel devastated Iran’s enrichment facilities at Natanz, Fordow, and Isfahan. But the most destructive weapon Trump deployed was not military. It was cognitive: a cascade of contradictory signals.
“Everyone should leave Tehran!” followed hours later by “Now is the time for peace!” “Unconditional surrender!” and the next morning, “A real opportunity for negotiations.” The result was total paralysis in Tehran. Every possible response was mined before it could be formulated.
Eight months later, in Muscat, a systematic review of Iranian internal communications reveals something striking: Iran copied the method, refined it, and is running it back against Trump.
From the book to the table
Across five rounds between Oman and Rome in the spring of 2025, Iran’s approach was straightforward: enrichment down to 3.67%, stockpile transfer to a third country. When Trump sent contradictory messages, Foreign Ministry spokesman Esmail Baghaei complained openly: “The contradictory messages are unhelpful.” Rounds were postponed. Then came June.
But regimes that survive 45 years are quick learners.
On February 3, 2026, Tasnim published three headlines simultaneously: confirmation of talks, a warning of war, and a rejection of negotiations under Trump’s conditions. Same outlet. Same day. Kayhan, whose editor is personally appointed by Khamenei, defended the talks on February 6 and ran “Fingers must stay on the trigger” on February 8. Ali Shamkhani, the supreme leader’s political advisor declared in six languages that the talks were operating “under the Leader’s command.” That same week, the IRGC unveiled the Khorramshahr-4 “Khyber” long-range ballistic missile inside an underground missile city. Diplomacy and a ballistic missile: This is exactly what Trump did in June.
Not cacophony: polyphony
The obvious counter: Iran’s system has always produced contradictory signals. During the JCPOA nuclear deal, while Mohammad Javad Zarif negotiated, the IRGC launched missiles. But in the past, the contradictions reflected genuine internal disputes. This time there is none.
Shamkhani explicitly declares that Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi is acting “under the order of the Leader.” The Guardian’s David Shariatmadari defends and threatens on consecutive days. The impression that “the IRGC might oppose a soft deal” is a tool in Khamenei’s hands, not a threat to him. This is not a cacophony of feuding factions: It is a polyphony with a conductor.
Three indicators support this reading. First, no leaks: Past contradictions always came with leaks about power struggles: This time, nothing. The post-January repression targeted the street, not the establishment; officials who previously leaked to Western media remain active.
Second, timing: Three contradictory Tasnim headlines on one day; Kayhan defending and warning within forty-eight hours; the Khorramshahr-4 unveiled on the eve of Muscat. These are not disagreements leaking out: they are signals sent deliberately.
Third, direction: Every contradictory voice leads to the same outcome. The hard line strengthens the negotiating position, the soft line prevents a strike – and the missile backs both. When contradictions serve the same objective, it is not disorder: It is design.
Trump versus Trump
If Iran is running Trump’s playbook against Trump, the result is an equilibrium neither side can break.
Khamenei cannot sign a real deal. A nuclear rollback dismantles his only remaining deterrent. Missile constraints cut the asymmetric advantage compensating for conventional weakness; dismantling proxies collapses his architecture of influence. Every pillar that falls brings the building closer to collapse.
Trump cannot start a real war. The armada dispatched after the January massacre in Iran created a commitment to act, but his political identity is built on “no more wars.” A regime that understands the end has come will hit American bases. One soldier killed, and Trump will have seen what Iraq did to Bush.
Regime change opens a question nobody can answer: 88 million people, dozens of ethnic groups, no opposition leader, and no plan for the day after. In June, Trump found a formula: short war, declare victory, go home. Iran is closing off that formula: The next round will not be twelve days.
Both sides need to continue the game, not end it. Trump needs the threat to project strength, Khamenei needs the talks to prevent a strike. The moment the game ends, both lose. Nour News, the Supreme National Security Council’s outlet, summed up Muscat: “The main game is still being played at the level of signals, not at the level of a draft agreement.” The talks are not the vehicle for a deal: they are the deal.
The assessment
If forced to bet, I predict that a “framework agreement” will be signed. Enrichment lowered, a symbolic transfer of material, a monitoring mechanism that looks impressive but lacks enforcement. Araghchi shakes Witkoff’s hand. Trump declares he achieved what Obama never could, Khamenei declares he gave up nothing: Both will be right. Within months, quietly, the infrastructure rebuilds.
This is unless the deal is built to crack the apparatus from within. January proved that the people are ready. But every uprising without an internal rupture ends in massacre. What is missing is not courage in the streets but a crack in the guards. A deal that damages the leadership without uniting it could be the lever. The question for Washington is whether the goal is a deal that produces a photo, or one that changes a structure.
And one more thing: Trump. This analysis assumes rational play. But the American president moved from threats to war within seventy-two hours in June. He may surprise again with a deal nobody expected – or a strike nobody recommended. His instincts override every informed assessment, especially regarding what would be unwise to do. In June, he proved it: There is no reason to assume he will not prove it again.

Iran needs regime change, not another reformist illusion doomed to fail - opinion

On 28 January, US Senator Marco Rubio testified before the Senate: “I don’t think anyone can give you a simple answer as to what happens next in Iran if the supreme leader and the regime were to fall – other than the hope that there would be some ability to have somebody in their systems that you could work toward a similar transition.”
The problem is precisely that hope.
Any transition brokered with figures from inside the Iranian regime would not be a solution; it would be another disaster for Iranians and for Israel. Now that negotiations are ongoing, any agreement would lead to so-called reformers getting a second wind.
The Islamic Republic has killed tens of thousands of its own citizens. During the current uprising alone, more than 36,500 people have been killed, making it the deadliest mass repression of the 21st century.
Internet access has been systematically restricted, leaving only a fraction of Iranians able to circumvent censorship.
From London, I open Instagram each day to messages from followers inside Iran sending me the names of friends, relatives, and neighbours who have been arrested or killed, asking me to pass them on to opposition channels. This has become my daily routine: opening messages and crying.
Reformists have never been the solution
It worsened when I learned that my friend Masoud Hasirchin, the Persian translator of The Case Against Socialism, had been imprisoned.
There is a crucial fact that Western observers consistently forget: The worst violence against Iranian protesters has always occurred under so-called “reformist” governments.
When Hassan Rouhani was president, Western media declared a breakthrough: A Gorbachev had emerged, they said. There was the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), renewed diplomatic optimism, and talk of moderation.
Then came Bloody Aban in November 2019. Over the course of just three days, security forces killed around 1,500 protesters, shut down the Internet nationwide, and plunged the country into silence. I was in Iran at the time. Only weeks later did we learn the scale of the massacre.
Soon after came Flight PS752. The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) shot down a civilian airliner shortly after take-off, killing all 176 passengers and crew.
And who defended the regime internationally? It was the reformists who defended that terrorist act in Western capitals: Javad Zarif, Hassan Rouhani, and today’s foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi.
Fast forward to today.
Once again, reformists return to office, and once again, Western media indulges the illusion that reform is possible. It is not that reformists lack power. It is that they lack will.
Reformers are not an alternative to the regime; they are its continuation, albeit a fragile one, because they have no legitimacy among the Iranian people.
Unlike European diplomats and Western journalists, Iranians have long since abandoned any faith in internal reform.
During the 2019 protests, people chanted: “Reformists, hardliners – this is the end of the story.” From Mohammad Khatami, who dismissed protests as a Western conspiracy, to Masoud Pezeshkian, who recently declared on X/Twitter that “an insult to the Leader is tantamount to an all-out war.”
On all fundamental issues, reformers share the same values as hardliners; their difference lies in strategy rather than substance, a temporary accommodation in service of a longer-term confrontation.
The political father of the reformists, Hashemi Rafsanjani, was the very figure who translated Akram Zuaytir’s The Story of Palestine and helped make the struggle for Palestine an integral part of the Islamic Revolution’s identity. The architect of the doctrine of perpetual conflict with Israel was also the progenitor of the so-called reform.
The reformists’ biggest achievement has not been for the Iranian people, but the mullahs; they have bought time and resources for a regime whose ambitions remain unchanged.
In the current uprising, reformists were not even mentioned. No one believes in them anymore. The political divide is between Khamenei and Pahlavi – not between clerics in robes and clerics in suits laundering blood for the mullahs.
With reformists in power, the regime’s reliance on the IRGC remains intact. Their political survival depends on it. That ensures the continuation of a terrorist organization, which the European Union, finally, has designated as such. Any transition engineered from within the regime would fail because those figures lack legitimacy. What Iran needs is not another illusion of reform but decisive Western support for genuine regime change.
Yet the ghost of Syria still haunts us.
Syria was arguably the West’s greatest strategic faux pas in the last 25 years. When Bashar Al-Assad assumed power in 2000, many hailed him as a reformer. As an ophthalmologist who had studied in London and married a British Syrian lady, many thought his Western education would bring economic and political liberalization to the country.
To some extent, he initially did. Syria opened to new markets which, however, centralized socio-economic power with his loyalists in Damascus. Tony Blair invited Assad and his wife back to London in 2002 for a state visit, the first by a Syrian leader. Assad even met Queen Elizabeth II.
However, all was in vain and when Blair needed support for military intervention in Iraq, and Assad – unlike his father – did not support these measures.
None of what had been discussed for the future of Syria was implemented (similar to the situation with today’s interim ruler). By 2011, a mix of political, economic, sectarian, and social factors fueled a bloody civil war that resulted in the loss of 600,000 lives (10 times more than in Gaza and yet public outcry was minimal).
In 2012, then-US president Barack Obama made his famous red-line comment on Syria, saying that if the regime used chemical weapons, it would trigger a significant US response.
In 2013, chemical weapons were used, and Obama was nowhere to be seen. Instead, he allowed the Russians, with Assad’s backing, to enter Syria and dismantle the weapons. In this process, he showed the world that Syria can do what it wants and gets away with it.
Then, he invited Russia to set up naval bases in Lattakia, a strategic global position. If Trump claims to be everything that Obama was not, he should not repeat the mistake of making empty threats that serve no purpose other than to empower the incumbent and weaken the resolve of many within Iran who are risking their lives for regime change.

US must reclaim its institutions and universities in face of Qatari financial influence - opinion

Following the October 7 attacks, Qatar has faced heightened scrutiny for sustaining Hamas, which invaded Israel and massacred 1,200 people in 2023. Despite demands from some US officials, Doha refuses to expel Hamas officials, who have enjoyed safe haven in the West Asian country since 2012.
Between 2017 and 2021, four Arab countries (the “Quartet”) blockaded Qatar due to its support of and billions of dollars in contributions to the Muslim Brotherhood, which the US Treasury has partially designated as a terrorist group.
As Qatar cultivates terrorism, it pumps billions of dollars into efforts to convince the West that it is a dependable business partner, cultural patron, and friend. These include efforts to sponsor sports, Western universities, media initiatives, tourism campaigns, airplane and weapon acquisitions, lobbying, and America’s Al Udeid base. In reality, such generosity is motivated by Doha’s greater desire for influence and political survival in a region hostile to its leadership (see Operation Abu Ali, for example).
Qatar’s impact on the West has been effective. Recently, it became a non-NATO major ally of the US, which helped Doha overcome the Quartet-led boycott. The country largely escaped accountability post-October 7 for its role in sponsoring Hamas. Many Americans forget that Qatar, in the 1990s, hosted Khaled Sheikh Mohammed, who later masterminded the 9/11 attacks. During the Wars on Terrorism, Qatar’s Al Jazeera Network hailed attacks on US troops as “paradise operations” while also manning booby traps where US soldiers were ambushed.
Qatari funding in US universities
As reports now allege that Qatar’s influence footprint in US higher education might be billions of dollars greater than once thought, exposing Doha’s partnerships with American institutions remains crucial for national security, especially as Qatar continues to influence America’s youth and future.
Previously, American universities were believed to have received $6.25 billion from Qatar, largely to fund their satellite campuses in Qatar’s Education City. The Institute for the Study of Global Antisemitism and Policy (ISGAP) now reports that Qatar has invested upwards of $20 billion, almost three times the previously thought of amount, into US universities such as Cornell, Georgetown, Texas A&M, Carnegie Mellon, Virginia Commonwealth, and Brown.
Another study by ISGAP documents a correlation between increased antisemitism on campuses and the presence of funding from Qatar. A recent Harvard poll also suggests that nearly half of all Americans aged 18-24 support Hamas over Israel. Whether or not Qatari funding has fueled such sentiment is a question that should be analyzed.
Recent disclosures reveal that Qatar and its campuses have forged memorandums of understanding (MOUs) with American institutions, many of which have escaped spotlight and scrutiny.
In 2025, Qatar University and Microsoft signed an MOU to formalize collaboration on “AI-driven learning solutions, leading research tools, and foundational digital infrastructure.” This agreement might not be simply academic or civilian in nature. As the agreement notes, it is meant to support Qatar’s “national priorities for nurturing advanced digital capabilities.”
This abstract language could range in meaning to be anything from suggesting that Qatari-state affiliated education institutions will now be equipped with basic Microsoft programs to suggesting that Microsoft could be providing resources to universities to help aid Qatari-state interests (e.g. public relations and disinformation campaigns, intelligence gathering, etc.). In 2025, the Qatar Debate Center and Indiana University’s Hamilton-Lugar School of Global and International Studies also signed an MOU “aimed at strengthening academic and cultural cooperation.”
In 2024, at least four US universities signed MOUs with Qatari entities: Idaho State University (partnering with the University of Doha for Science and Technology to boost cooperation in “engineering, energy research and disaster response”); Bridgewater State University (partnering with the Community College of Qatar to leverage resources and strengthen “academic and educational collaboration”); the University of Houston-Clear Lake (partnering with the Qatari Ministry of Foreign Affairs to exchange “programs, information, and activities” pertinent to “diplomatic capacity-building”); and Arkansas State University (partnering with the Global Studies Institute, a private institution, to offer degree programs in Doha).
Other US universities that have signed MOUs with Qatari entities include the University of Michigan (agreeing in 2008 to help Qatar University develop a center for research), the University of Wisconsin – Madison (agreeing in 2009 to “establish a framework” with Qatar University to “explore future collaboration”), the University of Maine (agreeing in 2018 to help prepare students from the Academic Bridge Program in Qatar for academic study), the University of South Carolina (agreeing in 2018 to promote collaboration and investment opportunities with the Qatar Investment Authority), and Harvard University (agreeing in 2019 to partner with the Qatar Foundation’s Al Shafallah Center on efforts to improve intellectual disability services).
Additional schools include the University of Maryland’s School of Public Policy (agreeing in 2021 to a five-year partnership designed to promote cooperation on projects with Hamad bin Khalifa University), the University of Utah’s College of Humanities (agreeing in 2023 to join the Qatar Debate Center’s Arabic Debate program), the Medical College of Wisconsin (agreeing in 2023 to promote informational exchanges and to jointly organize conferences and trainings with Qatar University), and Xavier University (partnering with the Qatar University).
As evidenced above, “academic partnerships” often function as partnerships with state institutions that serve Qatari state interests, such as security, a key component of Doha’s influence efforts. In 2018, the University of Southern Mississippi signed a training pact with Interpol and Qatar, which has trained Hamas officers at its Al Rayyan Police College. In 2025, the Qatari Ministry of Interior partnered with the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department to “strengthen security cooperation.” And in 2021, West Virginia’s National Guard partnered with the State of Qatar on security collaboration.
In summary, American higher education is being inundated by influence operations from Qatar, which constitute a possible national security threat. Now more than ever, Americans must reclaim and audit their institutions and demand that their universities distance themselves from Qatar, its ongoing sponsorship of terrorist groups like Hamas, and its promotion of hatred toward our country.

Gaza's reconstruction must focus on the culture just as much as on the concrete - opinion

Imagine a society in which a child walks to school on a street named for a mass murderer, studies in a building honoring a terrorist ideologue, and spends afternoons in youth centers commemorating men famous for killing civilians. Imagine further that this child is taught – by state-sanctioned television – that the highest aspiration in life is death, preferably violent, preferably in the service of God.
This is not a dystopian thought experiment. It has been everyday life in Gaza.
Before October 7, a Palestinian child might have walked along Abu Jihad Street – named for the architect of a bus hijacking that killed 38 Israelis, including 13 children – before arriving at a school bearing the name of Hamas founder Ahmad Yassin.
After class, the same child could attend activities in a center honoring Abu Iyad, one of the planners of the Munich Olympics massacre.
On a popular Palestinian TV program, an adult host asks an 11-year-old girl if martyrdom is beautiful. “Very, very beautiful,” she replies. “Everyone yearns for shahada. What could be better than going to Paradise?”
Carefully cultivated culture
This cultural environment did not emerge by accident.
And it helps explain a grim statistic often treated as impolite to mention. On October 7, polls showed that roughly 70 percent of Gazans and 80% of West Bank Palestinians expressed support for Hamas. For decades, scholars and policymakers have warned about the institutionalized radicalization embedded in Palestinian education, media, and civic life – a culture that prizes martyrdom over life and grievance over coexistence.
And for decades, those warnings have been met with a familiar response: denial, relativism, and money – lots of it. Over the past 10 years alone, billions of dollars – a large part from Europe – have flowed into Gaza, with few conditions and fewer consequences, helping sustain a system that glorifies death while promising peace.
Now, after October 7, the Middle East stands at a rare historical inflection point. Israel’s military and diplomatic gains have widened the opening created by the Abraham Accords: a chance to privilege pragmatism over ideology, realism over fantasy.
Gaza, too, sits before such a moment, if the world has the nerve to seize it. Reconstruction, however, cannot mean repeating the errors that led to ruin. Rebuilding Gaza without dismantling the ideology that destroyed it would be less an act of compassion than an exercise in willful blindness. Concrete poured atop radicalization is not reconstruction. It is preparation for the next war.
This brings us to a word that is endlessly invoked and rarely understood: “deradicalization.” Hamas’ disarmament is essential, but it is not sufficient. Weapons can be confiscated, but ideas require confrontation.
Deradicalization is not merely about convincing militants to lay down their arms. It is about dismantling the narratives, symbols, institutions, and incentives that normalize violence and sanctify hatred.
There is a useful distinction here. Deradicalization refers to the ideological retreat from extremist beliefs – something that can happen to individuals (as in the case of Mosab Hassan Yousef, author of The Green Prince and son of a Hamas founding member) or even groups (as with the IRA in late 1990s Ireland).
Counter-radicalization, by contrast, is preventative, ensuring that extremist ideas fail to capture new generations. Gaza requires both. But above all, it requires societal change.
History offers a precedent that is often invoked and rarely absorbed. Post-war Germany did not abandon Nazism because it was gently persuaded to do so. It did so because Nazism was systematically uprooted. Symbols were removed, and textbooks were rewritten. Media was regulated, and former perpetrators were barred from power. Accountability was imposed.
Denazification succeeded not because Germans were flattered, but because reality was enforced.
The lesson is uncomfortable but unavoidable: Radicalized societies do not heal through dialogue alone. They require structural reform. For Gaza, that means rewriting curricula that glorify jihad, renaming streets and institutions that honor terrorists, regulating media that incites violence, and permanently excluding Hamas from political authority. Without these steps, the “day after” will look disturbingly like the day before.
This transformation cannot be imposed solely from above. Palestinian civil society, both local and international, must play a role in building cultural immunity against extremism. That includes educational initiatives, exposure to alternative narratives, and yes, carefully structured encounters with the very people Hamas has spent decades demonizing, the Jews.
I say this not as an optimist by temperament, but as someone who has spent years speaking with former jihadists who abandoned ideologies they once embraced unto death. Change is possible. But it is never accidental.
The consequences of failure extend well beyond Gaza. Hamas has proved remarkably adept at exporting its worldview, fusing Islamist extremism with Western progressive rhetoric.
What began as the worst massacre of Jews since the Holocaust has metastasized into a global antisemitic movement, turbocharged by social media and absorbed by students who cannot locate Gaza on a map but chant slogans calling for Israel’s erasure. The spectacle borders on the surreal: LGBTQ activists chanting Hamas slogans and progressive students donning Hamas costumes in European capitals. In the name of liberation, they excuse misogyny, homophobia, honor killings, theocracy, and the murder of Jews, while congratulating themselves on their moral sophistication.
Western governments should recognize the boomerang effect. Funding radicalization abroad imports illiberalism at home. Some Arab states already understand this.
Morocco and the United Arab Emirates have concluded that the Muslim Brotherhood ideology is a threat not only to Israel or the West but also to their own societies. They have acted accordingly, by reforming textbooks, regulating religious discourse, producing media that promote coexistence, and appointing officials explicitly tasked with countering extremism.
Gaza deserves no less seriousness – and no more indulgence.
If the Abraham Accords demonstrated that peace in the Middle East is possible without illusions, then Gaza’s future depends on applying the same realism to Palestinian society itself.
Ideological disarmament is not collective punishment. It is a collective rescue. The window is open, but history will not keep it that way for long.

When Judea and Samaria become Israel, democracy pays the price - opinion

On February 9, the Israeli government reinforced the country’s sovereignty over Judea and Samaria – known internationally as the West Bank – by allowing Israelis to buy land there without any limitation. It also removed any difference between the three areas as had been defined in the Oslo Accords to allow the Palestinian Authority to have civilian jurisdiction in Areas A and B.
In many ways, this makes Judea and Samaria a new Israeli region, similar to Gush Dan or Shfela, thus preventing any territorial concession, let alone the creation of a Palestinian state living side-by-side with the State of Israel. Some top members of the coalition are actually claiming it.
This is indeed a clear victory for the far Right, deprived of a de jure annexation but granted another achievement toward a de facto one. Actually, it is better for them because a formal annexation would either impose major sanctions on Israel or force the country to make difficult choices, such as concerning the Palestinians’ status. The status quo is therefore likely to continue, with Palestinians deprived of Israeli citizenship, while Israelis will be able to develop their presence and buy land.
On the surface, Israel continues to be a thriving democracy (which it is inside the Green Line) without having to confront the legal and demographic complexities of a full annexation of the West Bank, and mainstream Israelis can still avoid dealing with this issue. International condemnations are real, even in Washington, but unlikely to cause major issues for Israel.
In reality, this victory for the Right in Israel represents a major risk for the State of Israel, with a vindication for Israel-haters who can now claim that their accusations of “Israeli apartheid” are rooted in reality.
Knesset no longer proof of Israeli democracy
With the erasure of the Green Line, the Jewish state can no longer point to Israeli members of Knesset as (real) proof of Israeli democracy, among many other elements.
If Judea and Samaria are becoming part of Israel, these regions’ democratic status, or lack thereof, becomes somewhat the status of the entire State of Israel. For example, were Florida to become a dictatorship, the United States could no longer claim to be a democracy.
Israel’s democracy has been under attack for three years now, with the government’s relentless attacks on the judiciary and the media. The final erasure of the Green Line would be another key element of this attack on democracy, with the end of the principle of “one man, one vote” that has defined Israeli democracy inside the Green Line since its creation, despite what its accusers are saying in the world.
Ironically, while the “Green Line” of the Tel Aviv light rail goes through Kikar Rabin in Tel Aviv, the erasure of the other Green Line would be the final nail in the coffin for Yitzhak Rabin’s legacy.
Thirty years after Rabin’s assassination, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s subsequent arrival to power, the current premier has not only killed the Oslo peace process but also the outcome that Rabin was aiming for, namely a separation from the Palestinians in order to preserve the democratic nature of the state and pave the way for a future peace.
In 2026, peace is clinically dead, and democracy is badly damaged, to the pleasure of Netanyahu’s far Right allies, the delight of Israel’s enemies, and the despair of its democratic allies and many Jews in the world.

Macron urges calm after far-right activist fatally beaten

French President Emmanuel Macron on Saturday, February 14, urged calm and restraint after the fatal beating of a 23-year-old French youth aligned with the far-right on the sidelines of a conference by a hard-left lawmaker in the southeastern city of Lyon.
The death of the young man – identified only as Quentin – has intensified tensions between France's far-right and radical left who are both eyeing 2027 presidential elections.
He had been hospitalized in Lyon on Thursday after being attacked while providing what his supporters said was security for a protest against an appearance by hard-left MEP Rima Hassan at the Lyon branch of the Sciences Po university.
The office of the Lyon prosecutor on Saturday told AFP he had died of his wounds. An investigation has been opened into suspected aggravated manslaughter, it added.
'An unprecedented outburst of violence'
Macron said on X that Quentin had been the victim of "an unprecedented outburst of violence".
"Hatred that kills has no place in our country. I call for calm, restraint and respect," he added.
According to the Nemesis collective, which is close to the far-right, Quentin was part of the security team responsible for ensuring the safety of its activists.
They were demonstrating against the conference by Hassan, who is known for her outspoken criticism of Israel.
The family's lawyer said in a statement that Quentin appeared to have been ambushed by "organized and trained individuals, vastly superior in number and armed, some with their faces masked".
Prosecutors have yet to give details on the circumstances of his death.
Nemesis accused members of a local anti-fascist association that was banned by the government in June of being behind the killing.
Three-time presidential candidate Marine Le Pen, who is still hoping to stand in 2027 despite a graft conviction, said on X that the "barbarians responsible for this lynching" should be brought to justice.
With Quentin's death sparking a wave of alarm across the political spectrum, concern also spread to the hard-left party of Hassan, France Unbowed (LFI). "What I have feared for years in Lyon is continuing," said LFI French parliament MP Raphael Arnault. "I offer my condolences to the family of this young man and I hope that the truth will be uncovered about this tragedy," he added.
In the wake of the incident, Interior Minister Laurent Nunez urged authorities to "increase vigilance around political gatherings, as well as around campaign offices".

Which states get an Anzac Day public holiday this year?

People in Australia's most populous state have been granted an Anzac Day long weekend for the next two years and could be in line for more public holidays.
Premier Chris Minns has announced NSW will have an extra public holiday in both 2026 and 2027. Anzac Day falls on a Saturday this year and on a Sunday next year. The additional public holiday for 2026 will be on the following Monday, 27 April.
Remembrance services are held nationwide on 25 April but previously, only people in Western Australia and ACT had been granted an additional public holiday on 27 April.
The ACT had announced it would transfer the public holiday to the Monday, and that all commemorative activities would take place on the Saturday as usual. In WA, the government has designated both the Saturday and the Monday as public holidays.
Unlike New Year's Day, Christmas Day and Boxing Day, previously there were no additional public holidays declared in NSW when Anzac Day fell on a weekend.
Adding a public holiday in these circumstances won't diminish the tradition, Minns insisted.
"If anything, it is a reminder of its importance and another reason for people to get up, attend a local service and ensure the spirit of remembrance continues to be passed on to the next generation," he said in a statement on Sunday.
Restaurants and cafes encouraged not to open
The NSW Returned and Services League (RSL) said it did not oppose the introduction of an additional public holiday after consulting with members.
"I've already had feedback from some smaller RSL organisations that ... it may give them an opportunity to get together on the Monday," its acting president Vince Williams said.
"Additionally, a public holiday on Monday will also provide many serving Australian Defence Force personnel who are required to work on Anzac Day itself with an opportunity to spend quality time with their loved ones."
But the decision hasn't garnered universal backing, with Minns acknowledging not all business groups were on board.
"We know that it's somewhat of an additional burden for small businesses in particular," he said.
"But this is, we believe, an important thing to do for the state."
The decision will lift labour costs for hospitality venues to 75 and 100 per cent of sales, Australian Restaurant and Cafe Association chief executive Wes Lambert warned.
"So we'll be encouraging cafes and restaurants not to open," he told ABC TV.
"It won't just be a public holiday for office workers, it'll be a public holiday for everyone.
"Hospitality businesses are on some of the lowest profit margins in history, below three per cent, and they just cannot wear another public holiday in NSW."
Major lobby group Business NSW declined to comment on the decision.
Fewer public holidays in NSW
NSW has fewer public holidays than all other mainland states and territories.
Anzac Day is one of 10 public holidays recognised nationwide in 2026.
Most Australians get another three or four, including those in Victoria, Queensland, ACT and South Australia.
But NSW enjoys just two extra: the King's Birthday in June and Labour Day in October.
Christmas Island celebrates an extra six, including two for Lunar New Year in February.
The Minns government will consider making the Anzac Day change permanent and decide if the number of statewide public holidays is enough.
It will look at economic and social impacts of the extra public holiday in 2026 and 2027 and be subject to feedback from community, business and veteran groups.

US army launches retaliatory strikes on dozens of ISIL targets in Syria
Operation Hawkeye has killed and captured more than 50 ISIL fighters after hitting about 100 targets.
United States forces have carried out a series of strikes against ISIL (ISIS) targets in Syria in retaliation for last year’s killing of two of its soldiers and an interpreter.
US Central Command (CENTCOM) said in a statement on Saturday that it attacked more than 30 ISIL targets in Syria between February 3 and 12, hitting the armed group’s infrastructure and weapons storage facilities with “precision munitions”.

CENTCOM said it launched the most recent attacks to “sustain relentless military pressure on remnants from the terrorist network”.
ISIL attacked US and Syrian forces near the historic city of Palmyra in December, killing Sergeant Edgar Brian Torres-Tovar, Sergeant William Nathaniel Howard, and Ayad Mansoor Sakat, identified as an American civilian interpreter.
Launched after the killings, Operation Hawkeye has killed and captured more than 50 fighters and hit about 100 ISIL infrastructure targets over the past two months, said CENTCOM.
The US military on Friday completed the transfer of thousands of ISIL detainees from Syria to Iraq, where they are expected to stand trial.
The prisoners were sent to Iraq at the request of Baghdad in a move welcomed by the US-led coalition that had for years fought against the armed group.
In other developments, the Syrian Ministry of Defence confirmed that government forces took control of the al-Tanf military base in the east of the country, which was run for years by US troops fighting ISIL.
The US-led coalition worked alongside the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) in the battle that led to ISIL’s territorial defeat in Syria in 2019.
However, Washington has now drawn close to Syria’s new authorities, recently saying that the purpose of its alliance with the SDF was largely over.
The US withdrawal from al-Tanf comes as Damascus seeks to extend its control over all of Syria.

Brisbane moviegoers get star-studded Valentine’s Day surprise
It was a Valentine’s Day to remember for moviegoers in Brisbane when their screening of “Wuthering Heights” turned into a star-studded event, with the stars of the show making an appearance.
Queensland-born actors Margot Robbie and Jacob Elordi surprised fans at cinemas in New Farm, Red Hill and Chermside on Saturday to wish them a happy Valentine’s Day and hand-deliver roses and sweets as a special treat.
“We were really just waiting until we could get home [to Queensland],” Robbie told the room in New Farm.
“Still recovering,” one person wrote alongside a video of their visit to Palace Cinemas on James Street.
Olivia Vickery, who was at Event Cinema’s 6.40pm V-Max session at Chermside with her two friends started tearing up when the stars walked in.
“I was like, surely this is not happening right now. Yes, the whole cinema was screaming! It was a great atmosphere,” she told this masthead.
Vickery suspected something special was happening when she spotted microphones at the front of the cinema, and admitted to hoping they’d show up.
“[It] was hard to watch the start of the movie … I was still in shock from them being right in front of us ... I needed a 10-minute intermission to recover from seeing them before the movie started.”
Footage also emerged of Elordi’s security getting in a scuffle with a paparazzo before heading into one of the screenings.
Elordi, who is from Brisbane, and Robbie, who hails from the Gold Coast, have been on a whirlwind press tour for their latest film, directed by Emerald Fennell.
Arriving in Sydney for the premiere on Thursday, Robbie, who also produced the film, addressed the controversy surrounding its adaptation of Emily Bronte’s book.
“I suppose you can assume that’s going to happen, particularly when you’re making a bold interpretation like [Fennell’s] version.
“There’s going to be mixed opinions for sure, but we just weather the storm and wait for people to see the movie, and they can make up their minds for themselves,” Robbie said.

Will China’s state-backed holiday thriller spill details of little-known spy cases?
‘Scare Out’ depicts leak of PLA jet secrets, and some speculate the plot could be based on true story involving stealth fighter tech
On January 29, the film’s distributor released a promotional video titled Spies Among Us. In the video, Zhang said Scare Out recreated modern espionage scenarios and incorporated technical elements.
“This is the first time I’ve worked on this kind of subject matter under the guidance of the [ministry]. We filmed it very realistically, and the national security personnel gave us a lot of technical guidance,” Zhang said.
The promotional video features behind-the-scenes footage in which a national security officer instructs actors on how to track a target. The officer’s image is blurred with a mosaic effect to protect their identity.

US, Iran to hold new round of nuclear talks in Geneva this week, Swiss government says
GENEVA (AP) — Iran and the United States will hold a second round of talks over Tehran’s nuclear program next week, the Swiss Foreign Ministry said Saturday.
Oman, which welcomed the first round of indirect talks on Feb. 6, will host the talks in Geneva, the Swiss ministry said, without specifying which days.
After the first discussions, U.S. President Donald Trump warned Tehran that failure to reach an agreement with his administration would be “very traumatic.”
Similar talks last year broke down in June as Israel launched what became a 12-day war on Iran that included the U.S. bombing Iranian nuclear sites.
Trump has repeatedly threatened to use force to compel Iran to agree to constrain its nuclear program. Iran has said it would respond with an attack of its own. Trump also has threatened Iran over its deadly crackdown on recent nationwide protests there.
Gulf Arab nations have warned any attack could spiral into another regional conflict.
Trump said Friday the USS Gerald R. Ford, the world’s largest aircraft carrier, was being sent from the Caribbean to the Mideast to join other military assets the U.S. has built up in the region. He also said a change in power in Iran “would be the best thing that could happen.”
The indirect talks on Feb. 6 were between Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi and U.S. Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff. The top military commander in the Middle East was also present for the first time.
The Trump administration has maintained that Iran can have no uranium enrichment under any deal. Tehran says it won’t agree to that.
Iran has insisted its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes. However, its officials increasingly threaten to pursue a nuclear weapon. Before the June war, Iran had been enriching uranium up to 60% purity, a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels.
Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian has said his nation is “ready for any kind of verification.” However, the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, has been unable for months to inspect and verify Iran’s nuclear stockpile.
Trump has suggested in recent weeks that his top priority is for Iran to scale back its nuclear program. Iran has said it wants talks to focus solely on the nuclear program.
But Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who met with Trump in Washington this week, has pressed for any deal to include steps to neutralize Iran’s ballistic missile program and end its funding for proxy groups such as Hamas and Hezbollah.

Private jet forced to land after hitting ‘multiple deer’ during takeoff at a Florida airport
The pilot reportedly told air traffic controllers he hit ‘four or five deer’

A private jet in Florida was reportedly forced to make an emergency landing after the Federal Aviation Administration said it hit “multiple deer” during takeoff.
The jet, a Cessna Citation, struck the animals Tuesday evening while taking off from North Palm Beach County General Aviation Airport, the FAA said in a statement. The plane then made an emergency landing at the nearby Palm Beach International Airport, according to The Palm Beach Post.
The plane, which was heading to Cincinnati, was carrying seven passengers when it took off near the state’s Beeline Highway, The Palm Beach Post reports. No injuries were reported, and the plane landed safely.
The aircraft landed at Palm Beach International Airport shortly after 7:30 p.m. and was towed to the parking ramp “as a precaution,” a spokesperson for the Palm Beach County Department of Airports told The Independent.
The pilot said he was going to “declare an emergency” because he hit “four or five deer on the nose gear and possibly on the wings.” according to air traffic control audio reviewed by The Palm Beach Post.
The pilot reportedly asked air traffic controllers: “Can you let [North County Airport] know there are deer on the runway?”
Air traffic controllers then had to make changes to accommodate the private jet’s emergency landing at Palm Beach International Airport. At one point, a United pilot reportedly asked air traffic control: “Did you say they hit deer?”
“That is their report,” an air traffic controller responded.
This kind of incident is “an extremely rare event, like getting hit by lightning or getting bit by a shark,” pilot Michael Leighton told local outlet WPBF.
“It's not something that happens. You could fly your whole life, your entire life. I've got 16,000 flight hours, that's two full years off the surface of the Earth, and I've never hit an animal with an airplane. Can it happen? Sure. Is it likely to happen? Probably not," he said.
Leighton noted that it’s often not possible for planes to take a sudden turn once they reach a certain speed during takeoff.
"You're not able to swerve left or right like you can with a car. With an airplane, your range of motion is much smaller because the plane only has three wheels, so it's not made for that. It's not made to turn quickly at high speed on the ground," he added.

The singer who represents America better than Trump, according to new poll
- A recent Yahoo/YouGov poll revealed that 42 percent of U.S. adults believe Bad Bunny better represents America than the U.S. president, who received 39 percent.
- The poll, conducted between 9-12 February with 1,700 Americans, followed the U.S. president's criticism of Bad Bunny's Super Bowl halftime show as "one of the worst, EVER!".
- Bad Bunny's historic performance, watched by over 128 million, marked the first time a Super Bowl headliner performed primarily in Spanish, celebrating his Puerto Rican heritage.
- Approximately 44 percent of U.S. adults approved of the performance, while 35 percent disapproved, with opinions largely split along party lines (78 percent Democrat favorability vs. 12 percent Republican).
- Despite conservative backlash and an alternative "All-American Halftime Show" organized by Turning Point USA, Bad Bunny's set included a message stating, "The only thing more powerful than hate is love."

Chisinau and its Brussels curators will undoubtedly continue their course toward the "Romanianization" of Moldova, while Moscow hopes that the Moldovan people will be able to defend their identity, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Galuzin said in an interview with TASS.
"There is no doubt that official Chisinau and its Brussels curators will continue the course toward dismantling Moldovan statehood, its sovereignty, the national identity and cultural code of Moldovans," Galuzin noted.
"The position of Bucharest itself is also noteworthy. There, despite the national elite’s strong commitment to the ‘Romanianization’ of Moldova, they are in no rush to support hasty statements by the Chisinau leadership about the need to unite the two countries and prefer to refer to the necessity of an expression of will by the Moldovan people on this issue. I hope that they will be able to defend their identity," the senior diplomat said.
According to him, the ongoing attempts by the country’s current pro-Western forces to artificially "Romanianize" Moldova are regretful.

Lindsey Vonn says "ride was worth the fall" after fourth surgery for broken leg, set to return to U.S.
American skier Lindsey Vonn announced Saturday that her latest surgery was successful, and that she has been cleared to return to the United States after breaking her left leg in a brutal crash last weekend during her opening downhill race at the Winter Olympics in Italy.
"Surgery went well today!" the 41-year-old Vonn wrote on social media. This marks her fourth surgery since the Feb. 8 crash.
Vonn had said Friday she would need at least two more surgeries — the one Saturday and a second after she returns to the U.S.
On Wednesday, Vonn disclosed she had already undergone three surgeries since experiencing the injury. She wrote Saturday that once she's back in the U.S., she plans on giving "more updates and info about my injury."
The Olympic veteran from Colorado also reflected on her crash, saying, "I don't have regrets."
"The ride was worth the fall. When I close my eyes at night I don't have regrets and the love I have for skiing remains," Vonn said in her post. "I am still looking forward to the moment when I can stand on the top of the mountain once more. And I will."
Vonn crashed just seconds into the first run of her Olympic downhill race. She was competing despite rupturing her left ACL in a different crash during a World Cup race in the Swiss Alps last month.
"I was willing to risk and push and sacrifice for something I knew I was absolutely capable of doing," Vonn said in the post. "I will always take the risk of crashing while giving it my all, rather than not ski to my potential and have regret."
The three-time Olympic medalist had come out of retirement to compete in the Milan Cortina Games. After tearing her ACL, she had said she felt confident she could still race with the help of a knee brace.
"Please, don't be sad," Vonn said. "Empathy, love and support I welcome with an open heart, but please not sadness or sympathy. I hope instead it gives you strength to keep fighting, because that is what I am doing and that is what I will continue to do. Always."

Not all sanctions imposed on Russia's economy are sufficient or effective – Presidential Office
Ihor Zhovkva, Deputy Head of Ukraine's Presidential Office, said this in an interview with TSN, Ukrinform reports.
"Unfortunately, not all of the sanctions imposed even on Russia's economy are sufficient, effective, and decisive," he said.
Zhovkva noted that Ukraine is aware of sanctions imposed on certain countries, again by the United States, which, in particular, have made it impossible or more difficult to export Russian raw materials to those countries.
"We see that, albeit slowly, these processes are underway. We know about the decline in Russia's GDP and the growing budget deficit. All these processes are objective and ongoing. When will they produce some effect? Forecasting is a thankless task," he said.
He added that sanctions against Russia's banking system also need to be tightened.
"It is still under-sanctioned, as is Russia's nuclear sector. Unfortunately, there is inertia. That is why we are not speaking only about European sanctions packages," Zhovkva said.
He recalled that earlier there was a very effective outcome when U.S. sanctions (against Lukoil and Rosneft – ed.) were imposed simultaneously with the EU's 19th sanctions package.
"To ensure that this synergy is repeated this year, we will work with European and American partners, other countries, the United Kingdom, and Japan. When this is synchronized and each such sanctions blow is painful and joint, then what you are asking about [ending the war] may happen faster," he said.

Real Madrid thrash Real Sociedad 4-1 to move top of La Liga
Vinicius Jr strikes twice from the penalty spot as Madrid move provisionally above Barcelona, who play Girona on Monday.
Vinicius Junior scored two penalties as Real Madrid moved top of La Liga with a 4-1 win over Real Sociedad, despite missing superstar Kylian Mbappe.
Mbappe watched from the substitutes’ bench on Saturday after missing some team training sessions during the week with discomfort in his left knee.

Madrid coach Alvaro Arbeloa said on Friday that he was able to play, but evidently, he did not want to rush his star goal-scorer.
Mbappe and Jude Bellingham, out with a hamstring injury, watched as Madrid produced an assured team performance to end the visitors’ 11-game unbeaten run across all competitions, and move two points clear of Barcelona before the defending champions visit Girona on Monday.
Perhaps Tuesday’s team dinner at a fancy restaurant paid for by Mbappe and Vinicius helped focus the players before facing Benfica in the Champions League playoffs next week.
Gonzalo Garcia opened the scoring with a slight touch to Trent Alexander-Arnold’s cross in the fifth minute. However, it was to be a largely frustrating game for the young attacker, who failed to make more of other good opportunities.
Dean Huijsen conceded a penalty for bringing down Yangel Herrera, and Mikel Oyarzabal duly equalised from the spot with a hard, high, centrally-placed shot in the 21st.
Referee Francisco Jose Hernandez Maeso awarded another penalty at the other end four minutes later, when Jon Aramburu caught Vinicius’s ankle, bringing him down. The Brazilian dusted himself off to score from the spot in the 25th minute.
Madrid captain Fede Valverde gratefully scored the third in the 31st after being left too much space at the edge of the penalty box. It was Valverde’s first goal of the season.
Garcia should have scored again before the break, when Valverde set him up for what looked like a simple tap-in, but Vinicius made it 4-1 with his second spot kick after the break, awarded after Aramburu was again penalised for bringing him down.
Dani Carvajal made his long-awaited return around the hour mark, when he replaced Alexander-Arnold for his first league appearance since Madrid’s 2-1 loss to Barcelona in October.
Vinicius thought he had scored a hat-trick when he headed in a free kick in the 90th minute, only for it to be ruled out for offside.
Elsewhere in La Liga on Saturday, Borja Iglesias scored in stoppage time, after having another seemingly good goal ruled out through VAR, to salvage a 2-2 draw for Celta Vigo at Espanyol.
A rueful Iglesias shook his head and smiled after having a 77th-minute goal disallowed when a long check determined there had been an offside infringement.
His frustrations grew when Ramon Terrats pulled the ball back for fellow substitute Tyrhys Dolan to score what he thought was the winner for Espanyol in the 86th minute.
But Iglesias equalised in the third minute of stoppage time when Pablo Duran set him up with his heel after a good run from Sergio Carreira.
Espanyol remained sixth, and Celta a point behind in seventh.
Also on Saturday, Getafe held on to upset visiting Villarreal 2-1, and the 10-man Sevilla drew with Alaves 1-1 in a duel between two strugglers.

More than 60 children infected in north London measles outbreak

More than 60 children have been infected by a measles outbreak in north London, it has been reported.
Seven schools and a nursery in Enfield reported the cases, with some children treated in hospital, according to the Sunday Times.
There are concerns the outbreak is linked to low levels of MMR vaccination in the capital. For every one infected person, measles can spread to up to 18 unvaccinated people.
Dudu Sher-Arami, Enfield’s director of public health who is writing to every parent in the area, said the outbreak posed a serious threat to the wider capital and there was the potential to cause a “much greater and bigger pan-London outbreak” because residents travel across the city.
She told the Sunday Times London has “one of the lowest, if not the lowest, vaccination uptake rates” in the country.
Sher-Arami said: “It is possible for it to grow. We know that measles has got some very nasty complications. It can cause deafness. It can cause brain damage and one in five children can need hospital treatment.”
Temporary vaccination clinics are being held in schools and throughout Enfield, an area in which more than a fifth of children are not inoculated against measles, mumps or rubella by the age of five.
A government campaign promoting childhood vaccination is expected to be launched next week with adverts on social media, YouTube and radio to counter vaccine scepticism. Measles usually starts with cold-like symptoms followed by a rash a few days later, according to the NHS. Some people may also get small spots in their mouths.
Last month, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the UK is no longer considered to have eliminated measles, as transmission was re-established in 2024.
It comes after a plateau in vaccination coverage and a surge in cases, with 3,681 cases recorded in the UK in 2024.
From 2021 to 2023, the UK was considered to have “eliminated” the disease.
WHO recommends at least 95% of children should receive vaccine doses for each illness to achieve herd immunity.
According to UK Health Security Agency figures 91.9% of five-year-olds had received one dose of the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine in 2024-25, unchanged from 2023-24 and the lowest level since 2010-11.
The data also showed 83.7% of five-year-olds had received both MMR doses, the lowest level since 2009-10.

On Tuesday, Nahar Siddhi, a 12th-grader in my school, was violently assaulted by a passerby. His only sin was that he stood in the street with his friends and dared to express sympathy with the difficulties the Arab community in Israel is experiencing right now. Nahar is the salt of the earth. He loves Israel and has fought for years for the character of the country. Like a veteran fighter, he joked and told me that he is used to violence from hooligans who are not willing to listen to opinions labeled "leftist" or "Kaplanist."

Netanyahu, Trump agree to step up economic pressure on Iran: report

US President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu agreed to step up economic pressure on Iran, particularly targeting its oil sales to China, Axios reported Saturday.
The report, citing two American officials briefed on the issue, said the agreement occurred when Trump and Netanyahu met on Wednesday at the White House.
“We agreed that we will go full force with maximum pressure against Iran, for example, regarding Iranian oil sales to China,” according to a senior US official.
But they differed on how to achieve that goal, with Netanyahu telling Trump that a reliable agreement with Iran is unattainable and would likely be violated, while Trump said he believes a deal is possible.
“We’ll see if it’s possible — let’s give it a shot,” Trump said, according to the US official.
American officials said Washington will pursue its maximum pressure campaign on Iran alongside nuclear negotiations and a continued military buildup in the Middle East to maintain the option of strikes if diplomatic efforts collapse.
With more than 80 percent of Iran’s oil exports going to China, any reduction in Chinese purchases would sharply intensify economic pressure on Tehran and could shift its calculations toward greater concessions on its nuclear programme.
Additionally, an executive order signed by Trump recently allows the US to intensify economic pressure on Iran, including provisions enabling the heads of state and commerce departments to recommend tariffs of up to 25 percent on countries that maintain trade ties with Tehran.

What is dart frog toxin, the poison linked to Alexei Navalny’s death?
The toxin is reportedly 100 times more powerful than morphine
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
Epibatidine, the highly potent toxin Britain has linked to the death of Alexei Navalny, is reportedly 100 times more powerful than morphine.
This extremely toxic, nicotine-like compound originates from the Epipedobates genus of poison dart frogs, found exclusively in northern South America. Crucially, these amphibians are not indigenous to Russia.
Species such as the brightly coloured Anthony’s poison arrow frog and the Phantasmal poison frog secrete this substance onto their skin. Researchers theorise that the frogs acquire the toxin through their diet, as captive-bred animals lack it, and wild populations exhibit varying levels depending on their habitat.
Epibatidine has been investigated as a pain killer and for relief from painful inflammatory conditions of the lung such as asthma and pulmonary fibrosis.
However, it is about a hundred times more potent than morphine and because of its toxicity is not used clinically.
Professor Alastair Hay said Epibatidine acts to inhibit nerve action by blocking nicotinic receptors in the central and peripheral nervous systems.
The Professor (Emeritus) of Environmental Toxicology at the University of Leeds added: “The effect of blocking these receptors is muscle paralysis and paralysis of the respiratory system.
“So, breathing is blocked, and any person poisoned dies from suffocation.”
Professor Hay said the presence of the toxin in a person’s blood “suggests deliberate administration”.
He added: “Epibatidine toxicity can even be increased by co-administration of certain other drugs and these combinations have been researched.
“If epibatidine, a toxin, was indeed used to poison Alexei Navalny, this is in violation of the 1972 Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention (BTWC) and the 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC).
“The Soviet Union was a co-sponsor of the BTWC. Russia is a signatory of both the BTWC and CWC.
“If Russia used Epibatidine to poison Mr Navalny it has violated two treaties it has sworn to uphold.”
Epibatidine can be detected using a combination of gas chromatography and mass spectrometry.
Gas chromatography helps separate out compounds of interest and mass spectrometry breaks up chemicals into particular fragments to create a unique fingerprint of the substance which can then be identified.

Four new astronauts arrive at the International Space Station to replace NASA’s evacuated crew
Four new astronauts arrive at the International Space Station to replace NASA’s evacuated crew
CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) — The International Space Station returned to full strength with Saturday’s arrival of four new astronauts to replace colleagues who bailed early because of health concerns.
SpaceX delivered the U.S., French and Russian astronauts a day after launching them from Cape Canaveral.
Last month’s medical evacuation was NASA’s first in 65 years of human spaceflight. One of four astronauts launched by SpaceX last summer suffered what officials described as a serious health issue, prompting their hasty return. That left only three crew members to keep the place running — one American and two Russians — prompting NASA to pause spacewalks and trim research.
Moving in for eight to nine months are NASA’s Jessica Meir and Jack Hathaway, France’s Sophie Adenot and Russia’s Andrei Fedyaev. Meir, a marine biologist, and Fedyaev, a former military pilot, have lived up there before. During her first station visit in 2019, Meir took part in the first all-female spacewalk.
Adenot, a military helicopter pilot, is only the second French woman to fly in space. Hathaway is a captain in the U.S. Navy.
“Bonjour!” Adenot called out once the capsule docked to the space station 277 miles (446 kilometers) up.
A couple of hours later, the hatches swung open and the seven space travelers hugged and exchanged exuberant high-fives. “Let’s get rolling,” Meir said.
NASA has refused to divulge the identity of the astronaut who fell ill in orbit on Jan. 7 or explain what happened, citing medical privacy. The ailing astronaut and three others returned to Earth more than a month sooner than planned. They spent their first night back on Earth at the hospital before returning to Houston.
The space agency said it did not alter its preflight medical checks for their replacements.

Casey Wasserman puts talent agency up for sale amid Epstein files fallout and high-profile departures
Wasserman had exchanged flirtatious emails with Maxwell in 2003, before Epstein was convicted in Florida
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
Casey Wasserman, the founder and CEO of talent agency Wasserman Group, told employees Friday he had begun selling his company after documents in the Epstein files revealed he had a flirtatious relationship with Ghislaine Maxwell and maintained a friendship with Jeffrey Epstein.
“I’m deeply sorry that my past personal mistakes have caused you so much discomfort,” Wasserman wrote in the message to staff, seen by The Independent. “It’s not fair to you, and it’s not fair to the clients and partners we represent so vigorously and care so deeply about.”
Wasserman’s announcement follows a wave of departures from high-profile clients who cut ties over his relationship with Maxwell and Epstein. While Wasserman has several email exchanges with the two, there is no suggestion he participated in Maxwell and Epstein’s crimes, nor has Wasserman been formally accused of any wrongdoing.
That includes musicians Chappell Roan, Orville Peck and Chelsea Cutler, as well as soccer star Abby Wambach. Others had threatened to leave unless Wasserman stepped down, including DJ John Summit.
Wasserman, 51, told employees he would devote his attention to preparing for the 2028 Los Angeles Olympic Games, which he is overseeing as chairman of the organizing committee.
The Independent has asked Wasserman Group for comment.
Executives of the 2028 Olympics confirmed earlier this week to reporters that Wasserman would continue chairing the committee. It’s unclear if that decision will remain firm.
Wasserman’s relationship with Maxwell and Epstein became apparent after the Justice Department released three million pages of documents in the Epstein files, many of which include email correspondence between Maxwell, Epstein and third parties.
In 2002, years before Epstein was first convicted of solicitation of prostitution in Florida, Wasserman and his then-wife flew on Epstein’s private plane as part of a charitable trip with former President Bill Clinton and others.
Emails from 2003 show Wasserman flirting with Maxwell over email. At the time, Wasserman was in his late 20s and married.
In one email, Wasserman told Maxwell, “Where are you, I miss you. I will be in nyc for 4 days starting april 22...can we book that massage now?” In another, he wrote to Maxwell, “So what do I have to do to see you in a tight leather outfit?
Wasserman had previously apologized for his presence in the files. He reiterated his regret in his email to staff Friday and said he had “limited interactions” with Epstein and Maxwell before criminal charges were brought against either of them. Epstein died by suicide while awaiting trial in 2019. Maxwell is serving a 20-year sentence for child sex trafficking among other charges.
“The pain experienced by the victims of Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell is unimaginable — and I’m glad, as I’m sure you all are, that those who helped them commit their crimes are rightly being held accountable,” Wasserman wrote.
While Wasserman is in the process of selling his company, Mike Watts, the company’s chief operating officer, would assume day-to-day control of the business, Wasserman told employees.

US ‘too often’ asks Ukraine, not Russia, for concessions
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky voiced hope on Feb 14 that US-brokered peace talks in Geneva next week would be substantive, but he said Ukraine was being asked “too often” to make concessions.
He also accused Moscow of seeking to delay decisions by changing its lead negotiator.
Ukrainian, Russian and American delegations are due to meet in the Swiss lakeside city on Feb 17 and 18 as US President Donald Trump seeks to push through a deal to end Europe’s biggest war since 1945.
“We truly hope that the trilateral meetings next week will be serious, substantive, helpful for all us but honestly sometimes it feels like the sides are talking about completely different things,” Mr Zelensky said, in a speech at the annual Munich Security Conference.
Son of Iran’s last shah urges US military intervention
Iranian opposition figure Reza Pahlavi on Feb 14 said US military intervention in Iran could save lives, and urged US President Donald Trump’s administration not to spend too long negotiating with Tehran’s clerical rulers on a nuclear deal.
The exiled son of Iran’s toppled shah told Reuters in an interview that there were signs that the Iranian government was on the brink of collapse, and that an attack could weaken it or accelerate its fall.
Mr Pahlavi was speaking on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference, where officials from the Iranian government are banned.
French prosecutors announce team for Epstein files
The Paris prosecutor’s office on Feb 14 announced it was setting up a special team of magistrates to analyse evidence that could implicate French nationals in the crimes of the convicted US sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.
With Epstein’s known circle now extending to prominent French figures after the release of documents by the US authorities, the prosecutor’s office said it would also thoroughly re-examine the case a former French modelling agency executive Jean-Luc Brunel, a close associate of the American financier, who died in custody in 2022.
The new team will work closely with prosecutors from the national financial crimes unit and police with a view to opening investigations into any suspected crimes involving French nationals, the Paris prosecutor’s office told AFP.
Dart frog poison killed Navalny, European allies say
Five European allies on Feb 14 blamed Russia for killing late Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny using toxin from poison dart frogs while he was held in an Arctic penal colony two years ago.
In a joint statement, Britain, France, Germany, Sweden and the Netherlands said analyses of samples from Navalny’s body “conclusively” confirmed the presence of epibatidine, a toxin found in poison dart frogs in South America and not found naturally in Russia.
The Russian government has repeatedly denied any responsibility for Navalny’s death.
Muchova ends six-year title drought with Qatar win
Former French Open finalist Karolina Muchova ended a six-year trophy drought on Feb 14, when she beat Canadian Victoria Mboko 6-4 7-5 to win the Qatar Open and clinch her first WTA 1000 title.
The Czech Republic’s Muchova, who has struggled with multiple injuries and was sidelined for 10 months after a wrist injury suffered in 2023, had not won a title on the WTA tour since the Korea Open in September 2019.
But the 29-year-old Muchova kept mistakes to a minimum as she switched up the rhythm against Mboko to clinch victory in an hour and 34 minutes.

States reliant on Colorado River fail to meet the latest deadline to find consensus
The seven Western states that depend on the Colorado River have missed a deadline for the second time to agree on a plan addressing record drought and water shortages
- Bookmark
The seven Western states that depend on the Colorado River missed a deadline for the second time Saturday to agree on a plan addressing record drought and water shortages.
Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs, California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Nevada Gov. Joe Lombardo released a joint statement calling on Upper Basin states to offer more concessions. Those states include Colorado, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming.
“The Colorado River is essential to our communities and economies, and our states have conserved large volumes of water in recent years to stabilize the basin’s water supplies for years to come,” the governors said. “Our stance remains firm and fair: all seven basin states must share in the responsibility of conservation.”
Arizona, California and Nevada have offered to decrease Colorado River allocation by 27%, 10% and 17%, respectively, according to those states.
Colorado Sen. John Hickenlooper. who helped negotiate a river contingency plan in 2019 as governor, called the situation in the Colorado Basin “dire," pointing to the state's low snowpack.
"If we don’t address this problem together –- head-on and fast –- our communities, farms, and economies will suffer. The best path forward is the one we take together. Litigation won’t solve the problem of this long-term aridification," Hickenlooper said in a statement.
John Entsminger, the general manager of the Southern Nevada Water Authority, also expressed frustration at the lack of progress.
“The actions we have taken over the past two-plus decades are less about raising Lake Mead’s elevation than they are about protecting ourselves if things go from bad to worse,” Entsminger said in a statement.
The states previously let pass a November deadline set by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation to devise a strategy to face water shortages after this year, when current guidelines will expire.
Over 40 million people across these states along with Mexico and Native American tribes rely on Colorado River water. The river is crucial to farming as well as water and electricity for millions of homes and businesses. Much of the water starts out as winter mountain snowfall in the Upper Basin, which amasses far more that way than it consumes. Lower Basin states, including agriculture-heavy regions, are bigger consumers.
Major cities including Denver, Salt Lake City, Albuquerque, Las Vegas, Phoenix and Los Angeles, are also big water consumers. Chronic overuse, drought and rising temperatures linked to climate change have lessened water flows.
How the water is allocated — especially in dry spells — and conserved has been the center of agreements among the states for decades. The original 1922 Colorado River Compact was calculated based on water amounts that doesn’t exist today, especially with the long-term drought.
The current round of negotiations among states have been going on over two years.
If no consensus can be reached, the federal government could step in and devise a plan that leaves parties dissatisfied and could even result in litigation.
Scientists recently found snow cover and snow depth in the West are at their lowest in decades. Some areas have seen their warmest December through early February. Normally, snow cover this time of year spans 460,000 square miles — about the size of California, Utah, Idaho and Montana. But, this year it is only California-sized, about 155,000 square miles, according to the National Snow and Ice Data Center.

Onsite gunmen force MSF to stop work at Gaza’s Nasser Hospital
Medical charity’s announcement comes on the heels of Israel’s recent ban on its operations in Gaza.
Doctors Without Borders, known by its French initials MSF, has suspended some operations at a Nasser Hospital in Gaza after its staff and patients saw “armed men, some masked” posing “serious security threats” inside the building.
The Geneva-based medical charity reported on its website that non-essential work at the hospital in Khan Younis was halted on January 20 due to concerns with the “management of the structure, the safeguarding of its neutrality, and security breaches”.

“MSF teams have reported a pattern of unacceptable acts, including the presence of armed men, intimidation, arbitrary arrests of patients, and a recent situation of suspicion of movement of weapons”, said the site’s “frequently asked questions” section, last updated on February 11.
“Hospitals must remain neutral, civilian spaces, free from military presence or activity to ensure the safe and impartial delivery of medical care”, it said, adding that the charity expressed concern to the “relevant” authorities.
Under the suspension, MSF will continue supporting critical services, such as inpatient and surgical departments, but will end support to the paediatrics and maternity wards, including the neonatal intensive care unit, and will no longer offer a range of outpatient consultations and other services.
The organisation was not able to indicate the armed men’s affiliation, but said its concerns were heightened by previous, deliberate Israeli attacks on health facilities.
Israel has decimated the enclave’s health infrastructure and continues to hold captive 95 Palestinian doctors and medical workers, including 80 from Gaza.
Zaher al-Waheidi, the head of the records department at Gaza’s Ministry of Health, said that MSF’s suspension will have a significant impact as hundreds of patients are admitted to the maternity and burn wards daily. He said the ministry would take over maternity patient care.
Gaza’s Ministry of Interior said in a statement that it is committed to preventing any armed presence inside hospitals, and that legal action will be taken against violators. It suggested that armed members of certain families recently entered hospitals, but did not identify those involved.
Israeli ban on aid organisations
MSF’s announcement comes after Israel recently ordered the charity and dozens of other international organisations to stop their work in Gaza and the Israeli-occupied West Bank if they did not meet new rules, including sharing details about their staff.
Two weeks ago, MSF – which provides international staff for six hospitals, and operates two field hospitals and eight primary health centres, clinics and medical points – said it would not submit a staff list to Israel after failing to receive assurances for their safety.
Israel has repeatedly attacked hospitals and healthcare workers throughout its genocidal war on Gaza.
In other developments on Saturday, Israel’s military said its troops “eliminated” a person in northern Gaza, alleging that the unidentified individual crossed the “yellow line“. The demarcation divides Gaza into an eastern area under Israeli military control and a western area where Palestinians face fewer movement restrictions but are under constant threat of air strikes and forced displacement.
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas slammed Israel for violating the US-brokered “ceasefire”, during which Israel has killed nearly 600 Palestinians since October 10.
In a speech by Prime Minister Mohammed Mustafa at an African Union summit in Ethiopia, he called on Israel to remove all “obstacles” to implementing phase two of the “truce” deal, including the work of a technocratic committee that will oversee the daily governance of Gaza.
More than 72,000 Palestinians have been killed and 171,000 wounded in attacks in Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza since October 2023.

Searching ruins: Father in Gaza digs for family killed in Israeli strike
Mahmoud Hammad lost wife, 6 children, relatives when his home was hit by 2,000-pound bomb
- Officials say nearly 9,500 Palestinians remain missing under debris amid limited recovery capacity
GAZA City, Palestine
On a mound of sand and shattered concrete that once formed the foundation of his six-story home in Gaza City, Mahmoud Hammad digs methodically through the debris, searching for the remains of his wife and children killed beneath the rubble.
Armed with little more than a small shovel and a metal sieve, the 45-year-old father filters sand by hand, hoping to find bone fragments that would allow him to lay his family to rest.
“In the absence of machinery, this is what we have,” he said, holding up the sieve.
Home reduced to dust
Hammad’s house in the Sabra neighborhood was destroyed Dec. 6, 2023, during heavy Israeli bombardment. He said a powerful bomb weighing around 2,000 pounds (907 kilograms) struck the building while the family was inside.
He lost his wife, six children, his brother, his brother’s wife and their four children.
Hammad survived but sustained severe injuries, including multiple rib fractures and injuries to his shoulder and pelvis. After months of partial recovery, he returned to the site to begin searching for his family’s remains.
“I wanted to bury them properly,” he said.
With the help of neighbors, he managed to retrieve and bury his brother and his brother’s family. But the bodies of his wife and children remain under layers of hardened debris.
“I collect what I can, piece by piece,” he said.
Missing under the rubble
Nearly 9,500 Palestinians are missing beneath destroyed buildings across the territory, according to official estimates in Gaza.
Officials said recovery efforts are severely hindered by the lack of heavy equipment needed to clear the debris. Despite a ceasefire that took effect in October, authorities said the entry of large-scale machinery remains restricted, limiting the ability of rescue teams to reach buried bodies.
Civil defense crews have repeatedly warned that the longer debris remains uncleared, the harder it becomes to recover remains.
Private grief amid mass destruction
Hammad said his wife was pregnant and close to delivery when the strike occurred, as medical services across Gaza were collapsing under the strain of the war.
“She and our unborn child died together,” he said.
Since December, Gaza has been battered by repeated storms that further displaced families living in makeshift shelters after their homes were destroyed.
For Hammad, however, the focus remains on the ruins before him.
Each day, he returns to sift through dust and fragments of concrete, driven by what he describes as a simple duty.
“They deserve to be buried with dignity,” he said.
At least 591 Palestinians have been killed and more than 1,598 injured in Israeli attacks since a ceasefire deal took effect Oct. 10, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry.
Israel’s war on Gaza, which began Oct. 8, 2023, and lasted two years, has killed more than 72,000 Palestinians and wounded over 171,000, most of them women and children, and destroyed about 90% of Gaza’s civilian infrastructure.

Asia-Pacific, Western officials discuss connected security challenges at Munich Security Conference
Japanese, Dutch top diplomats, New Zealand, Australian defense chiefs, US defense official discuss challenges linking Europe, Indo-Pacific
ISTANBUL
Asia-Pacific and Western officials discussed shared security challenges linking Europe and the Indo-Pacific at the Munich Security Conference on Saturday.
Japanese Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi outlined three key concerns: growing turbulence in the international order; a strong sense of urgency over the linked security of the Euro-Atlantic and the Indo-Pacific; and cooperation as the cornerstone of Japan’s alliance with the US, as well as Tokyo’s responsibility to deter and repel any aggression.
“Going forward, Japan will contribute to the stability and peace of the international society,” he said.
Motegi expressed Tokyo's concern about “the advancement of cooperation among China, Russia and North Korea and its impact on regional security,” saying that Japan will continue to monitor the situation "closely."
Dutch Foreign Minister David van Weel highlighted similarities between Europe and the Indo-Pacific across domains such as defense and economy.
“If you look at cyberspace, if you look at hybrid threats, then we are all in the same arena, and we're all facing the same enemies there. If you look at the economic arena, our dependencies and our need to diversify, or the export control measures that we're being hit with, those are all the same,” he said. “We live in one world. We need friends in this very turbulent world.”
Australian Defense Minister Richard Marles said global relations are increasingly power-centered and stressed burden-sharing, adding Canberra wants to be a “better ally” to Washington.
Marles highlighted “the biggest conventional military buildup we've seen in the world since the end of the Second World War, being undertaken by China, but being done so without strategic reassurance.”
“From an Australian point of view, we are very much about working with the US and other partners like Japan to try and put forward deterrence within the Indo-Pacific so that we can maintain peace, stability, and prosperity -- a free and open Indo-Pacific,” he added.
New Zealand Defense Minister Judith Collins described the world as “a very dangerous place at the moment,” urging greater collective awareness.
“We'll have to understand that we can't just keep thinking that we can go on as we have, without significant improvements,” she said. “I would say to you, think about us too, because what happens to us is going to affect you just as what happens to you affects us.”
US Under Secretary of Defense for Policy Elbridge Colby emphasized the need to view global affairs as interconnected.
"It's better to keep, to keep jaw-jawing, rather than war-warring, even if there's a crisis or conflict in one or more theaters," he said.

IDF eliminates terrorists emerging from Gaza tunnel, strikes Hezbollah sites in Lebanon

The IDF said Saturday it killed armed terrorists in northern Gaza after identifying them near Israeli forces operating in an area under Israeli control, describing the incident as “another blatant violation” of the ceasefire agreement.
The military said the terrorists were spotted moving while covered and attempting to conceal themselves among ruins close to troops in Beit Hanoun in northern Gaza.
Separately, the military said it carried out strikes on infrastructure belonging to the Hezbollah terrorist group in southern Lebanon. The Lebanese Hezbollah-affiliated channel Al Manar reported that fighter jets launched a series of strikes in the village of Bouslaiya, between Houmine al-Fawqa and Deir al-Zahrani, and in the Jabal al-Rihan area.
Following reports of explosions, the Upper Galilee Regional Council informed residents that “a wave of strikes will continue for several hours in Lebanese territory.” It warned that blasts may be heard in eastern Galilee and the northern Golan Heights but said there was no change in security guidelines for civilians.
Earlier Saturday, the medical aid group Doctors Without Borders, also known by its French acronym MSF, said it had suspended operations at Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis after its staff identified armed men, some masked, inside the facility. The organization’s activities in Gaza had recently been halted after it refused to provide Israel with a list of its Palestinian employees.
During the week, the IDF carried out several strikes in Gaza in response to ceasefire violations. On Monday, the army said it killed Ahmad Hassan, whom it described as responsible for the deaths of seven soldiers and injuries to others in separate incidents during the war.
The killing came after four terrorists emerged from a tunnel in Rafah and opened fire on Israeli forces. 7th Armored Brigade troops returned fire, killing the attackers. No Israeli casualties were reported in that incident, the military said.

Israel prepares to deploy tear gas drones in occupied West Bank ahead of Ramadan: report

Israel’s National Guard is preparing to deploy drones equipped to fire tear gas at Palestinians in the occupied West Bank, including occupied East Jerusalem, as part of “security” preparations for the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, Israeli Channel 12 reported on Saturday.
The police tenders committee approved the purchase of three drone-mounted systems designed to drop tear gas capsules, the channel said. The contract is valued at about $49,000.
The systems, known as “Surprise Egg,” are designed to be mounted on Matrice-type drones and used to disperse demonstrations by releasing tear gas from the air, according to the report.
Israeli police already operate 19 similar systems, Channel 12 said.
Tender documents described the purchase as “urgent,” for “expected events during Ramadan,” the outlet reported.
Israel’s National Guard was formed under National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, a far-right minister. Opposition figures have described the force as “a militia effectively operating under his authority.”
Military buildup
Earlier this week, Channel 12 reported that the Israeli army decided to reinforce its presence in the occupied West Bank during Ramadan, including deploying a commando brigade.
In addition to the 22 battalions currently deployed in the occupied territory, the army plans to send additional units, the report said.
More companies are also expected to be stationed at checkpoints ahead of the entry of thousands of worshippers into the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound in occupied East Jerusalem.
The army has recommended to Defence Minister Israel Katz that up to 10,000 worshippers be allowed to enter the compound each Friday during Ramadan, according to Channel 12. It also recommended allowing entry only for men over 55 and women over 50.
On Friday, Sheikh Ikrima Sabri, preacher at the Al-Aqsa Mosque, said he regretted Israel’s decision to restrict access during Ramadan and warned that the government was implementing “an aggressive plan targeting the holy site.”
Access restrictions
Each year during Ramadan, hundreds of thousands of Palestinians travel from the occupied West Bank to occupied East Jerusalem to pray at the Al-Aqsa Mosque.
Since the start of Israel’s genocide in Gaza in October 2023, Israeli authorities have imposed tight restrictions on occupied West Bank residents crossing military checkpoints into occupied East Jerusalem.
Over the past two years, only limited numbers have been allowed entry after obtaining Israeli-issued permits, which Palestinians say are difficult to secure.
Israel has not announced any special easing measures for Ramadan this year.

At least 6,000 killed over 3 days during RSF attack on Sudan’s el-Fasher, UN says
Sudan’s Rapid Support Forces killed more than 6,000 people in three days during an assault on el-Fasher, the U.N. Human Rights Office has said
- Bookmark
More than 6,000 people were killed in over three days when a Sudanese paramilitary group unleashed “a wave of intense violence … shocking in its scale and brutality” in Sudan's Darfur region in late October, according to the United Nations.
The Rapid Support Forces' offensive to capture the city of el-Fasher included widespread atrocities that amount to war crimes and possible crimes against humanity, the U.N. Human Rights Office said in a report released on Friday.
“The wanton violations that were perpetrated by the RSF and allied Arab militia in the final offensive on el-Fasher underscore that persistent impunity fuels continued cycles of violence,” said U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk.
The RSF and their allied Arab militias, known as Janjaweed, overran el-Fasher, the Sudanese army’s only remaining stronghold in Darfur, on Oct. 26 and rampaged through the city and its surroundings after more than 18 months of siege.
The 29-page U.N. report detailed a set of atrocities that ranged from mass killings and summary executions, sexual violence, abductions for ransom, torture and ill-treatment to detention and disappearances. In many cases, the attacks were ethnicity-motivated, it said.
The RSF did not respond to an e-mailed request for comment.
The paramilitaries' Gen. Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo has previously acknowledged abuses by his fighters, but disputed the scale of atrocities.
‘Like a scene out of a horror movie’
The alleged atrocities in el-Fasher, the provincial capital of North Darfur, mirror a pattern of RSF conduct in its war against the Sudanese miliary. The war began in April 2023 when a power struggle between the two sides exploded into open fighting in the capital, Khartoum and elsewhere across the country.
The conflict created the world's largest humanitarian crisis with parts of the country pushed into famine. It has also been marked by heinous atrocities which the International Criminal Court said it was investigating as war crimes and crimes against humanity. The RSF was also accused by the Biden administration of carrying out genocide in the ongoing war.
The U.N. Human Rights Office said it documented the killing of at least 4,400 people inside el-Fasher between Oct. 25 and Oct. 27, while more than 1,600 others were killed as they were trying to flee the RSF rampage. The report said it drew its toll from interviews with 140 victims and witnesses which were “are consistent with independent analysis of contemporaneous satellite imagery and video footage."
In one case, RSF fighters opened fire from heavy weapons on a crowd of 1,000 people sheltering in the Rashid dormitory in el-Fasher university on Oct. 26, killing around 500 people, the report said. One witness was quoted as saying that he saw bodies thrown into the air, “like a scene out of a horror movie,” according to the report.
In another case, around 600 people, including 50 children, were executed on Oct. 26 while taking shelter in the university facilities, the report said.
The report, however, warned that the actual scale of the death toll of the week-long offensive in el-Fasher was “undoubtedly significantly higher.”
The toll does not include at least 460 people who were killed by the RSF on Oct. 28 when they stormed the Saudi Maternity hospital, according to the World Health Organization.
Around 300 people were also killed in RSF shelling and drone attacks between Oct. 23 and Oct. 24 in the Abu Shouk camp for displaced people, 2.5 kilometers (1.5 miles) northwest of el-Fasher, the U.N. Human Rights Office’ report said.
Woman and girls sexually assaulted
Sexual violence, including rape and gang rape, was apparently widespread during el-Fasher offensive, with RSF fighters and their allied militias targeting women and girls from the African Zaghawa non-Arab tribes over allegations of having links or supporting the miliary, the report said.
Türk, who visited Sudan last month, said survivors of sexual violence recounted testimonies that showed how the practice “was systematically used as a weapon of war.”
The paramilitaries also abducted many people while attempting to flee the city, before releasing them after paying ramson. Thousands have been held in at least 10 detention centers — including the city’s Children Hospital which was turned into a detention facility — run by the RSF in el-Fasher, the report said.
The U.N. Human Rights Office also said it documented 10 detention facilities used by the paramilitaries in el-Fasher, including the Children’s Hospital which was turned into a detention center. Several thousands of people remain missing and unaccounted for, the report said.
The pattern of the RSF offensive on el-Fasher was a mirror of other attacks by the paramilitaries and their allies on the Zamzam camp for displaced people, 15 kilometers (9 miles) south of the city, and on West Darfur’s city of Geneina and the nearby town of Ardamata in 2023, the U.N. Human Rights Office said.
Türk said there were “reasonable grounds” that RSF and their allied Arab militias committed war crimes, and that their acts also amount to crimes against humanity.
He called for holding those responsible — including commanders — accountable, warning that “persistent impunity fuels continued cycles of violence.”

Security guarantees for Ukraine must not repeat fate of Budapest Memorandum – Pistorius
He made the remarks at the Munich Security Conference, according to an Ukrinform correspondent.
"When it comes to the future of Ukraine, three points are crucial in my view. First, we will keep looking for paths to a reliable peace because Ukraine's future is fundamental not just to European security, but to global security. We need a peace deal that safeguards both Ukraine's and our European interests," Pistorius said.
He stressed that the second key aspect is the need to increase pressure on Russia, which shows no willingness to compromise.
"The ball is in Putin's court. He is the one who is dragging out negotiations and is showing no willingness to compromise. He is shifting the cost of war to his own people. But he must not be mistaken. We will continue doing everything in our power to protect Ukraine as an independent, sovereign European nation. We will keep up the pressure politically, economically, and militarily," Pistorius said.
The third aspect, he stressed, is providing Ukraine with reliable security guarantees:
"Third, we will have peace. And when, not if, this day comes, we will have to make this peace last, we will have to shield Ukraine from any potential future aggression by Russia. To accomplish this huge task, Ukraine needs substantial, reliable security guarantees," he said.
Pistorius recalled that as early as 2014, then-Senator Marco Rubio (now U.S. Secretary of State) noted that the 1994 Budapest Memorandum did ultimately not serve the purpose of providing for Ukraine's security. "Quite the opposite, 20 years later, Russia invaded and annexed Crimea," he said.
"Therefore, our lesson for today, must be: we cannot afford another paper tiger like the Budapest Memorandum. To provide credible and reliable security guarantees, all of us – European and Americans – have to deliver," Pistorius said.
He also stressed the critical role of a strong and capable NATO in the face of multiple interconnected threats. He concluded that Germany remains the largest donor of aid to Ukraine, and this support will not waver even in the fifth year of the war.

Obama responds to Trump’s video of him and Michelle as apes and says MAGA lacks a sense of ‘shame’
A White House official claimed a staffer ‘erroneously made the post’ on Trump’s Truth Social account
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
Former President Barack Obama has responded to a video shared on President Donald Trump’s Truth Social account depicting him and former first lady Michelle Obama as apes.
Last week, Trump’s Truth Social account shared a video that showed the Obamas’ faces superimposed onto apes as the song “The Lion Sleeps Tonight” played in the background. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt initially claimed the post was “from an internet meme video” and said to “stop the fake outage.”
But as criticism mounted, the post was deleted. A White House official told The Independent a staffer “erroneously made the post.”
Political commentator Brian Tyler Cohen, who published a 47-minute interview with Obama on Saturday, asked the former president about the video and other instances of “cruelty” in public discourse from Trump and his allies.
Obama replied: “First of all, I think it's important to recognize that the majority of the American people find this behavior deeply troubling.”
“It is true that it gets attention. It’s true that it’s a distraction. But, as I’m traveling around the country, as you’re traveling around the country, you meet people — they still believe in decency, courtesy, kindness,” he said.
“And there’s this sort of clown show happening in social media and on television, and what is true is that there doesn’t seem to be any shame about this among people who used to feel like you had to have some sort of decorum and a sense of propriety and respect for the office. So that’s been lost,” he added.
“But the reason I point out that I don't think the majority of the American people approve of this is because, ultimately, the answer is going to come from the American people.”
The Independent has contacted the White House for comment.
Trump refused to apologize when asked about the video on Friday, February 6, telling reporters he “didn’t make a mistake.” When asked Thursday if he “fired or disciplined” the staffer who erroneously posted the video, Trump replied: “No, I haven’t.”
The video received widespread backlash, including from several Republican lawmakers.
Senator Tim Scott, the only Black Republican in the chamber, called on Trump to remove the video after it was first posted. “Praying it was fake because it’s the most racist thing I’ve seen out of this White House. The President should remove it,” Scott wrote on X.
Republican Senator Katie Britt also denounced the video, writing on X: “This content was rightfully removed, should have never been posted to begin with, and is not who we are as a nation.”
Trump was later said to be furious with both of them for having criticized the post.
Obama – the Democratic president from 2009 to 2017 – has long been a favorite target of Trump, who was a leader of the so-called “birther conspiracy” which falsely claimed that Obama was born in Kenya and was therefore ineligible to serve as U.S. president.

41 DUI arrests made by Tennessee trooper tossed — with over half of the cases involving sober drivers, report says

41 DUI arrests made by Tennessee trooper tossed — with over half of the cases involving sober drivers, report says
Local defense attorneys have raised concerns over enforcement practice, according to the report
- Bookmark
Forty-one DUI arrests made by a single Tennessee Highway Patrol trooper in Bedford County have been dismissed by prosecutors, an investigative report shows, with more than half involving drivers later found to be sober.
The dismissals stem from arrests made between 2021 and 2024 by former Trooper Asa Pearl, according to records obtained by WSMV4.
Of those 41 cases, a Bedford County District Attorney’s office spreadsheet shows that 22 incidents involving drivers who either had no drugs or alcohol in their system or whose blood alcohol was within legal limits at the time of testing, the local news outlet found.
One of those drivers, Ron LaFlamme, said he was pulled over and asked to perform a sobriety test despite having neither alcohol nor drugs in his system.
“I was surprised when he started asking me to do a sobriety test,” LaFlamme told WSMV4 in an interview that aired Tuesday. “It was wrongful arrest.”
The remaining 19 dismissals were attributed to procedural issues, including the arresting trooper’s unavailability for court or inability to recall specifics of the stop, officials said.
Attorney David McKenzie, representing LaFlamme, told the outlet that word of the dismissals spread among local defense attorneys and raised concerns about enforcement practices.
“I know that during the time that Ron’s case was making its way through the court, Ron’s case was not the only one with this particular trooper, where blood results were coming back negative,” McKenzie said.
He added: “This could happen to your child. This could happen to your parent. This could happen to your coworker.”
Pearl resigned from the Tennessee Highway Patrol in 2024, and his personnel file offers no explanation for his departure and makes no mention of the dozens of DUI cases that were later thrown out, according to the report.
Pearl did not respond to WSMV4’s requests for comment. The Tennessee Highway Patrol also declined the outlet’s request to comment on the matter.
The Independent has contacted the Tennessee Highway Patrol for comment.
This latest report is part of WSMV4’s “Sobering Problem” series, which investigates Tennessee’s troubling pattern of sober drivers being wrongly arrested for DUI and left waiting months for blood test results to prove their innocence.
Last month, the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation acknowledged it had undercounted DUI cases involving people who had no drugs or alcohol in their system. New data shows that from 2017 to 2024, more than 2,500 drivers in Tennessee were sober at the time of their DUI arrest, which is more than double the number the TBI previously reported, according to WSMV4.

Faaletino Tavana scores stunning try in NRL trial, Canterbury Bulldogs star Matt Burton limps off
In short:
Faaletino Tavana has scored a try for the Wests Tigers while most of his body was outside the field of play.
Canterbury Bulldogs five-eighth Matt Burton limped off in his club's trial match against Newcastle.
What's next?
The 2026 NRL season begins with a double-header in Las Vegas on Sunday, March 1 AEDT.
Wests Tigers rookie Faaletino Tavana has laid claim to one of the best tries in 2026 during a preseason trial against the Sydney Roosters.
The Tigers came from 0-16 down on Saturday to claim a 42-26 win in a trial match of mostly second-string players.
Heamasi Makasini bagged a hat-trick for Wests, but it was Tiger teammate Tavana who produced the moment of the match.
Tavana jumped out of the field to avoid defender Enzo Griffier, then contorted himself to place the ball on the line late in the match.
Tigers coach Benji Marshall had plenty to smile about on Saturday, with the hat-trick performance by Makasini showing the teenager is ready for a big year in 2026.
Makasini's sparkling display comes at the perfect time for the Tigers, who are preparing to shuffle their backline around as Adam Doueihi begins the season in the halves.
Makasini has mostly trained on the left wing this pre-season, so is competing with Jeral Skelton for chances, but could also fill in at centre should Starford To'a or Taylan May go down while Doueihi is in the halves.
"I can cover both spots. I like both positions," Makasini said.
"I've been on the left a bit, left wing. But there's a couple of good wingers in our team. We're all fighting for the spot."
Injury puts star Bulldog in doubt for Las Vegas opener
Matt Burton is backing himself to overcome a hamstring injury in time for Canterbury's Las Vegas season opener after limping off during the Bulldogs's 28-0 pre-season thrashing of Newcastle.
Dylan Brown had a quiet first hit-out in Knights colours but the multi-million-dollar recruit's underwhelming showing was overshadowed by the poorly timed injury to his rival No.6.
Burton scored an early try but pulled up sore following a tackle from Phoenix Crossland and Brown midway through Saturday's first half.
He managed to complete a tackle on Knights winger Dom Young during the next set before leaving the field for medical assessment.
"We saw him grabbing at it, and we told the trainers to get him off," Bulldogs coach Cameron Ciraldo told reporters at Hunter Stadium in Newcastle.
"He had to make that tackle [on Young], so he couldn't have been too bad."
Burton was walking freely in the Bulldogs shed after full-time, albeit with a brace on his hamstring, and told club staff his injury felt minor.
"He said it's not too bad, it feels all right," Ciraldo said.
"He just felt a little something and just thought with it being a trial that he'd come get it checked."
Burton will nevertheless be racing the fitness clock to board Thursday's flight to the US, where the Bulldogs face St George Illawarra for their season opener at Allegiant Stadium.

French President Macron urges restraint after right-wing youth fatally beaten
French President Emmanuel Macron on Saturday urged calm and restraint after a far-right aligned 23-year-old man identified only as Quentin was fatally beaten on the sidelines of a conference by a hard-left lawmaker in the southeastern city of Lyon. The incident has intensified tensions between France's far-right and hard-left.
French President Emmanuel Macron on Saturday urged calm and restraint after the fatal beating of a 23-year-old French youth aligned with the far-right on the sidelines of a conference by a hard-left lawmaker in the southeastern city of Lyon.
The death of the young man -- identified only as Quentin -- has intensified tensions between France's far-right and hard-left who are both eyeing 2027 presidential elections.
He had been in hospitalised in Lyon on Thursday after being attacked while providing what his supporters said was security for a protest against an appearance by hard-left MEP Rima Hassan at the Lyon branch of the Sciences Po university.

The office of the Lyon prosecutor on Saturday told AFP he had died of his wounds. An investigation has been opened into suspected aggravated manslaughter, it added.
Macron said on X that Quentin had been the victim of "an unprecedented outburst of violence.
"Hatred that kills has no place in our country. I call for calm, restraint and respect," he added.
'Organised' attack
According to the Nemesis collective, which is close to the far-right, Quentin was part of the security team responsible for ensuring the safety of its activists.
They were demonstrating against the conference by Hassan, who is known for her outspoken criticism of Israel.
The family's lawyer said in a statement that Quentin appeared to have been ambushed by "organised and trained individuals, vastly superior in number and armed, some with their faces masked".
Prosecutors have yet to give details on the circumstances of his death.

Nemesis accused members of a local anti-fascist association that was banned by the government in June of being behind the killing.
Three-time presidential candidate Marine Le Pen, who is still hoping to stand in 2027 despite a graft conviction, said on X that the "barbarians responsible for this lynching" should be brought to justice.
With Quentin's death sparking a wave of alarm across the political spectrum, concern also spread to the hard-left party of Hassan, France Unbowed (LFI).
"What I have feared for years in Lyon is continuing," said LFI French parliament MP Raphael Arnault.
"I offer my condolences to the family of this young man and I hope that the truth will be uncovered about this tragedy," he added.
Le Pen's far-right National Rally (RN) is the biggest single party by seats in the French lower house while the LFI is the biggest left-wing faction.
In the wake of the incident, Interior Minister Laurent Nunez urged authorities to "increase vigilance around political gatherings, as well as around campaign offices".

Debate in Europe over nuclear weapons gains pace amid US security doubts
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
- European leaders are debating bolstering nuclear arsenals due to Russian threats and US security commitment doubts, with Germany and France discussing deterrence.
- Britain and France are enhancing nuclear cooperation. NATO and US officials affirm the US nuclear umbrella remains, but welcome greater European contributions.
- An MSC report outlined five options for Europe's nuclear future, from US reliance to new arsenals, warning of no easy, risk-free solutions.

MUNICH, Germany – European leaders, worried about threats from a nuclear-armed Russia and doubts about the future of US security commitments, are increasingly debating whether to bolster nuclear arsenals on the continent.
While the US and Russia have thousands of nuclear warheads each, in Europe, only France and Britain have atomic weapons, with the combined total in the hundreds.
US President Donald Trump’s disdainful comments about NATO and his transactional approach to foreign relations have European allies questioning whether they can risk relying on US protection.
“Europeans can no longer outsource their thinking about nuclear deterrence to the United States,” an expert group warned in a report published for the Munich Security Conference (MSC).
It called on Europe to “urgently confront a new nuclear reality” in the face of “Russia’s nuclear-backed revisionism”.
Speaking at the MSC, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said he was already holding “confidential talks with the French president about European nuclear deterrence”.
British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Britain’s nuclear deterrent already protected fellow NATO members, but stressed he was “enhancing our nuclear cooperation with France”.
Mr Starmer said that “any adversary must know that in a crisis, they could be confronted by our combined strength” alongside France.
US ‘ultimate guarantor’
NATO secretary-general Mark Rutte insisted that “nobody” was considering fully replacing the American nuclear umbrella, which has shielded Europe’s NATO countries for decades.
“I think every discussion in Europe making sure that, collectively, the nuclear deterrence is even stronger – fine,” Mr Rutte, a former Dutch prime minister, told journalists.
“But nobody is arguing in Europe to do this as a sort of replacement of the nuclear umbrella of the United States.
“Everybody realises that is the ultimate guarantor – and all these other discussions are in addition.”
US Undersecretary of Defence for Policy Elbridge Colby said that Mr Trump had “made clear the US extended nuclear deterrent continues to apply here” in Europe.
He said there was US “receptivity to a greater European contribution to... the NATO deterrent” – but that conversations needed to be “very sober” and “deliberate” because of concerns about nuclear proliferation and instability.
No good options
Discussion of nuclear armament has long been viewed as taboo in many other European countries – but Russian aggression and worries about US commitment have forced the issue into mainstream European politics.
Many European officials are convinced that Moscow’s territorial ambitions will not be confined to Ukraine, and that other European countries – including even NATO members – could face some sort of attack.
The MSC report laid out five nuclear options for Europe, while cautioning that none were good. There was “no low-cost or risk-free way out of Europe’s nuclear predicament”, the authors of the report warned.
“The era in which Europe could afford strategic complacency has ended,” they wrote.
They called on European policymakers “to confront the role of nuclear weapons in the defence of the continent directly and without delay – and to invest the resources needed to do so competently”.
It listed five options: Continue to rely on American deterrence; strengthen the role of British and French nuclear weapons in a European deterrent; jointly develop European nuclear weapons as a deterrent; increase the number of European countries with their own nuclear arsenals; or expand European conventional military power to present a more intimidating non-nuclear deterrent.
Sticking with the status quo, and relying on America’s unmatched military might, remained “the most credible and feasible option” in the short term, they argued.
‘We need action’
Very few currently believe Europeans can assume full responsibility for deterrence in the short term.
“If there’s going to be some kind of bigger European investments in France’s or the UK’s nuclear deterrence, that’s only a good thing,” Finnish Defence Minister Antti Hakkanen recently told AFP.
But he quickly added: “If you’re talking about to compensate for US nuclear deterrence, that’s not realistic at this point.”
Experts, nevertheless, welcomed the increasingly serious political debate on an issue that has long worried military planners.
“That’s very positive, but now we need action,” the French Institute of International Relations’ Ms Heloise Fayet, who contributed to the MSC report, told AFP.
The report noted that both France and Britain would face a range of challenges in growing their arsenals and extending nuclear protection across Europe – from hefty costs to tricky questions about who holds final authority to launch the warheads.
French President Emmanuel Macron, who has previously raised the possibility of extending France’s nuclear umbrella across Europe, is scheduled to deliver a major speech on French nuclear doctrine at the end of February.
Mr Macron said in Munich that he was considering a doctrine that could include “special cooperation, joint exercises and shared security interests with certain key countries”. AFP

The Masked Singer UK 2026 ended with a jaw-dropping final reveal. Hidden beneath the shimmering, jewel toned ‘Moth’ costume was Keisha Buchanan, the Sugababes singer and songwriter, who secured victory after weeks of intrigue.
Earlier in the episode, ‘Toastie’ became the first contestant to be uncovered, revealed as soul diva and presenter Mica Paris. ‘Conkers’ followed, unmasked as television favourite Ben Shephard.
Judge Jonathan Ross appeared astonished after incorrectly guessing Jamelia, while Maya Jama reacted emotionally to Moth’s reveal. “Oh my God, I'm so happy. It's really you,” she said. “Because the way I've been convinced for weeks, it would've been so embarrassing.”

Why didn't Israel finish the job in Lebanon?

Israel's agreement to a ceasefire in Lebanon in November 2024, at a moment when Hezbollah was reeling from the blows it had sustained, is increasingly emerging as an unfathomable missed opportunity. We had a rare chance to decisively defeat the organization long regarded here as our most formidable and certainly most dangerous enemy. The paralyzing fear of Hezbollah not only cast a heavy shadow over daily life in northern Israel, it also prevented Israel, as many will recall, from acting against Iran's nuclear capabilities at the start of the previous decade.
Yet at the decisive moment, when victory over Hezbollah appeared within reach, we halted the fighting. In doing so, we effectively extended the organization a lifeline, one it has used well in the weeks and months since. The same "conceptzia" that led us to the October 7 catastrophe and seemed to have shattered in dramatic fashion that day is still alive and well. Once again, we hear that Hezbollah has been dealt a severe blow and is now deterred. Once again, we are told it no longer poses the kind of threat it did on the eve of October 7. And once again, we are advised to wait patiently until internal pressure within Lebanon forces the organization to surrender and disarm.
But a year and a half has already passed since the ill-fated decision to stop short of defeating Hezbollah. To everyone's surprise, the organization remains standing. It is actively rebuilding its strength, restoring its command structure and leadership, and rehabilitating its remaining military capabilities.
It is also increasingly clear that Hezbollah will never voluntarily disarm. The lull it has imposed on itself is temporary, intended solely to get Israel off its back so it can focus on reconstituting its power. Meanwhile, the Lebanese government, true to form, continues to issue declarations but refrains from taking meaningful action against the organization, neither in southern Lebanon nor north of the Litani River. Instead, it directs accusations at Israel, as though our actions are the reason Hezbollah has not disarmed.
Israel does carry out near-daily strikes in Lebanon, targeting Hezbollah operatives, hampering its rehabilitation efforts in the south and applying indirect pressure by preventing its Shiite support base from returning to villages along the Israel-Lebanon border. Yet in the final analysis, important as these actions may be, they lack strategic weight. They are insufficient to defeat Hezbollah or even to halt its recovery.
It appears, then, that the October 7 disaster changed little among Israel's decision-makers, especially regarding the northern front. Before our half-closed eyes, Hezbollah is rebuilding its capabilities, just as Hamas, the terrorist organization in Gaza, is doing the same. Israel, meanwhile, refrains from decisive action and waits, heaven knows for what.
Little wonder, then, that amid the possibility of a US strike on Iran and the risk of broader regional escalation, concern is growing that Hezbollah could join the fight against us. It beggars belief: Hezbollah, which we supposedly struck and subdued, may resume hostilities. If so, what exactly have we accomplished over the past two years? Have we simply delayed the next round?
It is becoming ever clearer that the war that began on October 7, following Hamas' murderous terrorist assault, has not truly ended. At most, we are in a temporary pause. That is the case in Gaza, vis-à-vis Iran, and in Lebanon against Hezbollah. But if the next round is essentially a matter of time, would it not be wiser to preempt the threat and remove it before it is too late?
This question is especially relevant in the Lebanese front. There, the circumstances are more conducive to decisive Israeli action. Israel also enjoys broad legitimacy for such a move, from the US, from many in the international community and even from elements within Lebanon itself.
Perhaps it is time for someone in the upper echelons in Israel to wake up, so that in a few months or years we do not once again hear the familiar refrain: "I didn't know. I didn't hear."

Russia poisoned Alexei Navalny with dart frog toxin, European nations say

Russia poisoned Alexei Navalny with dart frog toxin, European nations say
London: Five European allies have blamed Russia for killing late Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny using toxin from poison dart frogs while he was held in an Arctic penal colony two years ago, a claim Moscow rejected as propaganda.
In a joint statement, Britain, France, Germany, Sweden and the Netherlands said analyses of samples from Navalny’s body “conclusively” confirmed the presence of epibatidine, a toxin found in poison dart frogs in South America and not found naturally in Russia.
“Russia had the means, motive and opportunity to administer this poison,” they said.
The five countries said they were reporting Russia to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons for a breach of the Chemical Weapons Convention. There was no immediate comment from the organisation.
The Russian government, which has repeatedly denied any responsibility for Navalny’s death, dismissed the latest allegations as “a Western propaganda hoax”, according to the Russian state’s TASS news agency, while the Russian embassy in London said: “One must ask what kind of person would believe this nonsense about a frog.”
Navalny, who crusaded against official corruption and staged massive anti-Kremlin protests as President Vladimir Putin’s fiercest foe, died in an Arctic penal colony in February 2024 while serving a 19-year sentence that he believed to be politically motivated.
“Russia saw Navalny as a threat,” British Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper said. “By using this form of poison, the Russian state demonstrated the despicable tools it has at its disposal and the overwhelming fear it has of political opposition.”
French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot wrote on X that the poisoning of Navalny showed “that Vladimir Putin is prepared to use biological weapons against his own people in order to remain in power”.
The European nations’ assessment came as Navalny’s widow, Yulia Navalnaya, attended the Munich Security Conference in Germany, and just before the second anniversary of Navalny’s death.
She said last year that two independent labs had found that her husband was poisoned shortly before he died.
Navalnaya said on Saturday (Munich time) that she had been “certain from the first day” that her husband had been poisoned, “but now there is proof”.
Russian authorities have said the politician became ill after a walk and died from natural causes.
Epibatidine is found naturally in dart frogs in the wild, and can also be manufactured in a lab, which European scientists suspect was the case with the substance used on Navalny. It works on the body in a similar way to nerve agents, causing shortness of breath, convulsions, seizures, a slowed heart rate and ultimately death.
European officials said they had a high degree of confidence in the assessment that Navalny died from epibatidine poisoning. Asked why the results had taken so long, German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul said it had been “a complicated process”.
Wadephul said “no one but Putin’s henchmen will be able to say in detail what happened on February 16, 2024, in the Russian penal colony. But it is clear that Russian authorities had the possibility, the motive and the means to administer the poison to Navalny”.
Navalny was the target of an earlier poisoning in 2020 with a nerve agent, in an attack he blamed on the Kremlin, which always denied involvement. His family and allies fought to have him flown to Germany for treatment and recovery. Five months later, he returned to Russia, where he was immediately arrested and imprisoned for the last three years of his life.
The UK has accused Russia of repeatedly flouting international bans on chemical and biological weapons. It accuses the Kremlin of carrying out a 2018 attack in the English city of Salisbury that targeted a former Russian intelligence officer, Sergei Skripal, with the nerve agent Novichok. Skripal and his daughter became seriously ill, and a British woman, Dawn Sturgess, died after she came across a discarded bottle with traces of the nerve agent.
A British inquiry concluded that the attack “must have been authorised at the highest level, by President Putin”.
The Kremlin has denied involvement. Russia also denied poisoning Alexander Litvinenko, a former Russian agent turned Kremlin critic who died in London in 2006 after ingesting the radioactive isotope polonium-210. A British inquiry concluded that two Russian agents killed Litvinenko, and Putin had “probably approved” the operation.

Zelensky devises election manipulations in Ukraine — Russian deputy foreign minister

MOSCOW, February 15. /TASS/. Vladimir Zelensky is attempting to resort to manipulations involving elections in Ukraine, including in order to remain in power, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Galuzin said in an interview with TASS.
As the diplomat noted, responding to mounting and well-founded accusations, both externally and domestically, of usurping power and pervasive corruption, Zelensky, in dialogue with the United States, the EU, the UK, and within Ukraine’s domestic information space, "has begun speculating about a willingness to organize elections and even a referendum on 'territorial issues.'"
"Zelensky’s fragile domestic political standing is forcing him already now to contemplate manipulations. It remains unclear what to do with internally displaced persons, which is an enormous number of people. Ideas are being floated to employ the 'Moldovan scenario' — to bar Ukrainian citizens residing in Russia from participating in elections and to make maximum use of diaspora votes in Western countries," he noted.
"It appears that the illegitimate, or, as some say, 'expired president,' Zelensky is working through options for preserving himself in power. Although back in 2019 he publicly promised Ukrainians to serve only five years and to do everything possible to ensure that peace would come to Ukraine. What his promises are worth, I think, is clear without any further words," Galuzin emphasized.
As the Russian deputy foreign minister recalled, in January the Ukrainian Central Election Commission presented its considerations on organizing and conducting a vote to the Verkhovna Rada. "A working group was established there to prepare for elections. However, no real, practical steps toward organizing them are being taken. Martial law remains in force, which makes elections impossible. Consequently, it is too early to discuss the involvement of any structures in electoral monitoring," Galuzin pointed out.

Opinion | More than funding, the UN needs restructuring
The UN’s financial strain is a chance to rethink its structure, cut inefficiencies and empower local work that delivers more impact
The UN is far from ideal. The secretariat and agency headquarters are massive bureaucracies, the General Assembly is widely derided as a talk shop and the Security Council is an arena for great powers to advance their national interests.
Reports on the impact of the UN’s potential collapse have focused more on the maintenance of its headquarters than on where the institution’s work is needed most. UN funding runs on two modalities – regular programme funding from member states and extrabudgetary funding.
The latter is project-specific and comes from donors, often responding to project proposals drafted by consultants, strategically contracted for no longer than 11 months to avoid the obligation of offering full-time work or project appointments with benefits. Donors can be member states or from the private sector. So, flagship programmes will survive, especially if member states see a strategic reason to keep them running.
But that’s not necessarily good news. While some programmes and projects are likely to keep going, they will be run off the backs of exploited and under-resourced consultants. A portion of extrabudgetary funding often goes to help keep the headquarters and field offices running, despite the fact that consultants are the ones implementing the programmes.
The UN is in financial straits not only because member states are not paying their dues, but also because it inefficiently siphons money destined for field operations to headquarters based in the Global North.

Regional governors must submit 2026-2027 resilience plans – Kuleba
According to Ukrinform, Deputy Prime Minister for Restoration and Minister for Communities and Territories Development Oleksii Kuleba said this on Telegram.
He noted that during a meeting with heads of regional military administrations, participants discussed a key issue – preparations for the 2026-2027 autumn and winter period and the overall resilience of critical life-support systems: heating, water supply, electricity, transport, hospitals, and social infrastructure – systems that must function even during attacks and blackouts.
Each regional military administration head must submit a resilience plan within two weeks, specifying concrete facilities, capacities, reserves, funding sources, and an implementation schedule. The plans will be submitted for approval to the president and prime minister.
"The country must get through the next winter stronger. We are working together with the government, concerned ministries, and the regions on the necessary decisions," Kuleba said.

Union leaders issue new leadership ultimatum to Starmer
Prime minister told a summit in Munich that he ‘ended the week much stronger’ than he started it after attempts to oust him from Downing Street
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
The leaders of some of the UK’s largest unions have delivered a new ultimatum to Sir Keir Starmer, just days after he survived an attempt to oust him from power.
Demanding he change course or risk electoral disaster, Unite and Unison have warned that the party’s current trajectory undermines its “ability to win both people’s trust and elections”. They say they will band with concerned MPs to “reverse this damaging behaviour”.
The unions, which between them donate millions of pounds to the party, also hit out at Sir Keir’s decision to block his rival Andy Burnham’s return to Westminster in a by-election this month.
The warning comes just hours after Sir Keir was forced to deny he was almost “toppled” by his own MPs this week in a failed coup.
His government was plunged into crisis a fortnight ago when the extent of the contact between the UK’s former ambassador to Washington Peter Mandelson and the paedophile Jeffrey Epstein was revealed. Since then, the PM has lost three of his most senior staff and faced a battle to stay in post himself.
On Saturday, he insisted he had finished last week “stronger” than he started, during an appearance alongside other world leaders at the Munich Security Conference.
But now trade union leaders and Labour MPs have written to the party’s deputy leader Lucy Powell to demand a change of direction.
As well as Mr Burnham, they hit out at Sir Keir’s decision to suspend Labour MPs for “standing up for their constituents”. Labour have in the past stripped the party whip from MPs for voting to scrap the two-child benefit cap and opposing other policies, such as welfare cuts.
Andrea Egan, Unison general secretary, said: “Shutting down party democracy has contributed to the government’s unpopularity and its failure to improve living standards. Rebuilding the coalition necessary to stop Reform must start with a more open and democratic culture in the party.”
Richard Burgon, a Labour MP and one of the coordinators of the statement, said:“Under Keir Starmer and (his now departed chief of staff) Morgan McSweeney, there has been a clampdown on the democratic rights of Labour members. This has led to a small clique making out-of-touch decisions that have left the prime minister and the government deeply unpopular – from the mess over winter fuel payments to the appalling decision to make Peter Mandelson the US Ambassador.
“We need an urgent end to this nasty factionalism coming from the top of the party where the views of Labour members and trade unionists are treated with contempt.”
Steve Wright, FBU general secretary, said: “Firefighters know what happens when decisions are made without listening to those on the frontline. Restoring democracy in the Labour Party is essential if it is to reconnect with its members, its unions and the communities it exists to serve.”
In a statement the group, which includes more than 25 Labour MPs, said: “It’s increasingly clear that a narrow, factional agenda is being imposed upon the Party and that this is increasingly unpopular with the public.
“This approach is wrong in principle and damaging in practice. When the Labour Party sidelines its members, it weakens Labour’s roots in our communities, alienates voters, and undermines Labour’s ability to win both people’s trust and elections.
“We will work together to strengthen our democracy and reverse this damaging behaviour.”
A Labour Party spokesperson said: “The Labour Party is proud to be powered by our brilliant party members as we work to bring about the vital change we were elected to deliver.
“Our Labour government is delivering for families across the country, including tackling the cost of living, cutting NHS waiting lists and restoring pride in local communities.”

Macron mourns the death of young man violently attacked at MEP Rima Hassan's event in Lyon

The young man died in hospital where he was admitted on Thursday to receive treatment for critical injuries on the fringes of an event held by LFI MEP Rima Hassan.
Quentin D, 23, has died in hospital from a traumatic brain injury after being violently attacked in Lyon on Thursday, on the sidelines of a conference by LFI MEP Rima Hassan at the Institute of Political Studies (Sciences Po), the Lyon prosecutor’s office told AFP.
Quentin was a member of the security team responsible for providing security to the activists of right-wing group Collectif Némésis, as they staged a protest against the visit of the left-wing La France Insoumise (LFI) politician to the city.
The young man was very seriously injured after suffering multiple severe blows to the head. The hospital later said that Quentin was in critical condition after having sustained a concussion and was placed in a coma.
The Lyon Public Prosecutor's Office said they have launched an investigation into the incident. The attack is now being investigated under charges of aggravated manslaughter, officials said on Saturday.
Prosecutors also said the perpetrators of the attack have not yet been identified and police are continuing their efforts to locate the suspects.
Macron calls for 'calm, restraint and respect'
French President Emmanuel Macron mourned the young man's death, in a post on X expressing his condolences and sending his thoughts and "the nation's support" to his family and loved ones.
He denounced the "unprecedented outburst of violence" that led to Quentin's death, stressing that killing over ideological differences will never be justified in the French Republic.
"On the contrary, the very purpose of our institutions is to civilise debates and protect the free expression of arguments," wrote the French president.
Macron vowed to identify the perpetrators of this vicious assault and bring them to justice.
"The hatred that kills has no place among us."
The French leader ended his post by calling for calm, restraint and respect during this difficult time for the country.
Politicians of all ideologies condemned the event, with several figures from the right and far-right pointing the finger at the far-left, anti-fascist activists, and even La France Insoumise directly.
"The beating to death of Quentin by ultra-left militants is horrifying evidence of the extreme violence that reigns in the satellites that gravitate around LFI", said Bruno Retailleau, leader of The Republicans party.
"Given the seriousness of the threats and the criminal intentions clearly demonstrated, the government must consider these militias as terrorist groups", said Marine Le Pen.
"Please stop trying to implicate Rima Hassan and La France Insoumise in this tragedy", wrote Manuel Bompard, LFI coordinator, in a post on X on Saturday.
Hassan condemned the attack and said that her party's security detail were not involved.
LFI offices vandalised
Multiple LFI offices were vandalised in several regions in France following the incident on Thursday.
"Last night, our premises and offices were attacked all over the country after Retailleau and Le Pen made a call, covering up and repeating baseless accusations against the rebels by exploiting the tragedy in Lyon", said Jean-Luc Mélenchon, LFI founder and leader.
For the time being, it is not clear whether any arrests have been made. Sciences Po Lyon has not yet reacted to the incident which took place near their premises.

PM and Trump reportedly agree to ‘full force’ economic pressure campaign against Iran
Blocks on Iranian oil exports to China among options, US official tells Axios; Geneva to host next round of US-Iran talks, though second American official sees ‘zero chance’ of deal
US President Donald Trump and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu agreed to intensify the “maximum pressure policy” in order to force Iran to give up its nuclear program, including clamping down on the sale of Tehran’s oil to China, according to a Saturday report citing two US officials.
At the two leaders’ meeting at the White House earlier this week, “We agreed that we will go full force with maximum pressure against Iran, for example, regarding Iranian oil sales to China,” a senior American official told Axios.
According to the report, some 80 percent of Iran’s oil exports go to China, leading the US and Israel to believe that clamping down on trade between the two countries would “significantly” increase economic pressure on Tehran.
Trump, under authority by an executive order he signed last week, could impose 25% tariffs on China for trading with Iran.
The pressure campaign will be implemented alongside the ongoing negotiations between Washington and Tehran, the report said.
Oman is set to mediate another round of talks next week, though they will be held this time in Geneva, the Swiss foreign ministry announced Wednesday. The ministry did not give an exact date for the talks.
The US believes that Iran will present its answer to Washington’s proposal during next week’s meeting, the report said, though a US official told Axios that there is “zero chance” of an agreement.
“We are sober and realistic about the Iranians. The ball is in their court. If it is not a real deal, we will not take it,” a second US official said.
The report also quoted Wednesday’s meeting at the White House between Trump and Netanyahu, with the prime minister expressing skepticism that Tehran would honor an agreement with the US, even if one is reached.
It’s “impossible” to do a deal with Iran, Netanyahu reportedly said, arguing that even if Tehran signs a deal, they will not abide by it.
“We’ll see if it’s possible. Let’s give it a shot,” Trump is said to have replied.
The report added that Trump’s envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner told the US president that the Iranians are “saying all the right things” in the talks, and that they “will continue with the negotiations and take a tough line.”
If Iran agrees to what the US is asking, then the two envoys will give Trump the option “so that he can decide if he wants to do it,” a US official said, according to the report.
Axios also pointed to a recent report by an Iranian journalist, which claimed that Witkoff’s proposal included that Iran suspend its enrichment for “three to five years,” after which, Iran would be allowed to enrich uranium to “very low levels.”
The reported proposal also stipulated the “removal of 450 kilograms of highly enriched uranium” that Iran currently holds, and its relocation to a third country. Tehran rejected the proposal, according to the Iranian report.
Axios noted that a US official denied that Washington ever proposed such an offer.
Rubio: Trump would meet Khamenei
Also on Saturday, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that Trump would meet with Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei to solve disputes between the two countries, in an interview with Bloomberg while in Munich attending the city’s global security conference.
“I’m pretty confident in saying that if the ayatollah said tomorrow he wanted to meet with President Trump, the President would meet him, not because he agrees with the ayatollah but because he thinks that’s the way you solve problems in the world, and he doesn’t view meeting someone as a concession,” Rubio said.
The top diplomat has said in the past that Trump is willing to meet with any world leader to resolve disputes.
“Number one is I think it’s pretty clear that Iran will never be allowed to have a nuclear weapon, that that poses a threat not just to the United States, to Europe, to world security, and to the region. There’s no doubt about it,” he said when asked if Washington is running out of patience with Tehran given that Trump is building up forces and sending another aircraft carrier to the region.
“The second is we obviously want to have forces in the region because Iran has shown the willingness and the capability to lash out and strike out at the United States presence in the region,” Rubio said.
“We have bases because of our alliances in the region, and Iran has shown in the past that they are willing to attack us and/or threaten our bases. So we have to have sufficient firepower in the region to ensure that they don’t make a mistake and come after us and trigger something larger,” he added, stressing that Trump prefers to resolve the dispute with a deal.

Children from at least seven schools hospitalised in north London measles outbreak
More than 60 measles cases have been reported in London this year

Measles infections have been confirmed across at least seven schools in north London as the NHS has warned parents to immunise their children.
Cases were confirmed across at several schools in Enfield and Haringey, according to a warning issued by Evergreen GP Surgery in Edmonton, who said that the infection was spreading.
More than 60 measles cases were reported in London since January, and labs have confirmed 34 cases of measles in Enfield since 12 January, with one in five of these children being hospitalised with the infection.
All of those affected had not been fully immunised, according to the GP surgery.
“There is no treatment for measles, only the vaccination to prevent catching it, which is part of the Measles, Mumps, Rubella, Varicella (MMRV) injection,” the surgery said on the website.
“Parents should ensure that their children are up-to-date with all their immunisations. This can be done by checking the child’s immunisations ‘red book’ or contacting the practice nurse here at the GP practice.”
The MMR vaccine has been updated to also protect against chicken pox.
The outbreak comes after recent UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) figures showed that not a single childhood vaccine in England last year met the target needed to ensure diseases cannot spread among youngsters.
The World Health Organisation (WHO) recommends at least 95 per cent of children should receive vaccine doses for each illness to achieve herd immunity.
Some 91.9 per cent of five-year-olds had received one dose of the MMR (measles, mumps & rubella) vaccine, unchanged from 2023/24 and the lowest level since 2010/11, while just 83.7 per cent of five-year-olds had received both MMR doses, the lowest level since 2009/10.
Uptake of the first MMR dose at 24 months stood at 88.9 per cent in 2024/25 – unchanged on the previous year, but again the lowest figure since 2009/10.
Last month, the WHO confirmed that measles is re-established in the UK following a plateau in vaccination coverage and a surge in cases in 2024.
Coverage for the Hib/MenC vaccine, which protects against haemophilus influenzae type B and meningitis C, stood at 88.9 per cent for children aged five, the lowest level since 2011/12.
Meanwhile, uptake of the four-in-one pre-school booster vaccine – which protects against polio, whooping cough, tetanus and diphtheria – stood at just 81.4 per cent among five-year-olds, the lowest since current data began in 2009/10.
Elsewhere, health chiefs could not give MPs on the committee a target for meeting 95 per cent coverage on vaccines or regaining measles elimination status.
Dr Mary Ramsay, director of public health programmes at UKHSA, said high vaccine coverage is one of the “main indicators” of regaining measles elimination status, “but it’s not the only one”.
“It’s largely related to how many cases of measles you have,” she said.
“We are now having lower levels, but we’re still seeing circulation of measles. So until we stop circulating measles, we’re not going to get back to elimination.”
She added that “when we have had low coverage, it’s often taken many years to get back”.

Myths about the army - through the eyes of a former businessman

Myths about the army - through the eyes of a former businessman
Vadym Zukin, AFU serviceman
Today I caught myself thinking that I've been in the army for 8 months now. During this time, I've noticed that there are many misconceptions and myths surrounding the service.
Myth 1. Everyone in the army must be perfectly healthy.
If your cholesterol is high, your vitamin D is low, your eyesight is "-2" - then you can't serve. That's what many people think. Especially women who don't want their husbands, sons, fathers and brothers let go.
The truth is that there are not many perfectly healthy people in general - and in civilian life too. Many have certain characteristics or chronic illnesses that do not prevent them from serving. The army is not a gathering of perfectly healthy people. As for the desire of women to come up with an excuse why their loved one should not go, this is a completely adequate and healthy female desire, given the stereotypes of our society and the lack of patriotic education for many years.
Myth 2. If you have children, how can you join the army?
In fact, a lot of military personnel have minor children. And many came voluntarily. Everyone makes their own decisions, and these are difficult decisions. But the argument “I have a child” doesn’t really work, because, apparently, most men in the army who are older than 30 or 35 years old have children.
Myth 3. If your experience is “not military”, then it is not needed.
Obviously, civilian experience is very different. Indeed, if in civilian life everything was relaxed and there was no need to delve into anything new, then here it will be necessary. But definitely previous experience is very useful. Of course, only when there is a struggle for independence, because in peacetime it is still much better if the army consists mostly of professional military personnel, and for civilians, patriotically minded, there will be a clear path to be a reservist with the possibility of involvement in times of danger to the country.
Myth 4. Military personnel are dirty and poorly eat.
Hygiene is a matter of personal responsibility, and many people take it very seriously. The food is different, as it is everywhere, but it certainly cannot be called “bad.” It is either average or even good.
Myth 5. Command always makes stupid decisions.
Often, a soldier sees a very limited piece of information. Command usually has a much broader picture. It's a bit like business: when you have only limited information about your piece of work, the leader's decisions seem strange. When you see more, they become clearer. This does not mean that mistakes do not happen. But reality is usually more complicated than it seems.
Myth 6. The rights of the military are massively violated, and this is the norm.
In most cases, this is simply unprofitable and dangerous for the unit itself. No commander is interested in treating his people badly. This directly affects the result, and is also quite dangerous for him himself. It is true that the power of commanders over personnel in wartime is very great. But it is also true that the abuse of this power is not beneficial to anyone.
Myth 7. “I’m not joining the army because I don’t want to die.”
In 8 months, I haven’t met a single person who would like to die. On the contrary, most people want to live. Preferably in a peaceful country. After victory or a peace treaty. But to live. And that’s why many are here.
Myth 8. The military are impudent in everyday matters.
Experience shows that the level of impudent behavior does not really depend on whether a person is a civilian or a military person. And my long stay away from Kyiv shows something else: the behavior of the military in public places is often quite restrained. Since the consequences of improper behavior can be very specific for violating the order even when not performing official duties, since this spoils the reputation of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.
Myth 9. Only the poor or “not very smart” join the army.
There are a lot of educated people, entrepreneurs, IT professionals, doctors, managers among the military. Many had a normal and not poor life before the service. The decision to go is not always about the lack of alternatives.
Myth 10. Those in the army greatly despise those who decided not to go, either officially or not very officially.
In fact, it is precisely in the army that there is less contempt for those who, for various reasons, did not join. For various reasons, but somehow there is no hatred felt anywhere for the rear, the reserved, the "evasive". And not to that extent, and there is no need to waste energy on unnecessary thoughts.
And now a little unexpected truth.
1. For some reason, when you're in the military, some people suddenly stop communicating. Or they start talking as if you "don't have very long left." This is quite strange, because statistically, even in the biggest wars in history, the vast majority of soldiers still survived. And whether a person was in the military or not should not affect the desire to communicate.
2. Many people think that most soldiers are constantly “running around with weapons” or “sitting in the trenches.”
In fact, only a part of them directly perform combat missions with weapons in their hands. The army is a huge system with a lot of different functions. And those who really don’t want to “go into the trenches” have many opportunities to find their application in a quieter place, but, of course, with less financial compensation.
3. The Pixel uniform is not as often seen in real life as it is in social networks in ceremonial photos.
The reality is much less ceremonial and more ordinary. Some say that “we will wear a pixel to the parade.” But I really hope that the authorities will have enough sense to abandon the strange tradition of parades after the war is over.
To be honest, the army is not a separate world or some other planet. These are the same people from the same society. With their own strengths, weaknesses, and features. Perhaps, the best thing society can do now is to avoid another line for the polarization of society, which is quite popular with Ukrainians. After all, we already have enough polar lines: Russian-speaking/Ukrainian-speaking, left/remained, voted for one presidential candidate/voted for another.

RSF's October 2025 attack on Sudan's Al Fasher killed at least 6,000 in over three days: UN

More than 6,000 people were killed in over three days when the paramilitary RSF unleashed “a wave of intense violence … shocking in its scale and brutality” in Sudan’s Darfur region in late October, according to the United Nations.
The paramilitary Rapid Support Forces’ offensive to capture the city of Al Fasher included widespread atrocities that amount to war crimes and possible crimes against humanity, the UN Human Rights Office said in a report released on Friday.
“The wanton violations that were perpetrated by the RSF and allied militia in the final offensive on el-Fasher underscore that persistent impunity fuels continued cycles of violence,” said UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk.
The RSF and their allied militias, known as Janjaweed, overran Al Fasher, the Sudanese army’s only remaining stronghold in Darfur, on October 26 and rampaged through the city and its surroundings after more than 18 months of siege.
The 29-page UN report detailed a set of atrocities that ranged from mass killings and summary executions, sexual violence, abductions for ransom, torture and ill-treatment to detention and disappearances. In many cases, the attacks were ethnicity-motivated, it said.
‘Like a scene out of a horror movie’
The atrocities in Al Fasher, the provincial capital of North Darfur, mirror a pattern of RSF conduct in its war against the Sudanese military. The war began in April 2023 when a power struggle between the two sides exploded into open fighting in the capital, Khartoum and elsewhere across the country.
The conflict created the world’s largest humanitarian crisis with parts of the country pushed into famine. It has also been marked by heinous atrocities which the International Criminal Court said it was investigating as war crimes and crimes against humanity. The RSF was also accused by the Biden administration of carrying out genocide in the ongoing war.
The UN Human Rights Office said it documented the killing of at least 4,400 people inside Al Fasher between October 25 and October 27, while more than 1,600 others were killed as they were trying to flee the RSF rampage. The report said it drew its toll from interviews with 140 victims and witnesses which were “are consistent with independent analysis of contemporaneous satellite imagery and video footage”.
In one case, RSF fighters opened fire from heavy weapons on a crowd of 1,000 people sheltering in the Rashid dormitory in Al Fasher university on October 26, killing around 500 people, the report said. One witness was quoted as saying that he saw bodies thrown into the air, “like a scene out of a horror movie,” according to the report.
In another case, around 600 people, including 50 children, were executed on October 26 while taking shelter in the university facilities, the report said.
The report, however, warned that the actual scale of the death toll of the week-long offensive in Al Fasher was “undoubtedly significantly higher.”
The toll does not include at least 460 people who were killed by the RSF on October 28 when they stormed the Saudi Maternity hospital, according to the World Health Organization.
Around 300 people were also killed in RSF shelling and drone attacks between October 23 and October 24 in the Abu Shouk camp for displaced people, 2.5 kilometres (1.5 miles) northwest of Al Fasher, the UN Human Rights Office’ report said.
Women and girls sexually assaulted
Sexual violence, including rape and gang rape, was apparently widespread during Al Fasher offensive, with RSF fighters and their allied militias targeting women and girls from the African Zaghawa tribes over allegations of having links or supporting the military, the report said.
Turk, who visited Sudan last month, said survivors of sexual violence recounted testimonies that showed how the practice “was systematically used as a weapon of war”.
The paramilitaries also abducted many people while attempting to flee the city, before releasing them after paying ramson.
The UN Human Rights Office also said it documented 10 detention facilities used by the paramilitaries in Al Fasher, including the Children’s Hospital which was turned into a detention centre. Several thousands of people remain missing and unaccounted for, the report said.
The pattern of the RSF offensive on Al Fasher was a mirror of other attacks by the paramilitaries and their allies on the Zamzam camp for displaced people, 15 kilometres (9 miles) south of the city, and on West Darfur’s city of Geneina and the nearby town of Ardamata in 2023, the UN Human Rights Office said.
Turk said there were “reasonable grounds” that RSF and their allied militias committed war crimes, and that their acts also amount to crimes against humanity.
He called for holding those responsible — including commanders — accountable, warning that “persistent impunity fuels continued cycles of violence”.

European allies say Navalny was poisoned by dart frog toxin; Russia rejects claims
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
LONDON, Feb 14 - Five European allies on Saturday blamed Russia for killing late Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny using toxin from poison dart frogs while he was held in an Arctic penal colony two years ago, a claim Moscow rejected as propaganda.
In a joint statement, Britain, France, Germany, Sweden and the Netherlands said analyses of samples from Navalny's body "conclusively" confirmed the presence of epibatidine, a toxin found in poison dart frogs in South America and not found naturally in Russia.
The Russian government, which has repeatedly denied any responsibility for Navalny's death, dismissed the latest allegations as "a Western propaganda hoax," according to the Russian state's TASS news agency, while the Russian embassy in London said: "One must ask what kind of person would believe this nonsense about a frog."
Britain on Saturday said the poisoning demonstrated "an alarming pattern of behaviour". The country held a public inquiry into the poisoning in Britain of Russian double agent Sergei Skripal in 2018. It concluded last year Russian President Vladimir Putin must have ordered the Novichok nerve agent attack.
"When the test results are available and the formulas for the substances are disclosed, we will comment accordingly," Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova was quoted as saying by TASS.
"Until then, all such assertions are merely propaganda aimed at diverting attention from pressing Western issues," the news agency cited her as saying. The report also said she described Navalny as a blogger "officially designated as a terrorist and extremist in Russia".
The British government declined to comment to a Reuters query about how the samples from Navalny's body were obtained or where they were assessed. Foreign Minister Yvette Cooper told reporters that "UK scientists worked with our European partners to pursue the truth" on Navalny's death.
SECOND ANNIVERSARY OF NAVALNY'S DEATH
Russian opposition leader Navalny died in an Arctic prison colony in February 2024, after being convicted of extremism and other charges, all of which he denied.
His death was announced minutes before the opening of the Munich Security Conference in 2024. In response, the conference made a rare schedule adjustment to allow his widow, Yulia Navalnaya, to address the conference and she called for Putin to be held accountable.
"I was certain from the first day that my husband had been poisoned, but now there is proof ... I am grateful to the European states for the meticulous work they carried out over two years and for uncovering the truth," she said on social media while attending this year's Munich conference on Saturday.
The Russian embassy spokesperson said the European allies' move was "not a quest for justice but a mockery of the dead."
"Even after the death of the Russian citizen, London and the European capitals cannot allow him to rest in peace - a fact that speaks volumes about those who instigated this campaign," the spokesperson added.
Saturday's statement from the European allies, almost exactly two years after Navalny's death, said Moscow had the means, motive and opportunity to administer the poison as Navalny died in prison.
"Russia claimed that Navalny died of natural causes. But given the toxicity of epibatidine and reported symptoms, poisoning was highly likely the cause of his death," the joint statement said.
His death was followed by memorial gatherings and protests across Europe, with demonstrators in cities including London, Berlin, Vilnius and Rome condemning the Kremlin and demanding accountability.
The joint statement added that the latest findings underlined the need for Russia to be held accountable for "its repeated violations of the Chemical Weapons Convention and, in this instance, the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention." REUTERS

Trump, Netanyahu agree US should press Iran to cut oil sales to China: Report

- US and Israeli leaders agreed, Axios reported, to reduce Iran's oil exports to China under "maximum pressure".
- China buys over 80% of Iran's oil, so reducing trade would significantly lower Iran's oil revenue.
- US held nuclear talks but also positioned a naval flotilla, preparing for potential sustained military operations against Iran.
AI generated
WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu agreed at a White House meeting on Feb 11
“We agreed that we will go full force with maximum pressure against Iran, for example, regarding Iranian oil sales to China,” the US news site reported on Feb 14, quoting a senior US official.
China’s Foreign Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Feb 15, the first day of a national holiday for the Chinese New Year.
China accounts for more than 80 per cent of Iran’s oil exports.
Any reduction in that trade would mean lower oil revenue for Iran.
US and Iranian diplomats held nuclear talks through Omani mediators recently in an effort to revive diplomacy, after the US President positioned a naval flotilla in the region as the American military prepares for the possibility of sustained, weeks-long operations against Iran. REUTERS

Lindsey Vonn shares health update on latest surgery and plans to return to US
Vonn ustained a "complex tibia fracture" during an Olympic downhill event last Sunday
- Bookmark
Lindsey Vonn said Saturday that her latest surgery on the left leg she broke in the Olympic downhill “went well” and she “will be able to finally go back to the U.S.”
The 41-year-old skier is receiving treatment at a hospital in Treviso.
Vonn sustained a "complex tibia fracture" during an Olympic downhill event last Sunday, crashing just 13 seconds into her run before being airlifted from the course.
She stated on Monday that the injury "will require multiple surgeries to fix properly," later announcing a "successful" third operation on Wednesday.
Nine days before Sunday’s crash, Vonn ruptured the ACL in her left knee in another crash. Even before then, all eyes had been on her as the feel-good story heading into the Olympics for her comeback after nearly six years of retirement.
“I have been reading a lot of messages and comments saying that what has happened to me makes them sad,” Vonn said on Instagram. “Please, don’t be sad. Empathy, love and support I welcome with an open heart, but please not sadness or sympathy. I hope instead it gives you strength to keep fighting, because that is what I am doing and that is what I will continue to do. Always.
“When I think back on my crash, I didn’t stand in the starting gate unaware of the potential consequences. I knew what I was doing. I chose to take a risk.”
Vonn’s father, Alan Kildow, told The Associated Press on Monday that his daughter will no longer race if he has any influence over her decision.
But Vonn concluded her latest message by saying she is “still looking forward to the moment when I can stand on the top of the mountain once more. And I will.”

Trump’s ‘desire’ to own Greenland persists, says Danish PM

- Danish PM Mette Frederiksen believes US President Trump still wants to own Greenland, despite recent threats being dialled back.
- Trump's desire for mineral-rich Greenland caused US-Europe tension, as he sees it vital for US/NATO security against Russia and China.
- A US-Denmark-Greenland working group formed to discuss Arctic security concerns. Denmark states "red lines" for Greenland's autonomy will not be crossed.

MUNICH, Germany - Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said on Feb 14 she believed US President Donald Trump still desires to own Greenland despite dialling back his recent threats to seize it by force.
Asked at a security conference in Munich if Mr Trump still wanted to own the Arctic island, Ms Frederiksen said: “Unfortunately, I think the desire is the same.”
Mr Trump’s designs on Greenland
In January, he backed down from his threats to seize the island, an autonomous territory of ally Denmark, after striking what he called a “framework” deal
But relations have remained strained.
“Everybody asks us, do we think it’s over? I mean, no, we don’t think it’s over,” Ms Frederiksen said, participating in a panel discussion on Arctic security.
Mr Trump insists mineral-rich Greenland is vital for US and NATO security against Russia and China as a melting Arctic opens up and the superpowers jostle for strategic advantage.
Ms Frederiksen and her Greenlandic counterpart, Mr Jens-Frederik Nielsen, said the pressure on the island’s people was “unacceptable”.
But Mr Nielsen said “some steps” had been taken “in the right direction”.
A US-Denmark-Greenland working group has been established to discuss Washington’s security concerns in the Arctic, but details have not been made public.
“We now have a working group, it’s good. We will try to see if we can find a solution... But of course, there are red lines that will not be crossed. And we will stick to our strategy,” Ms Frederiksen said.
The remarks came after Ms Frederiksen and Mr Nielsen had a 15-minute meeting with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Feb 13 on the sidelines of the security conference, which Ms Frederiksen afterwards described as “constructive”. AFP

Syrian FM: Security talks with Israel are focused on buffer zone, not Golan Heights
Asaad al-Shaibani clarifies negotiations are about IDF presence in border areas that Israeli troops entered after Assad regime’s overthrow, says control of Golan ‘is another issue’
Syrian Foreign Minister Asaad al-Shaibani said on Saturday that negotiations on a security deal with Israel were focused on areas Israel has recently occupied and excluded the broader issue of the Golan Heights.
Since the December 8, 2024, overthrow of Syria’s longtime ruler Bashar al-Assad, Israel has sent troops into a UN-patrolled buffer zone that separated Israeli and Syrian forces.
Israel and Syria’s new authorities have held several rounds of direct talks in recent months, and after negotiations in January — and under US pressure — they agreed to establish an intelligence-sharing mechanism as they edged towards a security agreement.
When asked at the Munich Security Conference about the scope of the talks with Israel, Shaibani said discussions were on “the withdrawal of Israel” from Syrian territory occupied after Assad’s ousting, “not from the Golan Heights, and this is another issue.”
Israel captured the Golan Heights from Syria in the 1967 Six Day War and annexed it, a move that Syria and most countries don’t recognize.
To reach a security deal, Israel should “respect the security of Syria and withdraw from these territories” recently entered, Shaibani said.
“These negotiations will certainly not lead to forcing an acceptance of the fait accompli imposed by Israel in southern Syria,” he said.
“The end of these negotiations will be the withdrawal of Israel from the areas where it advanced” since December 2024, and with Israel refraining from “interfering in Syria’s internal affairs” and sovereignty, Shaibani added.
Israel, which has demanded a demilitarized zone in southern Syria, carried out waves of airstrikes against military installations in the immediate aftermath of the lightning offensive that took out the Assad regime, citing the danger of them falling into jihadists’ hands.
It also intervened last year during unrest in the Druze-majority area of Sweida, at the urging of Druze in Israel, and it has had small-scale confrontations with terror groups inside Syria amid operations to kill or capture operatives, or to seize weapons.
Syrian FM, Kurdish commander share meeting with Rubio
Shaibani on Friday met US Secretary of State Marco Rubio in Munich and discussed a recent agreement between Damascus and the Kurds.
Mazloum Abdi, chief of the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), was also in attendance.
Syria’s government and the Kurds last month signed an agreement to gradually integrate Kurdish forces and institutions into the state, after the SDF ceded territory to advancing government troops.

— Wladimir van Wilgenburg (@vvanwilgenburg) February 13, 2026
Shaibani told the Munich conference that the Rubio meeting involving Abdi “confirms the new mindset Syria is adopting today.”
“We do not view our national partners as enemies,” he said, adding that the country’s national identity is “completed by Syria’s diversity.”
The US military said on Friday it had completed the transfer of thousands of Islamic State group suspects, including many Syrians, to Iraq, after they were held in Kurdish-run prisons in northeast Syria for years.
Shaibani said Damascus was “prepared in the future to take back” Syrian detainees “to ease the burden on Iraq.”

Zelensky accepts Munich Security Conference award on behalf of Ukrainian people
According to an Ukrinform correspondent, the award ceremony took place at the Munich Residence on Saturday evening.
"I'm very proud to be here and it's a great honor for me. I'm very proud to have such friends and to be the president of Ukraine, of our people, our great nation. I thank Germany and your people who are supporting us from the very beginning of the full-scale war," Zelensky said during the ceremony.
The Ukrainian leader stressed that Germany is currently the country providing the largest volume of assistance to Ukraine. In particular, Zelensky highlighted Germany's contribution to building a critically important air defense system amid Russian strikes on energy infrastructure and civilian facilities.
The Ewald von Kleist Award, established by the founder of the Munich Security Conference, Ewald von Kleist-Schmenzin, has been presented since 2009 for outstanding contributions to international cooperation and conflict resolution.
Earlier, the Chairman of the Munich Security Conference, Wolfgang Ischinger, announced that the 2026 award would go to the Ukrainian people, who have been fighting for their freedom, independence, and dignity for more than ten years.

Azerbaijan's president accuses Russia of 'deliberate attack' on country's embassy in Ukraine

Azerbaijan's president accuses Russia of 'deliberate attack' on country's embassy in Ukraine
Russia deliberately targeted Azerbaijan's energy infrastructure and embassy during attacks against Ukraine, Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev said on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference on Feb. 14.
The comments came on the same day Aliyev met with President Volodymyr Zelensky, who addressed the conference and held talks with various leaders in Munich.
Aliyev's remarks also highlight the growing strain in Russia–Azerbaijan relations, despite recent efforts by Moscow and Baku to normalize ties.
"There were three attacks on the energy infrastructure of Azerbaijan in Ukraine, and there were also three attacks on the Azerbaijani embassy in Ukraine," Aliyev told the independent media outlet Ukrainska Pravda in Munich.
"After the first attack, we could assume that it was accidental, and we gave our Russian colleagues all the coordinates of the diplomatic missions of Azerbaijan, including the consular department, our cultural centers, and everything else. Despite this, two more attacks took place. So it was a deliberate attack on the diplomatic mission of Azerbaijan."
The reported strikes come amid Russia's all-out assault on Ukrainian energy infrastructure, an ongoing campaign that intensified in fall 2025 as temperatures began to plunge. In November, Azerbaijan's Foreign Ministry summoned the Russian ambassador to voice a "strong protest" after the Azerbaijani Embassy in Kyiv was damaged by an Iskander-type missile in a Russian aerial attack.
Previously, in August 2025, Azerbaijian's Embassy in Kyiv suffered damage due to a Russian strike. That same month, a Russian drone attack also damaged a diesel pipeline and injured four workers at an Azerbaijan State Oil Company (SOCAR) depot in Odesa Oblast. Another attack that summer targeted a gas distribution station near Orlivka, part of the Trans-Balkan pipeline that began carrying Azerbaijani gas to Ukraine in July.
Azerbaijan's honorary consulate in Kharkiv also suffered damage in March 2022, shortly after Russia launched its full-scale invasion.
Azerbaijan has maintained a neutral stance in the Russia-Ukraine war, balancing its long-standing partnership with Moscow while offering humanitarian and energy assistance to Kyiv. Following Aliyev and Zelensky's meeting on Feb. 14, the Presidential Office said that Azerbaijan "is ready to deepen cooperation" with Ukraine.
"The leaders discussed the development of bilateral relations and the implementation of projects in the energy sector," the Presidential Office said. "Azerbaijan is interested in them and is ready to deepen cooperation. Volodymyr Zelensky and Ilham Aliyev agreed that the teams would work out all necessary issues."
Aliyev also told Ukrainska Pravda that Baku sees Moscow's recent strikes as hostile.
Russia's actions are "of course, regarded as an unfriendly step towards Azerbaijan," he said.

Aiava quits tennis, calls out 'racist, misogynistic, homophobic' culture

Destanee Aiava announces retirement, calls out online trolls and 'racist' tennis culture
In short:
Destanee Aiava has announced her retirement from tennis in an explosive social media post.
The 25-year-old called out online trolls, while also claiming the sport had a "culture that’s racist, misogynistic, homophobic and hostile to anyone who doesn’t fit the mould".
Aiava last played at the Australian Open, where she was knocked out with Maddison Inglis in the first round of the women's doubles.
Australian tennis player Destanee Aiava says 2026 will be her last year in professional tennis, announcing her impending retirement in an expletive-laden statement on social media.
Aiava, 25, described tennis as her "toxic boyfriend", while also calling out a culture in the sport she said is "racist, misogynistic, homophobic and hostile to anyone who doesn't fit its mould".
The Victorian did not make the main singles draw of January's Australian Open, and was eliminated with partner Maddison Inglis in the first round of the women's doubles.
Aiava has not played since the Australian Open, which will now be her last home slam.
In a post to social media on Saturday evening, Aiava said she had trusted the wrong people early in her career, something she was unable to overcome.
"2026 will be my final year on tour playing professional tennis," Aiava wrote.
"From the moment I had my first lesson at Casey Tennis Club, my entire life was tennis. I often wondered what my life would have looked like if I'd chosen anything else and whether everything I sacrificed for this sport was actually worth the cost.
"There was a time in my career when I had reached the point that comes just before you make your big breakthrough, when the world is at your feet and nothing can touch you.
"I was only 17, unprepared and dangerously naive to the consequences of trusting the wrong people.
"The trajectory of my career was never the same after that."
The 25-year-old said she kept playing tennis because she believed it was owed to herself and "everyone who had helped me throughout my career".
Aiava called tennis "my toxic boyfriend", stating she did not know what her passions were outside of the sport.
But the most explosive aspects of her retirement post were reserved for those Aiava claimed "made me feel less than".
"I want to say a ginormous f*** you to everyone in the tennis community who’s ever made me feel less than," she wrote.
"F*** you to every single gambler who's sent me hate or death threats.
"F*** you to the people who sit behind screens on social media, commenting on my body, my career or whatever the f*** they want to nitpick."
Aiava has been vocal about online abuse in the past.
After losing in this year's Australian Open qualifiers, she shared a comment that had been left on her page, which addressed her ability and body image.
She also dealt with comments about her appearance following her breakthrough performance at the 2025 Australian Open, where she made it to the second round.
In a video addressing online abuse published in January, the Victorian said she had dealt with the trolling for years.
"The way that people think it's OK just because someone is a public figure, that they comment this s***? F***ing disgusting," she said in January.
"Body shaming is not a f***ing opinion, and neither is bullying."
On Saturday, Aiava said she was proud to have represented the Pasifika community on the international tennis stage.
Aiava has a New Zealand-born father, Mark, whose parents were Samoan, while her mother Rosie was born in American Samoa.
She called out a culture in tennis that she called "hostile" to people like her.
"And f*** you to a sport that hides behind so-called class and gentlemanly values," she wrote.
"Behind the white outfits and traditions is a culture that's racist, misogynistic, homophobic and hostile to anyone who doesn’t fit the mould."
Aiava is currently ranked number 321 in the WTA, with a career high of 147.
She won 10 singles titles on the women's ITF tour, the last coming in Brisbane in 2024.
"Life is not meant to be lived in misery or half assed," Aiava wrote on Saturday.
"My ultimate goal is to be able to wake up everyday and genuinely say I love what I do — which I think everyone deserves the chance at.
"I'm 25, turning 26 this year and I feel so far behind everyone else, like I'm starting from scratch. I'm also scared. But that's better than living a life that's misaligned, or being around constant comparison and losing yourself."

Italian journalist says Russian citizenship will give him peace of mind

LUGANSK, February 14. /TASS/. International Reporters journalist Vincenzo Lorusso, who operates in Donbass, has expressed his aspiration to acquire Russian citizenship. Speaking to TASS, Lorusso emphasized that holding a Russian passport would provide him with greater peace of mind.
"Yes, of course, it's my wish - more precisely, my dream - to obtain Russian citizenship," he stated. "Having Russian citizenship would allow me to work with a sense of security, especially given the political pressures I face. The Vice-President of the European Parliament has already twice called for sanctions against me and submitted a dossier to Kaja Kallas, head of the EU External Action Service, requesting EU sanctions. Additionally, the Ukrainian ambassador to Italy has urged Italian mayors not to allow me to speak at conferences or participate in online debates," he explained to TASS.
Lorusso clarified that his primary goal as a journalist working in Donbass is "to maintain a bridge of friendship between Italy and Russia, promoting people-to-people diplomacy."
"Beyond my personal desire for peace of mind, I love Russia - its history, its people, its culture and literature. I consider Russophobia a crime that must be confronted. It moves me deeply when I see the Russian tricolor flying. That flag is in my heart and always will be, but I would very much like it to be reflected on my official documents as well," he added.
In February, Russian Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Irina Volk announced that Lorusso had been granted a residence permit.

BrewDog could be broken up as craft beer business put up for sale

The beer-maker BrewDog could be broken up after consultants were called in to help find new investors.
The Scotland-based brewer, which makes craft beer such as Punk IPA and Elvis Juice, has appointed consultants AlixPartners to oversee the sale process.
BrewDog last month announced it was closing its distilling brands, prompting concerns for jobs at its facility in Ellon, Aberdeenshire.
The company, which was founded in 2007 by friends James Watt and Martin Dickie, said it made the decision to focus on its beer products.
No decision has been made in respect of the sale process.
A spokesperson for BrewDog said: “As with many businesses operating in a challenging economic climate and facing sustained macro headwinds, we regularly review our options with a focus on the long-term strength and sustainability of the company.
“Following a year of decisive action in 2025, which saw a focus on costs and operating efficiencies, we have appointed AlixPartners to support a structured and competitive process to evaluate the next phase of investment for the business.
“This is a deliberate and disciplined step with a focus on strengthening the long-term future of the BrewDog brand and its operations.”
The spokesperson added: “BrewDog remains a global pioneer in craft beer: a world-class consumer brand, the No 1 independent brewer in the UK and with a highly engaged global community.
“We believe that this combination will attract substantial interest, though no final decisions have been made.
“Our breweries, bars, and venues continue to operate as normal. We will not comment on any further speculation.”
The company announced job cuts across the business in October last year after posting a £37m loss.
BrewDog operates 72 bars around the world, as well as four breweries.
The firm employs about 1,400 people and has breweries in Ellon, as well as in the US, Australia and Germany.

From competition to communication: Removing the strategic games in relationships - comment
Unknown

After nearly 25 years, I can’t remember how many people have tried to give me the “perfect advice” for finding a partner.
“Just be yourself!”
“Don’t tell them how much you read; it’s scary.”
“Put yourself out there!”
“Maybe a little more makeup?”
So when I was handed a copy of the 2006 book Why Men Marry Bitches, by Sherry Argov, I figured, what do I have to lose? After all, I am indeed – depending on whom you ask – a bitch myself, so I thought maybe I’d learn something.
Contrary to its title, this book is not “A woman’s guide to winning her man’s heart.” It is a rule book for the most ridiculous games men and women play with each other instead of just having a single conversation.
Less than 50 pages in, you get this gem: Don’t even mention the word “commitment.” The less you say about it, the closer you are to getting it.
What? Were men in the early aughts really so terrified of admitting they liked someone? Why do relationships need to be treated like a chess match, where you need to maintain the upper hand?
The book has an entire chart about how long to wait between phone calls so you don’t accidentally reveal that maybe you’re interested in more than a situationship.
The idea that you should tell a partner to “Please give me the same courtesy that you would give to a client you work with” was one that really blew me away because, for the record, if my future person is out there: dear God, don’t.
The strategy of dating
To be fair to Argov, Why Men Marry Bitches was publishing gold in 2006 because it spoke directly to the anxieties of its moment.
This was peak strategic dating era, when the books Sex and the City had women analyzing every phone call like CIA operatives; when He’s Just Not That Into You convinced us that men were simple creatures whose feelings could be decoded with the right manual; when The Rules still cast a long shadow over how women approached relationships.
The underlying philosophy was pure game theory: Relationships were fundamentally adversarial, and you needed a competitive edge to win. Being “too available” signaled desperation. Showing genuine interest meant losing leverage. Vulnerability wasn’t intimacy – it was tactical weakness.
Women consumed these books religiously because we’d been taught that love was something you strategized your way into, that the right combination of aloofness and intrigue would unlock commitment.
Women needed instruction manuals because they’d been sold the idea that honesty, directness, and emotional transparency were relationship repellents.
Reading Argov’s advice now feels like watching someone describe an elaborate heist, when you could just knock on the door.
The shift to healthy relationships
The entire premise – that you need to strategically withhold parts of yourself to seem valuable – contradicts everything we’ve (hopefully) learned about healthy relationships. We talk about attachment styles now, not manipulation tactics. We value emotional availability, not calculated distance. The idea of performing cool indifference for months or years sounds genuinely exhausting when you could just communicate like adults.
Beyond the sheer effort required, the book’s framework feels archaic in its assumptions. It presumes a rigidly heteronormative dynamic where men chase, and women gatekeep, where traditional gender roles are so fixed that they can be gamed like a predictable algorithm.
It completely misses that good relationships aren’t about winning – they’re about finding someone who enthusiastically chooses you without needing to be tricked into it. The “power” Argov promises isn’t actually power; it’s performing a character until someone proposes to your act instead of to you.
That’s not a victory. That’s a setup for years of wondering when he’ll figure out you’ve been pretending all along.
Maybe the saddest thing about Why Men Marry Bitches isn’t the advice itself; it’s that millions of women bought it – and truly, it’s part of why I read the book to begin with – because we genuinely feared that being ourselves was too much; that our authentic enthusiasm, our emotional honesty, our desire for partnership, would scare men away.
Twenty years later, we’re finally learning what actual power looks like: showing up as yourself and trusting that the right person won’t need a performance.

Valentine’s Day 2026: The aphrodisiac myth that could spoil your romantic dinner

Oysters, exotic spices, chocolate desserts and a glass of champagne are Valentine’s Day staples, long associated with whispers of aphrodisiac power.
However, according to medical experts, romance may owe more to atmosphere than to ingredients.
“The belief that aphrodisiac foods exist is ancient and present in every culture, but currently there is numerous scientific evidence that refutes it,” experts from the online anti-hoax platform “Doctor, but is it true that…?” said in a Valentine’s Day note. The platform is curated by the National Federation of Orders of Physicians, Surgeons and Dentists (Fnomceo).
“It is not necessary to avoid foods like chili pepper or chocolate on Valentine’s Day, but it is good not to expect miracles.”
Can foods really increase desire or physical pleasure?
The term “aphrodisiac,” derived from Aphrodite, the Greek goddess of love, refers to foods or substances believed to increase desire and physical pleasure. Yet, experts stress that such claims lack scientific grounding.
For a substance to truly merit the label, they explain, it would need to increase blood flow to organs involved in sexual response, stimulate physical and psychological sensitivity, influence hormones regulating desire and pleasure, and produce a rapid effect after a single intake.
“Such results,” they note, “are sometimes achievable with pharmacological therapy or psychotherapy.” Food, however, does not meet that standard.
Chili pepper, often cited because of its capsaicin content, has recognized anti-inflammatory, digestive and analgesic properties - but no proven aphrodisiac effect. Oysters are rich in zinc, a mineral associated with testosterone production, yet there is no scientific evidence linking them to improved male sexual function.
Cocoa can raise levels of serotonin and phenylethylamine, hormones associated with pleasure and satisfaction, but meaningful effects would require unhealthy quantities. And while alcohol may appear to lower inhibitions, doctors warn that as blood alcohol levels rise, bodily functions - including those related to sexual performance - are actually depressed, with possible consequences such as erectile dysfunction or premature ejaculation.
In the end, experts suggest, Valentine’s Day magic is more likely to come from connection than from the menu.

Rabbi Shmuel Yerish: From teaching in Ukraine to creating Jewish kids' toys in Hadera
Unknown
Unknown Publisher

05:51:30 KST

‘My name is Shmuel. I am the father of 15 children, ages one to 20. Three years ago, I made aliyah from Ukraine to Hadera with nothing. With zero dollars in my pocket. Here, I started a brand producing toys connected with Jewish tradition.”
With an intro like that, it was abundantly clear that Rabbi Shmuel Yerish has a fascinating story to tell.
Let’s start with his brand, Reb Shmuel Toys (rebshmueltoys@gmail.com).
From Rachel and Leah dolls (Leah has glasses because of the verse describing her “weak eyes”), to a Yetziat Mitzrayim (Exodus from Egypt) play set, to portable play tents resembling the Holy Temple or 770 Eastern Parkway (Lubavitch headquarters in Brooklyn, New York), Reb Shmuel’s toys are produced in China – some items are now starting to be manufactured in Israel – and are sold in Israel through social networks, communities, and kindergartens.
Everything has a Jewish twist and is designed with real kids in mind.
Inspiration for toys comes from personal experience
“The ideas for toys come from my vast experience as a teacher and a father,” Yerish says. “The biggest difficulty was taking the first step, choosing the path of an entrepreneur. Like Nachshon ben Aminadav” – whom a rabbinic legend credits with walking into the Red Sea as an act of faith even before it parted – “I moved forward step by step, with only the desire. I had experience creating board games in Ukraine, but building my own brand would be a completely different experience.”
This 48-year-old Jewish educator, event coordinator, and game developer also runs children’s birthday parties and stars in his original one-man musical, Better To Be Jewish. In true Lubavitch style, he calls himself Shaliach Simcha (“emissary of joy”).
Ukraine was still part of the Soviet Union when he was born in 1977, so he knew nothing about Judaism except that he was Jewish. Once the Iron Curtain fell, when he was 14, his Jewish identity and knowledge blossomed.
“I was the coordinator and one of the leaders of the wonderful Hillel organization in Odessa. On my first trip to Israel, near the Kotel, they put tefillin on me for the first time. And they told me to recite the “Shema” before bed. Well, what do you think the chances are that a secular guy would start doing that? And yet, I started reading the first line, then the second, and so on.”
After graduating from a technical college in Odessa, he learned in a yeshiva and then a Chabad kollel (yeshiva for married men) after marrying Chana Gitl in 2004. He received his rabbinic ordination at the kollel in 2010.
“I worked as a teacher and vice principal in a Talmud Torah and realized that Jewish education should be brought directly into people’s homes,” he says. “I worked for five years as a cash-register technician, but later fully devoted my life to Jewish education.”
Meanwhile, his wife became a world expert in the study of Chabad nigunim (melodies) and began presenting concerts, lectures, and master classes. In Israel, she teaches at a music school and gives private piano lessons. The couple and their children “more or less spoke Hebrew before making aliyah – we read books and understood it to some degree.”
It goes without saying that the idea of relocating to Israel became more of an imperative following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Yerish’s parents came to the same conclusion and made aliyah that year as well, all with the assistance of the Jewish Agency. They had some distant relatives in Israel.
“The war in Ukraine removed the last bit of doubt,” Yerish says. “Security was the last deterrent. But when I found myself in Israel and experienced its war, I realized it was a war at home. And it felt different. Moreover, I didn’t want to choose between Ukraine and Russia. I chose to be Jewish, and Israel is our land.”
The process was not easy, especially with a large family to uproot from one country and resettle in another, but Yerish saw a divine hand guiding everything. “Absolutely, it was like the Exodus from Egypt. The number of miracles was overwhelming.”
One of these “miracles” occurred at the airport in Berlin, a stop along the way. The Jewish Agency had not informed the Yerish family that they’d need COVID-related paperwork in order to get on the plane to Israel. Airport officials told them to fill out forms for each member of the family. And the only way to do it was one by one, on their phones.
“My wife and I only had two phones. And they wouldn’t let us on the plane until we finished filling out the forms. My pregnant wife, I, and our 13 children were stuck between two worlds. We spent the night on the floor at the airport. I filled out all the forms that night. Well, in the morning, through the highest connections, they got us tickets for the morning flight. The plane waited for us for a whole hour. And we flew to Israel,” he recounts.
When asked why the family chose to live in Hadera, Yerish answers, “The reason was simple. We found a suitable place to live, and as it turned out, the city was perfect for us.”
He is grateful that “here in Israel you can live a full Jewish life, without judgment or reproach.”
And now, with two more additions to the family since their arrival, Yerish says his challenge is to scale up his Reb Shmuel Toys production to make it a profitable business. He has also started making Jewish community games and is participating in a tender from the Diaspora Ministry for social programs featuring Jewish identity.
He says, “There is a Mishnaic saying that inspires me: ‘If I am not for myself, who will be for me? And if I am only for myself, what am I? And if not now, when?’”

Pakistan captain says it is up to India to decide whether to shake hands at the T20 World Cup
Pakistan captain Salman Ali Agha says it is up to India's players to decide if they will shake hands with his team before and after Sunday's much-anticipated T20 World Cup clash

Pakistan captain Salman Ali Agha says it is up to India’s players to decide whether they will shake hands with his team before and after Sunday’s much-anticipated T20 World Cup match.
Political and diplomatic tensions between the two nations have often boiled over on to the cricket field. The game in Colombo will be the first time they have met since last year's acrimonious Asia Cup tournament in the United Arab Emirates won by India and where players refused to shake hands.
Pakistan's government threatened a boycott of Sunday's match after the International Cricket Council kicked Bangladesh out of the World Cup for refusing to play matches in India, citing security concerns.
Pakistan only agreed to play after intense discussions with the ICC. The fixture is the major revenue earner for the ICC.
Tensions came to a head in the Asia Cup when India captain Suryakumar Yadav refused to shake hands with Agha. Heated moments followed between the two sides throughout the tournament, with Suryakumar and Pakistan's Haris Rauf fined for breaching the ICC's code of conduct.
India went on to win the Asia Cup but refused to accept the trophy from Pakistan Cricket Board chairman Mohsin Naqvi.
“The game should be played in real spirit, the way it has been played since it started. The rest is up to them (India), what they want to do,” Agha told media on Saturday about the possibility of the players shaking hands.
Suryakumar, for his part, was non-committal.
“Why are you highlighting that?” Suryakumar asked reporters. “We are here to play cricket. We will play good cricket. We will take all those calls tomorrow. We will see tomorrow.”
Political and military tensions have meant the two teams have not played a bilateral series for years.
India has not traveled to Pakistan since 2008 and Pakistan visited India for the 50-over World Cup in 2023 but has since played ICC tournaments at neutral venues.
India has defeated Pakistan 12 times in the 16 T20 games they have played. It also has an impressive 6-1 record in the eight T20 World Cup matches since the first edition in 2007, with one being tied.
“We don’t have a good record against them in World Cups," Agha said. "But whenever you come to play a new match, it’s a new day and you have to play good cricket to win.
“You can’t change history. You can learn from it. We learned from it and we’ll try to do a good performance tomorrow and win the match.”
Suryakumar also said his players will put history behind them because past memories can lead to complacency.
Pakistan spinner Usman Tariq's bowling action has been the subject of discussion in recent days.
The Indian media has questioned whether Tariq's action is legal because he pauses before delivering the ball.
“The guy has been cleared twice and he has done whatever the ICC said, and whatever it requires to bowl in international cricket,” Agha said of Tariq. “I don’t know why people are saying so many things about him, but the one thing I can assure you, he doesn’t care about that because he’s very used to this stuff."
India's aggressive opening batter Abhishek Sharma’s health has also been the subject of discussion after he missed the match against Namibia due to a stomach infection.

Jordan Stolz, Double Olympic Champion at 21, Could Already Be the Speedskating GOAT

Before the 500-m men’s event at the Milano Speed Skating Stadium on Saturday, American Olympic champion Jordan Stolz, who won the 1000-m race here three nights ago, had a conversation with Bob Corby, his coach. Corby reminded Stolz that even if his start time in this sprint trailed his competition, the race would be won on the backstretch. “So you’ve got to burn, like you’ve never burned before,” Corby said. “And then everything will be fine.”
Stolz brought the required fire to the Olympic ice, again, and he’s now a double-Olympic champ. He set a new Olympic record in the 500, finishing the race in 33.77 seconds, .11 seconds ahead of Dutch speedskater Jenning de Boo, with whom he was paired on the oval. The rivals also dueled in the 500, and de Boo finished second there too, behind Stolz, who also set an Olympic best-ever time in the 1,000.

After crossing the finish line and looking up at the board to see his second-place time, a frustrated de Boo clutched his head, fell, and slid into the padded wall of the track, which seemed fitting. While back-to-back silvers are no small accomplishment, against Stolz, the Dutchman can’t seem to catch a break.
“I have a bit more of a bitter taste in my mouth than in the 1,000 meters, because I think the 500 is my best distance,” says de Boo, 22, who was not injured in his fall. “So this would have been the distance I should have done it at.”
Stolz’s time was also the fastest-ever 500 on sea level. The world record of 33.61 seconds, set by Russia’s Pavel Kulizhnikov in 2019, was in altitude, in a World Cup Final in Salt Lake City. Stolz is the first American Olympian to win two individual gold medals at a single Winter Games in 32 years; Bonnie Blair doubled in the 500 and 1,000 as well. Stolz is expected to win the 1,500 m on Feb. 19. If he pulls that off, a victory in the Feb. 21 mass start would give him four gold medals, just one short of American Eric Heiden’s record for most golds by a men’s speedskater at a single Olympics.
At least one competitor is already anointing Stolz, a seven-time world champ who’s just 21— and only halfway through the Olympic program in Milan—the best ever. “I think Jordan's the greatest speedskater of all-time,” says Canada’s Laurent Dubreuil, who briefly held the Olympic record on Saturday, with a time of 34.26 seconds. But three pairs later, Stolz and de Boo both broke the 34-second barrier. Dubreuil finished with the bronze.
“Not a lot of guys open faster than him, and all those that do just die after 3[00], 400 meters,” says Dubreuil. “And he's the huge favorite for the 1,500. If I raced a 1,500, I would finish last and wouldn't even probably medal against the women. Because I'm training for 500. I'm just a sprinter. He's good at everything. That's what's incredible. His ability to put power in the ice when all the other top sprinters are dead. It's unbelievable to watch, but it's not something I think we can copy. He’s just physically superior to us.”
After receiving his gold atop the podium, Stolz walked underneath the stands and embraced Heiden, who was at the race—as was Simone Biles, another GOAT. He also hugged his parents, Dirk and Jane, and his older sister Hannah. Stolz showed his family his newest hardware.
Hannah, older by a year, and Jordan both started skating on their family’s backyard frozen pond in Kewaskum, Wisconsin, after the 2010 Olympics; they loved watching Apolo Ohno at those Games. By all accounts, Hannah was the better skater at first. They competed with each other on the pond, and on hunting and fishing trips. Hannah stopped skating, however, and pursued bird taxidermy. She’s won a national taxidermy title and placed third at a recent world championship.
She’s still competing with little bro. “When I got third in the world championships with taxidermy, my medal and plaque was bigger than all of his World Championship medals,” says Hannah. “And heavier up until he got these gold medals. I wish I would have brought my medal, because we could compare them and really figure out whose is actually bigger. But I think this might have me on the weight.”
Backstage after the race, Heiden joked that he was thankful Stolz won’t suit up for the team pursuit, ensuring that Stolz can’t leave with more than four golds, thus keeping Heiden’s record intact. “Well, makes me want to do it now,” Stolz quipped back, when relayed Heiden’s remarks.
Heiden is widely regarded as the GOAT of his sport, a sort of Michael Jordan-like figure on the ice. But if people like Dubreuil want to throw Stolz in that conversation, it appears Heiden himself wouldn’t object.
“I'm proud to be mentioned in the same sentence as Jordan Stolz,” says Heiden. “That kid’s a stud.”

Syria says talks with Israel aim to stop interference, not accept terms imposed by force in south
Foreign Minister Asaad al-Shaibani says negotiations seek Israeli withdrawal from areas entered after fall of Assad regime and end to strikes and airspace violations
ISTANBUL
Syria’s foreign minister said talks with Israel are aimed at ending Israeli interference and military actions in southern Syria, not at accepting a new reality imposed by force.
Speaking at a panel discussion at the Munich Security Conference, Asaad al-Shaibani said Syria had adopted a “realistic path” towards Israel focused on reconstruction and national recovery following the Dec. 8, 2024 fall of the Assad regime.
He said that since then, Syria has faced more than 1,000 Israeli airstrikes targeting civilian and military facilities, as well as ground incursions and new territorial advances in the south.
Damascus chose diplomacy to address the situation and, with US support, brought Israel to direct negotiations, he added.
“These negotiations will not lead to accepting the fait accompli imposed by Israel in southern Syria,” he said. “Their outcome should be Israel’s withdrawal from areas it entered after Dec. 8, an end to interference in Syria’s internal affairs, and a halt to airspace violations.”
He added that security must be mutual. “Whoever seeks to preserve their own security must also respect the security of others,” he said, adding that Syria remains open in this regard.
Asked whether the current Israeli government is responsive to these demands, Shaibani said Israel is overstating perceived threats.
“I believe this approach is a mistake,” he said. “The policy you pursue could become the greatest risk to yourself.” He added that Israel would not be able to evade “Syria’s realistic approach.”
The top Syrian diplomat also cited US support for security discussions, mentioning President Donald Trump and Washington’s backing of talks.
Israeli forces have been carrying out near-daily incursions into Syrian territory, particularly in rural areas of Quneitra, detaining civilians, setting up checkpoints, questioning those passing through, and destroying farmland.
The developments came despite an agreement reached by Syria and Israel on Jan. 6 to establish a US-supervised communication mechanism aimed at coordinating information sharing, reducing military escalation, engaging diplomatically, and exploring trade opportunities.
After the fall of the Assad regime, Israel expanded its occupation of Syria’s Golan Heights by seizing the demilitarized buffer zone in violation of a 1974 disengagement agreement.
Syrians say the continued Israeli violations are undermining efforts to restore stability and hindering government attempts to attract investment to improve the country’s economy.

Children playing in a forest near Jerusalem discovered what appeared to be human skeletal remains Friday evening, police said on Saturday.
The remains were found in a wooded area adjacent to the Pisgat Ze’ev neighborhood in northern Jerusalem shortly before the start of the Jewish Sabbath.
According to police, the children told their father about the bones they had found, and he alerted authorities.
Officers who searched the scene located additional evidence, including a foreign passport. Police said they are examining whether there is any connection between the passport and the remains.
The human remains and other items recovered at the scene were transferred to the National Center for Forensic Medicine in Tel Aviv for examination and identification, police said.

Four new astronauts arrive via SpaceX rocket at International Space Station

The International Space Station (ISS) returned to full strength with Saturday’s arrival of four new astronauts to replace colleagues who bailed early because of health concerns.
SpaceX delivered the US, French and Russian astronauts a day after launching them from Cape Canaveral.
Last month’s medical evacuation was Nasa’s first in 65 years of human spaceflight. One of four astronauts launched by SpaceX last summer suffered what officials described as a serious health issue, prompting their hasty return. That left only three crew members to keep the place running – one American and two Russians – prompting Nasa to pause spacewalks and trim research.
Moving in for eight to nine months are Nasa’s Jessica Meir and Jack Hathaway, France’s Sophie Adenot, and Russia’s Andrei Fedyaev. Meir, a marine biologist, and Fedyaev, a former military pilot, have visited the ISS before. During her first space station visit in 2019, Meir took part in the first all-female spacewalk.
Adenot, a military helicopter pilot, is only the second French woman to visit space. Hathaway is a captain in the US navy.
“Bonjour!” Adenot called out once the capsule had docked to the space station 277 miles (446km) up.
French president Emmanuel Macron offered support to Adenot in a social media post: “In space as on Earth, it is by uniting our strengths that we accomplish the extraordinary.”
A couple of hours later, the hatches swung open and the seven space travelers hugged and exchanged exuberant high-fives. “Let’s get rolling,” Meir said.
Nasa has refused to divulge the identity of the astronaut who fell ill in orbit on 7 January or explain what happened, citing medical privacy. The ailing astronaut and three others returned to Earth more than a month sooner than planned. They spent their first night back on Earth at a hospital before returning to Houston.
The space agency said it did not alter its preflight medical checks for their replacements.

US House speaker blames Democrats for partial shutdown at Homeland Security Department

US House speaker blames Democrats for partial shutdown at Homeland Security Department
Mike Johnson says Democrats are 'risking public safety,' but they object to funding ICE agents' aggressive tactics, which they say have left the public feeling traumatized and much less safe
WASHINGTON
US House Speaker Mike Johnson on Saturday accused Democrats of risking public safety amid a looming funding lapse for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), warning that essential services could be disrupted.
"Here we go again. The new Democrat shutdown -- this time of the Dept. of Homeland Security -- will hit some very important programs like FEMA disaster response, TSA (Transportation Safety Authority) security lines, and Coast Guard operations," Johnson said on the US social media platform X.
The partial government shutdown at the DHS began early Saturday after Congress did not pass a funding bill before the Friday midnight deadline, with Democrats blocking the measure, demanding reforms to DHS and especially its Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the agency whose aggressive crackdowns in US cities have met widespread opposition.
Johnson said that the shutdown would lead to delayed disaster assistance, airport disruptions, and weakened law enforcement capabilities.
"Democrats are once again risking public safety just to stage a pointless political stunt," he added.
The shutdown follows weeks of negotiations between Democrats and Republicans on reforms to immigration enforcement and oversight of agencies such as ICE and Customs and Border Protection (CBP).
Democrats demand stronger oversight of ICE
DHS is now the only federal agency without funding for the remainder of fiscal year 2026, which continues through Sept. 30, while lawmakers have already approved spending bills covering the rest of the government since a record-long shutdown ended in November.
The latest funding measure, passed at the end of January, gave DHS a two-week extension to allow Congress additional time to negotiate changes to the agency’s immigration enforcement practices -- a stipulation pushed by Senate Democrats following the killing of two Americans by ICE agents in the state of Minnesota in January.
Democrats have insisted on stronger oversight and tighter limits on immigration enforcement -- including banning the use of masks by ICE officers, requiring body cameras to remain on, and mandating visible identification -- as a condition for supporting the funding bill.
They say ICE agents were deployed to American cities in the name of "public safety," but instead have left the public feeling terrorized, traumatized, and much less safe.
As Republicans have rejected the Democrats’ demands and called them "unreasonable," the Senate failed to advance a measure Thursday to fund the department, with lawmakers in both chambers leaving Washington without a deal.
The funding lapse affects DHS and its constellation of agencies, including the Secret Service and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).
Without funding, many of the workers deemed essential will be forced to work without pay, or furloughed, while others will be told to stay home.
But two of the agencies that have stoked Democratic furor amid President Donald Trump's migrant crackdown, ICE and CBP, are unlikely to suffer major operational effects from the partial shutdown through Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which was passed last year.
Lawmakers are expected to resume negotiations in an effort to end the partial shutdown, though there was no immediate indication of when a vote might occur.
If the partial shutdown drags on, tens of thousands of federal workers could be required to continue to work without pay, while some agencies might be compelled to scale back staffing levels until funding is restored.

Washington wants 'stable, respectful' relationship with Beijing: Senior US defense official
US seeks to avoid conflict, wants to engage in mutually beneficial commerce with China, says Elbridge Colby
ISTANBUL
Washington wants a "stable and respectful" relationship with Beijing, a senior US defense official said Saturday at the Munich Security Conference.
Elbridge Colby, US under secretary of defense for policy, said that while Washington seeks to avoid conflict, it also wants to engage in mutually beneficial commerce. “But we obviously recognize … that we need to do that from a position of strength,” he said.
He also said that Washington “understands and respects” Beijing's accomplishments and military buildup, towards which the US is “acting accordingly.”
“We are looking at it clear in a clear-eyed way” with the goal of achieving a favorable balance of power and stability, he said.
On the 2026 US National Security Strategy not mentioning Taiwan, he said US President Donald Trump “is actually quite consistent with our traditional position one-China policy position.”
“We are seeking stability, a willingness to engage, but also clarity and strength and we're all about building up a position of strength” in the Pacific, he said.
The US needs to work with allies, particularly in the Indo-Pacific, to “build up a position of collective strength,” Colby added.
On a new phase for NATO, he said Washington is now pushing “NATO 3.0.”
It involves “a couple of things,” including “flexible realism ... a refocusing on, in a sense, going back to … NATO as a military alliance,” he said.
Refocusing the military is critical for the “homeland hemisphere,” he said. “Obviously, a lot of that is not the military domain, but it is a critical part of that supply chain and stability there – deterring China through strength, not confrontation.”
Colby also said modern conflicts would be “wars of production,” stressing the importance of manufacturing capacity.
“We need to have a defense industry that can produce for ourselves and for our allies," Colby said, also extending support for US allies growing their defense industrial base.

MOSCOW, February 14. /TASS/. The United States is trying to prevent the destruction of Western civilization by European bureaucrats, Kirill Dmitriev, the head of the Russian Direct Investment Fund and special representative of the Russian president, said on his social media page.
"The US cares deeply and tries to prevent EU bureaucrats from destroying Western civilization. But EU bureaucrats are highly focused and skilled at destroying it through false narratives, migration, warmongering, and economic decline," the post reads.
In this way the Russian president's special representative commented on US Secretary of State Marco Rubio's speech on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference, in which he called Americans part of Western civilization.
"It's unclear who wins," Dmitriev added.
Previously he stated that European leaders are reconsidering their approach to resolving the conflict in Ukraine because they fear cooperation between Russia and the United States.

Cuba postpones its annual cigar fair as a US oil siege causes severe fuel shortages and blackouts
Organizers say Cuba’s annual cigar fair, which was set to be held the last week of February, has been postponed
- Bookmark
Cuba’s annual cigar fair, which was set to be held the last week of February, has been postponed organizers said Saturday, as the island faces blackouts and severe fuel shortages brought about by a U.S oil embargo.
In a statement, the cigar fair’s organizer, Habanos S.A. said it decided to postpone the iconic event to “preserve its high standard of quality.”
Habanos S.A., a joint venture between the state-owned company Cubatabaco and international firm Altadis, holds the global monopoly on Cuban cigar sales.
Every year, the company hosts the annual Habanos Festival, a key event for cigar aficionados and distributors worldwide, where attendees tour tobacco plantations, participate in auctions and witness the latest in craftsmanship.
The statement by Habanos S.A. did not set a new date for the 26th edition of the cigar fair.
Last year, the event closed with an auction in which $18 million was paid for a batch of highly coveted, hand rolled cigars. The company last year also reported record sales of $827 million.
Several cultural events, including a book fair, have been postponed in Cuba this month as the island grapples with the most severe fuel shortages and power blackouts in years.
In late January, U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to impose tariffs on any country that sold oil to Cuba, as Washington puts more pressure on the island’s communist leadership to implement political and economic reforms.
Cuba imports about 60% of its energy supply, and had long relied on Venezuela and Mexico for much of its oil.
But shipments from Venezuela were canceled in January following the removal of that nation’s then-president Nicolas Maduro in a U.S. military raid, a move that also resulted in greater U.S. oversight over Venezuela’s oil industry.
Shipments from Mexico stopped in mid-February following Trump’s tariff threat.
Earlier this week, three Canadian airlines canceled flights to Cuba after the island’s government announced there would be no jet fuel for planes seeking to refuel at Cuba’s airports. Other airlines have maintained their flights to the island but will be refueling their planes with stopovers in the Dominican Republic.
The fuel shortages have also hurt tourism on the island, with some agencies canceling trips as the government shuts down some hotels, and relocates tourists in a bid to save electricity.
Tabacuba, a state-run tobacco company, lamented the postponement of this year's cigar fair in a statement, saying it had come about due to “the complex economic situation that the nation is facing, as a result of the intensification of the economic, commercial and financial blockade” imposed by the United States.

Over 100 artists for Palestine back UN’s Albanese after resignation calls
France and Germany call for UN special rapporteur for occupied Palestinian territory, Francesca Albanese, to step down over her critical comments.
More than 100 prominent artists – including musicians, actors and writers – have signed an open letter in support of the United Nations special rapporteur for occupied Palestinian territory who faces international calls to step down.
In a letter from the group Artists for Palestine on Saturday, the signatories offered “full support to Francesca Albanese, a defender of human rights and, therefore, also of the Palestinian people’s right to exist”.

“There are infinitely more of us in every corner of the Earth who want force no longer to be the law. Who know what the word ‘law’ truly means,” the letter said.
Among the supporters were actors Mark Ruffalo and Javier Bardem, Nobel Prize-winning author Annie Ernaux and British musician Annie Lennox.
At last week’s Al Jazeera Forum, Albanese, an outspoken critic of Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza, said “we as humanity have a common enemy”, but a fake video that was later debunked had her accusing Israel of being the “common enemy”.
She later explained in a social media post she was referencing “the system that has enabled the genocide in Palestine” as the “common enemy”.
‘Crush any criticism of Israel’
Still, European countries, including France and Germany, continue to call for her removal.
On Tuesday, a group of French lawmakers sent a letter to Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot condemning Albanese’s remarks as “anti-Semitic”. A day later, Barrot called on her to step down, saying France “unreservedly condemns the outrageous and reprehensible remarks”.
On Thursday, German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul called her position “untenable”.
Frank Barat, an author and film producer, said French President Emmanuel Macron and Barrot have repeatedly said they support international law “while the facts show the complete opposite”.
Albanese has highlighted for the past two years that under international law, “states have a duty to act to prevent genocide, and they’ve been failing completely” in Gaza, Barat told Al Jazeera.
“Because Francesca has been highlighting this hypocrisy, she’s been targeted by most Western governments. The political agenda of these governments is to crush any criticism of Israel. We’ve seen it in the streets of Europe. We’ve seen it in the streets of the US,” he added.
People who have spoken out against Israel’s war on Palestine are “criminalised while the perpetrators of genocide continue to be let go“, Barat said.
Marta Hurtado, a spokesperson for the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, said at a news briefing on Friday that her colleagues are “very worried” about the backlash against Albanese.
“We are concerned that UN officials, independent experts and judicial officials are increasingly subjected to personal attacks, threats and misinformation that distracts from the serious human rights issues,” Hurtado said.
Nearly 600 Palestinians have been killed by Israel in Gaza since an October 10 “ceasefire” alone. At least 72,000 Palestinians have been killed and 171,000 wounded in Israel’s war since October 2023

Herzog demands answers from Netanyahu after Trump pardon broadside

President Isaac Herzog is seeking clarification from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu following sharp criticism directed at him by U.S. President Donald Trump, a day after Trump met with Netanyahu in Washington.
Trump said Thursday called Herzog “disgraceful” for not granting Netanyahu a pardon in his ongoing corruption trial. Herzog’s office said the president wants to know whether Netanyahu was behind the remarks, which officials described as a serious affront to Israel’s sovereign institutions.
Sources close to Herzog said that if it emerges that Netanyahu encouraged Trump to make the comments, it would constitute a “red line.”
“There is a difference between criticism and insult, and what we heard from Trump was an insult. Someone clearly stirred him up,” one official said. “Over the weekend, the president received dozens of inquiries from the United States and Israel, and there was a need to seek clarification from Netanyahu.”
Herzog’s office emphasized that the demand for clarification is public and that it wants to understand whether Netanyahu asked Trump to issue such pointed criticism. “Do Trump’s remarks that President Herzog is irrelevant and that the Israeli public should be ashamed of him reflect the position of Netanyahu’s own office?” an official said.
ynet has learned that contacts took place over the weekend between Herzog and American officials. Herzog was said to have been stunned by Trump’s comments, which came while he was on a return flight to Israel from a visit to Australia.
Officials in Herzog’s circle said they suspect Netanyahu may have encouraged Trump’s remarks and are also questioning whether there was any “quid pro quo” in exchange for the public criticism.
On Thursday, a day after meeting Netanyahu, Trump launched an unprecedented attack on Herzog. “Bibi's been a great wartime prime minister,” Trump said, using Netanyahu's nickname. “The president of Israel, the primary power he's got is the power to give pardons, and he’s not [doing it]. He said he’s given it five different times, but he doesn’t want to do it because I guess he loses his power. I think the people of Israel should really shame him. He's disgraceful for not giving it. He should give it.”
On Friday, Trump reiterated his position when asked whether he believed Netanyahu would receive a pardon. “I think so,” he said.
People who have spoken with Netanyahu said they assess his chances of receiving a pardon from Herzog as relatively low, around 30%. It is possible Trump was aware of that assessment when he made his remarks.
In November, Netanyahu submitted a formal request for a pardon to Herzog. The President’s Residence described it as an unusual request with significant implications.
The submission included two documents: a detailed letter signed by Netanyahu’s attorney and a separate letter signed by the prime minister.
According to the request, the grounds for a pardon are “the good of the state,” which Netanyahu argues would allow him to manage state affairs effectively. The document states that Netanyahu believes the legal proceedings, if carried through to their conclusion, would result in a full acquittal.
“He has had and continues to have substantial criticism of the conduct of law enforcement authorities in handling his case, matters that have been proven and continue to be proven in court,” the request said, adding that for years Netanyahu had been determined to prove his claims through all lawful means available to him.

Madagascar declares Cyclone Gezani a national disaster
Storm kills 43, destroys thousands of homes as government calls for climate resilience
LUSAKA, Zambia
Madagascar on Saturday declared Cyclone Gezani a national disaster after the storm killed 43 people and caused widespread destruction across the Indian Ocean island nation.
Prime Minister Rajaonarivelo Heritsalama said in the capital, Antananarivo, that the cyclone had affected the country’s economy and people’s lives. He said the government would focus on strengthening resilience to mitigate the impact of climate change in the future.
According to statistics released Saturday by Madagascar’s disaster agency, the cyclone claimed 43 lives across 25 districts in five regions. A total of 427 people were injured and six were reported missing.
The agency said 357,014 homes were destroyed, 16,428 people were displaced and 42,219 buildings were damaged.
France, the United States, the European Union and the United Nations have led humanitarian relief efforts, providing food and medical supplies.
Madagascar is one of Africa’s most storm-prone countries and is still grappling with the effects of Tropical Cyclone Fytia, which struck a fortnight ago, killing seven people and affecting more than 54,000 others.

Rubio says Europe and US 'belong together'
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio sought to reassure a nervous Europe on Saturday, saying Washington wanted to recharge the transatlantic alliance so a strong Europe could help the United States on its mission of global "renewal".
Speaking at a security conference in Munich after months of turmoil in US-European relations sparked by President Donald Trump's vows to seize Greenland and his often derisive remarks about allies, Washington's top diplomat struck a markedly soothing tone.
"We do not seek to separate, but to revitalise an old friendship and renew the greatest civilisation in human history," Rubio said, calling for "a reinvigorated alliance".
"We want Europe to be strong," Rubio said, adding that the continent and the United States "belong together."
He echoed the Trump administration's oft-stated assertion that immigration poses a threat, saying that "mass migration" is "a crisis which is transforming and destabilising societies all across the West".
He said Europe and the United States were "heirs to the same great and noble civilisation" and that he hoped Europe "together with us are willing and able to defend it".
Change in tone
Aside from immigration, Rubio otherwise largely avoided the MAGA flashpoint and culture-war issues that German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said Friday had deepened a "rift" between US and Europe.
Rubio's speech marked a sharp contrast to that of US Vice President JD Vance a year ago, when he used the same stage to attack European policies on a range of issues including free speech, shocking European allies.
The Trump administration has also charged that Europe faces a "civilisational decline", and has courted far-right parties on the continent.
Ties plunged last month when Trump stepped up threats to annex Greenland, an autonomous territory of NATO member Denmark, forcing European nations to stand firm in protest.
Rubio was on Sunday due to travel to Slovakia and Hungary, European countries run by nationalist leaders endorsed by Trump.
Some breathed a sigh of relief after Rubio's speech, with Estonia's Defence Minister Hanno Pevkur telling AFP: "It was needed to show that we are still allies and partners."
But others said they did not mark a shift in the US stance, with former Lithuanian foreign minister Gabrielius Landsbergis saying: "It was simply delivered in more polite terms. I am not sure the white paint will hold."
European security
European leaders at the Munich Security Conference have pledged to shoulder more of the burden of shared NATO defences, saying this was essential for Europe to counter a hostile Russia.
European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen told the gathering that "Europe needs to step up and has to take on its responsibility" for its security, including closer ties with Britain 10 years after Brexit.
British leader Keir Starmer echoed the sentiment, saying, "We must build our hard power, because that is the currency of the age," and calling to build "a shared industrial base across Europe which can turbocharge our defence production".
NATO chief Mark Rutte told reporters that although France and Britain, Europe's only nuclear powers, have discussed greater cooperation to make their nuclear deterrence stronger, "nobody is arguing in Europe to do this as a sort of replacement of the nuclear umbrella of the United States."
Ukraine war
The high-powered Munich meeting of government leaders, diplomats, defence and intelligence chiefs comes shortly before Russia's full-scale war on Ukraine is set to enter its fifth gruelling year.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky decried that political efforts to end the war have not worked.
"Weapons evolve faster than political decisions meant to stop them," he said, calling for speedier arms deliveries for Ukraine's Western-supplied air defence systems.
He said that "there is not a single power plant in Ukraine that is not damaged by Russian strikes," after Russia stepped up its attacks on infrastructure over the past few months, as the coldest snap since the war started in February 2022 hit the country.
"No one in Ukraine believes (Russian President Vladimir Putin) will ever let our people go, but he will not let other European nations go either, because he cannot let go of the very idea of war," Zelensky warned.
At the White House on Friday, Trump urged Kyiv to "get moving" to end the war. "Russia wants to make a deal... (Zelensky) has to move," he said.
But Rubio - who met Zelensky on the sidelines in Munich - said on Saturday: "We don't know if the Russians are serious about ending the war."

Passenger ferry capsizes in Sudan’s White Nile state, 4 rescued
Search continues for 12 missing as doctors group urges safety review
ISTANBUL
A passenger ferry carrying 16 people capsized Saturday in Sudan’s White Nile state, with four survivors rescued and search operations underway for the remaining passengers, the Sudan Doctors Network said.
The group said the boat sank in the Wad al-Zaki area with 16 people aboard, including women. Rescue efforts were continuing to determine the fate of the other passengers, it said.
The Sudan Doctors Network urged authorities to review all riverboats and ferries, enforce safety requirements, set clear load limits and ensure the availability of rescue equipment to prevent further accidents.
The incident comes days after at least 21 people were killed when a passenger ferry carrying more than 27 people capsized in the Nile River in northern Sudan, according to local authorities.
The Nile River state government said Thursday that 21 bodies had been recovered after the boat sank Wednesday, and that search efforts were continuing for those still missing.
Local media reported that the vessel was traveling between Taiba Al-Khawad and Deim Al-Qarray in the Shendi locality when it capsized, carrying women, children and elderly passengers.
At the time, the Sudan Doctors Network said the tragedy underscored the vulnerability of river transport and the lack of basic safety measures, as well as the absence of local authorities and civil defense teams in the initial hours, “which exacerbated the scale of the disaster.”

Boy, 16, charged with murder after teenager stabbed in Feltham
Maliki Sharma has been described as a ‘lovely boy’ who had hopes of becoming an electrician

A 16-year-old boy has been charged with murder after an 18-year-old man was stabbed to death in north-west London.
Metropolitan Police officers were called to Victoria Road, Feltham, ar around 5pm on 12 January where they found Maliki Sharma with multiple stab wounds.
He was taken to hospital but was pronounced dead, with his family now being supported by specialist officers.
Three teenagers have since been arrested in connection, with one boy from Hounslow charged with murder on Friday.
The boy, who cannot be named due to his age, appeared at Willesden Magistrates’ Court on Saturday and has been remanded into custody to appear at the Old Bailey on Tuesday.
A spokesperson for the family described Maliki as a “lovely boy” who was close to his mother and older brother.
He said: “It’s just devastating, it’s absolutely devastating. He was such a funny, kind, caring, lovely young man. He had his whole life ahead of him.”
Mr Sharma was a student at West Thames College, where he was training to become an electrician. The family friend said: “He wanted to go down that route – get a trade, do his own business, so that he could look after his mum, that’s what he always said.”
He added: “He really, really was a lovely boy. He was cheeky, funny.”
Two other 16-year-old boys, also from Hounslow, were charged with conspiracy to commit grievous bodily harm and have been remanded into youth detention.
Rhys Huskinson, 19, of North Road, Feltham was charged on Wednesday with affray and possession of an offensive weapon in connection with the investigation.
Police said that following further inquiries, the charges have been amended to attempted grievous bodily harm.
Detective Chief Inspector Allam Bhangoo, who is leading this investigation, said: “My thoughts remain with Maliki’s friends and family during this unimaginably difficult time.
“We understand that this incident has been distressing for the local community and residents can expect to see an increased police presence over the coming days.”

IDF strikes gunmen who approached troops in north Gaza after emerging from tunnel
In ‘blatant’ truce violation, military says at least 5 armed terror operatives entered damaged building on Israeli side of ceasefire line before being targeted in airstrike
Emanuel (Mannie) Fabian is The Times of Israel's military correspondent
A group of at least five armed Palestinian terror operatives on Saturday evening emerged from a tunnel and approached troops in the northern Gaza Strip, on the Israeli side of a ceasefire line, the military said.
The Israel Defense Forces said the incident in the Beit Hanoun area was a “blatant violation” of the ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas, hinting that it would respond. In past incidents of attacks on troops in Gaza amid the ceasefire, the IDF has launched waves of strikes against Hamas and allied terror groups.
In a statement, the IDF said soldiers monitoring surveillance cameras identified the gunmen coming out of an underground site and entering a damaged building on the Israeli side of the Yellow Line — demarcating where the military pulled back to in the Strip — near troops of the Gaza Division’s Northern Brigade who were stationed in the area.
An Israeli Air Force drone then struck the building, killing at least two of the gunmen, the military said, adding that additional operatives were likely also killed in the strike.
The IDF published footage showing the gunmen and the strike.
Troops were continuing to scan the area “to locate and eliminate the terrorists who may remain,” the IDF said.

“The IDF views any attempt by terror organizations in the Gaza Strip to carry out terror attacks against IDF troops and civilians of the State of Israel gravely,” the army added.
Since the start of the ceasefire in October, the IDF has said it has killed dozens of terror operatives and other suspects who have crossed the Yellow Line and approached troops. Such incidents have taken place on a near-daily basis.
Earlier Saturday, the IDF said that a Palestinian who crossed the ceasefire line in the Jabalia area of northern Gaza was killed by troops.
According to the military, the terror operative crossed the Yellow Line and approached soldiers of the Northern Brigade “in a manner that posed an immediate threat.”
“Immediately after identification, the forces eliminated the terrorist to remove the threat,” the IDF said.
The US-brokered ceasefire plan reached in October foresees the demilitarization of Gaza and the disarmament of Hamas, as well as the withdrawal of Israeli troops from the enclave. The terror group, however, has not agreed to give up its weapons.
Even with fighting officially halted, near-daily incidents have occurred along the ceasefire line, with Israel accusing Hamas of violating its terms and the terror group making counterclaims.
During a visit to Gaza on Friday, IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir said the military would not give up on the war objective of demilitarizing the Strip and disarming Hamas, while also confirming that the army has such plans ready to go if the government orders it.
“During the war, we achieved an unprecedented accomplishment: all of Hamas’s frontline battalions were destroyed. Hamas was militarily defeated, and all the hostages returned home,” Zamir said in the Rafah area, according to remarks published by the IDF.
“The IDF is deployed along a security border — the Yellow Line — controls the gateways to the Strip, and is systematically clearing the area of terror infrastructure,” he continued.
Zamir said the IDF is “prepared to shift from defense to offense,” and “will respond to any violation.”
“We are not giving up on the war’s objective, the full demilitarization of the Gaza Strip and the disarmament of Hamas,” he said.
“We are acting in accordance with the directives of the political echelon, while also holding decisive military plans and are prepared to act offensively as required,” Zamir said.
This week, The Times of Israel reported that the IDF had drawn up plans for a renewed offensive in Gaza aimed at disarming Hamas.
“There is no immunity for terror. What applies to Gaza also applies to the other arenas. We will continue to remain focused and cut down threats, with determination and in an offensive manner,” Zamir added.

Four new astronauts arrive at the International Space Station to replace NASA's evacuated crew
The International Space Station is back to full strength with the arrival of four new astronauts
- Bookmark
The International Space Station returned to full strength with Saturday’s arrival of four new astronauts to replace colleagues who bailed early because of health concerns.
SpaceX delivered the U.S., French and Russian astronauts a day after launching them from Cape Canaveral.
Last month’s medical evacuation was NASA’s first in 65 years of human spaceflight. One of four astronauts launched by SpaceX last summer suffered what officials described as a serious health issue, prompting their hasty return. That left only three crew members to keep the place running — one American and two Russians — prompting NASA to pause spacewalks and trim research.
Moving in for eight to nine months are NASA’s Jessica Meir and Jack Hathaway, France’s Sophie Adenot and Russia’s Andrei Fedyaev. Meir, a marine biologist, and Fedyaev, a former military pilot, have lived up there before. During her first station visit in 2019, Meir took part in the first all-female spacewalk.
Adenot, a military helicopter pilot, is only the second French woman to fly in space. Hathaway is a captain in the U.S. Navy.
NASA has refused to divulge the identity of the astronaut who fell ill in orbit on Jan. 7 or explain what happened, citing medical privacy. The ailing astronaut and three others returned to Earth more than a month sooner than planned. They spent their first night back on Earth at the hospital before returning to Houston.
The space agency said it did not alter its preflight medical checks for their replacements.

Voices: Keir Starmer is right to embrace our European future
United Kingdom
Unknown Publisher
2026-02-14
20:15:19 GMT
05:15:19 KST

The prime minister is to be congratulated on his clear-sighted speech to the Munich Security Conference. In unscripted remarks referring to questions about his leadership at home, he claimed that he had “ended the week much stronger than I started it”. If that is true, let us hope that he has the strength to deliver the closer cooperation with our European neighbours of which he spoke so eloquently.
The speech struck the right balance between resisting the bullying bluster of Donald Trump and acknowledging that Europe needs to do more to secure its own defence. Sir Keir Starmer reminded his audience that Nato members had defended each other’s sovereignty on the issue of Greenland. He reminded President Trump, again, that Nato members had come to the aid of the United States in Afghanistan – “at terrible cost to many in my country”.
But he also spoke of the need for “greater European autonomy”, while saying that it “does not herald US withdrawal, but answers the call for more burden-sharing in full, and remakes the ties that have served us so well”.
His warning of the threat of Vladimir Putin’s aggression may have been a little hyperbolic for some tastes. Sir Keir said: “In the 1930s, leaders were too slow to level with the public about the fundamental shift in mindset that was required.” That is true, and there is a similar absence of urgency today, but it is unwise to make comparisons with the Nazis.
President Putin is bad enough – as the evidence presented about the murder of Alexei Navalny confirmed – but he is not Hitler, and he does not pose a direct military threat to most European nations. Such exaggerations risk undermining, rather than reinforcing, the argument for higher defence spending that Sir Keir was right to make.
Sir Keir was justified in warning that “the peddlers of easy answers are ready on the extremes of left and right”, although it was evidence of weakness rather than strength that he used his platform in Munich to attack the Green Party and Reform for being “soft on Russia and weak on Nato”.
Better to make the case for stronger European defence, and to let the British people make up their own minds about how serious Zack Polanski and Nigel Farage are about addressing it.
The bulk of the speech made a good argument for greater European defence cooperation. Indeed, Sir Keir’s speechwriter should be commended for resolutely avoiding the usual clichés. “To break the convention of a thousand speeches,” the prime minister said, “we are not at a crossroads today – the road ahead is straight and it is clear.”
He called for “a generational shift in defence industrial cooperation”, and said that “this includes looking again at closer economic alignment”. He is absolutely right that Britain should be closer to the European Union on both defence and economics, and indeed on the economics of the defence industry. As he said, “The prize here is greater security, stronger growth for the UK and the EU, which will fuel increased defence spending, and the chance to place the UK at the centre of a wave of European industrial renewal.”
This has implications for domestic politics, of course. As Sir Keir also said, “We are not the Britain of the Brexit years any more. Because we know that, in a dangerous world, we would not take control by turning inward – we would surrender it.”
But it would be a mistake to try to reopen the arguments of the EU referendum 10 years later. Sir Keir was right to focus most of his speech on making the positive case for closer European cooperation – and to let his domestic audience draw its own conclusions.

Volatile Ramadan begins amid Iran tensions, Temple Mount dispute
Unknown
Unknown Publisher

05:12:53 KST

After two years in which Ramadan passed relatively quietly under the shadow of war, Israeli security officials now warn that this year's observances could prove especially volatile. The central concern is a combination of lone-wolf terrorist attacks, renewed activity by Hamas and other terrorist organizations' infrastructure in Judea and Samaria, and the potential for broader unrest among a frustrated Palestinian public.
Many Palestinians had expected a return to normal life following the end of fighting in Gaza. That expectation, security officials believe, has not been met, deepening public disappointment and anger.
Israeli officials describe this year's "entry angle" into Ramadan as more troubling than in recent years. Two years ago, shortly after the outbreak of the war, Ramadan remained relatively calm amid widespread Palestinian concern over a harsh Israeli response. Last year, the month fell shortly after the IDF launched a large-scale operation in refugee camps in northern Samaria, a move that deterred terrorists and disrupted their operations.
This year, despite a relatively low number of significant attacks in recent months, the assessment is that friction potential is higher.
Iran, the Temple Mount and settlement moves
One major factor is the timing of Ramadan, which coincides with growing reports of a possible US strike on Iran. Security officials say Tehran has recently intensified efforts to transfer weapons and funds and to recruit terrorist operatives in Judea and Samaria, intending to activate them when ordered.
There is concern that a direct confrontation with the Islamic Republic of Iran could inflame the Palestinian street, already on edge, particularly if Tehran's proxies, including Hezbollah and the Houthis, join the fighting.
At the same time, recent decisions by Israel's political leadership have been poorly received among Palestinians in Judea and Samaria. The decision not to lower the minimum age for Muslim worshippers permitted to enter the Temple Mount during Ramadan, and not to increase the quota of entrants, has sparked anger. Many Palestinians had expected broader easing of restrictions following the end of the Gaza war and a return to policies in place before October 7.
Tensions are also fueled by renewed talk in Israel of annexation and by a government decision to reestablish the community of Sa-Nur in northern Samaria. The government has said that the renewed presence there will take place by the Jewish holiday of Purim, which this year falls during Ramadan, a convergence that adds to the strain.
Economic despair and security concerns
The economic situation in Judea and Samaria adds another layer of pressure. Unemployment, which stood at about 13% before the war, has risen to roughly 29%. Israel is not currently permitting Palestinian laborers to return to work inside its territory. Palestinian officials and residents speak of growing economic despair, compounded by a sense of political stagnation.
The delay in moving to phase two of the Gaza framework has also affected public sentiment in Judea and Samaria. Many had anticipated a different reality by now, and disappointment is mounting. This is compounded by the presence of hundreds of terrorists released in hostage exchange deals over the past two years. Experience following the 2011 Gilad Schalit deal showed that many released prisoners returned to terrorist activity in various forms. Security officials fear that heightened religious fervor during Ramadan, combined with the physical strain of fasting, could accelerate radicalization processes.
Officials also point to a recent rise in what they describe as "hate crimes" by elements within the Jewish population. Increased friction raises the risk of casualties, and a single "successful" attack could further destabilize the situation.
Tension mounts as IDF reinforces
Although no large-scale, successful terrorist attacks have been recorded recently, largely due to ongoing counterterrorism operations, data from recent weeks show an uptick in stone-throwing and Molotov cocktail attacks, seen as an indication of renewed agitation on the ground.
The IDF is preparing for Ramadan with reinforced forces. The Commando Brigade is expected to operate in the sector and remain on immediate standby for any incident. The Judea and Samaria Division will receive several additional companies, mainly in the seam zone and at crossings around Jerusalem. Security officials anticipate attempts to infiltrate into Israeli territory with the aim of reaching the Temple Mount. The Israel Police's Judea and Samaria District is also bolstering its presence along the seam line.
Over the past week, the division intensified operations, arresting 104 suspects and seizing nine weapons, including a machine gun, a shotgun, a long gun, two pistols, a hunting weapon and an M-16 rifle, as well as two airsoft guns. Authorities also confiscated terror funds totaling 1,560 shekels, 15,430 shekels and 2,200 dinars, along with gold worth approximately 3 million shekels and a BMW vehicle valued at around 200,000 shekels.
The IDF has stressed that operational activity will continue as usual during Ramadan, unlike in previous years when non-urgent operations were reduced out of consideration for the fasting month. A significant test is expected this coming Friday, the first Friday of Ramadan. The military will deploy reinforced forces, expressing hope that despite the destabilizing factors, the month will pass without escalation and without Israeli casualties.

Trump shares furious rant about Bill Maher and gives bizarre details about dinner they had at White House
‘Sometimes in life you waste time!’ Trump said of his dinner with Maher last year
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
In a Valentine’s Day Truth Social message, President Donald Trump railed against “jerk” TV host Bill Maher for being “anti Trump” on his show, despite the two enjoying a “great dinner” together at the White House last year.
The president, who often uses his social media to lash out at late-night hosts, claimed he had indulged Maher’s request to have dinner at the White House, and even invited him to the White House Christmas Party, only to have Maher insult him on Real Time with Bill Maher.
“I’d much rather spend my time MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN than wasting it on him,” Trump wrote Saturday. “Bill continues to suffer from a severe case of Trump Derangement Syndrome (TDS!), and there is nothing that will ever be done to cure him of this very serious disease.”
Hitting at Maher, Trump said the late-night host was “extremely nervous” and “had ZERO confidence” when he met him last year in the Oval Office.
“To soothe his nerves, immediately, within seconds, asked for a ‘Vodka Tonic,’” Trump wrote, later calling Maher an “underrated lightweight.”
“I’ve never felt like this before, I’m actually scared,” Trump claimed Maher said to him. The president went on to say that Maher “seemed to be a nice guy” and was “very respectful” about their meeting.
However, his opinion on Maher seems to have changed after comments made on his show Friday evening, in which he mocked the president for writing on Truth Social that China will take over Canada and “terminate all ice hockey.”
“What the f***,” Maher said after reading Trump’s Truth Social post out loud. “I think this is the kinda thing that is causing his popularity to go down.”
The president insisted he “jokingly” remarked about China taking over Canada and terminating ice hockey.
“He went on and on about the Hockey statement, like ‘What kind of a person would say such a foolish thing as this,’ as though I were being serious when I said it,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.
Despite his frustration, Trump said he thought Maher was still “slightly more talented” than fellow late night hosts Jimmy Kimmel, Jimmy Fallon, or Stephen Colbert.
The Independent has asked Maher’s representative for comment.
Maher, known for his political satire, often uses his show to bring on a diverse group of voices in an effort to unify the country at a polarizing time.
Last year, Maher dined with Trump, alongside Kid Rock and Dana White, at the White House. Afterward, he gave a positive review of the president, calling him “gracious.”
But Trump appeared angry Saturday that Maher has returned to criticizing him and his administration, rather than acknowledging his perceived successes such as the Dow hitting 50,000 points and immigration agenda.
“Fortunately, his Television Ratings are so low that nobody will learn about his various Fake News statements about me,” Trump wrote.

Ukraine War Is “Killing Russia” – Rutte to MT

05:04:27 KST

MUNICH, Germany — The Russian people should know that the war is destroying their country and should do everything they can to stop it, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte told The Moscow Times.
Speaking on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference, the former Dutch prime minister discussed what the Russian people should know about their country’s leadership and place in the world as the Kremlin further restricts their access to the global information ecosystem by blocking Telegram and WhatsApp.
“In December, they lost 35,000 of their own men, and in January — 30,000,” he said, pointing to figures that Western officials say show that more Russians were killed in Ukraine than were recruited to fight in the same period.
These casualties “do not come from Moscow and St. Petersburg, so the elite may not immediately experience this,” Rutte said. “But this will come soon, because at this [rate] of so many people dying in action, it's unavoidable that it will also reach Moscow and St. Petersburg.
“I would say, ‘Do everything you can to stop this, because it is killing Russia. It is so bad for Russia’,” he said.
The conference took place the day after NATO defense ministers met in Brussels and announced another package of $500 million in military aid to Ukraine through the Prioritized Ukrainian Requirements List (PURL), which allows countries to buy U.S. weapons for Ukraine.
The figure included over $200 million from Britain to buy air defense missiles, as Russia continues targeting Ukraine’s cities and energy infrastructure.
On the main stage at Munich, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky thanked the U.S. and European countries for their support and said Ukraine was ready to strike a peace deal.
But he said that while Ukraine was willing to make concessions, he saw no evidence that Russia would.
Several speakers at the conference, including U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, openly doubted whether there was clear evidence Russia wanted to end the war.
In remarks to journalists ahead of his meeting with Rubio, Zelensky said he believed that Russia’s only goal in invading his country was its total occupation and it was a mistake to believe that ceding the Donbas to Russia would bring peace.
Not only does how the war ends look unclear, but so does the relationship Russia will have with the rest of the world.
“I'm afraid under the current leadership of Russia, a return to normal relations with the West is unlikely,” Polish Foreign Minister Radosław Sikorski told The Moscow Times on Friday. “Colonial wars, if you look historically, are only ended by a different team than started them.”
“Let’s have a peace deal first and then see what happens after that,” Rutte said. “But for NATO, it’s clear as we see things now, Russia is a long term threat to the whole of NATO’s territory.”
A Message from The Moscow Times:
Dear readers,
We are facing unprecedented challenges. Russia's Prosecutor General's Office has designated The Moscow Times as an "undesirable" organization, criminalizing our work and putting our staff at risk of prosecution. This follows our earlier unjust labeling as a "foreign agent."
These actions are direct attempts to silence independent journalism in Russia. The authorities claim our work "discredits the decisions of the Russian leadership." We see things differently: we strive to provide accurate, unbiased reporting on Russia.
We, the journalists of The Moscow Times, refuse to be silenced. But to continue our work, we need your help.
Your support, no matter how small, makes a world of difference. If you can, please support us monthly starting from just $2. It's quick to set up, and every contribution makes a significant impact.
By supporting The Moscow Times, you're defending open, independent journalism in the face of repression. Thank you for standing with us.

Rio police in 'Money Heist' and Jason masks apprehend Carnival phone thieves
Rio police are using costumes at Carnival to blend into street crowds and catch cellphone thieves
- Bookmark
Rio de Janeiro police officers kitted themselves out as thieves from the series “Money Heist” and as Jason Voorhees from the “Friday the 13th” horror movie franchise to blend in with crowds celebrating Carnival and catch criminals stealing cellphones.
Carnival officially kicked off on Friday in Rio, and for many revelers participating in the megalopolis’ raucous, dazzling street parties, one of the biggest concerns is holding on to their phones — as thefts are all too common.
To tackle this phenomenon, officers in the Santa Teresa neighborhood Friday donned costumes to fly under thieves’ radar. The undercover agents noticed a woman snatching a cellphone from someone’s hand, followed her and saw her hand the device to an accomplice, Rio’s civil police said in a statement Saturday.
Police arrested the pair and found five cellphones in their possession.
That wasn’t the first time Brazilian police officers wearing costumes have sought to mingle with the crowds during festivities to catch wrongdoers.
Last Sunday, police officers dressed as characters from “Ghostbusters” caught a woman with 12 cellphones stolen in downtown Sao Paulo. A day prior, officers in alien outfits caught a man with three phones hidden under his clothing.
Cellphone thefts have declined overall in Brazil, according to the 2025 annual report by the Brazilian Forum on Public Safety think-tank. They dropped from approximately 980,000 per year in 2022 to some 850,000 in 2024.
But fear of both armed robberies and discreet pocketing of cellphones remains high, and opinion polls consistently show that violence and crime are Brazilians’ main concern.

Wuthering Heights director addresses differences between film and novel
- Emerald Fennell has discussed the significant changes made in her film adaptation of Emily Brontë’s Wuthering Heights, primarily due to time constraints.
- The film, starring Jacob Elordi and Margot Robbie as Heathcliff and Catherine, focuses mainly on the first part of the novel and their tumultuous relationship.
- To streamline the narrative, Fennell cut characters such as Mr. Lockwood and Hindley, integrating aspects of Hindley's character into Earnshaw, portrayed by Martin Clunes.
- Earnshaw is depicted as a more prominent, drunken and abusive antagonist in the film, combining traits of a deeply loving yet cruel individual.
- The adaptation has received divided critical reception, with some praising it as “oozy and wild” while others, including The Independent, have called it an “astonishingly bad adaptation.”

Hungary’s Orban says EU bigger threat than Russia before April elections
‘Illiberal’ PM, endorsed by ally Trump this week, to receive US Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Sunday.
Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban says his country should fear the European Union more than Russia while promising to clear away the EU’s “oppressive machinery” before what looks will be heated parliamentary elections.
Delivering his annual state-of-the-nation speech on Saturday, Orban pledged to push out “the foreign influence that limits our sovereignty together with its agents” as the opposition Tisza Party maintains an 8 to 12 percentage point lead over Orban’s ruling Fidesz party eight weeks from the April 12 elections.

“Fear-mongering about [Russian President Vladimir] Putin is primitive and unserious. Brussels, however, is a palpable reality and a source of imminent danger,” said the 62-year-old leader, who compared the EU to the repressive Soviet regime that dominated Hungary for decades last century.
Since returning to power for a second time in 2010, Orban has waged a campaign against “pseudo-civil organisations”, “bought journalists”, judges and politicians in his drive to build what he calls an “illiberal state”.
His crackdown on immigration has provided a blueprint for right-wing leaders, such as United States President Donald Trump.
‘War or peace’?
In Saturday’s speech, Orban signalled his work of clearing liberal forces from the country is only “half-done”, noting that Trump, who is backing him to win the upcoming vote, “rebelled against the liberals’ global-scale business, media and political network, thereby improving our chances as well”.
On Friday, Trump posted a new endorsement of Orban on his Truth Social platform, saying he’s a “truly strong and powerful leader with a proven track record of delivering phenomenal results”.
The US president’s comments came as US Secretary of State Marco Rubio prepares to visit Hungary on Sunday. Rubio will fly in from the Munich Security Conference in Germany with a stopover in Slovakia for talks with nationalist Prime Minister Robert Fico.
Orban, who has cultivated warm relations with Putin during his current stretch in power, this week cast the April elections as a stark choice between “war or peace”, warning in a Facebook post that Peter Magyar’s Tisza Party would drag the country into the conflict raging next door in Ukraine.
The prime minister has doubled down on his strategy of portraying Magyar as a “Brussels puppet” with billboards depicting him saying “yes” to a demand for “Money for Ukraine!” from European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.

Iranian authorities have without prior warning transferred Nobel peace prize laureate Narges Mohammadi to a prison in the north of the country as concern grows over her health, her family said on Saturday.
Mohammadi, who won the peace prize in 2023 in recognition for more than two decades of campaigning, was arrested on 12 December in the eastern city of Mashhad after speaking out against Iran’s clerical authorities at a funeral ceremony.
She spent time on hunger strike earlier this month and had been hospitalised before being returned to prison.
The Norwegian Nobel committee said this week it was “deeply appalled” by reports detailing “physical abuse and ongoing life-threatening mistreatment” of Mohammadi during her arrest and in detention.
After her arrest, Mohammadi had been held in Mashhad at the detention facility of the intelligence ministry.
But she has now been transferred to a prison in the city of Zanjan in the north of the country, said her husband, Taghi Rahmani, who is based in Paris.
“This action was carried out without informing her family or her lawyer,” he said on X, adding it was “intended to exile and displace Narges”.
Mohammadi’s foundation, which is run by her supporters and family, said she had been transferred on Tuesday but she had only been able to reveal the news on Saturday in a phone call with her Iranian lawyer, Mostafa Nili.
Since her arrest in December, she has only been allowed one phone call with a brother inside Iran and now just two more with her Iranian lawyer.
“In our short conversation, she spoke of the violence inflicted during her arrest, the pressure of interrogations, and particularly severe blows to her head,” Nili wrote in a post on X.
“These blows have resulted in dizziness, double vision and blurred vision. Bruises and marks of severe physical assault remain on her body,” he added.
Mohammadi was arrested before protests erupted nationwide later in December. The movement peaked in January, with authorities launching a crackdown that activists say has left thousands dead.
Earlier this month she was handed a further six years in prison on charges of harming national security and a one-and-a-half-year prison sentence for propaganda against Iran’s Islamic system. She also went on hunger strike for almost a week to protest the conditions of her detention.
Over the past quarter of a century, Mohammadi, 53, has been repeatedly tried and jailed for her campaigning against Iran’s use of capital punishment and the mandatory dress code for women.
She was born in Zanjan but is resident in Tehran. Her foundation said she had on two occasions during previous jail stints been transferred to Zanjan prison where she suffered ill treatment.

She tried to fix the Liberals’ women problem. Now she’s quitting the party
Updated ,first published
The founder of a key Liberal women’s network has resigned from the organisation and quit the party altogether, two days after federal MPs toppled Sussan Ley as their first female leader.
The announcement from Charlotte Mortlock, who founded Hilma’s Network four years ago to boost female representation in the Liberals, also comes a week after the party’s NSW branch dumped a planned vote on gender quotas. Mortlock had worked on the proposal with five other Liberal women.
“Due to recent events I have decided there are other ways I can support women and Australia,” the former Coalition staffer and Sky journalist said in a statement on Sunday morning.
“I have decided the time has come for me to step down as executive director of Hilma’s Network and I have also relinquished my Liberal Party membership.”
The resignation of one of the Liberals’ most vocal grassroots advocates for women’s representation is a sign of the fallout that awaits the party in some sections of its membership after Ley, the first federal female leader, was turfed out of the job within nine months.
New deputy Liberal leader Jane Hume said Mortlock had been a great voice for women who held Liberal values. “I think that this is a really sad moment,” she said.
“I think that there is real opportunity for women’s voices in the Liberal Party, and it’s on us to make sure that we demonstrate to Australian women that the Liberal Party is the place for them, that we represent their hopes, their dreams and their aspirations.
“That’s certainly what my aim will be over the next coming weeks, months, years, and that’s certainly what we’re going to take to the next election.”
Independent MP Allegra Spender said Mortlock had “the guts and clear-thinking to recognise what was needed to truly transform the Liberal party to one that represented modern Australian women”.
“I really admire the work she did, but once again the party didn’t listen,” Spender said. “People often ask me why I am not part of the Liberal party. This is at least one part of the answer.”
Ley’s tenure had been marred by disunity. An image of high-profile right faction MPs arriving at a home in Melbourne to discuss Ley’s leadership before the funeral for former Liberal MP Katie Allen was a sign that the opposition leader was being undermined within her own ranks.
The six men included leadership aspirants Andrew Hastie and Angus Taylor, as well as senators Jonno Duniam and James Paterson, who were members of Ley’s leadership team.
It came to a head last week when Taylor challenged for the Liberal leadership, and on Friday won the ballot convincingly, 34 to 17.
Most of those Liberal MPs insist their decision was about Ley’s performance, given the Coalition was sinking in the polls to new lows each month. However, Ley’s supporters argue she was never given a fair go by colleagues, and some think gender played a part.
The Liberals have struggled to win women’s votes in the last two elections, and the gender imbalance in its ranks of MPs has barely changed in a decade.
The party has a target of 50 per cent female representation, but only a third of its MPS are women. There are six women in the lower house – which will drop to five when Ley leaves parliament – and 22 men. In the upper house, there are 11 Liberal women and 12 Liberal men.
Mortlock said state and federal gender quotas should be a “bare minimum” to improve both representation and policy offerings for women.
Quotas mandate that a proportion of seats be held by women, and have helped women become a majority of Labor’s caucus. However, the Liberal Party’s aversion to identity politics and belief in individual merit has made quotas a contentious issue for the party.
In Ley’s first major speech as leader in June, she said she was open to gender quotas but not wedded to them, adding that “what is not fine is not having enough women”.
Taylor quickly rejected the prospect of quotas, claiming Labor had “subverted democracy” with its processes. He argued that mentoring and recruitment support were better options.
The federal review of the Liberal Party’s 2025 election loss has not yet been published, but this masthead reported last November that the document will not recommend a rigid quota system.
Mortlock at the time said the decision was one for the state divisions, not the federal leadership.
However, the NSW Liberals this month dumped a vote on a proposal to introduce quotas from their agenda for next month’s state council meeting.
Six Liberal women in NSW, including Mortlock, had drafted a plan to boost female representation at the federal level by introducing a 40 per cent target for women MPs, and ensuring half the candidates in preselection contests were women.
Forty per cent of seats in NSW would also be reserved for women candidates, and hold women-only preselection, to stop female candidates being shoehorned into unwinnable seats, according to reports of the plan in The Australian.
It was dumped from the state council’s March meeting agenda over concerns it could provoke a drawn-out debate on gender representation before next year’s state election.
In her statement on Sunday, Mortlock said she was proud of everything the network had achieved since she formed the grassroots group after Scott Morrison’s 2022 federal election loss.
“From inception, we quickly grew to multiple states hosting events that challenged the party to evolve,” she said. “I wish Hilma’s and the Liberal Party success in the future.”
The network’s board of directors said in a statement: “We extend our deepest appreciation to Charlotte for having the passion and vision to create Hilma’s network and thank her for her commitment, energy and bravery to support women in politics.”
Hilma’s Victorian representative, Erin Watson, will take over as chief executive. The statement said Watson would help bolster Victorian Liberal leader Jess Wilson’s campaign ahead of the state election.

Wave of lawsuits by Trump tests limits of press freedom

ALBAWABA - Donald Trump, the President of the United States, has started a huge legal battle against major media companies by filing a number of high-profile lawsuits. Legal experts say these lawsuits could change the balance between political power and press freedom in the United States.
Trump has sued eight media companies since 2024, asking for $65 billion in damages. He has also sued the IRS separately because they gave The New York Times access to his tax returns. There have already been settlements for multimillion-dollar amounts in two cases, but at least seven more are still pending in federal courts. Trump has said that more lawsuits may come.
This is a big change from his first term, when he often criticized the media but didn't file a lot of lawsuits against them. After he left office, a number of lawsuits he filed against major news organizations were thrown out. His new legal strategy during his second term shows that he is taking a more aggressive stance.
It is hard to win a defamation case against a public figure. To win, the plaintiffs must show that the statements were false, harmful, and made with "actual malice," which means that the publisher knew they were spreading false information or didn't care about the truth. Some legal experts think that Trump's bigger goal might be to use the discovery process to look into how the editorial staff works.
Several well-known cases have gotten a lot of attention. The parent company of CBS News, Paramount Global, agreed to pay $16 million to settle a disagreement over how to edit an interview for the 2024 campaign. ABC News also settled for $15 million after an anchor got facts wrong about a civil verdict involving Trump. At the same time, a $10 billion lawsuit against the BBC for allegedly misleading editing of coverage of January 6 is getting closer to going to trial.
Trump has also sued the Pulitzer Prize Board, The Wall Street Journal, and Penguin Random House, among others, for reporting that he says hurt his reputation.
Supporters say that the lawsuits are a way to make media companies responsible. Critics say they could make journalism less free. The cases have brought up the question of where the constitutional line is between free speech and protecting someone's reputation, no matter what the outcomes are. This is especially important in a political climate that is becoming more divided.

Israel to deploy tear gas drones in West Bank ahead of Ramadan: Report
Security forces step up presence as access to Al-Aqsa faces restrictions, says Channel 12
JERUSALEM
Israel’s National Guard is preparing to deploy drones equipped to fire tear gas at Palestinians in the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem, as part of security preparations for the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, Israeli Channel 12 reported Saturday.
The police tenders committee approved the purchase of three drone-mounted systems designed to drop tear gas capsules, the channel said. The contract is valued at about $49,000.
The systems, known as “Surprise Egg,” are designed to be mounted on Matrice-type drones and used to disperse demonstrations by releasing tear gas from the air, according to the report.
Israeli police already operate 19 similar systems, Channel 12 said.
Tender documents described the purchase as “urgent,” citing operational preparations “for expected events during Ramadan,” the outlet reported.
Israel’s National Guard was formed under National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, a far-right minister. Opposition figures have described the force as “a militia effectively operating under his authority.”
Military buildup
Earlier this week, Channel 12 reported that the Israeli army decided to reinforce its presence in the West Bank during Ramadan, including deploying a commando brigade.
In addition to the 22 battalions currently conducting routine security operations in the occupied territory, the army plans to send additional units, the report said.
More companies are also expected to be stationed at checkpoints ahead of the entry of thousands of worshippers into the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound in East Jerusalem.
The army has recommended to Defense Minister Israel Katz that up to 10,000 worshippers be allowed to enter the compound each Friday during Ramadan, according to Channel 12. It also recommended allowing entry for men over 55 and women over 50.
On Friday, Sheikh Ikrima Sabri, preacher at the Al-Aqsa Mosque, told Anadolu that he regretted Israel’s decision to restrict access during Ramadan and warned that the government was implementing “an aggressive plan targeting the holy site.”
Access restrictions
Each year during Ramadan, hundreds of thousands of Palestinians travel from the West Bank to East Jerusalem to pray at the Al-Aqsa Mosque.
Since the start of Israel’s genocide in Gaza in October 2023, Israeli authorities have imposed tight restrictions on West Bank residents crossing military checkpoints into Jerusalem.
Over the past two years, only limited numbers have been allowed entry after obtaining Israeli-issued permits, which Palestinians say are difficult to secure.
Israel has not announced any special easing measures for Ramadan this year.
Palestinians view East Jerusalem as the capital of a future state, while Israel considers the city, in both its eastern and western parts, its capital.

Sa’ar to represent Israel at inaugural Board of Peace meeting, after PM declines to attend
Saudi Arabia says it can’t commit funds to Gaza’s reconstruction without more information about IDF pullout and disarmament of Hamas, hopes Thursday’s DC meeting will bring clarity
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has asked Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar to represent Israel at the inaugural Board of Peace meeting in Washington, DC next Thursday, a diplomatic source told The Times of Israel on Saturday evening.
Netanyahu was in Washington last week for a meeting with US President Donald Trump, amid the acute tensions between the US and Iran. The premier decided not to return for AIPAC’s annual conference and the Board of Peace meeting, where the Trump administration hopes to raise money for the international body.
Joining Sa’ar at the February 19 meeting will be joined by more senior heads of state from Argentina, Cambodia, Hungary, Indonesia, Pakistan and Vietnam. Bahrain’s King Hamad Al Khalifa is also slated to attend, according to an Arab diplomat. All 28 countries on the panel are expected to send a representative, but each is deciding how senior of an official to send, the diplomat said.
The Board of Peace is tasked with overseeing the Gaza Strip’s transition to a postwar, non-Hamas government, in accordance with the US’s 20-point plan for the territory.
Saudi Foreign Minister Faisal bin Farhan Al-Saud, however, said on Saturday that his country cannot commit funds for the reconstruction of the Strip until it has more clarity regarding the yet-to-be-implemented withdrawal of Israeli forces and the disarmament of Hamas; he said the meeting on Thursday may clear things up.
Asked at the Munich Security Conference whether Riyadh will fund Gaza’s reconstruction and on what terms, Prince Faisal responded that his country is “fully supportive” of the Board of Peace and Trump’s 20-point plan. However, he stressed that, “We need to see a real end to the conflict.”
“That means we need to have clarity on when Israel is going to withdraw, when Hamas is going to disarm, when everyone is going to comply with all 20 points of the 20-point plan,” Prince Faisal said.
“The US is working on that. There’s a meeting on the 19th that will give us a lot more clarity,” he noted, referring to the Board of Peace fundraising meeting.
The US is hoping to announce $1.25 billion donations from the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Kuwait, a US official and two Arab diplomats told The Times of Israel earlier this week. The New York Times reported that the US is also planning on making a similar donation.
The Saudi foreign minister said that Riyadh will be in a better position to determine “where we can best contribute toward — not just reconstruction, but also that the people of Gaza and Palestine can have a better future.”
The US plan for Gaza was unveiled in September, and it was envisioned by Washington as the end-goal of the ceasefire-hostage deal it brokered between Israel and the Hamas terror group, after two years of war sparked by the Hamas-led attack against Israel on October 7, 2023.
Even though the US-brokered truce entered its second phase last month, violence has continued in the coastal territory, with Israel and the terror group trading blame.
Its second phase stipulates that Israeli forces gradually withdraw from Gaza and Hamas disarm, with an international stabilization force deployed to ensure security.
Hamas has repeatedly said, however, that disarmament is a red line, although it has indicated it could consider handing over its weapons to a future Palestinian governing authority.

Zelenskyy seeks up to 50-year US security guarantees for investors
Ukrainian leader says shorter terms insufficient for long-term stability
ISTANBUL
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Kyiv is seeking long-term security guarantees from the US lasting at least 30 years to provide stability for international investors.
Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference, Zelenskyy said Washington has proposed guarantees lasting 15 years, but Ukraine wants a longer timeframe.
“Today we have a proposal from the American side for 15 years; we want to have 20 years plus, 30–50. It depends on what the administration and Congress decide,” he said.
Zelenskyy said guarantees of five to 10 years would not be enough to reassure investors, who require more durable security assurances.
He also said he hopes the war will end this year, while suggesting Moscow is adjusting its diplomatic approach.
“Russia is changing the head of the negotiation group to Medinsky. It seems they want to postpone decision-making,” Zelenskyy said, adding that Russian President Vladimir Putin aims to capture the entire Donbas region to “sell” a victory to the Russian public.
On prisoners of war, Zelenskyy said there is a possibility of an “all-for-all” exchange if Moscow agrees. He said Russia is holding about 7,000 Ukrainian soldiers, while Ukraine is holding more than 4,000 Russian troops.
Addressing the military situation in eastern Ukraine, Zelenskyy reiterated Kyiv’s position on territorial integrity.
“We will never withdraw troops,” he said.

YouTube restores pro-Palestinian US activist’s account after backlash
Guy Christensen is known for using his platform to speak out against Israel’s genocide in Gaza
ANKARA
Following a backlash, YouTube has reinstated the account of pro-Palestinian US activist Guy Christensen after briefly suspending it.
The US video-sharing platform shut down Christensen’s account on Friday, drawing criticism from users after he pleaded his case on other social media platforms. Christensen is known for content supportive of Palestinians and sharply critical of Israel’s genocide in the Gaza.
After the backlash, YouTube restored the account.
Posting on US social media platform X, Christensen said the company reversed its decision after initially rejecting his appeal.
“We actually did it,” he wrote.
“YouTube was forced to restore my entire channel + monetization after REJECTING the appeal last night, promising I would stay banned forever. This is the power of collective action and solidarity. If we don’t stand together, we’ll be picked apart 1 by 1.”

Officials discuss US action in Venezuela at Munich Security Conference

WASHINGTON
Senior US and international officials voiced divergent views Saturday on the US military’s controversial capture of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro during a panel discussion on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference.
Asked whether he supported the US operation in Venezuela, US Sen. Ruben Gallego, a Democratic member of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, said he was “glad he’s (Maduro) gone,” but warned that the way it was done has serious consequences for the international system.
“The violation of rules-based orders from this should really concern everyone that actually lives, dies and prospers by the rules-based order,” Gallego said, underscoring concerns that the Trump administration move -- carried out without broad international backing -- may weaken global norms.
After months of heightened tensions, the US captured Maduro on Jan. 3, triggering a series of developments, including Delcy Rodriguez being sworn in as interim president, changes to the country’s flagship oil law, and the release of some political prisoners.
Arnoldo Andre Tinoco, Costa Rica's foreign minister, said his country’s experience with Venezuelan migration shaped its perspective.
“When talking about Venezuela, I agree that we have to bear in mind that 8 million Venezuelans left the country. Most of them passed through Costa Rica,” Tinoco said, referencing the ongoing humanitarian fallout from years of political turmoil in Caracas.
Tinoco said a poll done after Maduro’s removal showed 84% of Costa Ricans approved of the US action.
He also outlined Costa Rica’s core areas of cooperation with Washington, citing migration, organized crime and narcotics trafficking, and Chinese investment in security-sensitive areas as shared priorities.
"We are struggling against organized crime and narco trafficking with the support of the US," he added.
Portuguese Foreign Minister Paulo Rangel offered a more nuanced view, reflecting his country’s deep ties to Venezuela through its large expatriate community.
"I have to say that these are very, very important matter for Portugal, because we have a Portuguese community of half million people in Venezuela," he said.
He stressed that respect for international law and the UN Charter is fundamental, even as his government never recognized Maduro’s disputed election.
Rangel acknowledged that Maduro’s ouster represented a break with international norms, but argued that restoring legitimate governance -- rather than returning Maduro to power -- must be the focus.
“There was a break, that international law was broken, but the way to reintegrate, to restore international law, is not to bring again Maduro. So this means that probably is not so white and black as people normally say,” he said.

French prosecutors announce special team for Epstein files
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
- Paris prosecutors formed a team to investigate Jeffrey Epstein files for crimes involving French nationals, re-examining Jean-Luc Brunel's case.
- Jeffrey Epstein died in prison awaiting child trafficking trial; Jean-Luc Brunel died in custody charged with raping minors.
- Recent US Epstein files named French figures; however, being mentioned does not automatically imply an offence was committed.
AI generated
PARIS - The Paris prosecutor’s office on Feb 14 announced it was setting up a special team of magistrates to analyse evidence that could implicate French nationals in the crimes of the convicted US sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.
With Epstein’s known circle now extending to prominent French figures after the release of documents
The new team will work closely with prosecutors from the national financial crimes unit and police with a view to opening investigations into any suspected crimes involving French nationals, the Paris prosecutor’s office told AFP.
The aim is “to be able to extract any piece that could be usefully reused in a new investigative framework”, it said.
Brunel was found dead in his cell in a Paris prison in 2022
Prosecutors said an investigation had showed Brunel was “a close friend of Jeffrey Epstein” who had offered modelling jobs to young girls from poor backgrounds.
He had engaged in sexual acts with underage girls in the United States, the US Virgin Islands, Paris and the south of France, they said.
Ten women had made accusations against Brunel, several describing how they had been led to drink alcohol and had been subjected to forced sexual penetration, according to the prosecutor’s office.
New cases
Several French public figures feature in the latest US Department of Justice release of material from the Epstein files, though being mentioned there does not in itself mean any offence has been committed.
The prosecutor’s office said it had been asked to look into three new specific cases involving a French diplomat, a modelling agent and a musician.
At the request of the French foreign ministry it was looking into the reported appearance of senior diplomat Fabrice Aidan in the cache of Epstein-related documents published by the US authorities.
“An investigation is under way to gather various pieces of evidence that could substantiate this report,” the prosecutor’s office stated.
The prosecutor’s office has also received a complaint filed by a Swedish woman against Mr Daniel Siad, a model recruiter with close ties to Epstein. She accused him of “sexual acts that she describes as rape and that may have been committed in France in 1990”.
The office has also received a complaint filed against French conductor Frederic Chaslin alleging acts of sexual harassment allegedly committed in 2016, it said.
The latest release of Epstein files has led to French former minister Jack Lang resigning from his position
Mr Lang has, however, denied any wrongdoing, saying he was “shocked” that his name appeared in the statutes of an offshore company Epstein founded in 2016.
The office of the national financial prosecutor said it had opened a preliminary investigation for “aggravated tax fraud and money laundering” against Mr Lang and his daughter, Ms Caroline Lang.
Following this announcement, Mr Lang resigned from the presidency of the Arab World Institute.
In an interview in newspaper La Tribune Dimanche, out on Feb 15, Mr Lang once again insists he is “white as snow”, denouncing what he describes as “a tsunami of lies” against him.
He told the paper he had known nothing of Epstein’s 2008 conviction for procuring a child for prostitution.
Epstein died in prison in 2019 while awaiting trial

Olympic athletes promised fresh stocks of condoms on Valentine’s Day after villages run short
On Valentine’s Day at the Milan Cortina Olympics, a renewed supply of free condoms for the athlete villages was promised by the organizers after going short during the week
- Bookmark
On Valentine’s Day at the Milan Cortina Olympics, a renewed supply of free condoms for the athlete villages was promised by the organizers after going short during the week.
“We can confirm that condom supplies in the Olympic Villages were temporarily depleted due to higher-than-anticipated demand,” the Italian organizing committee said in a statement Saturday. “Additional supplies are being delivered and will be distributed across all villages between today and Monday.”
Providing condoms for athletes has been a gift from organizers — and a constant fascination to the world — for decades.
While 300,000 condoms were provided for more than 10,500 athletes at the 2024 Paris Summer Games, the original stock was much lower for these Winter Games.
“I think 10,000 have been used, 2,800 athletes — you can go figure, as they say,” International Olympic Committee spokesman Mark Adams said Saturday. “It clearly shows that Valentine’s Day is in full swing in the village.”
Reports of no condoms in week one of the games followed an absence of plush toys of the official mascots, Milo and Tina, in the opening days. They proved more popular than expected in the official Olympics merchandise stores.
Condoms are traditionally popular for Olympic athletes to take home from as “a kind of gift” to friends, Alpine skier Mialitiana Clerc said Saturday.
“I’m not so shocked. I saw it in Beijing already,” said Clerc, who also competed for Madagascar four years ago at the Winter Games in China. “There were some boxes with a lot of condoms at the entrance of every building where we were staying at the village."
"Every day, everything was (gone),” she recalled about Beijing at an IOC news conference Saturday to promote its scholarship program that helps hundreds of athletes to train and qualify for the Olympics.
“I already know that a lot of people are using some condoms or just taking them to give to their friends outside of the Olympics because it’s a kind of gift for them,” Clerc said.
There should be no further shortage in Italy until the Winter Games closing ceremony Feb. 22.
“They will be continuously replenished until the end of the games to ensure continued availability,” the local organizing committee said.

How a hair stylist's client list became a campaign to change surrogacy laws

Cambodia's Surrogacy Crackdown

Perth hair stylist Jay Lazarus always dreamed of becoming a dad.
"Three days before my 21st birthday, my mum was like: 'So when am I going to be a grandmother?' And I was like, 'It's a little bit harder for me, mum — but soon, hopefully one day.'"
Landmark changes to Western Australia's reproductive laws mean that dream may now finally become a reality.
Jay has four godsons and is known as Uncle Jay to many of his friends' children.
"A lot of my clients' kids have grown up around me," he said.
"They all know mummy's hairdresser is Uncle Jay."
But as a gay couple, Jay and his husband Jeremy's options for parenthood were extremely limited because WA’s laws barred couples like them from accessing surrogacy.
They tried to explore pathways that might lead them to a surrogate, including using an international agency, but found themselves up against high costs and opaque processes.
After one consultation, Jay says the experience left him devastated.
"I ended up having four or five sleepless nights after the consult, crying. It became all about money. There was no emotional side of it at all. It was all 'have you got the money to do this, otherwise you're wasting our time'."
"It was completely transactional and it was the most awful experience."
Those barriers pushed him further into advocacy around surrogacy laws in Western Australia.
"I wanted to do it for people to know what the law was and how awful and discriminative it was towards us," he said, "but also hopefully opening a door for us to potentially meet a surrogate."
The state of surrogacy in Australia
Until late 2025, WA's laws barred gay couples from accessing altruistic surrogacy.
While commercial surrogacy — where the surrogate gets paid — is banned across Australia, altruistic arrangements allow for a woman to carry a baby for someone without being financially rewarded. Under this model, a surrogate can be compensated for reasonable medical expenses, but cannot make a profit.
WA previously restricted altruistic surrogacy to married heterosexual couples who could prove medical infertility. This is defined as biological conditions that mean someone cannot conceive naturally. The state's laws were the most restrictive in Australia.
'Social infertility', on the other hand, refers to the social circumstances that present barriers to a couple for having children, for example being part of a same-sex couple.
WA's recent reforms have now removed the requirement for people to prove medical infertility. This means social infertility is now recognised as a legitimate reason to access Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) and surrogacy.
With record numbers of Australians seeking out surrogacy options, the Australian Law Reform Commission (ALRC) is currently reviewing surrogacy laws. Surrogacy in Australia is primarily legislated and regulated at the state level, leading to what many have described as a "patchwork" of laws that can make complex processes even more challenging.
In an attempt to standardise the industry with best practice ethical guidelines, the ALRC has collected the opinions of professionals, community members and industry providers to be delivered to the government in a report in July 2026.
As part of its recommendations, surrogates across the country may soon be compensated up to $2,000 a month for the physical toll of pregnancy.
With 75 per cent of babies born via surrogacy born overseas, the ALRC hopes it will incentivise local surrogates and reduce barriers for intended parents who would otherwise have to look abroad.
For some parents, engaging in international surrogacy can be stressful, and requires dealing with unfamiliar systems, processes and governments.
Anthony and Joseph's international surrogacy journey
When Anthony Fisk and Joseph Huang started their journey to become parents more than a decade ago, they were just one of many gay couples in Western Australia forced to look overseas to have children.
For the couple, pursuing surrogacy abroad became complex and dangerous amid government crackdowns on the practice in Thailand and Cambodia.
Their first daughter was born to a surrogate in Thailand, but during her pregnancy, the country changed its laws and banned surrogacy for foreigners in the wake of the Baby Gammy scandal.
For their second pregnancy, they looked to Cambodia. But while their surrogate was pregnant with twins, Cambodia also cracked down on surrogacy, meaning the couple had to smuggle her out of the country to give birth.
"There were a lot of sleepless nights thinking about it and ensuring that this was the right thing," Anthony told Dateline in 2024.
It was a time fraught with legal risk, emotional and financial strain — all for the dream of growing a family that they couldn't build back home.
"There weren't many other options for us," he said. "I would have wanted it to be different."
But now, after years of agitation, advocacy and debate, the laws around altruistic surrogacy in WA have changed.
How WA's legal reform came into effect
The Assisted Reproductive Technology and Surrogacy Act was passed in Western Australian parliament on 3 December.
The new legislation aims to protect the best interests of surrogacy-born children, including enabling donor-conceived children to have access to information about their genetic and social heritage.
WA Premier Roger Cook said these changes would "bring WA into line" with the rest of Australia".
When these changes are implemented in approximately mid 2027, WA's laws will align with other jurisdictions, including Victoria, South Australia, NSW, the ACT and Queensland.
Same-sex couples will now be able to pursue surrogacy at home under clearer safeguards and oversight.
The 'help Jay and Jeremy have a baby' campaign
Jay Lazarus unexpectedly became central to the campaign to overhaul WA's restrictive surrogacy laws. He mobilised support through his extensive client list, built up over decades as a hair stylist.
"I sent an email out to my database and the subject was 'Help Jay and Jeremy have a baby'," he says.
"I sent this to 6,000 people. I smashed it on my social media and just got as many people as possible to fill out this form."
The email automatically forwarded to every recipient's local MP, urging them to support the reforms. What began as a personal plea turned into a grassroots lobbying effort that helped turn the tide on WA's laws.
"The traction that we got from it… I think I've just gotten more and more involved, helping out as much as I can on that side — the awareness, getting as many people around Western Australia knowing about us."
When the legislation finally passed, Jay watched years of community effort crystallise into change.
"We've changed it. We've crushed it. We've nailed it. It's happened. And this is going to be the best thing for Western Australia."
He's clear about why it mattered.
"I think a lot of it did come down to discrimination ... So having that completely lifted is just incredible.
"It needed to change."
For Jay and Jeremy, the reform isn't only a legal victory, it's a personal one. The couple are now getting to know a potential surrogate.
"She met our family, we met her kids. We're just getting to know each other. Hopefully in the next few months we'll start our journey."
"It changes a lot of things for a lot of people."

Zelensky: Only Europe is providing funding for Ukraine now
He made the remarks during a briefing in Munich on Saturday, according to an Ukrinform correspondent.
"First of all, today it is only Europe that is spending money on Ukraine. Let's be honest – our partners from Canada are helping, Japan is providing humanitarian support, but most of the funding comes exclusively from Europe," Zelensky said.
At the same time, he noted that Europe is largely absent from the peace negotiations.
"So far, unfortunately, Europe is not very present in the negotiations. […] By the way, Russia also does not really see Europe at the negotiating table. But this is unfair, because security guarantees from Europe are important for us," Zelensky said.
On February 11, the European Parliament adopted, under an urgent procedure, a package of proposals aimed at supporting Ukraine, including the provision of an EU loan of EUR 90 billion for 2026-2027.
Of this amount, EUR 30 billion will be allocated for macro-financial assistance or budget support to be provided through the EU's Ukraine Facility, while EUR 60 billion will go toward strengthening Ukraine's defense capabilities and supporting the procurement of military equipment.

Israeli FM Saar to attend Trump's first Board of Peace meeting on Thursday
Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar will attend US President Donald Trump's first formal Board of Peace meeting on 19 February, two Israeli officials said on Saturday.
US officials told Reuters this week that Trump will announce a multi-billion-dollar reconstruction plan for Gaza and detail plans for a UN-authorised stabilisation force for the Palestinian enclave at the meeting in Washington.
Delegations from at least 20 countries, including heads of state, are expected to attend the meeting of the board whose creation was endorsed by a United Nations Security Council resolution as part of Trump's plan to end the Gaza war.
While regional Middle East powers, including Turkey, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Qatar, as well as major emerging nations such as Indonesia, have joined the board, global powers and traditional Western US allies have been more cautious.
The US officials said the meeting will focus on Gaza, where two years of war have left much of the Palestinian enclave in ruins.
Israel and Palestinian militant group Hamas agreed to Trump's plan last year, with a ceasefire taking effect in October. More than 590 Palestinians have been killed in rounds of violence that have erupted since.
Both sides have accused each other of violating the ceasefire, even as Trump's administration has pressed for progress to the next steps envisaged in the plan.
One of those is the deployment of the International Stabilisation Force, as Israeli troops further withdraw and Hamas disarms.
The US officials said Trump will announce that several countries plan to provide several thousand troops to the stabilisation force that is expected to deploy in Gaza in the months ahead.
Hamas has so far rejected demands to lay down its weapons, and Israel has said that if the group does not disarm peacefully, Israel will have to force it to do so.

Canada says no relations with Iran without regime change, mum on support for US strike

Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Anita Anand said Canada wants a change of government in Iran but would not say whether it would support a US military strike, the Globe and Mail reported on Saturday.
“We will not open diplomatic relationships with Iran unless there is a regime change. Period,” Anand told the Globe and Mail in an interview in Germany, where she is attending the Munich Security Conference.
Canada has particularly poor relations with Iran and cut off diplomatic ties in 2012.
Anand on Saturday announced further sanctions against seven individuals who are connected with the Iranian government and said Canada’s focus in the region is on the repression of human rights.
The US military is preparing for the possibility of sustained, weeks-long operations against Iran if US President Donald Trump orders an attack, two US officials told Reuters, in what could become a far more serious conflict than previously seen between the countries.
On Friday, Trump embraced potential government change in Iran as the Pentagon sent a second aircraft carrier to the region.
Canadian killed in Iranian anti-regime protest, FM says
Last month, Anand announced that a Canadian citizen had been killed by Iranian forces during anti-regime protests in the country.
At the time, Anand extended her “deepest condolences” in a statement released on X/Twitter and announced that Canadian consular officials are “in contact with the victim’s family in Canada.”
She slammed the “Iranian regime’s repression and ongoing human rights violations,” condemning and calling for an “immediate end” to the violence against protesters.
To date, conservative estimates amid the Islamic regime's deadly crackdown on protesters place the death toll between 40,000 and 50,000. While the US-based Iranian rights group HRANA has confirmed just over 7,000 deaths, the group is reviewing an additional 11,730 cases.

'Nothing quite like it': UK Treasure Act names Roman carriage ornament Essex's first 'treasure'
Unknown

A rare Roman carriage ornament displayed in late January at the British Museum marked Essex’s first archaeological find and is set to be declared a “treasure,” under the 2023 amendment to the UK’s 1996 Treasure Act.
The ornament, made of copper alloy, depicts a panther with its paws atop a bearded man’s severed head, while the back of the panther is hollow and filled with lead.
Under the Act, archaeological finds can be designated as a treasure if they are deemed to be of historical, archaeological, or cultural importance.
The ornament, which was originally found in 2024 by metal detectorists outside the town of Harlow in Essex, has been dated by researchers to circa 43-200 CE.
ESS-8AC18A Roman Vehicle Fitting by Mark.Jeffcock on Sketchfab
“The size of the Harlow fitting, and the presence of a motif beneath the front paw are closer to finds identified as fittings which attached the strap linking draught animal collars to the yoke,” according to the government’s official description of the find.
Essex Portable Antiquities Scheme (PAS), a government-sanctioned group dedicated to recording local archaeological finds, announced the ornament’s new status in a January social media post, during an event at the British Museum.
“Big cats represent the power of the Roman Empire, and the paw on the severed head, domination over its enemies,” Essex PAS’s post added, noting that careful blending of Roman and local styles represents the Roman conquest of Britain.
“This is unparalleled in vehicle fittings across the Empire, making this example unique.”
County Finds Liason Officer Lori Rogerson and archaeologist Dr. John Pearce of King’s College echoed the sentiment to the BBC. “There is nothing quite like it in Romano-Britain,” Pearce said.
Rising number of reported archaeological finds in Britain
The ornament was one of 79,616 artifacts discovered by the public and reported to British authorities in 2024, showing a significant rise in reported finds since 2022 and 2023.
“The continued rise in the number of finds reported through the Portable Antiquities Scheme is a testament to the dedication of finders across the country,” Ian Richardson, Acting Head of Portable Antiquities and Treasure at the British Museum, said in a January statement.
“Their responsible reporting allows us to build a richer and more detailed picture of life in the past, while ensuring that important objects are preserved for public benefit.”

German archaeologists discover medieval tunnel system inside Neolithic burial site

A medieval tunnel system, formally known as an “erdstall,” was discovered by the Saxony-Anhalt State Office for Heritage Management and Archaeology (LDA) during excavations near Reinstedt in Saxony-Anhalt, Germany.
The discovery was announced in a January social media post saying that “a very special discovery was documented at the end of 2025 in the area of a Middle Neolithic burial site.”
Erdstalls, a combination of Middle High German’s erde (“earth”) and stelle (“place”), are tunnel systems believed by researchers to have been constructed in the Middle Ages, though their precise dating is a challenge, as they are commonly found empty.
Even so, a horseshoe, a fox skeleton, and the bones of several other small mammals were unearthed in Reinstedt, according to the LDA.
The Spanish-language publication La Brújula Verde (LBV) added that archaeologists had also discovered a layer of charcoal in the erdstall’s lower levels, believing that the fire was “short-lived, perhaps merely a source of light.”
A pile of large stones found by archaeologists near one of the tunnel’s entrances may have been stacked there as a way to seal off the entrance, LBV said.
LBV further noted that the Reinstedt erdstall’s height ranged between “one and 1.25 meters, with a width of between 50 and 70 centimeters, and in some stretches, it featured a gabled, vaulted ceiling.”
According to the LBV, archaeologists also discovered the remains of a possible Bronze Age burial mound near the erdstall and Neolithic tomb.
What were erdstalls used for?
Thousands of similar tunnel systems have been discovered across Europe. Nevertheless, their purpose has been subject to decades of theory and debate.
Some researchers believed that these tunnels were used as temporary hideouts or escape routes, like those used by Jewish rebels during the Bar Kochba revolt.
LBV, however, explained that the late archaeologist Lambert Karner disregarded this theory in his 1903 book “Künstliche Höhlen aus alter Zeit,” claiming that, based on the tunnels’ design, such a use was impractical.
According to LBV, Historian Anton Haschner proposed that the tunnels may have been “empty symbolic tombs, erected by medieval settlers in their new settlements as dwellings for the souls of their ancestors, awaiting the Final Judgment.”
“Other interpretations insist on their possible use for initiation rituals, as places of spiritual retreat, or simply as temporary hideouts for people and valuable goods during periods of instability, although the absence of a second exit complicates this last explanation,” LBV went on.
“Their location, often in the basements of old farmhouses, near churches, cemeteries, or in remote forests, adds further layers of mystery to their original purpose.”

Herzog's camp questions Netanyahu’s role in Trump's 'he should be ashamed' comments

Sources close to President Herzog are demanding clarifications from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu regarding whether he is connected to US President Donald Trump's statement that Herzog "should be ashamed" for not giving the prime minister a pardon.
"If so, this constitutes crossing a red line," the sources said.
On Thursday, in comments to the press, Trump said that Netanyahu should receive a pardon for corruption charges and that Herzog should be "ashamed of himself" for not granting one.
Trump: The people of Israel should really shame Herzog
"I think the people of Israel should really shame him. He's disgraceful for not giving it. He should give it," Trump said at the time.
Herzog's office subsequently responded, reiterating its commitment to examine the pardon request, but only after it had been reviewed by the Justice Ministry, as required by Israeli law.
"President Herzog values President Trump for his significant contribution to the State of Israel and its security. Israel is a sovereign state governed by the rule of law," Herzog's office stated, adding, "contrary to the impression created by President Trump's remarks, President Herzog has not yet made any decision on the matter."
The statement was released as Herzog was mid-flight, returning to Israel after his visit to Australia.
Asked by one of the reporters traveling with him for his personal reaction, Herzog said, “To the best of my recollection, I am the president of Israel.”

Stressed about Lunar New Year? Here are tips to look after your mental health
Unknown
Unknown Publisher

As Lunar New Year approaches, many Asian Australian families are planning an annual gathering to celebrate the festival — but not everyone feels happy about it.
The two-week cultural festival is often considered a time for family reunions, connections and new beginnings, but increased family time can also create pressure and reopen old wounds, according to Maria Cassaniti, manager of the NSW government's Transcultural Mental Health Centre in western Sydney.
"Lunar New Year, similar to other events for different communities … is a time of excitement and celebration for many, but we also know that these kinds of events … can come with [their] own stress," she tells SBS News.
While some multicultural communities may still grapple with stigma about mental health, Cassaniti says many have become more aware of its importance in recent years, including during cultural events such as Lunar New Year.
SBS News has spoken with several psychologists and mental health experts ahead of the festival, which starts on 17 February, about how to look after your mental health during the Lunar New Year. Here are their tips.
From dinner table arguments to inappropriate comments
In China and Vietnam, where people can enjoy a week-long holiday for Lunar New Year, local media have reported on youth disengagement with the traditional festival, citing stress from dealing with family expectations.
In Australia, young people from the Asian diaspora may also find themselves in similar shoes, as their values may differ from those held by older generations who grew up in Asia, says Christopher Tran, a Sydney-based psychologist dedicated to multicultural mental health.
"There's a bunch of things in Asian cultures that don't necessarily make things difficult, but it's interesting when it interacts with the culture we have here [in Australia]," he tells SBS News.
Tran says many of his clients have found it difficult to deal with "personal questions" and comments from family members — on subjects ranging from marriage to career progression — as well as managing family expectations.
Tip: Be prepared, and set a boundary for engagement
If you feel stressed about interacting with other family members, Cassaniti suggests it could be helpful to prepare for questions from senior relatives.
Veronica Ing, a Sydney-based psychologist, also suggests people practise self-soothing exercises to ensure a calm state of mind and increase tolerance for potentially uncomfortable conversations before family dinners.
"Coming in with a higher tolerance means that you're more likely able to deal with any emotional triggers while you're in the presence of your family," she says.
Tran suggests setting a time limit for engagement and considering booking a follow-up event to give yourself an excuse to leave on time.
"The general thing is just remembering that: 'my parents or my uncles and aunties, they carry their own values, their own anxieties, I carry my stuff. I'm allowed to choose how much I let in of this,'" he says.
"And basically it's just about every time they try to shine that spotlight on you, just click it away."
Cassaniti, Ing and Tran say it's also important to keep in mind that people can choose whom they do and don't want to spend the Lunar New Year with.
Loneliness and homesickness
While some Asian Australians face stress from family estrangement, some international students and first-generation migrants living away from their loved ones might feel homesick and lonely during the festive period.
Loneliness has been described as "the silent epidemic" by the Australian Psychological Society. University of Sydney research from 2025 found 43 per cent of Australians aged 15 to 25 feel lonely.
Dr Eric Fu, senior research fellow at the Youth Research Centre at the University of Melbourne, says many young people start university expecting a rich social life, only to find themselves isolated by their living arrangements, which can foster "a heightened sense of loneliness".
He's noticed loneliness has become a "big issue" among Chinese international students in particular, as many struggle to integrate and connect with local communities due to cultural and linguistic barriers.
"Because they are only here for a short period of time, and also they didn't really get the chance to really set their roots into the local community," he says.
Tip: Use social media well, and go for a walk
Fu, who has conducted research about the well-being of Chinese international students in Australia, found many turn to social media to seek interest groups and build connections with peers.
He says students also use social media to stay connected with families, friends and even strangers with similar cultural backgrounds.
"Sometimes even some unknown people clicked a like or collected their notes on Xiaohongshu or WeChat [Chinese social media apps], even that kind of recognition or identification can really play a role for them to really feel less lonely in Australia."
But while agreeing that social media can be a useful engagement tool for students, Fu also warns them to be cautious about online scams, especially if they have recently arrived in Australia.
More importantly, he encourages international students to "leave their accommodation and just go out for a walk" to explore their neighbourhoods and local communities.
"I think that will be a good way, you know, to really overcome that kind of sense of acute loneliness, you know, especially during this kind of traditional Chinese [festival] period."
Tran and Ing also point out that the Lunar New Year could be a good opportunity to build connections, as councils and local libraries often host community events.
Besides staying connected with people in Australia, Ing and Cassaniti also encourage people to use video calls and online chats to stay connected with families living overseas as a way to counter loneliness.
"[Don't] be afraid to reach out and practice being vulnerable when you're initiating contact," Ing says, adding that in some Asian cultures, people may not be used to directly expressing their love and vulnerability.
Gambling
Huangyuan Chen, a counsellor at the GambleAware Multicultural Service, tells SBS News that some members of Asian communities participate in gambling — such as playing mahjong with money — as a means of social connection during festive seasons.
Major casinos in Australia have also invested in Lunar New Year celebrations to try to attract overseas visitors.
Chen says it's key that people maintain control of their behaviours and take strategies to prevent themselves from engaging in problematic gambling.
This could include talking to casino staff to impose a ban on themselves from entering the venues, blocking gambling websites and talking to a gambling counsellor, Chen says.
She says people also need to be mindful of their motivations for gambling and the potential effect on others.
"Think about the people around you, because we know that people can be socially influenced [by] gambling," she says.
"Keep a distance from people influencing you to gamble, or keep away from the social influence, the online influence, and at the same time, spend more time with people with other interests, away from gambling, if possible."
Consider taking leave
Except for Christmas Island, Lunar New Year isn't a public holiday in Australia. But with upcoming gatherings and other cultural practices, maintaining work-life balance can be challenging for those who celebrate amid competing priorities.
Tran suggests people start with the practical steps, such as speaking to their manager.
"That could feel scary, and we don't know exactly if that's going to be successful," he says."But it's worth a try, because there are some workplaces that will actually respect this [cultural festival]."
He says people should weigh up their priorities and focus on what they think is most important.
"If you're leaning on work, then speak to your family and see if you can rearrange things; if you know family is more important, then you might just bite the bullet and just take some leave."
Post-Lunar New Year care
If people find family gatherings during the Lunar New Year stressful, it may be worth considering seeking professional help in the future to unpack the source of pressure, Tran says.
In recent years, there have been practitioner-led initiatives and government-supported multicultural programs that encourage people with multicultural backgrounds to seek culturally inclusive mental health care, with interpreting services available.
But in the case of international students, previous research by Dr Michelle Peterie from the Sydney Centre for Healthy Societies at the University of Sydney shows that international students are less likely to access psychological support services than domestic students, as they may not know about services or worry about the costs.
"There is a real need for government-led, sector-wide action to both address some of the challenges international students face in Australia, and ensure appropriate help is available and accessible when required," she says.

Brumbies shines as Force wilt in the Perth heat

ACT Brumbies defeat Western Force 56-24 in Super Rugby Pacific
In short:
The ACT Brumbies have scored more than 50 points to claim a commanding Super Rugby Pacific victory over the Western Force.
The Brumbies are a perfect six wins from six first round matches against the Force, since the WA franchise joined Super Rugby 20 years ago.
What's next?
The Brumbies travel to Christchurch next week to face the Crusaders, while the Force host the Blues in Perth.
The ACT Brumbies have turned up the heat to blitz the Western Force 56-24 in a sapping season-opening Super Rugby Pacific clash in Perth.
Temperatures exceeding 35 degrees Celsius forced officials to apply heat stress protocols and it was the home side who wilted when it mattered most on Saturday.
The Force relinquished a 10-point lead and conceded 28 straight points mid-match as the Brumbies overcame the loss of a glut of Wallabies stars to once again claim derby bragging rights.
The victory was the ACT's sixth out of six in season openers against the WA franchise, which has yet to make the finals since entering the competition 20 years ago.
Reigning John Eales Medallist Len Ikitau and fellow Test players Noah Lolesio and Tom Hooper departed in the off-season, while fellow Wallabies Tom Wright (knee) and captain Allan Alaalatoa (back) remain sidelined.
But the Brumbies clinically showed the more things change, the more they stay the same as two-time Australian player of the year Rob Valetini led the visitors' fightback in Perth.
While Valetini offered the physical presence and power, fellow back-rower Charlie Cale played a fine role, showing pace and footwork down the left flank to drag the Brumbies into the contest with his side's first try, then turning unlikely provider with another vital second-half try.
The Force had enjoyed all the early running, camping themselves in the Brumbies' half and bagging the opening try through flanker Vaiolini Ekuasi.
A Ben Donaldson penalty goal immediately after the first of two three-minute water breaks skipped the hosts out to a 10-0 lead after 21 minutes.
It took the Brumbies 22 minutes to even enter the Force's quarter but, as soon as they did, Cale crossed.
Livewire flyhalf Declan Meredith then left Wallabies stars Carlo Tizzano and Brandon Paenga-Amosa clutching at air to give the Brumbies a 14-10 halftime lead that never looked likely.
Any home hopes of a second-half turnaround were snuffed out when Rhys Van Nek forced his way over a minute after the resumption and then Cale put Meredith over for his second try with a deft face ball.
Veteran Kurtley Beale did his best to inject some enterprise into the Force's play, combining with fellow former NSW Waratahs playmaker Donaldson to create a try for energetic Argentine lock Franco Molina to briefly cut the deficit to 11 points.
But second tries each for Meredith and Cale, a typically opportunistic strike for speedster Corey Toole and one for fellow winger Ollie Sapsford after the siren secured the Brumbies an emphatic first-round bonus point victory.
On debut for the Brumbies, Wallabies flyhalf and yet another former NSW Waratah, Tane Edmed, nailed his first points for the ACT franchise with three conversions from three attempts after being thrust into the action late on for Meredith.

Damascus, Washington stress Syria's sovereignty, territorial integrity at Munich meeting

Syrian and US officials stressed Syria’s sovereignty and territorial integrity during talks on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference, according to a Friday Syrian Foreign Ministry statement.
The Syrian delegation, headed by Foreign Minister Asaad al Shaibani, met US Secretary of State Marco Rubio to discuss key local and regional developments.
Both sides emphasised the unity of Syria, its sovereignty, and the integrity of its territory. The US reaffirmed its support for the Syrian government.
Washington also expressed support for the recent integration agreement between the government and the YPG terror organisation, as well as Syria’s efforts to combat the Daesh terror group.
Syria formally joined the anti-Daesh coalition last November. The coalition was formed in 2014 and has carried out military operations against the terror group in Syria and Iraq, though Damascus was not previously a member.
The talks also addressed relations between Syria and the US and ways to develop cooperation in various fields.
US reiterates support for stable, peaceful Syria
The US State Department said in a separate statement on Saturday that Rubio affirmed US support for a Syria that is "stable, at peace" with its neighbors, and protects the rights of all its ethnic and religious minority groups.
Rubio "welcomed the Syrian government’s commitment to fully cooperate with the United States and the Global Coalition to Defeat Daesh," deputy spokesman Tommy Pigott said.
The secretary of state also emphasised the importance of implementing the permanent ceasefire and integration agreement in northeastern Syria, and ensuring full respect and safety for the rights of all Syrians, Pigott added.
On January 18 the Syrian government and the YPG reached a comprehensive ceasefire and full integration agreement, outlining sweeping measures to restore state authority in the northeast.
Syrian security forces and administrative bodies have entered areas previously controlled by the YPG, including Hasakah, Qamishli and Ayn al Arab (Kobani), as well as strategic facilities such as airports, oil fields, and border crossings.
The agreement provides for the gradual handover of security responsibilities, the deployment of state institutions, and the integration of YPG forces into official government structures.
The Syrian Army launched an operation against the YPG on January 16 in areas west of the Euphrates River. The operation later expanded east of the river with the participation of tribal forces, leading to all of the territories previously occupied by the group coming under government control.

Russia ‘will not change,’ leaders warn as NATO allies call for tougher deterrence
Ukraine war 'a total strategic failure from Russia’s part,' says Finnish president
ISTANBUL
European leaders warned Saturday that Russia poses a continuing long-term threat to Europe and must be countered with stronger deterrence and sustained military support for Ukraine, as officials speaking at the Munich Security Conference stressed the need for faster defense investment.
Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said Moscow’s actions show that it is not seeking peace.
“Russia will not change … they are not interested in peace,” she said, arguing that the Western alliance must respond with strength.
She cautioned that Europe faces simultaneous security pressures: “We have an eastern flank … a southern flank … a northern flank … and a flank when it comes to new technologies.”
Frederiksen warned that current defense spending levels may fall short.
“Now we spend 3.5% of our GDP in Denmark on defense. I’m not sure it will be enough,” she said, adding that targets set for later decades could be too slow.
She also dismissed any suggestion of territorial bargaining over Greenland, saying: “If one NATO country attacks another NATO country, then NATO ends. It’s game over.”
Joint defense efforts
Finnish President Alexander Stubb argued that Russia has failed strategically despite the war’s intensity.
“Putin wanted to take over Ukraine … it became European,” he said, adding that Moscow’s goals of preventing NATO expansion and weakening European defense spending also backfired.
He cited battlefield losses to underline his point: “In December, 35,000 Russian soldiers died. In January, 30,000 Russian soldiers died … that’s 65,000 soldiers dead in two months.”
Stubb called the war “a total strategic failure from Russia’s part” and said the allies must act decisively.
Finland, which has the longest border of any NATO country with Russia, held off an invasion by the USSR for three months in late 1939 and early 1940, before surrendering.
Pedro Sanchez, Spain’s prime minister, said Europe must focus on joint defense efforts rather than simply boosting spending targets.
“We need to focus more on not only how much do we spend, but how much do we spend together,” he said. He warned that raising targets too quickly could have unintended consequences:
“If we agree with this idea of 5%, at the end of the day we will become more dependent on the US defense industry.”
Sanchez added that the war represents a broader geopolitical challenge. “This is not only an attack on Ukraine, it’s also an attack against the European Union as a whole,” he said, urging unity among allies.

De Minaur reaches third-straight Rotterdam final

Alex de Minaur through to ATP Rotterdam Open final with win over Ugo Humbert
In short:
Alex de Minaur survived all 10 break points he faced to defeat Ugo Humbert and reach the ATP Rotterdam final.
The Australian has become the first player to reach three straight finals in Rotterdam.
What's next?
De Minaur will face Felix Auger-Aliassime in the final.
Alex de Minaur has become the first man to reach three consecutive finals at the Rotterdam Open after a display that showcased Australia's lion-heart at his most resolute and resilient.
In a gritty semifinal, de Minaur managed to save all 10 of the break points he faced as the world number eight outlasted French left-hander Ugo Humbert 6-4, 6-3 on Saturday.
De Minaur, who lost in the last two Rotterdam final showdowns to Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz, will this time meet Felix Auger-Aliassime on Sunday in his bid to become Australia's first victor in the celebrated ATP 500 tournament's 54-year history since Lleyton Hewitt back in 2004.
"I'm super proud of the effort," the 26-year-old said.
"Again, a lot of tough moments, a lot of break points, a lot of tricky situations, but I managed to kind of dig myself out of them. Yeah, super pumped to give myself another chance of hopefully getting the title."
It was an afternoon when all of de Minaur's patience and speedy defensive nous was on show, as he was unable to hit his way through Humbert in the slow conditions on the Ahoy Arena hardcourt, managing to hit only three winners all match.
But while the French world number 36 looked to have more firepower, each time he gleaned an opening, de Minaur shut down the break points with the help of fine serving. When he got his own chance, the Australian was ruthless, converting three of his four break points.
"It's hard to get a lot of rhythm against him," de Minaur said.
"It's hard to really feel comfortable, so a lot today was just about trying to be solid, trying to make that extra ball, to keep asking questions.
"It's not every match you get the chance to be aggressive, and today was certainly one where I was not able to do that, but hey, I found a way. And on to the next."
Having lost to the best two players on the planet in his previous finals, he could afford to feel a bit more confident this year — and he reckons he will leave nothing out there.
"The plan is to go for the title. No regrets. Whatever happens tomorrow happens, go for it," said de Minaur, who will be featuring in his 20th ATP final.
"I don't want to leave the court thinking about the 'what ifs'. Ultimately, these are the types of matches you go to to win the title and not hope the other player loses it, and that's going to be my mindset."

10 Surprising Facts About Presidents’ Day
Unknown
Unknown Publisher
2026-02-14
19:29:52 UTC
04:29:52 KST

One of the earliest federal holidays enacted by Congress, Presidents’ Day honors the birthday and legacy of the first U.S. President, George Washington.
Observed on the third Monday of February each year, the special day is celebrated through patriotic parades, historical reenactments, and readings of major presidential speeches, including Washington’s Farewell Address.
“It’s a really good opportunity to reflect on the origins of the [presidential] office and what was intended by Washington and the other framers at the Constitutional Convention,” Lindsay Chervinsky, executive director of the George Washington Presidential Library at Mount Vernon, tells TIME.
Here are 10 facts that make Presidents’ Day a distinct, and often misunderstood, national holiday.
Presidents’ Day goes by another name
Despite its popular moniker, the federal holiday known as Presidents’ Day is officially called “Washington’s Birthday” under Section 6103(a) in Title 5 of the U.S. Code.
“Americans, prior to the revolution, celebrated the King's birthday quite regularly, and they started to transition to celebrating Washington's birthday about halfway through the war,” says Chervinsky. “By 1778, states and localities were celebrating Washington's birthday, largely because it was common practice to have a sort of a birthday celebration, and he was a good stand-in.”
The holiday was established by an Act of Congress introduced by Republican Sen. Stephen Wallace Dorsey of Arkansas and signed into law by President Rutherford B. Hayes on Jan. 31, 1879. Initially observed by federal offices in Washington, it was expanded in 1885 to include all federal offices.
George Washington had two birthdays
Washington was born in Virginia on Feb. 11, 1731, according to the Julian calendar, which was introduced by Julius Caesar and used throughout the British Empire at the time.
In 1752, Britain and its colonies adopted the Gregorian calendar, introduced by Pope Gregory XIII to correct inaccuracies in the Julian system. The shift moved Washington’s birthday forward by 11 days and into a new year.
As a result, Washington’s birthday came to be recognized as Feb. 22, 1732.
Presidents’ Day never falls on Washington’s birthday anymore
Although the holiday retains its name, Congress passed the Uniform Monday Holiday Act in 1968, shifting several federal holidays to Mondays when it came into effect in 1971.
The goal was to create more three-day weekends and reduce disruptions to the workweek.
Under the law, Washington’s birthday is now observed on the third Monday of February, meaning it does not coincide with Feb. 22.
It was the first federal holiday honoring an individual’s birth date
Although the U.S. now observes other federal holidays spotlighting prominent individuals, such as Martin Luther King, Jr., Washington’s Birthday was the first federal holiday dedicated to a single person’s birth date.
Peter Kastor, a history professor at Washington University in St. Louis, tells TIME that “during the revolution, but especially after his death, Americans concluded that Washington would be their symbol of what the American Revolution and the American experiment was supposed to be.”
After Washington’s death in 1799, his birthday continued to be celebrated informally nationwide for decades before receiving federal recognition nearly a century later.
Washington may not have enjoyed celebrating his own birthday
Historical records suggest that Washington paid little attention to his own birthday.
Domestic accounts from Mount Vernon, his plantation estate, show no evidence of large celebrations or regular family observances.
“He really wasn't much one for celebrations,” says Chervinsky. “For his birthday, he usually wrote down that it was his birthday and acknowledged it. And maybe there was something small among the family, but he was not going to be having lavish birthday parties.”
One diary entry from Washington’s birthday reflects his understated approach.
“About 10 o'clock last night it began to snow and continued to do so all night and till afternoon this day—but as it drifted much the depth cd. [could] not be ascertained. I remained at home all day,” the excerpt reads.
Abraham Lincoln became linked to the holiday
During debates over the Uniform Monday Holiday Act, some lawmakers proposed renaming the holiday Presidents’ Day to honor both Washington and Abraham Lincoln, the 16th U.S. President whose own birthday falls on Feb. 12.
Lincoln’s birthday was already a celebrated day in many states, as people chose to honor his role in preserving the Union during the Civil War and moving to abolish slavery through the Emancipation Proclamation.
“Lincoln became the symbol of the Union and the symbol of personal sacrifice, when he died in office,” says Kastor.
Although Congress rejected the proposed name change in 1968, the association stuck, and many Americans now view the holiday as honoring multiple Presidents.
Retail branding helped popularize the holiday
After the new Monday observance took effect in 1971, some retailers began using the long weekend for promotions.
By the 1980s, “Presidents’ Day Sales” had become a common marketing strategy in the U.S., with targeted advertisements often featuring patriotic imagery such as American flags or depictions of Mount Rushmore.
“Think about how many mattress stores do sales on Presidents’ Day,” says Kastor, noting that the holiday marks the first tentpole event of the year.
Cherry pie is loosely associated with the holiday
Cherry pie has become symbolically linked to Presidents’ Day. The association appears to stem from the famous, but fictional, story of Washington chopping down a cherry tree as a child.
“There is this long-standing story that Americans celebrated Presidents’ Day by eating cherry pie,” says Kastor. “It isn't in the way that people eat pumpkin pie on Thanksgiving. But rather, there's some people who've done it, and these stories that have propagated over time.”
The first seven Presidents weren’t (technically) born in the United States
The Constitution requires presidential candidates to be natural-born citizens. But for the nation’s first six decades, every President had technically been born before the United States even existed.
The first seven Presidents—Washington, John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, James Monroe, John Quincy Adams, and Andrew Jackson—were all born before 1776, when the colonies were still part of the British Empire. Their birthplaces later became U.S. soil.
The first President born after the signing of the Declaration of Independence was Martin Van Buren. Born in Kinderhook, N.Y., in 1782, he became the first native-born American President and the first from New York.
The Senate still reads Washington’s Farewell Address each year
In 1796, as his second term in office drew to a close, Washington opted not to seek a third term, announcing his decision in a public letter that became known as his “Farewell Address.” This also established the precedent of a two-term presidency, later formalized in the Constitution.
Each year, the Senate selects one of its members, alternating parties, to read Washington’s 7,641-word address aloud in a legislative session. The practice began on Feb. 22, 1862, as “a morale-boosting gesture during the darkest days of the Civil War.”
At the conclusion of the annual reading, the appointed senator signs a black leather-bound book maintained by the secretary of the Senate, adding brief remarks to memorialize the occasion.
Chervinsky calls the observance “an opportunity to reflect on the best leadership practices and what we can also learn from the darker moments” of U.S. history.
Republican Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi recited the farewell address on Feb. 18, 2025. He said he was “grateful” for the opportunity to read Washington’s words aloud.

Epstein affair: French prosecutors announce special team of magistrates to investigate suspected crimes
France

The Paris prosecutor's office on Saturday, February 14 announced it was setting up a special team of magistrates to analyse files relating to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The new team will work closely with prosecutors from the national financial crimes unit and police with a view to opening investigations into any suspected crimes involving French nationals, the office told AFP.
As part of that initiative, they will be reopening their files on the late Jean-Luc Brunel, a former French modeling agency executive. The aim is "to be able to extract any piece that could be usefully reused in a new investigative framework," said prosecutors.
Brunel, who had links with Epstein, was found dead in his cell in a Paris prison in 2022 after having been charged with raping minors.
Epstein died in prison in 2019 while awaiting trial for trafficking children, in what the US authorities ruled was a suicide.
Several French public figures feature in the latest US Department of Justice release of material from the Epstein files, though being mentioned there does not in itself mean any offence has been committed.
Three new specific cases
The prosecutor's office said it had been asked to look into three new specific cases involving a French diplomat, a modelling agent and a musician.
At the request of the French foreign ministry it was looking into the reported appearance of senior diplomat Fabrice Aidan in the cache of Epstein-related documents published by the US authorities. "An investigation is underway to gather various pieces of evidence that could substantiate this report," the prosecutor's office stated.
The prosecutor's office has also received a complaint filed by a Swedish woman against Daniel Siad, a model recruiter with close ties to Epstein. She accused him of "sexual acts that she describes as rape and that may have been committed in France in 1990", it said.
The office has also received a complaint filed against French conductor Frederic Chaslin alleging acts of sexual harassment allegedly committed in 2016, it said.
The latest release of Epstein files has led to French former minister Jack Lang resigning from his position as the head of a top cultural body, the Arab World Institute (IMA).

New poll says Bad Bunny represents America better than Donald Trump - after president’s Super Bowl rage
About 44 percent of U.S. adults said they approved of Bad Bunny’s historic Super Bowl halftime performance

A new poll reveals more than 40 percent of U.S. adults believe Super Bowl halftime show headliner Bad Bunny represents America better than the U.S. president.
When asked who “better represents America,” 42 percent of U.S. adults surveyed selected Bad Bunny, while 39 percent chose President Donald Trump, according to a Yahoo/YouGov poll conducted after the Super Bowl. This comes after Trump labeled Bad Bunny’s Super Bowl performance “one of the worst, EVER!”
Last Sunday, more than 128 million people tuned in to watch Puerto Rican artist Bad Bunny, born Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio, make history as the first Super Bowl halftime headliner to perform primarily in Spanish.
Despite the backlash from Trump and other conservatives, about 44 percent of U.S. adults said they approved of Bad Bunny’s performance, according to the survey. Meanwhile, about 35 percent said they disapproved and 21 percent said they weren’t sure.
The opinion of Bad Bunny is also party-dependent, according to the poll, which was carried out between February 9-12 and included 1,700 Americans across the political spectrum. Among Democrats, 78 percent see Bad Bunny favorably, compared to just 12 percent of Republicans.
Bad Bunny’s set celebrated his heritage and all countries of the Americas with scenes showing Puerto Rico life, a display of flags and even a wedding, as he was joined by surprise guests like Lady Gaga and Ricky Martin.
The 31-year-old artist performed a selection of his biggest hits, including "Tití Me Preguntó" and "DtMF.” During his performance, a message was displayed across a large screen in the stadium: "The only thing more powerful than hate is love."
When organizers announced Bad Bunny, an outspoken critic of Trump, would be headlining the halftime show, many conservatives were quick to push back. Turning Point USA, a conservative advocacy organization, even announced its own “All-American Halftime Show” to protest Bad Bunny’s performance.
Kid Rock headlined that concert, which was streamed online at the same time as Bad Bunny’s show. An estimated 6.1 million concurrent viewers watched Turning Point USA’s YouTube livestream, according to The Athletic.
Trump slammed Bad Bunny’s performance in a Truth Social post, but made no mention of Turning Point USA’s alternative event.
“It makes no sense, is an affront to the Greatness of America, and doesn’t represent our standards of Success, Creativity, or Excellence,” Trump wrote. “Nobody understands a word this guy is saying, and the dancing is disgusting, especially for young children that are watching from throughout the U.S.A., and all over the World.”

Zelenskyy says halt to energy infrastructure attacks to be discussed at Geneva talks
Kyiv declines details ahead of US-mediated negotiations with Russia
ISTANBUL
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said a proposed halt to attacks on energy infrastructure will be discussed at upcoming peace talks in Geneva but declined to provide details, saying the matter will not be addressed publicly at this stage.
Speaking to reporters in Munich, Zelenskyy refrained from elaborating when asked whether the matter would be part of the agenda at the next round of negotiations.
“We will not speak publicly about the energy truce yet,” he said in response to a question from an Interfax-Ukraine correspondent.
Secretary of the National Security and Defense Council Rustem Umerov also confirmed the issue is expected to be raised.
“This issue will be discussed during the negotiations, but we cannot discuss it publicly,” Umerov said.
An energy truce refers to a mutual suspension of strikes on power plants, transmission facilities and other critical energy infrastructure, which have been frequent targets during the conflict.
Zelenskyy did not specify what such an arrangement could include, as exchanges of attacks on infrastructure continue.
The comments came ahead of a new round of peace talks between Russia and Ukraine scheduled for Feb. 17-18 in Geneva, Switzerland. The Kremlin has said the meeting will take place in a trilateral format involving Russia, the US and Ukraine, without European representatives.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia’s delegation will be led by presidential aide Vladimir Medinsky and described the talks as the next step in a US-mediated process.
Russia and Ukraine previously held two rounds of talks in Abu Dhabi in January and earlier this month that resulted in an agreement on a prisoner exchange. Ukrainian officials, including Umerov, have said Kyiv’s delegation has begun preparations for the Geneva meeting with the aim of achieving what they call a sustainable and lasting peace.

Russian Opposition Leader Navalny Poisoned With Deadly ‘Dart Frog’ Toxin, European Governments Say

Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, who died in a remote Siberian prison two years ago, was almost certainly poisoned with a deadly toxin found in South American dart frogs, five European governments said Saturday.
A joint statement from Britain, France, Germany, Sweden, and the Netherlands said they were “confident” Navanly had been poisoned after an analysis of samples taken from his body “conclusively confirmed the presence of epibatidine,” and that the Russian government was the likely culprit.
“Epibatidine can be found naturally in dart frogs in the wild in South America. Dart frogs in captivity do not produce this toxin, and it is not found naturally in Russia. There is no innocent explanation for its presence in Navalny’s body,” the statement said.

“Russia claimed that Navalny died of natural causes. But given the toxicity of epibatidine and reported symptoms, poisoning was highly likely the cause of his death. Navalny died while held in prison, meaning Russia had the means, motive and opportunity to administer this poison to him,” it continued.
The five countries said they were reporting the case to the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, alleging Russia violated the Chemical Weapons Convention.
Russian authorities had previously claimed Navalny, 47, died of natural causes while serving several sentences totaling more than 30 years at a high-security prison above the Arctic Circle.
Navalny rose to prominence as an anti-corruption campaigner and staged massive anti-Kremlin protests, becoming a key opponent of President Vladimir Putin.
Navalny’s widow, Yulia Navalnaya, appeared at a press conference during the Munich Security Conference alongside European foreign ministers to announce the findings.
“Scientists from five European countries have established: my husband, Alexei Navalny, was poisoned with epibatidine—a neurotoxin, one of the deadliest poisons on earth. In nature, this poison can be found on the skin of the Ecuadorian dart frog. It causes paralysis, respiratory arrest, and a painful death,” she said.
“I was certain from the first day that my husband had been poisoned, but now there is proof: Putin killed Alexei with chemical weapon. I am grateful to the European states for the meticulous work they carried out over two years and for uncovering the truth. Vladimir Putin is a murderer. He must be held accountable for all his crimes.”
French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot said the poisoning shows that “Vladimir Putin is prepared to use chemical weapons against his own people to remain in power. France pays tribute to this opposition figure, killed for his fight in favor of a free and democratic Russia.”
British Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper added: "Only the Russian government had the means, the motive, and the opportunity to use that toxin against Alexei Navalny in prison. We are here today to shine a spotlight on the Kremlin’s barbaric attempt to silence Alexei Navalny’s voice.”
Russia announced Navalny’s death on Feb. 16, 2024, just as that year’s Munich Security Conference opened. On that day, Navalnaya delivered a speech, pledging that Putin “would pay for what they have done to our country, to my family, and to my husband.” After a weeklong dispute over custody, Russia released Navalny’s body to his mother.
Last September, Navalnaya said her team had transferred some biological samples from his body abroad, and two laboratories confirmed he had been poisoned. She described a photograph of her husband’s prison cell showing vomit on the floor the day he died, and said excerpts from official incident reports submitted by five prison officials indicated he suffered heavy vomiting and convulsions shortly before his death.
Six months after his death, Russia’s Investigative Committee declined to open a criminal investigation, citing a combination of medical conditions. Its report listed hypertension, chronic hepatitis, and a damaged vertebra as contributing factors, and claimed a rise in blood pressure disrupted his heart rhythm. One of Navalny’s former doctors called the diagnosis “implausible.”
Navalny had survived a prior assassination attempt in 2020, collapsing on a flight from Tomsk to Moscow after exposure to a nerve agent. He later said he had gathered evidence that Russian security agents had targeted him.
European officials said it remains unclear how the toxin, which is roughly 200 times more potent than morphine, was administered to Navalny.
Navalny’s aides said he was close to being released in a prison exchange when he died. Flowers and portraits of the late opposition leader have appeared in memorials across Europe, including outside the former Russian consulate in Frankfurt, highlighting international outrage over his death.

Russia bewildered by Baku claims of ‘deliberate’ Russian attacks on embassy in Kiev — MFA

MOSCOW, February 14. /TASS/. Russia has expressed its bewilderment over Baku's claims of allegedly deliberate Russian attacks on the Azerbaijani embassy in Kiev, according to the Russian Foreign Ministry's statement to TASS.
"We are perplexed by Baku's assertions regarding purported deliberate Russian missile strikes on the Azerbaijani embassy in Kiev," the Ministry stated. "We would like to remind you that the Azerbaijani side was promptly provided with necessary clarifications. Specifically, on November 21, 2025, during a conversation at the Russian Foreign Ministry, Azerbaijan's ambassador to Moscow expressed sincere regret over the damage to the buildings and grounds of the Azerbaijani diplomatic mission in Ukraine. It was also noted that the damage to the Azerbaijani diplomatic mission’s compound in Kiev was likely caused by a malfunction of Ukrainian air defense systems, presumably the impact of a Patriot missile."
The statement further emphasized, "The Azerbaijani side was once again informed that during the special military operation, the Russian Armed Forces are targeting legitimate military objectives, such as Ukrainian defense industry facilities, including those situated in Kiev. When planning strikes, combat data is meticulously monitored to minimize civilian harm, and the locations of foreign diplomatic missions are carefully taken into account."
In this context, it was particularly emphasized that claims of the allegedly targeted missile strikes on Azerbaijani facilities in Ukraine are untrue. "Attention was also drawn to the fact that the Kiev regime, in violation of international humanitarian law, continues to deploy military installations, including air defense systems, in residential areas, thereby endangering the civilian population. The Russian side believes that Ukraine's military-political leadership must bear responsibility for any consequences of such criminal actions," the Russian Foreign Ministry concluded.

Police said the family has requested privacy to grieve.
In a shared statement, the family said: “Demi was a beloved daughter, granddaughter, sister, cousin and niece. Demi loved her friends, and she was loved by all.”
Inquiries are ongoing and police have asked anyone with information including CCTV or dashcam footage to get in contact quoting log reference 2600 046 163.
The Welsh ambulance service also attended the incident.

Swiss say Oman to host US-Iran talks in Geneva next week
Switzerland said Saturday that Oman would host talks between the United States and Iran in Geneva next week, with Washington pushing Tehran to make a deal to limit its nuclear programme.
"Switzerland stands ready at all times to offer its good offices to facilitate dialogue between the United States and Iran," a Swiss foreign ministry spokesman told AFP.
On 6 February, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi held talks in Oman with US envoy Steve Witkoff and US President Donald Trump's influential son-in-law Jared Kushner.
The talks were indirect, with the Omanis acting as mediators.
Trump has recently focused his military threats on Tehran's nuclear programme, which US forces struck last July during Israel's unprecedented 12-day war with Iran.
Trump said Friday that a change of government in Iran would be the "best thing that could happen", as he sent a second aircraft carrier to the Middle East, ratcheting up military pressure on the Islamic Republic.
Go-between
Switzerland has played a key role in diplomatic relations between Iran and the United States for decades.
Renowned for its neutrality, Switzerland has been representing US interests in Iran since Washington broke off relations with Tehran after the 1980 hostage crisis, a year after the Iranian revolution.
In its role as the so-called protecting power, Switzerland has for decades allowed the two feuding nations to maintain a minimum of diplomatic and consular relations.
The Swiss embassy in Tehran handles all consular affairs between the United States and Iran, including passport requests, altering civil status and consular protection for US citizens in Iran.
Under the protecting power mandate, "Switzerland can either offer to act as a go-between on its own initiative or can fulfil this function at the request of the parties concerned, provided that all those involved agree," the foreign ministry says on its website.
The United States will be holding separate talks, also in Geneva next week, between Russia and Ukraine.
Moscow and Kyiv will hold US-brokered talks on Tuesday and Wednesday in the Swiss city, both countries have said, announcing the next leg in fraught negotiations seeking to end the four-year war.
Trump is pushing to halt the conflict, but two previous rounds of US-mediated talks in Abu Dhabi have not yielded signs of a breakthrough.

Bill Maher makes crass comparison between Taylor Swift’s exes and her fiance Travis Kelce

Bill Maher didn’t hold back while comparing Taylor Swift’s ex-boyfriends and her fiance, NFL star Travis Kelce.
During Friday’s episode of Real Time With Bill Maher, the host was monologuing about sexual intimacy rates among Americans and the rise of the “romantasy” book genre — which often features mythical creatures as part of a love plot — when he broached the topic of Swift and Kelce, who announced their engagement in August 2025.
Describing the plot of one such novel in the popular genre, Morning Glory Milking Farm, Maher said: “One thing leads to another and she winds up f****** a guy who’s half bull ... which brings me to Taylor Swift.”
As a photo of Swift and Kelce, a tight end for the Kansas City Chiefs, flashed on the screen, Maher continued, “Hear me out. I think Taylor Swift epitomizes the journey a lot of women have been going through. Yes, women wanted men to be more sensitive — sensitive, but not some noodle-bodied human turtleneck who wears the same clothes they do.”
“Taylor Swift went from writing songs about what a d*** this guy was to her, and what a d*** this guy was to her, to what a d*** this guy has,” Maher continued, seemingly referring to Swift’s song “Wood” from her latest album, The Life of a Showgirl. “She dated a procession of skinny, gay-adjacent, meek porcelain doll, shy guy, twink-like, tortured poet metrosexuals in America and Europe. But that second she got some old school wood from the Heartland, it was game over,” he added.
The ninth track on the pop star’s latest album, which launched in October, is replete with sexual innuendos about how Kelce’s love changed her life.
“Forgive me, it sounds cocky / He ah-matized me and opened my еyes / Redwood tree, it ain’t hard to see / His love was the key that opened my thighs,” Swift, 36, sings in the post-chorus.
“And baby, I’ll admit I’ve been a little superstitious (Superstitious) / The curse on me was broken by your magic wand (Ah) / Seems to be that you and me, we make our own luck / New Heights (New Heights) of manhood (Manhood),” continues Swift, referencing Kelce’s popular New Heights podcast. “I ain’t gotta knock on wood.”
Kelce shared his verdict on the tune during an October episode of his podcast, hosted alongside his brother, Jason Kelce, saying: “It’s a great song!”
Jason later gave his seal of approval as well, saying: “I think inserting wood innuendos is always childish enough for me that I can get on board with that.”

Venezuela frees 17 political prisoners, opposition movement says
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
Feb 14 - Venezuela on Saturday freed 17 political prisoners, the human rights committee of opposition movement Vente Venezuela said in a post on X.
CLIPPVE, a nongovernmental organization, separately reported the release of the political prisoners, who included 10 men and seven women from the Zona 7 Prison in Caracas.
Relatives outside the prison joined a hunger strike initiated by prisoners after only 17 of more than 50 detainees were released, human rights groups said.
CLIPPVE said the protest is a demand for the government to fulfill a pledge made last week by Jorge Rodriguez, head of Venezuela's National Assembly, to grant liberty to everyone held at the center.
Venezuela has been gradually releasing detainees following the January 3 capture of President Nicolas Maduro by the United States, though the process has drawn criticism from rights groups and families who say the pace has been slow and lacks transparency.
The releases come after Venezuelan lawmakers on Thursday postponed a debate on an amnesty bill that is meant to grant immediate clemency to individuals jailed for participating in political protests.
Rights group Foro Penal says it has verified more than 430 releases of political prisoners since January 8, though it does not include those moved to house arrest in its count.
The group estimated on Saturday that more than 644 political prisoners remain jailed, a figure that includes 47 people whose whereabouts are unknown and 57 people recently reported as prisoners.
The government denies holding political prisoners and says those jailed have committed crimes. Officials have given a much higher figure of releases - nearly 900 - counting liberations from previous years in their figure.
The government has never provided an official list of how many prisoners will be released, nor who they are. REUTERS

MUNICH, Germany — The U.S. is being much less offensive at this year’s Munich Security Conference but one of Europe’s top Trump whisperers sees it as a shift in tone, not substance.
“American foreign policy has changed,” Alexander Stubb, the president of Finland and occasional golf buddy of President Donald Trump, said in a live interview with POLITICO, pointing to the U.S. National Security Strategy that reserved some of its harshest remarks for American allies in Europe and recent messaging from senior officials.
The American approach combines ideology and hierarchy, he said: “One is ideological: It’s very MAGA … and then the second strand is America First.”

Frech prosecutors announce special team to analyse Epstein files

French prosecutors announce special team to analyse Epstein files
The Paris prosecutor's office on Saturday announced it was setting up a special team to analyse files relating to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and investigate suspected crimes involving French nationals. As part of that initiative, they will be reopening their files on the late Jean-Luc Brunel, a former French modelling agency executive.
The Paris prosecutor's office on Saturday announced it was setting up a special team of magistrates to analyse evidence that could implicate French nationals in the crimes of the convicted US sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.
With Epstein's known circle now extending to prominent French figures after the release of documents by the US authorities, the prosecutor's office said it would also thoroughly re-examine the case a former French modelling agency executive Jean-Luc Brunel, a close associate of the American financier, who died in custody in 2022.
The new team will work closely with prosecutors from the national financial crimes unit and police with a view to opening investigations into any suspected crimes involving French nationals, the Paris prosecutor's office told AFP.
The aim is "to be able to extract any piece that could be usefully reused in a new investigative framework", it said.
Read moreNew conspiracy theories hold that Jeffrey Epstein is alive and well
Brunel was found dead in his cell in a Paris prison in 2022 after having been charged with raping minors. The case against him was dropped in 2023 in the wake of his death, with no other person charged.
Prosecutors said an investigation had showed Brunel was "a close friend of Jeffrey Epstein" who had offered modelling jobs to young girls from poor backgrounds.
He had engaged in sexual acts with underage girls in the United States, the US Virgin Islands, Paris and the south of France, they said.
Ten women had made accusations against Brunel, several describing how they had been led to drink alcohol and had been subjected to forced sexual penetration, according to the prosecutor's office.
New cases
Several French public figures feature in the latest US Department of Justice release of material from the Epstein files, though being mentioned there does not in itself mean any offence has been committed.
The prosecutor's office said it had been asked to look into three new specific cases involving a French diplomat, a modelling agent and a musician.
At the request of the French foreign ministry it was looking into the reported appearance of senior diplomat Fabrice Aidan in the cache of Epstein-related documents published by the US authorities.
"An investigation is underway to gather various pieces of evidence that could substantiate this report," the prosecutor's office stated.

The prosecutor's office has also received a complaint filed by a Swedish woman against Daniel Siad, a model recruiter with close ties to Epstein. She accused him of "sexual acts that she describes as rape and that may have been committed in France in 1990".
The office has also received a complaint filed against French conductor Frederic Chaslin alleging acts of sexual harassment allegedly committed in 2016, it said.
The latest release of Epstein files has led to French former minister Jack Lang resigning from his position as the head of a top cultural body, the Arab World Institute.
Lang has however denied any wrongdoing, saying he was "shocked" that his name appeared in the statutes of an offshore company Epstein founded in 2016.
The office of the national financial prosecutor said it had opened a preliminary investigation for "aggravated tax fraud and money laundering" against Lang and his daughter Caroline Lang.
Following this announcement, Lang resigned from the presidency of the Arab World Institute (IMA).
Epstein died in prison in 2019 while awaiting trial for trafficking children, in what the US authorities ruled was a suicide.

Trump made the remarks Thursday, shortly after Netanyahu departed Washington at the end of a brief visit. "The Israeli president should be ashamed that he has still not granted a pardon to Prime Minister Netanyahu," Trump said.
Herzog heard the comments while flying back to Israel from a multi-day state visit to Australia. He responded in an official statement, saying: "Israel is a sovereign state."
On Friday, Trump was asked again about the issue and said he was convinced that Netanyahu would receive a pardon.
Meanwhile, the Justice Ministry is expected in the coming days to transfer its legal opinion regarding a possible pardon for Netanyahu to the President's Residence, where the Pardon Department operates. The opinion is being formulated by representatives of the attorney general, the State Attorney's Office and the ministry's Pardon Department.
As of now, no official response has been issued by Netanyahu or by the Likud party. However, sources close to Likud estimate that the prime minister is expected to contact Herzog this week in an effort to ease tensions.

Brazilians celebrate 'Carnival in the Italian snow' as Alpine skier wins Olympic gold
With Brazil entering the joyous throes of Carnival, Alpine ski racer Lucas Pinheiro Braathen just gave it another reason to celebrate: an Olympic gold medal at the Winter Games
- Bookmark
With Brazil entering the joyous throes of Carnival, Alpine ski racer Lucas Pinheiro Braathen on Saturday gave it another reason to celebrate — an Olympic medal.
It was the first-ever medal at the Winter Games for any country in South America. And not just any medal: Gold.
The win for the 25-year-old known in Brazil as “O cara do ski” — the skiing dude — happened on the first full day of Carnival, the pre-Lenten party that fills city streets with revelers drinking and dancing to their hearts' content. Even if lots of ordinary Brazilians were more preoccupied with that bacchanal, Pinheiro Braathen's gold-medal glory bumped Carnival news from top spots on major news websites and many commemorated. It was another in a series of recent scores for Brazil on top global stages that have provided what some view as long-overdue acclaim.
“This has become one of my top five Brazil gold medals in Olympic history, no doubt,” radio host and sports fanatic Thiago Varella, 41, told The Associated Press from Campinas, a city where Pinheiro Braathen has relatives and took several childhood vacations. “He will be our skiing dude forever. Even people who don’t understand the sport now will come to admire his story and his Brazilian-ness.”
In Milan, several hundred fans packed into Brazil House, a gathering spot organized by its Olympic committee. They erupted, toasting their beer bottles and singing soccer-style chants with Lucas' name. Michelin-starred Brazilian chef Raphael Rego distributed warm cheese bread, traditional breakfast fare back home, before dancing to samba alongside Bruno Fratus, a bronze-winning swimmer in Tokyo’s Summer Games. Wearing green-and-gold, many joined a conga line led by Ginga, the Brazilian Olympic team’s mascot.
“We’re used to this feeling a lot in (soccer), sometimes in volleyball, but, you know, it’s a winter sport, it’s a snow sport,” said Aline Fialho of Recife, in Brazil's northeast. “We don’t have snow in Brazil, so it’s a little bit surreal, but I feel very proud.”
Waking up to a win
The soccer-mad nation of 213 million excels at sports in the Summer Olympics, but not so for those on ice and snow. So Pinheiro Braathen and skiing were unlikely to have been at the top of most Brazilians' minds even in a non-Carnival weekend.
Still, the nation started getting excited as it woke up to the possibility of his achievement. At 6 a.m. local time Saturday, the country’s dominant TV network, Globo, was showing alpine skiing alongside Carnival coverage.
After his second and final run, Globo played a song that many Brazilian men, women and children know, bringing home his victory's importance. “Tema da Victoria” ("Victory Theme," in Portuguese) was the soundtrack after every win by Formula 1 driver Ayrton Senna, a national hero and three-time champion who often challenged and defeated European rivals.
“It is a Brazilian Carnival in the Italian snow!” said TV Globo commentator Paulo Andrade.
In Rio de Janeiro, people were split between curious and celebratory.
Driver Alexandre Novais heard about the skier competing in Italy, but didn't know his name. Stopping at a gas station in Rio’s up-market Ipanema neighborhood, he was impressed that anyone from Brazil could compete in the snow — a far cry from the 30 Celsius degrees (86 Fahrenheit) in Rio. Pinheiro Braathen until 2023 competed for Norway, switching to Brazil last season and adding his mother’s surname.
“I heard of him, I am glad he won," said Novais, 35. "I'm more of a soccer fan, but anyone who chooses to be Brazilian deserves our support.”
Nathalia Martínez, a 25-year-old Colombian in Rio for Carnival, was in her hotel’s lobby when people started screaming with joy. She said she felt proud to see the Brazilian cry as he tried to sing the national anthem.
“That’s 100% Latin America. No Norwegian athlete would be so emotional on the podium. I can say I felt a little represented by him, too,” Martinez said. “I'm really curious to see whether Brazilians will start wearing skiing gear as Carnival costumes.”
Another big win for Brazil on a global stage
Pinheiro Braathen, 25, has embraced his Brazilian heritage, giving interviews in Portuguese and decorating his helmet with “Vamos Dançar” — “Let’s Dance”. He has said his start in sports came from soccer, not skiing, and that his first hero was the World Cup-winning Ronaldinho.
Pinheiro Braathen’s quest for Olympic glory forms part of the nation’s recent achievements on the world’s biggest stages. Many Brazilians have lamented that the country and its cultural makeup and output have long gone underappreciated. There's even an infamous term that for decades encapsulated what writer Nelson Rodrigues perceived as Brazil’s sense of inferiority compared to other nations: “mongrel complex." He coined it in 1950, following the national soccer team’s humiliating World Cup loss at home.
That has been changing. The feature film “I’m Still Here” had box office success at home and abroad, and its nomination for three Academy Awards created something of a frenzy ahead of the awards ceremony last March. It won best international feature, giving Brazil its first Oscar. This year, the film “The Secret Agent” has been nominated for three more, including best picture and best actor.
Pinheiro Braathen’s supporters in Milan said he has helped Brazil gain recognition beyond its usual claims to fame.
“We are showing that we are more than samba and football,” said Giovana Biondo, who is from Sao Paulo and volunteering at the Games. “We love both and we are still very good at both. But I think it’s really sending a message to the whole planet that we are more than the Carnival.”
After his win, Pinheiro Braathen told Globo that he wanted to share his victory with everyone cheering for him in Brazil.
“This can be a point of inspiration for the next generation of children, showing them that nothing is impossible. It doesn’t matter where you’re from. What matters is what’s inside. What the heart does," he said. "I bring Brazilian strength today to bring this flag to the podium. This is Brazil’s.”

When antisemitism becomes normal, what comes next?
Unknown

Antisemitism has risen to such high levels around the world that William Daroff says he does not know if there will ever be a moment when Jews can declare victory. The best they can hope for, he told the ILTV Podcast, is to reach a point where Jews can say “that people feel a little safer.”
Daroff, the CEO of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations, is in Israel for the group’s annual event, which kicks off on February 15. He visited the ILTV studio to discuss the state of world Jewry in the aftermath of October 7, pointing to the “metastasizing of antisemitism and Jew hatred to a point where it is normalized in a way that also wouldn’t have been fathomable 10 years ago.”
He described the situation as “incredibly troubling” and warned that the “biggest danger” for Jews is when any level of antisemitism becomes acceptable, especially when there is a belief that as long as it stays at a low simmer, it can be managed.
“I think what we’ve learned since October 7 is that there is no baseline that’s acceptable,” Daroff told ILTV.
According to Daroff, antisemitism has increasingly shifted to focus on Israel. While openly attacking Jews is no longer socially acceptable in many spaces, attacking Israelis often is. He said antisemites now hide behind what they call “legitimate criticism” of Israel, but stressed that it is not legitimate.
Since October 7, Daroff said many progressive Jews in the United States have become politically homeless, feeling alienated both from the Democratic Party and from more conservative figures like President Donald Trump.
“I think there are moderates in both parties who are looking to try to engage and bring a bigger audience towards them,” Daroff said. “I think in the mainstream in both parties there are leadership roles that [Jews] can take and are taking. I think that it is incumbent upon all of us, but particularly those who are involved in both parties, to say that this antisemitic, anti-Israel filth on the far left of the Democratic Party and the far right of the Republican Party are totally unacceptable.”
Watch previous ILTV Podcasts:
At the same time, Daroff noted reports suggesting that as many as one-third of Jewish voters in New York supported Mayor Zohran Mamdani, who is openly anti-Israel and, some argue, antisemitic. Daroff said he believes the figure is somewhat lower, but said the result highlights a deeper political failure.
“You cannot beat someone with no one,” he said.
Daroff added that “with all due respect to Mayor [Eric] Adams and Governor [Andrew] Cuomo, they were both flawed candidates, particularly flawed against a young, charismatic candidate with no negative record.”
He said the two older leaders were running against someone who promoted ideas like unicorns, free rent, and free buses, without facing serious scrutiny.
“If there had been a credible opposition, I think there would have been a credible campaign against him,” Daroff said. “It is troubling that his statements and beliefs weren’t disqualifying, but I think given the opposition, we didn’t give the voters of New York really a fair shot at voting up or down on Mayor Mamdani.”

Will Warsaw become the seat of a new EU agency? To be decided in March
Unknown

Warsaw is one of the candidates for the location of the new EU Customs Office. In the background, however, there is a political battle and a race against a gigantic technological challenge.
At stake is prestige, hundreds of jobs and influence over how the European Union will protect its economic borders for decades to come. The new office is expected to be operational this year and will become fully operational two years later.
Who will Warsaw face?
The list of candidates is long. In addition to Warsaw, the following are Liège (Belgium), Malaga (Spain), Lille (France), Zagreb (Croatia), Rome (Italy), The Hague (Netherlands), Porto (Portugal) and Bucharest (Romania).
Each city plays its own card. The Hague is promoting closer ties with Europol. Belgium and France are betting on logistics.
Poland is bringing geopolitical and operational arguments to the table: Warsaw is already home to the EU border agency Frontex, and the Polish government argues that, in an age of hybrid warfare, security and the synergy among these institutions are key.
The argument is simple: since customs officers and guards are fighting the same threats, they should work side by side.
Why is it worth the effort?
"On the one hand, hosting the headquarters of the EUCA offers more opportunities to actively participate in the process of reforming the customs union. On the other hand, it is an economic growth opportunity for the host city," Małgorzata Krok, Plenipotentiary of the Minister of Finance and Economy for the application to establish the headquarters of the EU Customs Authority (EUCA), told Euronews.
"The new agency means increased business and tourist traffic, as well as the arrival of EUCA employees with their families. The EUCA is expected to eventually employ 250 people, but this number may increase in the future," she said.
"Warsaw offers direct flights to all EU countries, as well as to candidate and partner countries. The synergy with Frontex, the proximity to all types of border crossings and the experience of our administration in customs matters and the creation of large-scale tax and customs IT systems, create optimal conditions for the development of the EUCA," Krok added.
Polish diplomats also point out, behind the scenes, the weaknesses of rivals, noting that being a logistical hub for e-commerce, like Belgium or the Netherlands, in the era of the flood of cheap parcels from Asia can be a burden.
Poland's biggest rival, however, is identified as France, which has been courting the agency for quite some time.
Not only taxes, but also security and technology
"The role of the tax collector has evolved into a guardian of the single market, the competitiveness of the economy and the security of citizens. It's not just a question of smuggling or terrorism, but product compliance," Magdalena Rzeczkowska, former Minister of Finance, added in an interview with Euronews. Rzeczkowska also previously managed the National Tax Administration and observed the evolution of customs from paper declarations to the digital age.
The former minister draws attention to our asset, namely the Frontex seat. The argument about the synergy of institutions is considered crucial, especially in the context of the security of the eastern flank: "We are talking about integrated border management, and this synergy is an important element. It is at the interface of the work of these institutions that security can really be built."
Furthermore, the former minister points out that EUCA will also be a technology hub. "It should definitely not be officials in a suit, for the reason that the main task will be not only to build but also to maintain the EU Customs Data Hub," she points out.
Rzeczkowska is echoed by Minister Krok: "The heart of the current customs reform will precisely be the data hub. The agency itself, on the other hand, will be the brain, analysing customs issues and risk at the EU level. With this, the agency has the potential to become a research and development centre in the customs area."
What is the Customs Data Hub?
The struggle for localisation is only one dimension of the story. The real challenge is what the EUCA is supposed to manage: The EU Customs Data Hub.
Experts call this system the 'nervous system' of the new customs union. Instead of 27 separate national systems, the Union wants to create a single, unified database. This is supposed to enable real-time tracking of goods and the detection of dangerous products using artificial intelligence.
The reform is being driven by the crisis. According to European Commission forecasts, 5.6 billion parcels, the vast majority of which come from China, were expected to enter the Union in 2025. The current system is inefficient, and customs officials themselves are unable to physically control such a mass. The result? Europeans lose billions of euros in unpaid customs duties and taxes. It is this system that the new authority aims to seal.
However, business warns: without cooperation with the private sector (courier companies, e-commerce platforms), the construction of the 'Data Hub' could end up paralysing trade. The logistics industry has warned that the deadlines for implementing the changes are very tight and that the technical specifications remain unclear.
The industry itself adds that, without consultation with practitioners, the ambitious digital reform could lead to bottlenecks that will hit European consumers. At the same time, the Polish bid relies precisely on the argument that only a 'digital stronghold' with experience in crisis management will bear the burden.
This is why Warsaw, in fighting for the EUCA, is bidding not just to host officials, but to be the operational centre that must bear the biggest customs reform in the history of the European Union.
EUCA. The backstage of the competition
And what does the behind-the-scenes look like at the moment? Here, Minister Rzeczkowska is under no illusions about the nature of the choice of seat: "At the end of the day, it will be a political decision, although it shouldn't quite be. We should look from the point of view of the independence of the institution".
"We made a conscious decision to run for this office because we believe that it is in Warsaw that it will develop best. We are now actively persuading the decision-makers to do so," indicates Krok, recalling that the decision will be made by the EU Council and the European Parliament.
The final verdict will come in March 2026. That is when it will become clear whether Brussels prefers to bet on the proven trade routes of the west or on a digital shield on the eastern flank - and whether the centre of gravity is finally shifting to the east in Europe's new architecture.

This photo gallery, selected by the Associated Press, highlights some of the most spectacular falls of the Milan Winter Olympics.
The most shocking event in the figure skating arena
Malinin, the heavy favourite for gold, experienced a catastrophic collapse during his free skate on Friday
Malinin attempted his signature quadruple Axel but "popped" the jump, being able to complete only a single rotation. He followed this with two more falls on quadruple Lutz attempts. As a result, he finished in 8th place, nearly 30 points behind the gold medalist, Mikhail Shaidorov of Kazakhstan.
Malinin was visibly distraught, telling reporters that the "pressure of the Olympics really gets you" and admitting he felt overwhelmed before his music even started.
Lindsey Vonn’s heartbreaking comeback
At 41 years old, Alpine skiing legend Vonn’s highly anticipated Olympic return ended in tragedy on the Olimpia delle Tofane course in Cortina d'Ampezzo.
Just 13 seconds into her downhill run on Sunday, Vonn clipped a gate with her right arm, sending her pinwheeling down the slope at high speed. She was airlifted from the mountain and underwent surgery in Treviso for a complex tibia fracture in her left leg.
While the crash likely marks the final end of her competitive career, "no regrets" about attempting the comeback, Vonn posted on social media that

Netanyahu to skip Trump's Gaza summit, Sa’ar to attend

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will not attend next week’s Gaza Board of Peace summit in Washington, with Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar set to represent Israel instead, officials said.
Netanyahu’s office announced Wednesday, during his visit to the United States, that he would not travel to the summit and would participate remotely in the annual policy conference of AIPAC. Both events were seen as politically sensitive for the prime minister.
At the AIPAC conference, Netanyahu had been expected to speak alongside opposition leader Yair Lapid. The Gaza Board of Peace includes a number of Arab and Muslim leaders and senior officials, including representatives from Turkey and Qatar.
Sa'ar’s participation comes amid concerns in Jerusalem about possible external pressure to impose a Gaza settlement under terms the government views as unfavorable.
Last month, after the names of members of the Gaza Executive Board were made public — including officials from Turkey and Egypt — Netanyahu’s office said the composition had not been coordinated with Israel and ran counter to its policy. The prime minister instructed Sa'ar at the time to raise the issue with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio.
The summit is scheduled for Thursday. According to Reuters, U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to announce a multibillion-dollar reconstruction plan for Gaza and outline proposals for a UN-authorized stabilization force for the Palestinian enclave.
Delegations from at least 20 countries are expected to attend, including Turkey, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Qatar. One official described contributions to the reconstruction effort as “generous,” adding that the United States had not formally requested donations. “People came to us and offered,” the official said.
Trump is also expected to announce that several countries plan to provide thousands of troops to the stabilization force, which could be deployed in Gaza in the coming months, officials told Reuters.
A key concern is the disarmament of Hamas fighters, who have shown resistance to relinquishing their weapons. Under Trump’s Gaza plan, members of the terrorist group who commit to peaceful coexistence and disarmament would be granted amnesty, while those seeking to leave Gaza would be given safe passage to host countries.
The summit will also include detailed briefings on the work of the National Committee for the Administration of Gaza, established to replace Hamas in the territory’s day-to-day civilian governance. The committee announced its members and held its first meeting in January.
Additional updates are expected on humanitarian aid to Gaza and on plans to establish a local police force in the enclave.

UK premier, EU Commission chief agree Europe must step up toward 'more European NATO'
Keir Starmer, Ursula von der Leyen reaffirm commitment to continue work to bolster collective defenses 'in face of growing threats to European security'
LONDON
British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen agreed that Europe must step up efforts to build a stronger European pillar within NATO while safeguarding transatlantic ties, according to a statement on Saturday.
Meeting on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference, the EU Commission chief and the British premier reaffirmed their commitment to continue work that will bolster collective defenses "in the face of growing threats to European security."
"They agreed that Europe needs to step up and work towards becoming a more European NATO, while protecting our strong transatlantic ties," Starmer's office said in the statement.
Sharing his "high ambition" for the future UK-EU partnership, Starmer set out his desire for further integration across the economy, defense, and technology.
During the meeting, the pair committed to take forward further work ahead of the next UK-EU summit and also agreed to double down on existing negotiations to reach a food and drink deal which could lower prices.
In his address at the conference earlier on Saturday, Starmer said Europe must focus on decreasing "some dependencies," and called for creating a "more European NATO."

The ‘grey divorce’ phenomenon doesn’t signal a retreat from love. It’s a redefinition of it | Lisa Portolan

As Valentine’s Day approached we were once again flooded with the usual suspects: roses, chocolates, sophisticated dinners and glossy ads featuring young heterosexual couples staring earnestly into each other’s eyes. The problem isn’t just that this version of romance is exclusionary – though it is. It’s that it’s profoundly out of step with how love is actually being lived, negotiated and reimagined in contemporary Australia.
Culturally, love has long been framed as a pursuit of the young. From Romeo and Juliet to Normal People, from Bridget Jones to When Harry Met Sally, romantic fulfilment is depicted as something you secure early; ideally before your knees give out or your mortgage locks in. The message is consistent: find love in your 20s or 30s, settle down, and then coast (emotionally paired and narratively complete) until death do you part.
That story no longer holds (if it ever truly did).
In Australia, people over 50 are one of the fastest-growing cohorts actively seeking love – or, at the very least, rethinking what intimacy, partnership and companionship might look like in the second half of life. This shift isn’t marginal, it’s structural.
Research shows that close to a third of Australian divorces now occur after the age of 50; a phenomenon known as “grey divorce”. While overall divorce rates have declined since their 1990s peak, separations among over-50s have bucked that trend. Empty nest syndrome, financial pressures and retirement adjustments are all major drivers but beneath these factors lies something deeper: a recalibration of expectations about happiness, fulfilment and selfhood later in life. For many, the end of a long marriage isn’t a failure. It’s a reset.
This is where our cultural narratives lag behind reality.
In my research on dating, gender and intimacy, I found that ideas about love remain stubbornly temporal. There is still a perceived “right” time to marry, a sense that one should sow wild oats before settling down in one’s late 20s or early 30s. Miss that window and the language turns anxious: you’ve “missed the boat”, done things “out of order” or fallen behind the life schedule.
For people dating in their 50s and beyond, that temporal anxiety is amplified. They are acutely aware that they are out of sync with the story they were promised and yet, paradoxically, often far more intentional about what they want.
What became clear in my research is that older Australians come to love differently. Many women in their 50s, in particular, are seeking connection and companionship without cohabitation. They are reluctant to merge households, unwilling to take on unpaid caring roles for a new partner, and wary of financial entanglements that could jeopardise hard-won stability. This isn’t emotional coldness, it’s structural realism.
After decades of gendered labour – caregiving, part-time work or interrupted careers – many women enter later life with less superannuation, fewer assets and greater financial vulnerability. Add to this rising rates of homelessness among older women and the romantic ideal of “starting over” through shared property or pooled finances begins to look less like love and more like a risk.
Men and women do not arrive at later-life dating on equal footing, and pretending otherwise only reinforces outdated ideals of romance that no longer serve anyone.
Then there’s the dating landscape itself. For many over-50s, dating apps arrived suddenly and without warning; a brutal technological intervention into a world where courtship once involved friends, workplaces and chance encounters. For some, apps offered an unexpected abundance: a buffet of possibility, a way back into desire. For others, the swipe-and-discard logic felt alienating, even dehumanising, a sharp departure from slower and relational forms of connection.
Still, people adapt.
What’s striking is that despite the upheaval, many older Australians report being content on their own. More than half say they are satisfied with single life, particularly women, who cite independence, peace and personal space as key benefits. This doesn’t signal a retreat from love. It signals a redefinition of it.
We’re already seeing cultural green shoots. Programs like The Golden Bachelor have drawn large Australian audiences, suggesting a hunger for romantic stories that don’t centre youth. More broadly, as generation X moves into its 50s and 60s – the same generation that rebranded parenting, ageing and even grandparenthood (goodbye “Grandma”, hello “Gigi”), it’s unlikely they’ll accept inherited scripts about love without revision.
Love is about to be shaken up again.
The challenge now is to let our cultural narratives catch up with our social realities. Love doesn’t expire at 40. Romance isn’t invalidated by divorce. Intimacy doesn’t have to mean cohabitation, financial merger or lifelong sacrifice. For a growing proportion of Australians, love in later life is about alignment rather than aspiration, companionship rather than completion.
Love doesn’t belong to the young, and the sooner we rebrand it the better off we’ll all be.

The moment I knew: as soon as we parted I realised Hitomi was the one. I waited years to see her again

In my early 20s I quit my job in New Zealand and moved to Sydney to study martial arts. In 1982, after competing in the World Pugilist championships in Hong Kong, I hitchhiked around Japan for a month or so, then headed for Korea via ferry in January 1983. I’d heard air fares were cheap from Korea. No internet back then!
While boarding, I was approached by a very attractive Japanese woman, with limited English, who told me that if I bought one box of bananas and a bottle of Johnnie Walker Black label, I could pay for most of my trip in Korea. These items were very much in demand back then.
Her name was Hitomi. We ended up talking on the ferry – I had absolutely no Japanese, and she was learning English as a hobby. She and her friend were travelling to Korea to buy clothes and accessories to sell in Japan. I didn’t know anything about Korea so she suggested we travel together.
We stayed in Busan for a week, then in Seoul for another. Together we’d visit local temples or Busan Tower. We’d just met – I didn’t think there were any romantic feelings.
It turned out air fares were expensive in Korea, so Hitomi suggested I come back to Japan and spend some time in Miyazaki, Kyushu, where she lived with her mother. They lived in a valley, surrounded by rice paddies and koi ponds, with no other residences for a kilometre or so. Life was simple. Hitomi’s mother was amused by me, and treated me well – at the time.
Hitomi and I spent a lot of time travelling around Kyushu, visiting older people living on their own, others living with disabilities. She would often bring small gifts. I was becoming very attracted to her kindness, her always-cheerful personality, her lilting voice and laugh. She was beautiful on the inside and out. One local told me they thought she was an angel.
One day we visited Takachiho, a famous mountain gorge. Because of the snow and ice, we decided to spend the night in a local tavern. That night she asked me when I would return home. I told her I was falling in love with her and wanted to stay longer. She said: “Me too!” I had no idea she felt the same way, and was ecstatic. We kissed. It was soft and delicate, just like her.
Eventually my visa ran out and I had to return to Australia. She came as far as Narita to see me off; we kissed for ever and I almost missed the plane. We had plans for her to come to Australia as soon as she was able. I wasn’t thinking as far as marriage – this whole affair was completely unexpected for us both – but we were keen to see where it would lead.
As soon as I got back I realised Hitomi was the one. We had the odd phone call – expensive back then, so we primarily communicated through letters, in English. I have no idea how much she understood my writing although I tried to keep it as simple as I could, and I had an enjoyable but often difficult time understanding what she had written. All that mattered was the “love you” at the end.
She was trying hard to come to Australia but her mother was dead against it. So after a year I went back to Japan and hitchhiked down to a business hotel in Kyushu. Hitomi was working late, and I was just waiting in my room for her to arrive. There was a knock on my door. I opened it and she rushed into my arms, and a year’s worth of feelings spilled out. It was not a romantic place but I’d already decided I was going to ask her to marry me. And she said yes.
Her mother did not approve. Looking back, I can understand: I was an unknown quantity, a foreigner who was possibly going to take her daughter away. If Hitomi and I were going to be together, I would have to come to Japan.
I went back to Australia to start applying for a visa. Unbeknown to me, her mother was burning all my letters and hung up whenever I tried to call.
When I finally arrived back in Japan in 1988, I couldn’t contact Hitomi at all. She’d entered a singing competition, won a recording contract, and was travelling the country as a professional singer. Her manager and mother were blocking my attempts to contact her – their verdict was Hitomi had obligations and I would just complicate things.
This was a gut punch. Knowing I wasn’t welcome in Miyazaki, I stayed in Tokyo, enrolled in Japanese language school and worked in pubs, pachinko parlours and gyms.
One day a mutual friend called: Hitomi is in Tokyo and wants to meet you. We met at Shinagawa station in a coffee shop. We hadn’t seen each other in years. She had matured, and was as beautiful as ever, with her same sweet voice and manner. By this time my Japanese was better than her English and she was pleasantly surprised. After that we rekindled our relationship very quickly. We were madly in love. We were now 30 years old and, according to her mother, no one else was going to marry a woman that old!
In 1990, seven years after we met on that ferry, we had a wedding ceremony in a beautiful old church in Thames, New Zealand. Hitomi wore a white wedding dress then later changed into a kimono, which certainly turned heads in my small home town. Hitomi’s mother wore a kimono too – she’d come to accept that we could never be apart. My parents were totally enamoured of Hitomi and said to me on the day: “If you stuff this up, don’t bother coming home!”
We built a beautiful life together in Japan, with our two sons, and supported each other through thick and thin.
Hitomi passed away three and a half years ago. I consider myself lucky that we were able to find each other again, after so many years apart. We always said it was fate that we boarded that ferry. If we had a choice, we would have married much earlier. For 40 years, I could never take my eyes off her. She was always the most beautiful woman in the room.

Rubio gives Europe a Valentine’s bouquet, but the roses still have thorns

Rubio gives Europe a Valentine’s bouquet, but the roses still have thorns
What a difference a year makes. Or does it?
Twelve months ago, US Vice President JD Vance stormed into the Munich Security Conference, warning Europe that it was destroying democracy with its restrictions on free speech, censorship of social media and embrace of unvetted immigrants who didn’t share its way of life.
His dark speech, just weeks after his ascension to power, alarmed his European audience and put them on notice that under President Donald Trump, “there is a new sheriff in town”.
This year, the messenger was different – Secretary of State Marco Rubio – and so was the rhetoric. “The United States and Europe, we belong together,” Rubio said. “Ultimately, our destiny is, and will always be, intertwined with yours. We know that the fate of Europe will never be irrelevant to our own.”
Rubio directly repudiated what he said were headlines suggesting that the US sought to end the trans-Atlantic alliance. “This is neither our goal nor our wish,” he said. “For us Americans, our home may be in the Western Hemisphere, but we will always be a child of Europe.”
MSC chairman Wolfgang Ischinger, a former German ambassador to Europe, told Rubio there was an audible “sigh of relief” running through the room during his speech, characterising it as a “message of reassurance”.
That might be a case of hearing what you want to hear.
Rubio’s language may have been more conciliatory than Vance’s, but he hit upon much the same themes and priorities.
If Americans could sometimes seem “a little direct and urgent in our counsel”, Rubio said, it was only because they were so profoundly concerned about Europe’s direction.
Most pressing was the scourge of mass migration, which was not a fringe concern of little consequence but “a crisis which is destabilising societies all across the West”.
Controlling migration was not hateful or xenophobic, Rubio said. Rather, “the failure to do is not just an abdication of one of our most basic duties owed to our people, it is an urgent threat to the fabric of our societies and the survival of our civilisation itself”.
It was not dissimilar to what we heard from Opposition Leader Angus Taylor in his first pitch to the Australian public on Friday, vowing to shut the door to migrants who “hate our way of life”.
Rubio was scathing about what he described as a Western civilisation that was racked by guilt and shame, rather than being proud of its history, ancestry, language, Christian faith and shared sacrifices.
The West was also too fearful, he said: fearful of war, fearful of technology and fearful of climate change – which he described as a “cult”, echoing the language of his boss.
The so-called rules-based global order, which prioritises a set of international laws and norms above the use of raw power, was an “overused term”, Rubio said. The notion of a world without borders, where everybody was a global citizen, was “a foolish idea [that] has cost us dearly”. And the notion of free and unfettered trade was a delusion that had been exploited by the West’s adversaries.
Where Rubio differed slightly from Trump and Vance was the extent to which he conceded the same errors had been made by the United States.
“We made these mistakes together,” he said. “And now together we owe it to our people to face those facts, to move forward and to rebuild.”
Rubio’s remarks came hot on the heels of arguably the most consequential recent speech on the world stage – Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney’s declaration at Davos last month that there had been a “rupture in the world order”, and that middle powers like Canada or Australia had to forge a new path.
Although Carney didn’t mention Trump by name, he was clearly taking aim at the US president’s upheaval of global norms and institutions.
Rubio said those old institutions did not need to be dismantled, but they needed to be reformed and rebuilt. He pointed to the impotency of the United Nations, arguing it played “virtually no role” in forging the ceasefire in Gaza, pursuing peace between Russia and Ukraine, constraining Iran’s nuclear ambitions or ending the tyranny of Venezuela’s Nicolás Maduro – all of which were led by the US.
“In a perfect world, all of these problems would be solved by diplomats and strongly worded resolutions. But we do not live in a perfect world,” Rubio said.
One might quibble with how the US has gone about its actions – especially its handling of Russia and Vladimir Putin – but Rubio has a point when he says Washington is the one horse that’s always trying.
Appearing on a later panel in Munich, Australian Deputy Prime Minister Richard Marles was asked about the apparent death throes of the rules-based world order.
He said it was never the case that rules, and the enforcement of them, could be separated from pure power. But he seized on Rubio’s remarks as a happy middle ground.
“What Secretary Rubio said today was that there is an order which we should not be removing – repairing, but not removing – and I think it is well to remember that,” Marles said. “We should not easily cede the idea of what rules can do.”
Neither Europe nor the rest of the world should think they are off the hook. Rubio speaks with more diplomatic grace than Vance, but the substance is the same.
He may have handed Europe a Valentine’s Day bouquet, but the roses were still full of thorns.

Rise of Australia's public economy compares to mining boom of the 2000s

analysis
Rise of Australia's public economy is comparable to the mining boom of the 2000s, analyst says
You can't say the Albanese government didn't warn us.
Three years ago, after its 2022 election win, the government drew attention to some huge structural shifts that were hitting Australia's economy.
In its first major budget, it dedicated an entire section to talk about them: "Structural shifts shaping the economy."
"The Australian economy is changing in profound ways, with implications for society, policy, and public finances," it warned.
"While there are many structural shifts shaping our economy, this statement focuses on three, common across many advanced economies: the growing care and support economy; our expanding use of data and digital technology; and climate change and the net-zero transformation."
The government was signalling that its policies would be adapted to those long-term trends.
Fast forward three years, and what do we see?
Australia's care economy (childcare, aged care, disability care, etc) is expanding significantly to meet the needs of our population, and that has big implications for measured "productivity" and our public finances.
The global AI-race has become so intense that water-hungry and energy-hungry data centres are a new form of currency, in the ruthless war for data dominance, and it's sparking legitimate fears about the reality of the western surveillance state and Silicon Valley's techno-feudalism.
And the problems posed by climate change and the net-zero transformation are clear.
Should we pretend these things aren't happening?
Long-term trends, short-term spikes in inflation
That's why it was refreshing to see Westpac senior economist Pat Bustamante circulate a note on Friday that reminded everyone that long-term structural shifts have gravitational forces that are hard to escape.
In case you missed it, in recent weeks, there has been a heated debate in the daily news cycle about the return of inflation in Australia and the Albanese government's spending choices.
Economists and politicians have been arguing about public and private spending, and how public and private demand contribute to aggregate demand, the output gap, and inflation.
But some participants in the debate appear to have amnesia about the government's warning (from three years ago) that big structural shifts would dominate our economy in the coming years.
Those structural shifts are part of today's inflation story, too.
Thankfully, Mr Bustamante has reminded us that long-term trends are much bigger forces than any short-term spike in inflation.
"Australia is undergoing one of the largest structural changes in modern history, comparable in scale to the mining investment boom of the 2000s," he pointed out.
"Public spending now generates a record 35 per cent of domestic output, around 7 percentage points higher than a decade ago, and is linked to nearly 40 per cent of total employment.
"This shift is not inherently negative. However, it carries important macro implications."
What's he talking about?
As big as the mining boom
Mr Bustamante says a big expansion in public spending started in Australia a decade ago, it accelerated sharply during the pandemic, and persistently elevated public spending on expanded government programs since then has pushed the public footprint even higher.
See the chart below.
He says that increase in public spending means a greater share of the economy's resources is being directed toward the provision of public services, and a huge labour market reallocation has taken place that is "substantially larger" than occurred during the mining investment boom.
"Reflecting this expansion, public spending has generated an estimated 2.3 million additional jobs over the past decade, around 40 per cent of which are in market sectors," he says.
"Around 1.3 million of these jobs are attributable to the increased public share of economic activity, with the remainder driven by population growth.
"The breadth of these effects highlights that public spending influences labour market outcomes well beyond the non-market sector, with important implications for capacity, skills demand and wage dynamics."
See the impact on employment in the chart below.
He says the growth in public spending is also contributing to capacity constraints in sectors such as construction, health, education, and rental and real estate services.
He says with less spare capacity available, those sectors have a reduced ability to accommodate an upswing in private demand without generating upward pressure on prices and wages.
"This is consistent with the persistence of inflationary pressures in housing related costs, construction inputs, and health services," he says about our current problem with inflation.
A broader conversation, deeper understanding
Now, Mr Bustamante says the infrastructure pipeline in Australia appears to have peaked at a high level, and that may mean that the public share of construction output will gradually decline.
He says as we saw in the mining investment boom in the early 2000s, the resulting capital deepening that will result from that surge in infrastructure spending should support higher productivity levels for our economy.
But he says the large increase in employment in the care economy will weigh on labour productivity for a time, given how labour-intensive the childcare, aged care, and disability care sectors are.
He says he also thinks the expansion in public spending will probably peak in the next 12 months (roughly), although he says that forecast could be wrong.
But overall, his analysis helps to put things into better perspective.
The big expansion in public spending in Australia started a decade ago, and it has accelerated since then. It may be peaking soon. It is connected to some huge structural shifts in the economy, but it is also contributing to capacity constraints.
At the same time, the RBA has been trying to keep unemployment as low as possible without contributing to inflationary pressures, but it admits that it's a risky strategy that may be making the economy more susceptible to demand-side shocks at the moment (and more inflation-prone).
How much can we blame the Albanese government's spending choices for the pick-up in inflation in the second half of 2025?
This is not to say that it can't blamed.
But a good discussion about today's inflation would reference some of those big long-term economic trends that are grinding away in the background, which are changing the structure of the economy, alongside the daily inflation politics.

Zelensky hopes French support will not decline after Macron leaves office
He made the remarks during a briefing in Munich while responding to a question about Macron's term ending next year, Ukrinform reports.
"Emmanuel is with us. One year is still, essentially, a quarter of this war – it is a long period. I hope we can end this war within a year. Of course, much depends on the leader, but no less depends on public support. I believe the people of France support Ukraine and do not support Putin. That is why we count on this support and hope it will not decrease," Zelensky said.
At the same time, he noted that it would be a serious problem if France's future leader were to promote Russian narratives.
Macron was re-elected for a second consecutive term as President of France in 2022. His term is set to expire in May 2027.

More than 50,000 Israeli military personnel hold at least one additional foreign nationality, according to figures published Saturday by daily Yedioth Ahronoth based on official army data.
The newspaper said the information was released in response to a freedom of information request filed by the transparency advocacy group Hatzlacha.
Army data show that 50,632 soldiers have foreign citizenship alongside Israeli nationality. Of those, 12,135 hold US citizenship, the largest share by a significant margin, followed by 6,127 with French nationality and just over 5,000 with Russian citizenship.
The figures also include more than 3,000 soldiers holding German nationality and a similar number with Ukrainian citizenship. Over 1,000 troops apiece hold British, Romanian, Polish, Ethiopian, and Canadian citizenship, while the remainder are distributed among other countries.
According to the disclosure, 4,440 soldiers hold two foreign citizenships in addition to Israeli nationality, and 162 hold three foreign nationalities.
The report noted that the request was submitted nearly a year ago, in March 2025, marking what it described as the first detailed public breakdown of foreign citizenships among Israeli military personnel. The army did not clarify whether the data cover active-duty troops, reservists, or both.
Israeli media estimates put the number of active-duty soldiers at roughly 170,000, with some 400,000-460,000 registered reservists.

Chinese state media said that a widely shared video purporting to show a major road collapse in Shanghai was generated by artificial intelligence and was false.
A 49-year-old woman, identified only as Luo, was placed under administrative detention for spreading the misinformation, according to a notice from a local branch of the Shanghai Public Security Bureau cited by the Global Times.
Luo was accused of “claiming a partial ground collapse in a metro construction site in Shanghai to attract followers, causing adverse social impact,” the notice said.
The video circulated widely on social media Thursday and Friday. It claimed that a partial ground collapse had occurred at the construction site of the Jia-Min Line metro project in Shanghai’s Jiading district. The post also alleged it was the second such collapse risk in less than four months, according to the notice.
“After verification by the public security authorities, the information was found to be fake,” the notice said on Saturday.
Shanghai Metro said on its WeChat account that a localised leakage occurred on Wednesday on the Jia-Min Line. No casualties were reported.
On Thursday afternoon, however, Shanghai Shentong Metro Group told reporters that a collapse had occurred at the site in the same area as the leakage the previous day.
The area was sealed off and no one was injured, the company said. The cause remains under investigation.

US-Iran talks to resume in Geneva as tensions simmer

Switzerland announced Saturday the resumption of talks between the United States and Iran in Geneva next week, as Washington presses Tehran to reach an agreement aimed in part at limiting its nuclear program.
“I confirm that the Sultanate of Oman will host discussions next week in Geneva between the United States and Iran. Switzerland welcomes and supports these talks,” a Foreign Ministry spokesperson told AFP, without specifying a date.
“Switzerland stands ready at all times to offer its good offices to facilitate dialogue between the United States and Iran,” the spokesperson added, noting that the ministry “is in contact with the parties and has reiterated its readiness to support any diplomatic initiative aimed at promoting de-escalation.”
On Feb. 6 in Oman, discussions were held between Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi and U.S. President Donald Trump’s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, accompanied by Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner. Those talks were conducted indirectly, under Omani mediation.
Trump has recently focused military threats on Iran’s nuclear program, which U.S. forces struck in July during the 12-day war between Israel and Iran.
On Friday, the U.S. president openly raised the possibility of regime change in Iran, saying “that would be the best thing that could happen.”
Shortly beforehand, he confirmed that a second U.S. aircraft carrier would be sent to the region “very soon.”
Switzerland has played a key role in diplomatic relations between Iran and the United States for decades.
Known for its neutrality, the country has represented U.S. interests in Iran since Washington severed relations following the 1980 hostage crisis, a year after Iran’s revolution.
It allows for the maintenance of minimal diplomatic and consular relations between the two countries.
The Swiss Embassy in Tehran handles all consular matters between the United States and Iran, including passport applications, civil status changes and consular protection for U.S. citizens in Iran.

X removes verification badges from Iranian officials after sanctions report
Platform faces scrutiny over alleged paid services to sanctioned figures
ANKARA
The US social media platform X has removed blue verification badges from the accounts of several senior Iranian officials following a report alleging the platform provided paid services to individuals under US sanctions.
The move came after the Tech Transparency Project said X was offering its paid X Premium service to Iranian figures subject to US restrictions.
Accounts that lost verification included Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, Judiciary chief Gholamhossein Mohseni Ejei and Ali Larijani, secretary of the country’s Supreme National Security Council.
US sanctions on Iran prohibit American companies from conducting business with certain individuals and entities. X has not publicly commented on the removals.
The platform, owned by Elon Musk, previously replaced the Iranian flag emoji on its web platform with an older flag used by pro-monarchy groups opposed to the country’s current leadership.
Last month, amid a wave of protests in Iran, X updated the design of the Iran flag emoji shown on its web platform, replacing the emblem of the Islamic Republic with the older Lion and Sun symbol used by pro-monarchy groups.

MUNICH, Germany — Multiple European countries are publicly backing talks on a homegrown nuclear deterrent to complement American atomic weapons following an erosion of trust in a Donald Trump-led U.S.
Top officials from two Baltic countries told POLITICO that, while they still see NATO as the cornerstone of nuclear deterrence, they are now willing to talk about Europe’s role — adding fresh momentum to a debate that resonated through both public speeches and private conversations at the Munich Security Conference this weekend.
The rising pressure to start a serious nuclear conversation in Europe is a response to wavering confidence that the U.S. would repel a Russian attack, something that hasn’t lifted despite U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s relatively conciliatory tone in a speech Saturday morning.

Ukraine wants 20-year US security guarantee to sign peace deal

Ukraine wants security guarantees for a minimum of 20 years from the US before it can sign a peace deal with dignity, Volodymyr Zelenskyy said ahead of talks with Russia and the US scheduled for next week.
Speaking in Munich on Saturday, he also called for a clear date for Ukraine to be allowed to join the EU. Some EU officials have put the date as early as 2027.
Speaking to the annual Munich security summit, Ukraine’s president said he hoped “the trilateral meetings next week will be serious, substantive, helpful for all of us but, honestly, sometimes it feels like the sides are talking about completely different things”.
“The Americans often return to the topic of concessions and too often those concessions are discussed only in the context of Ukraine, not Russia,” he added.
The issue of Europe’s frustration with a perceived US reluctance to spell out the security guarantees it is prepared to offer Ukraine in the event of a peace deal, and the need for the guarantees to be spelled out before an agreement is signed, likely remains the biggest wound in the badly fractured relationship between the US and Europe.
In a speech that was welcomed by European leaders keen to see any sign of a thaw in the relationship, the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, put forward an offer to work in partnership with Europe.
However, this proposition, he stressed, was highly conditional and the US would go it alone if Washington’s highly Trumpian conditions were not met on climate, migration and tariffs.
Using a diplomatic tone that the US vice-president, JD Vance, shunned in his speech at the conference a year ago, Rubio said “Europe and the US belong together”.
He added that the US was ready to undertake the task of rebuilding the world order alone if necessary, but “we prefer it – and hope – to do it together with you, our friends in Europe”.
He made almost no reference to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, besides claiming that the US had pressed India to stop importing Russian oil, a claim Russia disputes.
At a press conference in Munich, Zelenskyy said the US had told him that if Ukraine withdrew from the Donbas, peace would come as quickly as possible, but he insisted this concession was not possible since Ukrainians live there.
He disclosed that the US had so far offered a 15-year security guarantee, but Ukraine wanted a minimum 20-year, legally water-tight agreement, setting out the specific help the US would provide to a planned European reassurance force due to be put inside Ukraine in the event of a peace deal.
Details of a so-called prosperity plan whereby the US would have access to Ukrainian mineral resources had not yet been exchanged, Zelenskyy said.
He also queried why the head of the Russian negotiation delegation had been changed, saying he feared it meant the Russians were playing for time, rather than shifting strategy.
Zelenskyy also complained about Europe having been practically absent from the table. “That’s a big mistake, in my opinion,” he said, a view that was shared by the Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi.
On Friday, Donald Trump called on Zelenskyy to “get moving” to reach an agreement with Russia.
Zelenskyy insisted that the elections that the US has pressed Ukraine to hold by 15 May can only take place two months after a ceasefire is declared, to ensure voters have adequate security.
Trump has been trying to put pressure on Zelenskyy to agree a deal within months, but has not spelled out the consequences if Ukraine is not sufficiently flexible for the US.
Zelenskyy also said the Russian attacks on Ukrainian energy plants would be raised in the talks in Geneva, adding that not a single energy plant inside Ukraine had now been left unscathed.
European leaders appear gloomy that a diplomatic breakthrough will be secured, with the consensus being that Vladimir Putin is not yet economically or militarily exhausted.
Zelenskyy said his ambition was to lift the number of Russians killed or seriously injured to 50,000 a month.
One European leader predicted at least another two years of war, and insisted Europe had the resources to sustain Ukraine for that long.
Zelenskyy also mounted a fierce attack on the Iranian regime for providing the Shahed drones that had caused so much damage inside Ukraine.
With as many as 200,000 protesters attending a demonstration in Munich calling for the Iranian regime to be toppled, Zelenskyy said: “We have never had a conflict of interests with the Iranian regime.
“But the Iranian Shahed drones they sold to Russia are killing our people and destroying our infrastructure.”
He argued that if Iran is given time, it will cause more destruction. “Regimes like the one in Iran must not be given time. When they have time, they only kill more.
“They must be stopped immediately, and this is exactly what should have happened with the Ayatollah after all the wars his regime unleashed and all the lives it took.”

Cynical Pakistan fans brace for heartbreak in India T20 World Cup match
As the match approaches, Pakistani fans hope and pray for their team to flip the script against their rivals.
Karachi, Pakistan – As rain and thunder threatened to disrupt their team’s T20 World Cup match against India on Sunday, Pakistan’s cricket fans are braced for a different storm – the now-customary loss against their archrivals at global events.
Pakistan have not beaten India in the tournament since 2021 when they recorded a solitary win in eight T20 World Cup encounters against their formidable opponents.

Despondent fans have now shifted from anticipating a thrilling, unpredictable game to praying for a miracle as Salman Ali Agha’s team step on the field at the R Premadasa Stadium in Colombo, Sri Lanka.
Pakistan’s latest “win” came in the form of a move to boycott the match on political grounds. Despite the eventual reversal of the decision after weeklong negotiations with the International Cricket Council (ICC), the initial decision to not take the field against India was seen as a triumph by cricket fans in Pakistan.
Despondent or optimistic, fans still eager for match
Escalating political tensions between the South Asian neighbours have seen a decades-old sporting rivalry turn into an ugly debacle both on and off the pitch with customary handshakes avoided and light jibes replaced by controversial hand gestures invoking their most recent armed conflict in May.
Politics and sport blur boundaries on both sides of the border, making these fixtures an exhibition of nationalistic pride that can sometimes turn distasteful.
The pre-match jingoism in Pakistan, though, was short-lived. It has been replaced by bitterly disappointed fans airing their thoughts in the form of self-deprecating memes or reels depicting the “foolishness” of a section of fans expecting a win.
“We’ll have heartbreak on February 14 and 15,” read the captions of several social media posts set to melancholic songs on Valentine’s Day, the eve of the match.
Supporters – both hardcore and casual – will religiously watch the three-plus-hour encounters. Come 6:30pm (13:30 GMT) on Sunday, the public will be glued to screens across the country to watch the high-stakes match.
Roadside tea stalls will be thronged by male spectators filling up wooden benches, plastic chairs or squatting on their haunches in front of small TV screens.
Food delivery riders busy with an overflow of match-day meal orders will occasionally halt their journeys to catch a glimpse of the action on their phones or through restaurant windows.
Upscale eateries will bring in large screens and host groups of young fans and families.
Domestic responsibilities will be wrapped up before the start of the match, and extended families will gather around a living room TV with drinks, snacks and feasts of biryani.
The weekend – now the standard time that all India-Pakistan matches are played for economic and logistical reasons – will offer some respite from an otherwise hectic schedule of school and office routines that throw the heaving metropolis of Karachi into transport turbulence.
India favourites, but Usman Tariq could spin a win
Despite the days of anticipation and hours spent preparing for the showpiece, fans remain realistic in their expectations.
On a balmy late Friday afternoon in Karachi as life gradually returned to its normal pace after an hour-long pause for midday prayers at mosques across the city, a group of young law students picked up their kits for a local league match.
“It’s looking 70-30 in India’s favour,” Talha Bandayal, a law student, told Al Jazeera as he watched his teammates play a cricket match in their local lawyers league at the historic Karachi Parsi Institute on Friday.
Bandayal and his friends plan to watch the match at a restaurant in one of Karachi’s posh localities.
“It’s a Pakistan-India match. We’re excited regardless of the result!”
Syed Ahmed Shah, who officiated the league match as a third umpire, was more sceptical of the team’s chances and more in tune with the country’s overall opinion of Pakistan’s expected performance.
“Sport is just like politics in our country,” a bespectacled Shah opined dryly to everyone’s amusement, drawing comparisons between the nation’s two most favoured topics.
“India is far superior to us, not just in cricket but everything,” Shah told Al Jazeera.
Cricket analysts have appeared on national talk shows throughout the week, dissecting the team’s shortcomings, the Pakistan Cricket Board’s organisational failures and the squad’s weak mental fortitude for a match of this proportion.
Local cricketers like Bandayal have been analysing Pakistani players’ strengths and weaknesses. Usman Tariq’s unreadable spin action and variations are being seen as Pakistan’s secret weapon.
When life comes to a standstill
When it comes to off-field behaviour, though, India’s trend of avoiding handshakes with Pakistani teams has been frowned upon.
“Politics should strictly be kept separate from sports,” a local cricket coach who requested anonymity said of Suryakumar Yadav and his team’s controversial actions from the Asia Cup last year.
“But if India takes that stance, Pakistan also needs to have some self-respect and respond accordingly,” the 46-year-old coach said.
Admittedly, the handshake row has taken centre stage in a fixture that has historically been remembered for scintillating bowling performances, swashbuckling innings or nail-biting finishes.
When Pakistan awakes on Sunday morning, most cricket fans will begin their day by playing their own cricket games – whether in narrow neighbourhood streets or vast, dusty fields hosting multiple matches simultaneously. As the evening draws closer, the clothes will be dusted off and equipment packed away for the showdown in Colombo.
Just as the hustle and bustle of life gave way for prayers two days earlier, the India-Pakistan match will do the same.
After all, it’s only cricket and Friday prayers that can bring life to a standstill in Pakistan.

German defence minister: Security guarantees for Ukraine must not become another Budapest Memorandum
German Defence Minister Boris Pistorius has stressed that future security guarantees for Ukraine must not meet the same fate as the Budapest Memorandum.
Source: Pistorius on Saturday during his speech at the Munich Security Conference, as reported by European Pravda
Details: Pistorius noted that as the potential ceasefire approaches, it will be necessary to ensure that any peace is lasting.
"We will have to protect Ukraine from any potential future aggression by Russia. For this major task, Ukraine needs substantial and reliable security guarantees," the German defence minister emphasised.
He recalled that Marco Rubio pointed out in the US Senate in 2014 that the 1994 Budapest Memorandum had failed to fulfil its purpose and did not protect Ukraine, as Russia invaded and annexed Crimea.
"So the lesson for us, ladies and gentlemen, must be that we must not allow another 'paper tiger' like the Budapest Memorandum. And in order to provide credible security guarantees, all of us – all of us, both Europe and the United States – must contribute. Europe and Germany are ready to do their part," Pistorius said.
Background:
- During a panel discussion earlier on Saturday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte expressed scepticism about Russia's willingness to engage in genuine negotiations and warned the West not to misjudge Moscow's intentions.
- During a visit to Kyiv, Rutte stressed that Ukraine's partners, just like Ukrainians themselves, "would not want a second Budapest Memorandum or another 'Minsk'."

Olympic organizers promise Valentine's weekend restock after condoms run out

Olympic villages ran out of free condoms. Organizers promise a Valentine's weekend restock.
On Valentine's Day at the Milan Cortina Olympics, a renewed supply of free condoms for the athlete villages was promised by the organizers after going short during the week.
"We can confirm that condom supplies in the Olympic Villages were temporarily depleted due to higher-than-anticipated demand," the Italian organizing committee said in a statement Saturday. "Additional supplies are being delivered and will be distributed across all villages between today and Monday."
Providing condoms for athletes has been a gift from organizers — and a constant fascination to the world — for decades.
While 300,000 condoms were provided for more than 10,500 athletes at the 2024 Paris Summer Games, the original stock was much lower for these Winter Games.
"I think 10,000 have been used, 2,800 athletes — you can go figure, as they say," International Olympic Committee spokesman Mark Adams said Saturday. "It clearly shows that Valentine's Day is in full swing in the village."
Reports of no condoms in week one of the games followed an absence of plush toys of the official mascots, Milo and Tina, in the opening days. They proved more popular than expected in the official Olympics merchandise stores.
Condoms are traditionally popular for Olympic athletes to take home as "a kind of gift" to friends, Alpine skier Mialitiana Clerc said Saturday.
"I'm not so shocked. I saw it in Beijing already," said Clerc, who also competed for Madagascar four years ago at the Winter Games in China. "There were some boxes with a lot of condoms at the entrance of every building where we were staying at the village."
"Every day, everything was (gone)," she recalled about Beijing at an IOC news conference Saturday to promote its scholarship program that helps hundreds of athletes to train and qualify for the Olympics.
"I already know that a lot of people are using some condoms or just taking them to give to their friends outside of the Olympics because it's a kind of gift for them," Clerc said.
There should be no further shortage in Italy until the Winter Games closing ceremony on Feb. 22.
"They will be continuously replenished until the end of the games to ensure continued availability," the local organizing committee said.

MOSCOW, February 14. /TASS/. One of Ukraine's Flamingo missile production lines was destroyed in a missile strike, Vladimir Zelensky announced at a news conference on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference.
"We don't have many of them. One large production line was destroyed as a result of a missile strike," he said, responding to a question about whether Ukraine had managed to resume production of Flamingo missiles as planned.
Zelensky added that he could speak about this because the incident occurred some time ago.
On August 21, Zelensky stated that Ukraine allegedly possessed a Flamingo missile with a range of 3,000 km, but that mass production would not resume for several more months. Later, a video purportedly from the missile production workshop appeared in Ukrainian media. Meanwhile, even Ukrainian analysts noted that the new allegedly "Ukrainian missile" is very similar to the British FP-5 Milanion.

SBU's Alpha special forces destroy half of Russia's Pantsir air defense systems in 2025
That is according to the SBU press center, Ukrinform reports.
"Pantsir is one of Russia's modern and key air defense systems. The cost of one system ranges from 15 to 20 million U.S. dollars. These gun-missile systems are the most effective in countering Ukraine's long-range drones," the statement said.
According to the security service, this is why the systematic destruction of Pantsir systems has a strategic objective: breaking through the enemy's air defenses and creating corridors to strike targets deep in the rear.
In particular, this enables Ukrainian forces to effectively hit Russian military bases, warehouses, airfields, and other enemy facilities.
The SBU also recalled that the total value of all Russian air defense systems destroyed by the Alpha unit in 2025 is estimated at around $4 billion.

Over 50,000 Israeli soldiers hold foreign citizenship: Report
More than 12,000 carry US nationality, the largest group by far, according to army data given in response to information request
JERUSALEM
More than 50,000 Israeli military personnel hold at least one additional foreign nationality, according to figures published Saturday by daily Yedioth Ahronoth based on official army data.
The newspaper said the information was released in response to a freedom of information request filed by the transparency advocacy group Hatzlacha.
Army data show that 50,632 soldiers have foreign citizenship alongside Israeli nationality. Of those, 12,135 hold US citizenship, the largest share by a significant margin, followed by 6,127 with French nationality and just over 5,000 with Russian citizenship.
The figures also include more than 3,000 soldiers holding German nationality and a similar number with Ukrainian citizenship. Over 1,000 troops apiece hold British, Romanian, Polish, Ethiopian, and Canadian citizenship, while the remainder are distributed among other countries.
According to the disclosure, 4,440 soldiers hold two foreign citizenships in addition to Israeli nationality, and 162 hold three foreign nationalities.
The report noted that the request was submitted nearly a year ago, in March 2025, marking what it described as the first detailed public breakdown of foreign citizenships among Israeli military personnel. The army did not clarify whether the data cover active-duty troops, reservists, or both.
Israeli media estimates put the number of active-duty soldiers at roughly 170,000, with some 400,000-460,000 registered reservists.

Russian embassy calls Western claims about Navalny's poisoning circus act, propaganda

LONDON, February 14. /TASS/. The Russian embassy in London has dismissed Western allegations regarding the poisoning of blogger Alexey Navalny - who is designated as a terrorist and extremist within Russia - as nothing more than a circus trick and necro-propaganda.
"We are once again compelled to highlight the political spectacle orchestrated on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference by representatives from Britain and several European nations," the embassy stated in a message obtained by TASS. "London claims that the toxin epibatidine was detected in certain samples allegedly linked to the death of a Russian citizen in 2024. Based on this, Russia is accused of violating the Chemical Weapons Convention."
The embassy further criticized the coordinated efforts of Western media outlets, political figures, and intelligence agencies, describing them as servile and complicit. "The purpose of this farcical performance is clear: to inflame waning anti-Russian sentiment within Western societies. When no real pretext exists, they simply manufacture one," the statement read.
Expressing disdain for what it called Western "fabrications," the embassy remarked, "What kind of person would believe such nonsense about a frog? Yet, the most troubling aspect is the necro-propaganda employed by Western politicians - an appalling attempt to mock the deceased. Even after a Russian citizen's death, London and European capitals refuse to let him rest in peace, revealing the true motives behind this campaign."
Russian diplomats also voiced skepticism about the Western 'conclusions.' "We place no faith in these so-called 'expert' assessments. Just as with the Skripal case - high-profile accusations, media hysteria, and no concrete evidence - there remain numerous unanswered questions that authorities prefer to ignore. So, in the end: is it poison from a South American frog’s skin or Novichok?" the embassy questioned.
On February 14, Germany, Britain, the Netherlands, Sweden, and France issued a joint statement asserting that Navalny was allegedly poisoned with epibatidine, a toxin derived from the skin of the Ecuadorian poison dart frog. Their conclusion was reportedly based on analyses of Navalny's biological samples. These countries accused Russia of violating the Chemical Weapons Convention in connection with the incident.

Finland beat Italy 11-0, set Olympic ice hockey shot record

Finland beat Italy 11-0 in their final men’s Olympic ice hockey group match in Milan, registering 62 shots on goal and breaking the Olympic single-game record.
The previous mark of 60 shots belonged to Sweden. Finland surpassed it in the closing minutes when Joel Kiviranta scored the team’s 11th goal.
The result leaves Finland on six points and with a goal difference of +11, placing them in strong position to advance directly to the quarter-finals as the best group runner-up.
Finland needed a three-point win to remain in contention for a direct place in Wednesday’s quarter-finals. Goal difference could prove decisive between group runners-up, and the margin against Italy reshaped the standings in Group B.
Slovakia topped the group, while Sweden dropped to third after results elsewhere. Without a late Slovak goal against Sweden earlier in the day, Finland’s scoring margin would not have carried the same weight.
Head coach Antti Pennanen praised his players after the match. “The players did a fine job again today. They prepared themselves and were efficient,” Pennanen told Yle.
He added that Italy, coached by former Finland head coach Jukka Jalonen, had competed well in the tournament.
“Italy have played well and credit to them for how they have fought in this event. Today they hit a wall,” Pennanen said.
Finland led 6-0 after two periods, outshooting Italy 38-8 at that stage. The third period brought five more goals and the record for shots.
In total, Finland directed 62 shots on goal compared with Italy’s 15.
The 11-0 victory ranks among Finland’s largest in Olympic history, though not the biggest. At the 1960 Winter Games in Squaw Valley, Finland defeated Australia 19-2.
Finland will learn their quarter-final opponent after the completion of the remaining group matches.

'I fought the only way I knew how, with my heart in my hands': a Valentine’s letter after 738 days in captivity

Six months ago, on Tu B’Av, often described as the Jewish Valentine's Day, Rivka Bohbot wrote a letter to her husband, Elkana Bohbot, while he was being held captive by Hamas.
In October, Elkana was released as part of a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas brokered by U.S. President Donald Trump.
Now, as Valentine’s Day falls on Saturday, Rivka has written to him again — this time about a love she says has been reborn after two years of separation.
“My beloved Elkana, this Valentine’s Day is unlike any we have ever known,” Rivka wrote to her husband.
“It carries within it everything we were, everything we survived and everything we are still learning to be. I want you to know that I waited for you. I waited through the long days and endless nights, when the uncertainty was overwhelming and hope was the only thing that held me up. I waited in fear, in faith, sometimes even in anger — but always in love. I fought the only way I knew how, with my heart in my hands, with a trembling voice and a weary soul, because giving up was never an option when it came to you.”
“I went through moments I never imagined I would face,” she continued. “There were days when I felt the world falling apart, and others when a small sign restored my strength. And in every one of those moments, you were there — in my thoughts, in my prayers, in every beat of my heart. And then you came back. And with your return came joy and relief … and also ups and downs. Because coming back does not erase what was experienced, and loving after so much pain requires patience, courage and tenderness.”
“We have had easy days and hard days, silences and learning, but even in the most complicated moments I never stopped choosing you,” Rivka added. “Today I want to tell you that I love you not only for who we once were, but for who we are today. I love you for your strength and also for your fragility, for your laughter and also for your wounds, for being here, for continuing to try. Our love is not perfect, but it is real, deep and full of hope. On this Valentine’s Day, I do not promise a path without challenges, but a hand that does not let go, a heart that believes and a love that continues to choose us. After everything we have been through, I still choose you. Today, tomorrow and every day. With all my love, yours always, Rivka.”
Elkana Bohbot was abducted from the Nova music festival on Oct. 7 and held in the Gaza Strip for 738 days.
On Tu B’Av, a video was released showing the wives of hostages addressing their partners in captivity. “I’m sorry that I’m crying — I know the last thing you want is to see me like this,” Rivka said in the video. “I miss you in every way that can be explained. It hurts in my bones.”

Israel's foreign minister to attend Board of Peace launch in Washington

Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar is expected to represent Israel at the Board of Peace launch meeting set to convene in Washington this week.
The upcoming summit will be the first gathering of the Board of Peace since the charter signing ceremony in Davos, Switzerland in January.
According to an invitation sent to member states, the Board of Peace is set to initiate international efforts to promote Gaza's reconstruction. The document states the effort aims to unite "countries, institutions and partners" in an ongoing campaign to "lay the foundations" for prosperity in Gaza.
Two senior U.S. officials told Reuters on Tuesday that during the summit, Trump will announce the plan of several countries to send thousands of troops each to the international stabilization force that is supposed to be stationed in Gaza as part of the Trump's plan to end the war.
The officials added that Trump will also outline the reconstruction plan for Gaza, amounting to billions of dollars. They said delegations from about 20 countries are expected to attend, including many heads of state.
The agenda for the meeting in Washington has not yet been publicized. Gaza's reconstruction is among the issues to be addressed, according to a source who added that the United States has already pledged funding for humanitarian efforts and administration for one year, and that the United Arab Emirates has committed to financing the effort.
He noted that the United States is exerting pressure on additional countries to finance reconstruction efforts and that the Board of Peace meeting is expected to focus on raising funds for a broader and longer-term reconstruction initiative.
On Friday, Board of Peace High Representative Nikolay Mladenov, outlined his vision for the near future of the Gaza Strip. In a speech delivered at the Munich Security Conference, he said that "Gaza needs to be governed by a transitional authority, as authorized by the Security Council resolution, under which it needs to take on the full civilian and security control of Gaza," referring to a technocratic committee operating under the supervision of the Board of Peace.
According to Mladenov, that requires "the disarmament of all factions in Gaza, not just Hamas: Hamas, Islamic Jihad and others," is the condition for Israel's withdrawal from the Yellow Line and for the start of Gaza.

South Africa’s Markram mauls New Zealand in seven-wicket T20 World Cup win
Captain Aiden Markram hits an unbeaten 86 in seven-wicket defeat of New Zealand in Ahmedabad.
South Africa are on the brink of reaching the Twenty20 World Cup’s Super Eight stage after captain Aiden Markram’s storming half-century led them to a dominant seven-wicket victory over New Zealand, securing their third straight Group D win.
New Zealand on Saturday suffered their first loss in the campaign after they posted 175-7 as South Africa’s Marco Jansen took four wickets.

In response, opener Markram hit four sixes and eight boundaries in his unbeaten knock of 86 off 44 balls, the highest by a South African captain in the tournament’s history, helping his team reach 178-3 with 17 balls to spare.
Last edition’s finalists South Africa chose to bowl first in Ahmedabad, India, and it immediately paid off as player of the match Jansen (4-40) dismissed most of New Zealand’s top order by the seventh over.
Finn Allen (31 off 17 balls) tried to mitigate the damage after Tim Seifert and Rachin Ravindra fell to Jansen. But Jansen got Allen caught at mid-off in the sixth over, leaving New Zealand struggling at 58-3.
Mark Chapman (48) and Daryl Mitchell (32) turned things around with a 74-run partnership for the fifth wicket until Jansen got Chapman caught by Ryan Rickelton at backward point in the 14th.
New Zealand scored only 17 runs in the next four overs until James Neesham’s unbeaten 23 off 15 balls got them to a fighting total.

Chasing 176, South Africa got off to a fast start with Markram hitting three sixes and five boundaries to steer his team to 62-0 in four overs.
Losing fellow opener Quinton de Kock (20) did not affect Markram, who hit Mitchell Santner for a six down long-on to reach his half-century in just 19 balls. By the time Rickelton (21) fell in the eighth over, South Africa had already crossed the 100-run mark.
With the required run rate falling below six per over, Markram did not hit a single boundary in the next seven overs and focused on rotating the strike, getting South Africa within 28 runs of victory with 30 balls left.
“It’s about managing it through the right phases, I guess, but up front, you’ve seen how teams are taking on the powerplay and we’d be silly not to try that. It’s not always going to come off, but when it does, … we can get ahead of the game,” Markram said.
David Miller, who scored an unbeaten 24, cleared the mid-wicket boundary to bring up the winning runs.
South Africa will conclude their group campaign against the United Arab Emirates on Wednesday, a day after New Zealand play Canada.

Documents reveal Epstein's money moved quietly through major investment firms

ALBAWABA - The U.S. Justice Department has just made public records that show how Jeffrey Epstein kept sending tens of millions of dollars, and in some cases hundreds of millions of dollars, into hedge funds years after his 2008 conviction. He did this by using a network of personal connections in the financial world.
Bloomberg says that documents show that an email exchange in 2016 between a hedge fund manager in Palm Beach and Epstein led to a big investment in Honeycomb Asset Management. Eva Andersson-Dubin, a doctor and long-time friend of Epstein's who later married hedge fund executive Glenn Dubin, is said to have made the introduction.
First Person to Support Honeycomb
The records show that Epstein was an early and important investor in Honeycomb, and he is called a "day-one" participant and co-investment partner. He kept putting money into the fund until just before his arrest and death in 2019, even though he was worried about how it would affect his reputation and major banks had cut ties with him.
The documents quote an email from 2017 that called Epstein a "great partner" when the fund was managing hundreds of millions of dollars. Honeycomb's assets rose to about $1.5 billion in 2020, but they fell in the years that followed.
Disputed Numbers in Highbridge Investment
The files also talk about Epstein's connections to Highbridge Capital Management again. Epstein said in a deposition in 2011 that he first put in between $50 million and $100 million, and then he raised his stake to more than $300 million. However, Glenn Dubin's representatives have disagreed with those numbers, saying that the initial investment was much lower and then completely withdrawn.
Epstein also said he made $20 million for helping JPMorgan Chase buy Highbridge in 2004, but Dubin's representatives disagree with this description.
Banking Scrutiny and Financial Disputes
The papers talk about more investments, like in DB Zwirn, where there were problems after accounting mistakes were found. At one point, Epstein wanted to get back more than $140 million, which caused long legal battles.
JPMorgan closed Epstein's accounts in 2013 because of concerns about regulations and his reputation. Still, hedge funds like Boothbay Fund Management, King Street Capital Management, and funds connected to Valar Ventures, which Peter Thiel co-founded, kept managing money that was connected to him.
Network Continued Access to Money
The records show that Epstein's long-term social and professional ties were very important for keeping his access to financial markets. Several fund managers have said that their relationships with him were only business, but the disclosures show that his money stayed in major investment vehicles until 2019.
The new information has brought back questions about how Epstein was able to keep up high-level business relationships even after being convicted of a crime and getting a lot of bad press.

EU accession process 'designed for peace,' needs 'solution' to bring Ukraine into bloc sooner, official says

EU accession process 'designed for peace,' needs 'solution' to bring Ukraine into bloc sooner, official says
The European Union's current accession processes and timelines do not reflect the geopolitical challenges faced by both Ukraine and the EU, Marta Kos, the European Commissioner for Enlargement, said on Feb. 14.
The official's comments address the possibility of Ukraine joining the bloc by 2027, a goal announced recently by President Volodymyr Zelensky. Reports then emerged that the EU is exploring a partial membership plan for Ukraine that would allow the country to join before completing all the necessary reforms required as part of the so-called accession process.
Previously, Kos made it clear that there would be no shortcut to Ukraine's EU membership: "(F)ull membership comes only after full reforms," she said on Feb. 13.
But speaking at a "Ukrainian Lunch" event organized by the Victor Pinchuk Foundation at the Munich Security Conference, Kos acknowledged that the bloc's current process doesn't take into account the realities of war.
"The methodology we are using now is designed for peace," Kos said on Feb. 14, as reported by Ukrainian outlet European Pravda.
"It is designed for times when there is plenty of time for a country to carry out all the necessary reforms. Sweden, for example, was the most developed country to apply for EU membership — but even Sweden took three years."
Kos said it was "not possible" for Ukraine to join the EU by 2027 under current structures, but called for a "solution" that would address the security crisis.
"So, based on the current methodology, accession on January 1, 2027 is not possible," Kos said.
"But we have to find a solution to bridge the gap between the current methodology and the geopolitical challenges. We cannot wait any longer."
Kos also said that Ukraine has already "made a positive contribution to the development of Europe." In particular, Ukraine has helped the bloc to remember "how important security is in Europe."
"Perhaps we have forgotten about this," she added.
Zelensky has said that Ukraine's EU membership is an essential security guarantee for Kyiv as it looks to negotiate an end to Russia's full-scale war, now nearing its fifth year. He also said he would not sign any peace agreement with the U.S., Russia, and Europe if it did not include a specific date for Ukraine's EU accession.
Ukraine applied to join the EU in February 2022, mere days after Russia launched its full-scale invasion.
Kyiv was granted candidate status in 2022, and the EU formally opened accession talks with Ukraine in 2024. However, de facto negotiations on specific accession clusters have not yet begun, and Hungary has used its veto power to block the process.

Winter storm threatens travel across Northern California this Presidents Day weekend
The National Weather Service has issued a stark warning and urging “extreme caution” to those travelling
- Bookmark
Northern California is under a winter storm watch this holiday weekend, with communities bracing for several feet of snow as people travel.
The National Weather Service has issued a stark warning for those heading to and from the Sierra Nevada and its popular ski resorts, advising of "major travel impacts" and urging "extreme caution."
Despite the impending severe weather, there remains a window for travel ahead of the cold system.
Dakari Anderson, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Sacramento, told The Associated Press that Saturday through Sunday morning is expected to be the "best travel window" for those making their way for Presidents Day weekend.
While there was some snow earlier in the week, conditions remained quiet on Saturday, Anderson said. But things are expected to pick up Sunday afternoon — with communities that are situated at elevations of 3,000 to 4,000 feet (914 to 1,219 meters) expecting to be blanketed with between 1 and 2 feet (30 and 60 centimeters) of snow.
“Our highest (snow) accumulations are going to be in those kind of more hard-to-reach places, but we’re still going to see some of those heavier amounts in communities that are populated,” Anderson said.
Communities in higher elevations could see much more snow — possibly 6 to 8 feet (1.8 to 2.4 meters). Among them, Anderson said, may be Blue Canyon, a sparsely populated unincorporated community that sits at 4,695 feet (1,431 meters) of elevation and is about 51 miles (82 kilometers) west of Lake Tahoe.
The City of South Lake Tahoe posted on its Facebook page a warning residents that if they drive on Monday they should “expect delays, possible road closures, and whiteout conditions.”
The Shasta County Sheriff's Office urged residents to take advantage of the clear weather Saturday and prepare for the storm. “It has seemed ‘spring-like’ for a large part of 2026, but winter is set to show it’s not quite done yet,” the agency posted on Facebook.
The winter event is expected to span several days and could also affect portions of western Nevada and southern Oregon.

Shocking footage appears to show scared children running from New Jersey bus stop as school blames nearby federal operation
Students in doorbell camera footage can be heard warning other children about the presence of ICE agents

Shocking Ring doorbell camera footage appears to shows the moment scared New Jersey schoolchildren ran from their bus stop as federal ICE agents carried out an operation nearby.
Lindenwold School District families were notified Thursday about a federal immigration enforcement operation that occurred around 8 a.m. at the Woodland Village Apartments. The district said 4th and 5th-grade students waiting for their buses were frightened and confused by the presence of multiple immigration enforcement vehicles and agents, causing some children to run from the bus stop, according to NBC10.
Students in the footage, posted to the public Hispanos Unidos en NJ Lindenwold Facebook page, can be heard yelling, “ICE, ICE.” In another video obtained by NBC10, one student alerts the others in Spanish, “ICE is there.”
“Our bus driver acted quickly and responsibly, circling back multiple times to ensure as many children as possible were safely transported to school. I would like to sincerely thank him for caring for our children and putting their safety first,” a school official said in a letter to parents also shared on the district’s Facebook page.
Hugo Cuello, 10, told NBC10, with his mother’s permission, that federal immigration agents were looking for his father and that he was at the bus stop with his mother when multiple vehicles arrived, prompting him to warn other children that ICE officers were present.
The outlet did not report what became of the alleged search for Cuello’s father, but obtained a separate video that appears to show several federal agents knocking on a door and waiting for someone to answer.
Fellow student Valery Pachecho Nunez claimed that ICE agents chased the fleeing students, and that she ran to a neighbor’s house because her mother was at work.
"It makes me feel sad because some people are leaving this country without their parents," she told NBC10.
Support was provided to upset students at the bilingual school, with counselors on hand to help, according to the report.
Federal agents were not present at any Lindenwold School District facilities and staff said they would closely supervise dismissal and bus loading.
“If your child is experiencing anxiety or distress related to this morning's events, I encourage you to reach out to your building principal so we can provide additional support,” school officials said.
In response to the incident, district officials reported reaching out to county and state representatives to advocate for protocols that prioritize the safety of children during any future enforcement operations.
The Independent has contacted the Lindenwold School District, Lindenwold Police Department and ICE for further comment.
The widespread footage prompted Lindenwold residents to protest Friday near the Woodland Village Apartments, WPVI reports. The crowd carried signs, played music and honked horns to show support for the local immigrant community.
U.S. Rep. Donald Norcross, a Democrat from New Jersey, joined the protest and said the video footage troubled him.
"What I saw in that video, children running away scared, this is how bad ICE is. That as soon as they heard, they ran home to their parents to see if they're OK," Norcross told the outlet.

What is epibatidine, and how did it kill Navalny? A guide to the frog neurotoxin that five countries say poisoned Russia’s opposition leader.
The poison used to kill Navalny
The United Kingdom, Sweden, France, Germany, and the Netherlands announced that a substance called epibatidine killed Alexey Navalny, the opposition leader who died in a Russian prison in February 2024. The discovery followed testing of biological samples that Navalny’s associates had smuggled out of Russia.
You’re currently reading Meduza, the world’s largest independent Russian news outlet. Every day, we bring you essential coverage from Russia and beyond. Explore our reporting here and follow us wherever you get your news.
What is epibatidine?
Epibatidine is a potent neurotoxin that disrupts nerve cell function.
Epibatidine accumulates in the skin of Epipedobates frogs, which are native to Ecuador and Peru, protecting the animals from predators.
Epibatidine is far more effective as a painkiller than morphine. However, the gap between an effective dose and a toxic one is so narrow that researchers abandoned it as a potential drug in the 1990s. Scientists — including some in Russia — have since explored safer derivatives.
In animal studies, toxic doses of epibatidine have caused elevated blood pressure, convulsions, respiratory arrest, and death.
Documented human exposure to epibatidine is extremely rare. The first known case occurred in 2010, when a laboratory worker who had handled the substance developed hives and sought medical attention. He survived after treatment with antihistamines.
At higher doses, epibatidine poisoning would likely resemble nicotine poisoning, producing symptoms such as confusion, wheezing, vomiting, tremors, muscle twitching, impaired coordination, agitation, and lethargy. Death may occur before the full range of symptoms develops.
Alexander Polupan, an intensive care specialist, told The Insider that the publicly available data about Navalny’s symptoms matches what is known about epibatidine’s effects:
The clinical picture is in some ways similar to poisoning by organophosphorus compounds, which include the Novichok poison used in the 2020 attempt to kill Navalny, but with a less pronounced muscarinic cholinergic component. [These effects include slowed heart rate, drops in blood pressure, bronchospasm, excessive salivation, urinary incontinence, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and impaired vision.] Atropine is essentially ineffective.
Epibatidine can cause poisoning through skin contact or injection — the method used in animal studies. However, the scientific literature has documented only these routes of exposure. Inhalation or ingestion would likely also cause poisoning.
Scientists in Russia have reported that epibatidine poisoning can be detected by analyzing blood, cells from the mouth, or urine samples.
Where did the Russian authorities obtain this poison?
Today, epibatidine can be synthesized in a laboratory, eliminating the need to harvest it from Ecuadorian frogs. Scientists at Russia’s Institute of Organic Chemistry and Technology — which developed the Novichok group of nerve agents — have reportedly synthesized epibatidine.
In its pure form, epibatidine is a powder that dissolves in certain liquids, including beverages.
Before Navalny’s death, no state was known to have used epibatidine as a weapon. However, the toxin’s properties make it well-suited for assassination.

Russia’s Alexey Navalny killed by dart frog poison, European nations allege
Five European countries say findings ‘conclusively’ confirm the deadly toxin in the Russian opposition leader’s body as Moscow calls it Western propaganda.
Five European countries – the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Sweden and the Netherlands – have accused Russia of poisoning and killing opposition leader Alexey Navalny in 2024 based on lab results from a sample taken from his body.
The five governments said in a statement on Saturday that tissue samples “conclusively” confirmed the lethal toxin epibatidine. The poison is found in wild dart frogs from South America.

“The UK, Sweden, France, Germany and the Netherlands are confident that Alexey Navalny was poisoned with a lethal toxin,” the statement issued during the Munich Security Conference said.
Russia had “the means, motive, and opportunity to administer this poison”, the UK Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office added in a statement.
Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova told state-run RIA Novosti news agency she’ll comment once the test results are publicly presented – something she noted has not yet been done.
The five countries said they’re reporting Russia to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons for a breach of the Chemical Weapons Convention. There was no immediate comment from the organisation.
Navalny, who crusaded against official corruption and staged anti-Kremlin protests as President Vladimir Putin’s fiercest foe, died in an Arctic penal colony on February 16, 2024, while serving a 19-year sentence he called politically motivated.
Epibatidine is found naturally in dart frogs and can also be manufactured in a lab, something European scientists suspect was the case in the alleged poisoning of Navalny.
The poison works by causing shortness of breath, convulsions, seizures and a slowed heart rate and can kill on contact.
The five countries said Russia needs to be held accountable for its “repeated violations” of the convention.
British Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper met Navalny’s widow, Yulia Navalnaya, at the Munich Security Conference. She said the new findings are “shining a light on the Kremlin’s barbaric plot to silence his voice”.
French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot wrote on X the alleged poisoning shows “Vladimir Putin is prepared to use biological weapons against his own people in order to remain in power.”
The Russian government has repeatedly denied any involvement in Navalny’s death. Authorities said he became ill after a walk and died from natural causes.
“Once there are test results – once there are formulas for the substances – there will be a comment. Without this, all talk and statements are just information leaks aimed at distracting attention from the West’s pressing problems,” said Zakharova.
‘Science-proven fact’?
It’s unclear how the samples from Navalny’s body were obtained or where they were assessed. Cooper told reporters “UK scientists worked with our European partners to pursue the truth” on Navalny’s death.
Navalnaya said the “murder” of her husband is now a “science-proven fact”.
“Two years ago, I came on stage here and said that it was Vladimir Putin who killed my husband,” Navalnaya said on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference.
“I was, of course, certain that it was a murder, … but back then, it was just words. But today these words have become science-proven fact,” Navalnaya added.
Navalny was the previous target of a nerve agent poisoning in 2020 that he blamed on the Kremlin.
He was flown to Germany for treatment, and when he returned to Russia five months later, he was immediately arrested and imprisoned for the remaining three years of his life.
The UK held a public inquiry into the poisoning in Britain of Russian double agent Sergey Skripal in 2018. It concluded last year that Putin must have ordered the Novichok nerve agent attack. The Kremlin has denied involvement.
Russia also denied poisoning Alexander Litvinenko, a former Russian agent-turned-Kremlin critic who died in London in 2006 after ingesting the radioactive isotope polonium-210. A British inquiry concluded that two Russian agents killed Litvinenko.

Jeffrey Epstein used glamour of Nobel Peace Prize to court elites, files reveal
Sex offender told Trump ally Steve Bannon in 2018 that ‘donalds head would explode’ if he knew about his ties to Nobel Committee chair, who has since been indicted for corruption
STAVANGER, Norway (AP) — Jeffrey Epstein repeatedly played up his ties to the former head of the Nobel Peace Prize committee in invitations to and chats with elites like Richard Branson, Larry Summers, Bill Gates and Steve Bannon, a top ally of President Donald Trump, the Epstein files show.
Thorbjorn Jagland, who headed the Norwegian Nobel Committee from 2009 to 2015, turns up hundreds of times in the millions of documents about the former US financier and convicted sex offender that were released by the US Justice Department last month.
Since the release, Jagland, 75, has been charged in Norway for “aggravated corruption” in connection with an investigation prompted by information in the files, the economic crime unit of Norwegian police Okokrim said.
Okokrim has said it would investigate whether gifts, travel and loans were received in connection with Jagland’s position. Its teams searched his Oslo residence on Thursday, plus two other properties in Risør, a coastal town to the south, and in Rauland to the west.
His attorneys at the Elden law firm in Norway said Jagland denies the charges, and was questioned by the police unit on Thursday.
While there is no evidence in the documents seen so far of any outright lobbying for the Nobel Peace Prize, Epstein repeatedly played up hosting Jagland at his properties in New York and Paris in the 2010s.
In September 2018, during Trump’s first term and in an apparent allusion to his interest in the peace prize, Epstein had a varied text-message exchange with Bannon, at one point writing — in one of many messages with untidy grammar: “donalds head would explode if he knew you were now buds with the guy who on monday will decide the nobel peace prize.”
“I told him next year it should be you when we settle China,” he added, without elaborating.
In one email from 2013, mixing in investment tips and praise for PR tips, Epstein told British entrepreneur and magnate Richard Branson that Jagland would be staying with Epstein in September that year, adding, “If you are there, you might find him interesting.”
A year after she left a job as White House counsel to President Barack Obama, in 2015, Kathy Ruemmler got an email from Epstein saying: “head of nobel peace prize coming to visit, want to join?”
In 2012, Epstein wrote former Treasury Secretary and Harvard University president Larry Summers about Jagland, saying, “head of the nobel peace prize staying with me, if you have any interest.”
In that exchange, Epstein referred to Jagland — also a former Norwegian prime minister and former head of the Council of Europe, a human rights body — as “not bright” but someone who offered a “unique perspective.”
The financier wrote Bill Gates in 2014, saying that Jagland had been reelected as head of the Council of Europe.
“That is good,” the Microsoft co-founder and the world’s former richest man wrote. “I guess his peace prize committee job is also up in the air?”
During Jagland’s tenure as chair of the committee, it gave the peace prize to Obama, in 2009, and the European Union in 2012.
Jagland was brought into Epstein’s orbit by Terje Rod Larsen, a Norwegian diplomat who helped broker the Oslo Peace Accords between Israel and the Palestinians. Larsen and wife are also facing corruption charges in Norway due to their association with Epstein.

NRB convention to spotlight Israel, Iran, antisemitism, and AI

With the National Religious Broadcasters (NRB) convention just days away, Troy Miller isn’t pretending the timing is easy. But the NRB president and CEO is betting that thousands of attendees will arrive ready to talk, and ready to build, at a moment when faith, politics, and technology are colliding fast.
For more stories from The Media Line go to themedialine.org
“This is the largest gathering of Christian communicators,” Miller said, describing an event he called unmatched not only in the US but worldwide. The week will open with a “state of broadcasting” session and updates on NRB initiatives that reflect how much the organization’s agenda has broadened. He cited priorities ranging from Israel and global Christian persecution to veterans’ ministries and a major effort titled “America Reads the Bible.”
The convention’s structure is meant to mirror the modern media ecosystem. NRB will run multiple stages, including forums focused on the legal landscape, courts, legislation, culture, and mainstream media. Alongside those panels, the schedule includes hands-on talks and workshops, hundreds of sessions in all, Miller said, including a full stage dedicated to artificial intelligence.
A centerpiece event will lean hard into history. NRB plans a Thursday night celebration of America’s upcoming 250th anniversary, a “real fun night,” Miller promised, though he said he couldn’t yet name every speaker. He did confirm participation from PragerU, David and Tim Barton of Wall Builders, Core Ridge Ministries, and Seth Dillon of The Babylon Bee.
NRB is also expanding its exhibit floor. Miller said more than 230 exhibitors will fill two rooms this year, and the America 250 team will bring what he described as a traveling museum: a mobile truck designed to tour the country and spotlight America’s founding, with an emphasis on what he called the Judeo-Christian influence behind it.
That phrase - Judeo-Christian - captures what Miller says is a deliberate shift at NRB.
Judeo-Christian
In a polarized America, he argued, the answer is broader unity, not narrower lanes. He compared today’s divisions to the disputes between states during the country’s founding, saying the essential lesson is that “they all came together.” NRB, he said, has worked in recent years to build greater unity “in the body of Christ” and to expand cooperation to “our Jewish brothers and sisters,” along with Catholic participants. He described shared ground on “pro-life” and “pro-family” issues, and said global Christian persecution remains a central concern.
Iran, he added, will be a major focus at the convention. Miller said NRB plans a press statement “standing in solidarity with the people of Iran,” framing it as both a foreign policy and a human rights issue.
The conversation turned to antisemitism, which Miller framed as inseparable from hostility toward Christians. “Absolutely,” he said when asked whether hatred of Jews also implicates hatred of Christians, pointing to Christianity’s Jewish roots and arguing that antisemitism carries an implicit anti-Christian dimension.
He also pointed to what he described as gestures of mutual support, citing comments he said were made by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu about Christian persecution and Israel’s commitment to protecting Christians globally. Miller recalled remarks by Deputy Foreign Minister Sharon Haskell, saying she spoke about Christians somewhere in the world experiencing “an October 7th every day.” “We need to lock arms if we’re going to defeat this,” he said.
Not every Christian community is aligned. Asked about a recent controversy involving the Greek Orthodox Church and criticism of Christian Zionists, Miller emphasized internal diversity within Orthodoxy and suggested local pressures shaped the episode. He called the stance “unfortunate,” but said the broader trend remains one of cooperation, noting that members of the Coptic Orthodox Church will attend NRB and describing widespread unity on antisemitism and persecution.
Debate over the West Bank and Iran
From there, the conversation shifted to Israel’s internal debate over the West Bank - also known as Judea and Samaria - and the competing language used to describe it. Miller blamed “outside influence” for complicating the conflict and said his preference is for international actors to step back while Israel and local authorities work toward practical arrangements. He pointed to the United Arab Emirates as an example of cracking down on radicalism and building a more unified society where “Arabs, Christians, and Jews are getting along.” He also said many Christians are firm in viewing the territory as the West Bank, referencing biblical narratives as part of that understanding.
Iran returned as the dominant theme. Miller spoke from personal experience, recalling his US Navy service in the 1980s and months spent in the Persian Gulf during a period when Iran sought to disrupt oil routes. He also described working with Iranian employees during his time in the tech industry at Gateway, Inc. Those connections, he said, sharpened his focus on the Iranian people rather than the regime.
He described what he said he had heard from an Iran-focused ministry: “tens of thousands” killed in a crackdown, with “tens, even hundreds of thousands” confined to their homes and facing shortages and infrastructure cutoffs. “This is a human rights issue that the world should just be screaming about,” he said, adding that he doesn’t understand why Iran “gets a pass.” He said he hopes US leadership will respond forcefully, pushing Iran toward serious negotiations, while warning that Iran’s proxies also brutalize populations across the region. In his view, reducing Tehran’s reach would “save millions and millions of lives.”
The sprint to deploy AI tools
From geopolitics, the discussion moved to artificial intelligence, an issue Miller says is already reshaping media faster than ethics can keep up. He pointed to a line from Jurassic Park: “You didn’t stop to think about whether you should.” The quote, he suggested, captures the problem with the current sprint to deploy AI tools.
Miller said NRB plans to confront thorny questions: what to do with fully AI-generated music; how to address the fact that models “learn from somebody” rather than create from the “human spirit”; whether AI-written sermons cross a line; and whether virtual reality pastors, deepfakes, and synthetic content threaten trust. The goal, he said, isn’t to halt innovation but to set moral guardrails before the technology remakes the field.
The conversation ended with the question of youth and faith. Miller said he sees signs of renewed interest among younger Americans: increased church attendance, higher turnout at youth events, and growing online searches related to belief. He attributed some momentum to a recent tragedy, the murder of Charlie Kirk, which he said had a significant impact on young people in the US. More broadly, he argued that many young people are confronting “emptiness” and loneliness, and are discovering that secular culture does not fill the gap.
He also described a rise in youth-led media aimed at reaching peers, a generation raised with constant media and fluent in how to use it. But, he warned, the low barrier to entry can reward popularity over truth. Christian media, he said, remains “one of the most well-kept secrets” and faces bias and marginalization on digital platforms and in traditional broadcasting. Even so, he called this a pivotal time to teach journalism, integrity, and truth “over the number of likes.”
On media ethics, Miller was blunt. “It’s gone,” he said, arguing that much of mainstream and legacy news has become “propaganda houses.” He invoked the idea of the press as a “fourth leg of the stool” meant to balance the executive, legislative, and judicial branches, and said that role has been undermined by partisanship. What the country needs, he said, is a free press that is “uninfluenced and unadulterated.”
For Miller, the coming NRB convention is not just a gathering of broadcasters. It is a test of whether faith-based communicators can hold a coalition together, across Christian denominations and with Jewish partners, while confronting the pressures of a polarized political climate, a volatile Middle East, and a technological revolution that can manufacture reality on demand.

Some 250,000 people demonstrated against Iran's Islamic regime in Munich's Theresienwiese on Saturday afternoon, according to local police.
The demonstration was part of a global day of action called for by Reza Pahlavi, the son of the last Shah of Persia. Pahlavi was in Germany to attend the Munich Security Conference over the weekend.
The demonstration's slogan was "Human rights and freedom for Iran. International solidarity with the Iranian people."
Chants calling for the end of the mullahs in Iran were heard repeatedly, and flags of the USA and Israel were visible, according to reports from the German public broadcaster Bayerischer Rundfunk (BR).
Pahalvi, who spoke at the rally after attending the Munich Security Conference, said he wanted to lead the "transition" in Iran and enable a democratic future for the country, BR reported.
At the conference, he told journalists that Iran's future was a critical test for global security and asserted that the Iranian regime had been exporting instability for nearly fifty years, undermining the sovereignty of its neighbors, fueling conflicts in various regions, and advancing its nuclear ambitions.
In his speech at the Theresienwiese, Pahlavi urged the international community to support the freedom of the Iranian people, according to BR.
"Above all, the free nations of this world and their governments should place themselves on the right side of history," he said.
'I have chosen the Iranian people over the ayatollah'
US Senator Lindsey Graham also spoke at the Munich rally and commented on his participation in a post on X/twitter.
“I have chosen the Iranian people over the ayatollah. I believe they could be good allies of the United States and would march the region toward the light.” Senator Graham wrote.
“I believe the ayatollah is a religious Nazi, who would keep the region and the world in turmoil. He's a religious fanatic who wants to purify Islam, destroy the Jewish people, and come after the United States, which he refers to as the Great Satan.”
International protests
Munich was not the only gathering for those eager to respond to Pahlavi's call that weekend.
Large demonstrations took place in cities around the world, including Toronto, Melbourne, Athens, Tokyo, and London.
CBC News reported that people marched down Yonge Street in Toronto, accompanied by the beat of drums and chants of "King Reza Pahlavi."
Tens of thousands potentially killed in Iran protests
In Iran, conservative estimates amid the Islamic regime's deadly crackdown on protesters suggest that the death toll could be between 40,000 and 50,000. The US-based Iranian rights group HRANA has confirmed just over 7,000 deaths, and the organization is currently reviewing an additional 11,730 cases.
In addition to the large number of casualties, a campaign of mass arrests and intimidation has led to the detention of thousands, as Iranian authorities attempt to prevent further protests following last month's crackdown, which was the bloodiest unrest since 1979.
The protests began on December 28 as a small demonstration in Tehran’s Grand Bazaar, fueled by economic hardship, and quickly spread across the country.

Death of Saif al-Islam Gadhafi deepens Libya’s political fragmentation - analysis

The killing of Saif al-Islam Gadhafi removes from Libya’s political arena the last figure capable of simultaneously embodying the legacy of the former regime, engaging in tribal mediation, and participating in the post-revolution political process. More than a personal loss for his supporters, analysts describe the event as a structural rupture in a system that had gradually reorganized itself around his presence.
For more stories from The Media Line go to themedialine.org
Saif al-Islam had emerged after 2011 not as a restorationist leader in the traditional sense but as a negotiator between eras. He represented a constituency that never disappeared after the fall of his father, Moammar Gadhafi, consisting of former officials, tribal networks, bureaucratic structures, and communities that experienced deterioration after the revolution.
Other members of the family had long been removed from the political field. Some were killed during the uprising, others were sidelined, imprisoned, or politically marginalized, leaving him as the only figure able to operate simultaneously in revolutionary Libya and in the memory of the previous state.
Ibrahim M. S. Grada, a former Libyan ambassador and UN senior advisor, describes this role to The Media Line in structural rather than personal terms: “During this period, the line led by Saif al-Islam emerged and advanced as the leading current among the various supporters of the former regime, to the extent that he became almost their official representative and the representative of their popular base.”
Saif al-Islam also functioned as the only political reference point for what remained of the former Jamahiriyah constituency, often informally referred to as the “Greens.” This was never a unified ideological movement but a loose ecosystem made up of tribal strongholds, including the cities of Sirte and Bani Waled, bureaucratic networks embedded in state institutions, security officials from the previous system, and communities whose status deteriorated after 2011.
Saif al-Islam’s relevance lies with his power to unify
Since the fall of the regime, these networks have survived less as an organized political party than as a dispersed social current waiting for representation. Over time, both western-based authorities in Tripoli and eastern authorities aligned with Khalifa Haftar attempted to absorb parts of this constituency into their own coalitions, particularly in the military and administrative spheres. Saif al-Islam’s relevance, therefore, lay not in controlling institutions but in remaining the only figure who could potentially consolidate these fragmented actors into a single negotiating bloc.
His presence shaped political calculations even when he was absent from daily politics. The possibility that he could re-enter elections or endorse a camp forced rivals to treat the former-regime constituency as a decisive electoral and security factor. Without Saif al-Islam, that constituency does not disappear; it simply loses a focal point. It now faces a choice between dispersion into existing power centres or gradual political irrelevance, a shift that may reduce immediate confrontation while simultaneously weakening prospects for an inclusive settlement.
Grada characterizes the magnitude of this event directly: “Saif al-Islam Gadhafi’s disappearance from the political scene is literally an earthquake, because the vacuum he left is difficult to fill.”
On the ground, reaction has been limited to tiny demonstrations but remains psychologically significant. Misbah Omar, an Institute for Integrated Transitions expert on Libyan affairs, notes shock rather than mobilization. “Only in two cities, maybe Sirte, Bani Waled, the Libyan people took [to] the streets since they were shocked when they got the news. They didn’t expect Saif al-Islam could be alone without any security, any armed team to protect him. Nobody accepted that,” he told The Media Line.
Omar also stresses uncertainty over responsibility. “About who killed him, I think nobody knows yet. There is a lot of pressure from the people on the ground, on the investigation office, and on the government to find that out.”
This uncertainty contributes to a wider political reading with each faction interpreting the assassination through its own strategic lens. Omar points out that Saif al-Islam had multiple adversaries. “There’s kind of tension between Saif al-Islam and some countries abroad and some international organizations. He knew many secrets and could have been a target for that reason,” he noted.
Libya’s divisions since the revolution have never followed a simple binary. The “pro” and “anti-Gadhafi” line that defined the civil war gradually evolved into overlapping political, economic, and local power struggles. Yet Saif al-Islam functioned as a rare cross-cutting actor linking those layers.
“He succeeded in representing a political side in the Libyan equation as the central linking element between the different pro-regime constituencies socially, tribally, and politically,” Grada explained.
His death risks refragmenting those constituencies: “This vacuum will produce competition among prominent figures of the former regime to replace him, and this competition will necessarily reflect on their social and political bases, and it will take a long time,” Grada added.
Omar similarly anticipates redistribution of loyalties: “Before we had Saif al-Islam. Now we have only two representatives left, Abdul Hamid Dbeibah and Khalifa Haftar. Each one will try to polarize the former regime supporters to his side, fragmenting even more the situation.”
Rather than resolving tensions, the removal of a controversial figure may dissolve a stabilizing center. Grada notes that emotional mobilization may occur only under escalation: “Unless a sharp political or military escalation occurs, even then it will not be easy socially or politically unless a leadership emerges with a developed narrative capable of uniting the popular base.”
A lengthy political struggle
Omar’s assessment portends a lengthy political struggle: “We will see a long political struggle since the key for transition has been eliminated from the equation.”
These scenarios will likely impact the elections, according to Grada: “All Libyan and international parties need time to understand the current developments, therefore the timing of the elections will likely be postponed,” he said.
The Libyan state remains a negotiated space among armed actors, administrative networks, and international influence. Saif al-Islam’s absence affects each differently.
Omar warns that his killing may not be an isolated event, but part of a broader pattern of political violence ahead: “More than Saif al-Islam will be killed… Many important leaders or armed group leaders will be killed this year,” suggesting a potential phase of targeted eliminations accompanying this political vacuum.
Grada describes possible institutional consequences: “Former regime figures still influential in the deep state may find themselves without political or social cover, which may increase chaos in state institutions.”
Omar also situates the fragmentation within a wider external competition over the Libyan state itself: “We have three different projects for Libya right now, one supported by Egypt, another under the influence of the United States but not clear, and a third led by the United Nations.” He noted that public trust in international mediation, especially in the UN, has eroded.
“More than 12 countries [which are] part of the Security Council are supporting opposing armed groups in Libya,” he added, reinforcing the extent to which domestic political balance is intertwined with foreign security calculations.
Both interviews converged on the same structural issue, reconciliation depended on representation.
“Saif al-Islam was the only leader who could represent all the former regime; now nobody knows who should talk to whom,” Omar observed, while Grada noted that “national reconciliation needs political, economic, and social reconciliation. The first step is decentralization, maybe a federal system with 13 or 16 states,” with a connection to building a state.
Grada links this to economic governance as well, arguing that centralized control over resources had reinforced corruption and exclusion, and that redistribution of economic authority to municipalities will be necessary for reconciliation to function in practice.
Omar similarly focuses on administrative reform, instead of focusing on funding the army: “We need to reform the Ministry of Interior, not the army. Only this will allow us to go back on track. Ideally, we are trying to establish all these processes in a maximum two years.”
Monarchy, revolutionary republic, and fragmented post-revolution
Since independence, Libya has repeatedly reorganized its political order: monarchy, revolutionary republic, and fragmented post-revolution state. The removal of Saif al-Islam does not restore the past nor complete the revolution; it eliminates a bridge between them.
Grada describes the social pressure behind potential unrest: “Declining living standards, widespread corruption, and increasing inequality may lead to a new uprising, more likely chaotic disorder, which benefits no one.”
Saif al-Islam’s political importance lay not in governing, but in structuring competition. He represented a bloc that could be negotiated with. Without him, the bloc dissolves into multiple actors, tribal, political, bureaucratic, and armed.
That shift changes Libya’s transition from a negotiation among defined sides into a fluid contest among overlapping networks. The assassination does not resolve the post-2011 conflict. It removes one of the few actors capable of translating the past into the present.
Whether Libya moves toward a unified state or renewed fragmentation now depends less on ideology than on whether a new mediator, institutional or personal, emerges to replace the one that is gone.

Thai police arrest Israeli ‘top dealer’ with millions in drugs

An Israeli man described by Thai authorities as a major drug trafficker was arrested Friday on the island of Koh Phangan with narcotics worth more than 50 million baht, or $1.6 million, the Bangkok Post reported Saturday.
The suspect, identified as Shai Alfasi, 42, allegedly operated from a restaurant he owned on the popular tourist island. Thailand’s tourist police commander told the newspaper that Alfasi sold drugs through a WhatsApp Business account using a Hebrew name.
According to police, customers placed orders via the app, after which the drugs — concealed inside black socks — were left at prearranged locations. Photos of the drop-off points were sent to buyers. Payments were made in cash and hidden inside the same socks, investigators said.
Undercover officers posed as customers and arrested Alfasi when he arrived at a designated location on a motorcycle to collect the cash, the police commander said.
A search of his belongings and hidden compartments uncovered a range of illegal drugs, including cocaine, ketamine, MDMA, LSD, heroin, psychedelic mushrooms and heart-shaped ecstasy pills known locally as “Labubu.” The estimated street value of the seized drugs exceeded 50 million baht, police said.
Alfasi was identified as the owner of the restaurant “Lola” on Koh Phangan. Authorities said that during an enforcement operation launched Monday on the island, six suspects were arrested on drug trafficking charges, with Alfasi described as the most senior figure detained so far.
Last month, Koh Phangan police arrested four Israelis in their 20s staying at a villa on the island on suspicion of drug use. Officers raided the property following complaints of a loud party and suspicious behavior, and reported finding “Labubu,” cocaine and MDMA.
Earlier that month, Thailand’s tourist police raided a luxury villa on the island and arrested four Israelis suspected of operating a drug trafficking network targeting foreign tourists, primarily Israelis. Large quantities of drugs and cash were seized in that operation, authorities said.

US-Iran talks to be held in Geneva next week, hosted by Oman
The son of Iran’s last shah called for US action, as Trump sends a second aircraft carrier to the Middle East
Switzerland said on Saturday that Oman would host talks between the United States and Iran in Geneva next week, with Washington pushing Tehran to make a deal to limit its nuclear programme.
“Switzerland stands ready at all times to offer its good offices to facilitate dialogue between the United States and Iran,” a Swiss foreign ministry spokesman said.
On February 6, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi held talks in Oman with US envoy Steve Witkoff and US President Donald Trump’s influential son-in-law Jared Kushner.
The talks were indirect, with the Omanis acting as mediators.
Trump has recently focused his military threats on Tehran’s nuclear programme, which US forces struck last July during Israel’s unprecedented 12-day war with Iran.
Trump said on Friday that a change of government in Iran would be the “best thing that could happen”, as he sent a second aircraft carrier to the Middle East, ratcheting up military pressure on the Islamic republic.

Ukraine holds over 4,000 Russian POWs – Zelensky
The head of state said this while speaking with journalists in Munich on Saturday, Ukrinform reports.
"Prisoner exchanges. They [the Russians] are currently holding about 7,000 Ukrainian prisoners of war. We, at this moment, have more than 4,000. This is good news, because we used to have 1,500. Now we have slightly more than 4,000. That means we can carry out exchanges," he said.
Zelensky noted that the ideal scenario would be for the Russian side to agree to an "all-for-all" exchange. At the same time, Ukraine is also ready for "1,000 for 1,000" prisoner swaps.
"It would be good if they were ready even for '100 for 100.' Any step in this direction is a positive decision for us," he said.
The latest prisoner exchange between Ukraine and Russia took place on February 5, 2026, with 157 Ukrainians returning home.

BRATISLAVA, February 14. /TASS/. Despite the suspension of Russian oil deliveries via the Druzhba pipeline, Slovakia maintains adequate reserves of oil and petroleum products, according to the State Reserves Administration of Slovakia. The agency assured that, with government approval, it is prepared to release the necessary reserves to ensure supply stability.
An emergency meeting of Slovakia’s Energy Security Commission is scheduled for Monday, February 16. The session will evaluate the current situation and discuss strategic measures to secure the country’s oil supply. Bratislava is actively monitoring developments related to the Druzhba pipeline, which has been suspended since early February.
The Slovak Ministry of Economy reported on Friday that the nation’s strategic reserves are sufficient to cover approximately 90 days of consumption. The ministry remains optimistic that energy supplies via the Druzhba pipeline will be restored in the coming days.
It is noteworthy that Hungary and Slovakia receive oil directly from other EU countries through the Druzhba pipeline, which passes through Hungary to Croatia and then on to Serbia.

Syria’s foreign minister, Iraq’s Kurdish region president discuss reconstruction, economy
Talks on sidelines of Munich Security Conference focus on rebuilding Syria’s economy, boosting bilateral ties
ISTANBUL
Syria’s Foreign Minister Asaad al-Shaibani on Saturday met with Nechirvan Barzani, the president of Iraq’s northern Kurdish region, to discuss reconstruction and economic cooperation in Syria.
The meeting took place in Germany on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference, which began Friday and runs for three days, according to a Syrian Foreign Ministry source cited by the Syrian Arab News Agency (SANA).
The two sides discussed Syria’s economic situation and the country’s postwar reconstruction and stressed the importance of intensifying economic and development ties in the coming days, the source said.
Barzani reaffirmed his support for Syria’s unity and stability, describing them as “a fundamental pillar for the stability of Iraq and its Kurdish region alike,” according to the same source.
He also praised several steps taken by Syrian President Ahmad al-Sharaa, expressing “great satisfaction” with a recent presidential decree concerning Syrian Kurds' rights.
In January, Sharaa issued a decree recognizing the cultural and linguistic rights of Syrian Kurds, addressing civil and legal issues affecting stateless residents, and tackling long-standing property rights cases, in a move aimed at building an inclusive state that protects citizens’ rights without discrimination.
Later that month, the Syrian government announced it had reached a “comprehensive agreement” with the YPG/SDF terrorist organization, aimed at ending internal divisions and launching a new phase of integration.
The government said the agreement covering the northeastern cities of Hasakah and Qamishli and the integration of military forces complements a previous deal signed on Jan. 18.

BERLIN, February 14. /TASS/. Alice Weidel, co-chair of the Alternative for Germany (AfD), has called on German authorities to cease supporting Kiev and instead pursue diplomatic negotiations, echoing the approach taken by US President Donald Trump.
In a speech at an AfD event, Weidel emphasized the urgency of peace, criticizing what she described as "completely anti-Russian rhetoric" and the ongoing provision of financial and military aid to Ukraine. She posted a video of her remarks on her X social media platform, stating, "We need peace as soon as possible. We must stop further fueling this war with such rhetoric and resources."
Weidel argued that Germany should stop "feeding" the Ukrainian regime and instead pressure it into negotiations, aligning her stance with Trump's diplomatic strategy. She concluded by asserting that this should be the primary responsibility of German policymakers.

Assailants kill at least 32 in north-west Nigerian villages, residents say

Armed assailants on motorbikes killed at least 32 people and burned houses and shops during raids on three villages in north-west Nigeria’s Niger state early on Saturday, local officials and residents who escaped the violence said.
The dawn raids targeted the communities of Tunga-Makeri, Konkoso, and Pissa.
The attacks on villages in the Borgu local government area, near the border with Benin Republic, are part of a surge in attacks blamed on “bandits” who have carried out deadly assaults, abductions for ransom, and displaced communities across northern Nigeria.
Niger State police spokesperson Wasiu Abiodun said six people died in the attack on Tunga-Makeri, adding that a “yet to be ascertained number of persons were abducted.”
Abiodun confirmed that the Konkoso community was attacked, but provided no further details. “Joint security teams have been mobilised to the scene for assessment and effort to rescue the victims is ongoing,” he said.
Insecurity is a pressing concern in Nigeria and the government is under mounting pressure to restore stability.
Northern Nigeria is in the grip of a complex security crisis featuring both Islamic militants and armed gangs kidnapping people for ransom.
Saturday’s attacks follow a deadly attack earlier this month in neighboring Kwara State that killed 162 people.
In the past few months, Nigeria has been in the crosshairs of the US government, which has accused the Nigerian authorities of not protecting Christians, although attacks affect both Christians and Muslims.
The accusation has resulted in a security partnership between both countries that has involved US strikes targeting armed groups in Nigerian territories in December, as well as presence of a team of US military in the West African country.
Jeremiah Timothy, a resident of Konkoso who fled to a nearby locality, said the attack on his village on Saturday began in the early hours with sporadic gunfire.
“At least 26 people were killed so far in the village after they set the police station ablaze,” said Timothy, adding that the attackers entered Konkoso around 6am (5am GMT), shooting indiscriminately.
He said residents heard military jets flying overhead.
Another witness, who requested anonymity, said the attackers, riding more than 200 motorbikes, swept through the area targeting the villages.
Auwal Ibrahim, a resident of Tunga-Makeri, recounted the early-morning assault on his village at approximately 2am GMT.
“The bandits stormed our town around 3am (local time), riding so many motorcycles while shooting sporadically, beheading six people and killing others. They set shops on fire and forced the whole village to flee,” Ibrahim said.
He added that many villagers fear returning as the gunmen remain nearby.

Spain and France are still struggling to repair the damage from the previous storm, Nils.
Another storm has hit the Iberian Peninsula as Spain struggles to cope with the damage caused by the previous storm, Nils.
Storm Oriana is bringing torrential rain and strong wind gusts, with dangerous weather warnings in place across much of Spain.
In the eastern province of Castellón, a maximum red alert has been issued as Storm Oriana sweeps through the region with "hurricane-force" winds, which could uproot trees, flood roads, and leave thousands of people without power.
The previous storm has so far killed three people in France and Spain. Dozens of people have been injured in weather-related accidents, and a viaduct has partially collapsed due to flooding on the A1 motorway between Lisbon and Porto in Portugal.
In southwest France, rivers in several municipalities have flooded due to heavy rainfall from the previous storm. A flood alert remains in place along the Garonne River for the weekend.

Opinion
I want to fairly give my three nephews money. How should I do it?
I would like to gift/loan some money to my adult nephews to help them buy homes and am uncertain how best to do this. One is married with children, one is in a de facto relationship with no children, and the third is single. I would like to give/loan the money in such a way as to protect them financially in the event of a relationship ending, but I also want to act fairly, particularly in relation to my nephew’s children and their mother. I am in a good position financially and so have no need for any gift/loan to be repaid.
You will certainly lock in favourite aunty status with this plan! Great to hear that you are sufficiently across your financial position to be aware that you have more than you need.
Dying with millions of dollars in the bank is not winning. The impact your gifts will have on your nephews now will be far more significant than if they have to wait until you pass away.
You should discuss this with your solicitor. My understanding is that you can structure your assistance as a loan, which can provide protection in the event of a relationship breakdown.
However, for it to stand up to a legal challenge, it needs to be conducted as a legitimate loan, with interest charged, repayments made, and perhaps security taken.
I am 61, single, and had to resign from work due to health issues. I have $351,000 in super and $150,000 in savings. I own my home and have no debts, and I am intending to apply for the disability support pension. Can I also draw on my super if I’m on a DSP?
Yes, you can. As you are over age 60 and have ceased employment, your super will be accessible.
Whilst it would be possible to commence a pension from your super, I would delay this until you get a determination on the DSP. For means-testing purposes, money in super will be ignored until you turn 67. But if you convert it into a pension it will get included in the test, and is likely to reduce how much you receive in DSP.
A suitable solution here might be to live off the DSP and supplement this via draw-downs from your savings. Leave your super alone until you reach age 67 and transition to an age pension.
If you pursue this plan, and your super is left to compound for six years, ensure it is invested with a bias towards growth assets so that you maximise the compounding impact across that period.
I invest in an actively managed international share fund that has been underperforming for years. If I withdraw the funds, I will incur capital gains tax. However, if I transfer my money from this share fund to a different share fund with the same fund manager, will capital gains tax still apply?
Yes it will, as you will be selling units in the current fund that you are in. I don’t know the amounts involved here, but if you are in a high-cost fund that is not performing, it might be worth copping the CGT hit to move onto greener pastures.
Perhaps you could make a tax-deductible super contribution to offset the capital gain if you can do so. Alternatively, if you have any investments that are sitting on losses, perhaps you take the opportunity to clear those out at the same time, which would provide an offset.

Snakes on a plane, skinks in the post: The slippery and growing problem of animal smuggling

Snakes on a plane, skinks in the post: The slippery and growing problem of animal smuggling
Crime gangs are being caught in record numbers smuggling rare Australian animals for global underground networks, but experts say it’s just the tip of the iceberg in an illegal trade worth billions.
Australian reptiles worth up to $100,000 each on international black markets are being intercepted in the $32 billion annual global trade – the world’s fourth-largest illegal market behind drugs, counterfeiting and human trafficking.
A crackdown on wildlife trafficking syndicates has caused the number of smuggled animal seizures to more than double in the past two years. Federal authorities stopped more than 1100 trafficked native animals at the border last year.
Victoria’s Conservation Regulator has recorded a 254 per cent rise in wildlife-related crime reports over the past five years, including instances of trafficking and cruelty.
Despite the surge in enforcement, wildlife crime experts mapping the illegal trade have found nine out of 10 animal-smuggling attempts in and out of Australia are successful, earning millions of dollars each year for crime gangs, decimating animal populations and risking the nation’s biosecurity.
Australia’s unique reptiles are the most frequently targeted species, particularly blue‑tongue skinks, shinglebacks and rare snakes. Hong Kong continues to be the top destination for illegal exports, with most leaving the country via New South Wales.
Federal Environment Minister Murray Watt said the Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water had set up specialist environmental crime units in Sydney and Melbourne over the past two years as part of an effort to tackle the growing “barbaric trade”.
“Illegal trafficking and wildlife crime is fast becoming a threat for many of our species that are already at risk of extinction,” Watt said. “The growing global trade in native plants and animals is illegal, cruel and threatens the future of many of our beloved plants and animals.
“Through targeted intelligence analysis, on-ground investigations, and close collaboration with partner agencies, we’re detecting the methods used to traffic native species and closing the gaps criminals rely on.
“This work is delivering results – seizures, prosecutions and deterrence – and strengthening Australia’s broader biosecurity and conservation outcomes by making it harder for offenders to profit from the illegal wildlife trade.”
A popcorn moment
Following one of Australia’s largest animal-smuggling busts, the ringleader of a Sydney-based syndicate on Friday received a record jail sentence.
Between 2018 and 2023, authorities intercepted 15 packages bound for Hong Kong, Romania, South Korea and Sri Lanka, which contained a total of 101 native reptiles hidden in bags of popcorn, biscuit tins and a handbag.
Under Operations Buckland and Pandora, Commonwealth and NSW investigators teamed up with Australia Post and university-based wildlife crime researchers to track down the traffickers, leading to search warrants that uncovered several hundred more live reptiles – shingleback lizards, western blue-tongue lizards, Centralian blue-tongue lizards, bearded dragons, southern pygmy spiny-tail skinks, Eastern Pilbara spiny-tailed skinks, desert skinks, narrow-banded sand swimmers and major skinks – as well as the ringleader, Neil Simpson, 61.
On Friday, the Sydney Downing Centre District Court sentenced Simpson to eight years in jail with a non-parole period of five years and four months. Three lower-level syndicate members were previously convicted for their roles.
Smokes and lizards
An investigation by this masthead can also reveal that recent busts have shown an overlap with other forms of organised crime.
During a January 22 raid on a Melbourne apartment, federal environmental crime investigators uncovered 800 cartons of illicit tobacco along with native reptiles allegedly being prepared for trafficking.
The raid, codenamed Operation Sam, was launched late last year after 24 live reptiles – including 14 shingleback skinks, three eastern blue‑tongue skinks, three lace monitors and four children’s pythons – were uncovered stuffed into toys, table lamps, clothing bags, socks and plastic tubs bound for Hong Kong.
A 26-year-old Chinese national was arrested and charged with three counts of attempting to export specimens.
This masthead is aware of at least nine alleged wildlife traffickers slated to face courts in Victoria, NSW, Queensland and Tasmania in the next three months after being identified through a series of ongoing investigations.
They follow at least 14 major operations in Australia since 2020, which have brought together a range of agencies – including the Australian Federal Police, Australian Border Force, the Department of Agriculture Fisheries and Forestry, state and territory police services and environment agencies, as well as international agencies including Interpol – and ended with about 30 people convicted of charges connected to the illegal wildlife trade.
The Australian convictions include people from China, Hong Kong, Thailand and Malaysia, while there have also been a handful of convictions in the United States, Hong Kong and Germany over the past six years for smugglers in possession of Australian rusty monitors, spiny-tailed skinks and earless monitor lizards.
But those convicted are often low-level mules, including international students recruited on Chinese e-commerce and social media sites to conceal live animals in everyday goods and send them through the post and courier channels.
Snakes on a plane
Cal Heppell, the director of regulatory operations at the Conservation Regulator, said the Victorian agency was seeing more reptiles being taken from the wild, with shingleback and blue‑tongue lizards often targeted, driven by their high value in the illicit overseas pet trade.
After raiding properties in Noble Park North and Caroline Springs, the Conservation Regulator and Victoria Police seized dozens of illegally sourced native reptiles, including shingleback lizards, blue-tongued lizards and various species of geckos, as part of Operation Pike, which targeted an illegal Victorian syndicate operating with links to other states.
In February 2025, the syndicate’s ringleader, Zehong Zheng, 21, was fined $30,000 after pleading guilty to 67 charges including importing and exporting wildlife without a permit, while two women in their 20s were also fined for their roles.
Like counterpart agencies around the country, the Victorian authority had detected high demand in Australia and internationally for native species as pets, and reports of illegal wildlife trafficking were rising, Heppell said.
“We are working more closely than ever with national and state agencies to disrupt the illegal trafficking of both protected native species and exotic pest animals,” he said.
The series of complex operations involving informants, data scraping, postal X-ray and organic scanning has intercepted hundreds of shipments that often include dozens of animals cruelly stuffed into hollowed-out electrical equipment, toys, socks, boots, music boxes, rice cookers and other packages bound for underground markets, most commonly in Hong Kong and Germany.
Organisations including Rapiscan technologies, Taronga Zoo and the Australian Museum have also been called in to develop world-leading scanning technology capable of detecting live animals at Australia’s borders.
As a result, the federal wildlife watchdog last year seized 1118 specimens being smuggled out of Australia – a huge increase on the 331 live specimens seized in 2024, and the 584 specimens seized in 2023.
While the crackdown has made it more difficult for organised criminals to operate, intelligence gathered by the federal wildlife watchdog reveals syndicates are adapting to the increased focus and have moved towards “higher‑risk, higher‑volume” shipments.
This shift is also apparent in detection figures, provided to this masthead, which reveal a decline in the number of illegal parcels detected last year – from 151 in 2023 to 75 in 2024, and 102 in 2025 – despite a near tripling in the overall number of animals they contained.
In response, authorities are undertaking lengthy investigations to trace the source of the shipments. The number of warrants executed by federal Environment Department officials at smuggling headquarters has risen from 11 in 2023 to 16 in 2025.
Pet peeves
Wildlife Crime Research Hub manager Katie Smith and her colleagues are using wildlife forensics and cyber-crime tracking technology to not only research the illegal markets in Australia, but to uncover those operating within them.
Although they have recorded a significant increase in detections, Smith said only 10 per cent of animals being illegally traded were being detected.
“Since COVID, we’re seeing almost an exponential increase again in the number of seizures being made,” Smith said.
“Australia, because of its geographic positioning, has a whole heap of unique species found nowhere else. The exotic pet trade, which is the biggest place we see Australian species being laundered into, is driven by rarity.
“They’re really highly sought after in the international markets.”
The scale(s) of the problem
Based at the University of Adelaide and backed by the Australian Research Council, the research hub has worked with state and federal agencies to co-ordinate seizures across the country – including Operations Buckland and Pandora – by tracking poachers in the wild, as well as the networks they use to ship animals out of the country.
Using data-scraping technology, the unit’s researchers are tracing purchasing orders, sale offers and smuggler recruitment advertisements on social media, wildlife chat groups and in e-commerce sites dating back to 2019.
The results not only provide a map of the illegal international trades, but uncover those who are still operating within it for authorities to target with detections and covert operations.
The intelligence also reveals two realities: the escalating prices driving the market, and the fact detection operations are barely making a dent.
Illegal sales data shows that a shingleback sold domestically in Australia for $200 to $300 fetches an average $11,000 in Hong Kong.
Rarer species, such as the Oenpelli python, found only in Arnhem Land, sell for $100,000. Escalating demand for the snakes from 2017 caused them to become the first species to be listed as “vulnerable” due to the impact of illegal trade rather than conservation issues.
Once out of their native Australia, where they can be laundered and passed off as captive-bred, an animal’s price jumps further for seemingly legal sales into Asia, Europe and North America.
“It shows that Australian native species that should never have been leaving the country are everywhere,” Smith said. “There are huge markets in North America, there are huge markets in Europe
“It’s an exponential price increase. We’ve got cases of national movement in Australia where people are moving 90 shinglebacks at once.
“In Adelaide, you can go on a hike on a sunny day and pick up 10 species, and we’re then talking $100,000 in Hong Kong, if you can get them there.
“And the maximum you could be fined for something like this is $3000, so if you can get just one out of the country, you’ve already covered your costs. That’s just the cost of doing business.”
Global wildlife trade expert Professor Alice Hughes, of the University of Melbourne, said that once an animal was smuggled out of its native country, a system similar to money laundering made it difficult, or nearly impossible, to track from there.
‘No one cares’ about lizards
The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species – or CITES – is the global tool to combat wildlife trafficking. It requires nations to list native animals that are targets of wildlife traffickers, so they can then only be traded under a regulated licensing system.
But Hughes points to huge gaps in the international treaty, such as the fact only 9.5 per cent of reptile species are listed on CITES despite 45 per cent of species being detected in illegal trade. She said these gaps were being exploited and even promoted on wildlife trading chat pages and social media sites.
Crime networks can then smuggle a native species to regional hubs, such as Hong Kong or Germany’s massive Hamm reptile market, where they can be recorded as being bred in captivity to sidestep the regulations.
“We’re actually doing another assessment at the moment, which is quite terrifying, just the volumes of species that we’re finding in trade,” Hughes said.
“When you talk about illegal trade, people talk about ivory, or maybe they’ll talk about rhino horn, and then they’ll talk about pangolins – we never talk about exotic animal trade in the context of the pet trade, and it is booming.
“They will put radioactive material in rhino horns so they can trace it and so on. There have been all these sting operations, but they have been solely focused on a very small subset of species.
“They’re not going to put effort into tracing down your lizard dealer. No one, sadly, cares about it.”
The whole hedgehog
The impact of the gaps in international regulations is clear in the intelligence gathered by the Wildlife Crime Research Hub. As well as monitoring animals being smuggled out, the hub is also scraping data to see what is for sale within our shores, and building a “species accumulation curve” to plot the number detected in Australia over time.
After four years of scraping, the curve is still climbing because the number of species detected as having already been smuggled into the country keeps rising, including animals that are illegal to keep as pets, such as hedgehogs.
Even more concerning, it shows that the global trade moves so fast and wide that one in four of the exotic animals being sold within Australia is not even officially recorded yet by science.
When a new species is identified in the wild, it is typically analysed by scientists to confirm its origins before being officially recognised and recorded. But illegal market tracing shows demand to own the rarest animals means species are now being smuggled and sold to pet collectors long before they can even be published in scientific journals.
This is not only dangerous for the animals, but fuels organised crime and could be catastrophic for Australia’s environment and native species.
“Twenty-five per cent of the species identified are actually not described to science – so we know nothing about their potential environmental risk to Australia, or the biosecurity implications,” Smith said.
TikTok traffic
Influencers are one of the biggest drivers of the rare animal market, and the impact of social media is changing the nature of markets that have existed for hundreds of years, according to Hughes.
Wildlife investigators cite the impact of a single US-based reptile influencer as almost wiping out a newly detected species of New Caledonia skinks. Although the man’s posts focus on captive breeding, investigators believe his huge reach fuelled subsistence poaching for New Caledonians desperate to make a living from collectors who may have no idea where their new pets came from.
When jumping spiders began to trend on TikTok in 2021, the tiny and previously unheralded big-eyed creatures suddenly became the second most traded arachnid on the global market, behind ever-popular tarantulas.
The increasing lust for rare and small pets has meant space-limited Japan has emerged as a rapidly increasing market for species that have not previously been traded elsewhere, including small and rare Australian reptiles that can be easily housed in small indoor enclosures.
While China’s traditional medicine market has long fuelled the underground trade, Hughes said it was rapidly being overtaken by illegally sourced pets for a new generation.
“These are tiny little things, but yet, there’s this massive diverse market for them,” Hughes said.
“The market in China is growing, and it’s not regulated at all for these things.
“These animals are very compatible with the modern lifestyle because they are low maintenance, because they take up less space, because they don’t eat as much, and a lot of people will have them just because it’s easier.
“In the last month, there have been so many seizures in places like Hong Kong, where they’re starting to check a bit more, because wildlife trade for pets is absolutely huge, and it is under-regulated and totally neglected.”

How a promising lawyer was unmasked as the culprit in a bizarre years-long crime spree

How a promising lawyer was unmasked as the culprit in a bizarre years-long crime spree
The elusive thief raided affluent homes in Sydney and Melbourne over eight years. A decade later, he’s been at it again.
A single swipe card inside a former promising lawyer’s wallet unlocked the largest burglary investigation its lead detective had faced, having baffled police for years.
Phillip See, the wallet’s owner and one-time paralegal at the Crown Solicitor’s Office in Sydney, was a suspect in more than 100 burglaries across affluent suburbs in the harbour city and Melbourne.
The card – discovered by the case’s lead investigator, Victoria Police’s Detective acting Sergeant Cliff Pickett – became the smoking gun. It opened a Sydney storage unit hiding a $5.5 million treasure trove linked to about 150 robberies over eight years. An Olympian and war veteran were among the victims.
Phillip See was sentenced to 12 years’ jail for these crimes a decade ago, with a non-parole period of 7½ years.
The “sheer volume of robberies, coupled with the amounts of money that he stole”, made it the largest burglary investigation Pickett had confronted.
To this day, he wonders how some sophisticated thefts were executed, and what motivated a man who rarely spent his dirty cash.
“I’ve never, ever found someone as invested in researching different ways to commit crime,” he said.
“I couldn’t really get inside his head as to why he was doing the things he was doing. It wasn’t to lead an extravagant lifestyle … maybe it was the challenge of doing things and the thrill of getting away with it.”
Pickett can recall the elation he felt when he and his Victorian and NSW colleagues finally cracked the case – mainly because it was unique and bizarre.
Now, the 47-year-old has quietly avoided prison after returning to his old tricks and stealing tens of thousands of dollars worth of valuables from Sydney’s north shore and northern beaches.
Robbery manuals replace legal books
As a young adult, the future looked bright for the quick-witted law and economics graduate.
But as Phillip See fell into drug use and mental health challenges, he began committing petty thefts and trespasses. He spent the next decades visiting courtrooms, but not for reasons he’d hoped.
‘I’ve never, ever found someone as invested in researching different ways to commit crime.’Victoria Police’s Detective acting Sergeant Cliff Pickett
After his first jail stint in the early 2000s, his crimes – and ability to evade capture – escalated.
From 2010 to 2011, Victorian and NSW Police noticed similarities in many unsolved and sophisticated burglaries. Families in wealthy areas were targeted while on holiday. Fleeing without a trace, the culprit would even repair and repaint damaged window frames, often leaving victims unaware of the intrusion until police returned their valuables.
“A lot of the time the safe would be removed and not located,” Pickett said.
“Now, these were quite heavy safes … How he did that, I don’t know.”
A breakthrough came when NSW detectives traced jewellery, stolen from Sydney and sold at a Melbourne auction under a fake name, to Phillip See. He was a prime suspect, using fake IDs, names and credit cards.
Investigations uncovered that he and his father, Christopher See, committed a daring $900,000 heist in a Melbourne warehouse in late 2011.
Court documents state they remained on a police-tapped call throughout the burglary. Christopher See kept watch from a nearby church, while his son scaled and cut a tall barbed wire fence. Inside, Phillip See used a portable power saw to slice a timber door that protected a safe deposit box room and would only spark an alarm if opened. He covered a CCTV camera and cut the locks of dozens of security boxes while his father removed valuables.
“Wait till you see it, Dad,” Phillip See told his father on the phone.
Upon his arrest in Sydney, the pair were extradited to Melbourne. While searching Phillip See, Pickett found the swipe card. His NSW counterparts tracked down the Sydney storage unit.
The $5.5 million stash contained valuables from the Melbourne warehouse and auction thefts. Police uncovered more than $2.3 million in Australian and foreign currency, 145 kilograms of silver bars, 100 ounces of gold, several firearms, 8500 pieces of jewellery and hundreds of bottles of expensive wine.
At a See family member’s Bellevue Hill home in Sydney’s east, police found piles of “how to” books, including those titled How to Crack Safes, Locks, Safes and Security and Understanding and Servicing Alarm Systems.
This masthead earlier reported that lower north shore resident, Trish Howman-Giles, burst into tears when her wedding and engagement rings, anniversary gifts and family heirlooms were recovered.
Busted with gold tucked under pillow
By dealing with so much cash and “stealing any valuable item you could think of”, Phillip See could have lived in a luxury penthouse, taken lavish holidays and dressed in designer clothing.
But when he was caught, he was found living in a “crappy boarding house”, owning only casual clothes. The sole sign of his newfound wealth? A gold bar hidden under his pillow.
He remained cool, calm and collected upon his arrest.
“Reserved and cocky don’t usually go together, but he had an air of cockiness and confidence about him, but he also didn’t talk too much; he didn’t get angry,” Pickett said.
“I think the only time he showed any emotion was when he realised we were taking this swipe card from him … [he was] either frustrated or a little bit belligerent.”
Large amounts of money were spent on specialised lock-picking equipment ordered from the US, safe-picking manuals and even a submersible drone. His technology skills were far ahead of his time.
“He appeared to be of high intelligence, but with limited social skills,” Pickett said.
“We would [ask ourselves], ‘OK, why is this person able to do this? Who are they?’ ”
‘Reserved and cocky don’t usually go together, but he had an air of cockiness and confidence about him.’Detective acting Sergeant Cliff Pickett
Police were surprised he mostly carried out his work alone, bar the occasional help of his father. This suggested a “really unusual type of relationship”.
After their extradition to Victoria and discovery of the card, the father and son pleaded guilty to the Melbourne offences. Both men were jailed for up to four years.
Following the younger See’s release, in 2016 he was sentenced in NSW for the Sydney crimes to a maximum of 12 years’ jail. These included a raft of dishonesty and firearm crimes, as well as dealing with the proceeds of crime over the $5.5 million stash.
The sentencing judge noted his diagnosis of schizoid personality disorder (SzPD) – characterised by detachment from social relationships, limited emotional expression and preference for isolation. He was also abusing drugs and not taking antipsychotic medication properly.
While it was accepted his mental illness “had some role to play”, other motivations included “a desire for greater closeness with his father and greed for money to pay for regular visits to sex workers”, documents state.
Thief avoids jail for 2022 spree
Phillip See was released to parole in July 2020. A mere 19 months later, he struck again.
In February 2022, he stole tens of thousands of dollars worth of jewellery from three Sydney homes in the upper north shore and northern beaches, court documents state.
When one Lindfield family returned from a Queensland holiday, they could not disarm the alarm at their home. Power was cut; a broken deadlock lay near scattered belongings. About $59,000 worth of jewellery was missing.
In the same week, $50,000 of jewellery was collectively reported stolen from homes in Killarney Heights and Allambie Heights.
Phillip See’s latest undoing came when his DNA was matched to the Lindfield house and he was arrested.
Five months after being released on bail, he was arrested again. Police found plastic bags containing jewellery from all three addresses in his pocket.
He pleaded guilty in the NSW District Court to breaking-and-entering to steal less than $60,000, with one count of receiving more than $5,000 worth of property and another count of suspected stolen goods in custody considered. Last month, he was sentenced to a 359-day Intensive Corrective Order.
Judge Stephen Hanley took account of his mental illnesses and prior drug use.
He said there was “potential disagreement” between doctors about a current schizophrenia diagnosis, and noted suggestions he previously used the diagnosis to “some extent, milk the system”, but concluded the illness was a “valid psychiatric opinion”.
The nature of his recent offending was affected by his schizophrenia, antisocial behaviour, and other mental health issues – alongside financial motive, Hanley found.
The judge described the crimes as “extremely distressing” for the victims, but said full-time prison may risk “interrupting what appears to be a genuine, sustained course of rehabilitation in all the circumstances. There has been a significant change in insight he’s demonstrated.”
Phillip See, who was supported in court by his mother, sat emotionless as he learnt he would not return to jail.
His reoffending – albeit on a smaller scale – was not shocking for Pickett.
“It didn’t surprise me at all that he went back to do it,” he said.
“The lack of sophistication and type of burglary [this time] surprised me.”

El Jannah’s cousin has entered Sydney’s chicken shop wars

El Jannah’s cousin has entered Sydney’s chicken shop wars
James Estephan’s new Lebanese charcoal chicken shop, nestled on the single shopping strip of Belfield in Sydney’s south-west, is surrounded.
There are two El Jannah outlets in the neighbouring suburbs of Punchbowl and Burwood. Then there is Anar in Croydon and Awafy in Belmore, not to be confused with Awafi (named for an Arabic saying that loosely means “good health”), which has locations in Punchbowl and Revesby.
“This area actually knows what good charcoal chicken is supposed to taste like,” Estephan says.
Then come the fighting words. “But like, tasting good charcoal chicken with heaps of flavour – I just think that’s missing,” he says.
The success of his new chicken shop Char’d will come down to its rivals, Estephan believes, not despite them. This is a baptism of fire: the suburbs of western Sydney are full of residents of Lebanese heritage, the top nominated ancestry that comprises 14-17 per cent of the local population on Australian Bureau of Statistics figures.
It is the same hotspot that gave rise to national chain El Jannah, which was founded in 1998, already has 50 locations and is rapidly expanding towards a goal of 500, aided by an $800 million injection last year from US investment giant General Atlantic.
El Jannah’s undeniable role in introducing thousands of Australians to Lebanese charcoal chicken for the first time and proving its broad appeal across mainstream Australia has meant it is the standard against which Char’d (and any other Lebanese charcoal chicken merchant) will be measured.
Then there’s the family name: James Estephan’s grandfather is a cousin of the father of Andre Estephan, co-founder of El Jannah. That makes the two men second cousins once removed. Lineage aside, their respective families have lived largely separate lives.
“I just want to set a new standard,” Estephan says. “But if the standard is El Jannah and everyone compares me to them, that’s pretty fine.”
If you can’t join ’em, beat ’em
Prowess with poultry seems to run in the family. After starting his working life at McDonald’s at the age of 14, James Estephan spent three years in the digital marketing and brand management team of Red Rooster, one of four chicken chains run by Craveable Brands. At the time, Craveable was headed by chief executive Brett Houldin, who had attempted to acquire El Jannah before he jumped ship to lead the Lebanese chicken shop’s national rollout.
Estephan had in early 2020 tried, at first, to join the family business, and had explored the option of owning an El Jannah franchise, but found the cost (about $1 million) too steep for his budget. In mid-2021, he took over a chicken shop in western Sydney’s Eastern Creek called Paradise and another in St Clair that he rebranded to Char’d two years later.
As he eyes expansion, Estephan has little room for error. He is wary of falling into the same pitfalls that some former El Jannah fans – often early adopters, or of Lebanese descent – are now criticising the growing franchise for, including poorer quality control, often attributed to rapid expansion, accusations of “selling out”, and dry chicken.
“I’ve [built] the whole brand on the negatives of other places that I’ve heard,” the 30-year-old says.
“You jump on Google reviews, Facebook, Instagram, you read comments, and you see what people are lacking, and then you do the opposite.”
When this masthead visited ahead of the Char’d Belfield branch’s soft launch last Thursday, at least half a dozen curious passers-by stopped to inquire whether it was open for business.
El Jannah chief executive Brett Houldin wasn’t one of them. Houldin says he hadn’t heard of Char’d until asked about it by this masthead, but he wishes Estephan well and says that more players will raise awareness of Lebanese cuisine.
“There [are] copycats in every industry,” Houldin says.
“I think smaller brands are trying to look at how we’ve done things and why we’ve been successful, and that’s great. The imitation is flattering.”
Houldin says he is confident of the consistency and quality of El Jannah’s product and service standards.
“All roads don’t mean that everyone’s going to be the best,” he says. “We have the highest performing fast food brand in the country, and that means there will be others that want to see if they can try and get a piece of that.”
Tim Fawaz, interim chief executive of Craveable Brands, the parent company that operates Oporto, Red Rooster, Chargrill Charlie’s and Chicken Treat, says the brands are constantly innovating their menus as customers become more adventurous with flavours and range.
“Competition is healthy, it’s a sign the category is growing and Australians continue to love chicken, which after a period of uncertainty for the [quickservice restaurant] industry in the years following COVID, is a good thing,” Fawaz says. The company, which acquired Chargrill Charlie’s in May 2023, is not looking at any other acquisitions.
Estephan, for his part, is toeing a similar line. He has plenty of praise for what El Jannah has done to expand the appeal of Lebanese cuisine. “Honestly, I look up to them. What they’ve done is great,” he says. “[But] our food is 100 per cent better.”

Epstein files reveal scope of Ghislaine Maxwell’s role in Clinton circle

Epstein files reveal scope of Ghislaine Maxwell’s role in Clinton circle
New York: Jeffrey Epstein’s long-time companion, Ghislaine Maxwell, played a substantial role in supporting the creation of the Clinton Global Initiative, one of former US president Bill Clinton’s signature post-White House endeavours, new documents released by the Justice Department show.
Maxwell took part in budget discussions related to the first Clinton Global Initiative conference; talked through challenges about it with both Clinton aides and Publicis Groupe, the company that produced the inaugural event; and arranged to wire $US1 million to pay Publicis for its work on “the Clinton project”, according to emails in the massive cache of documents collected as part of the government’s investigations of Epstein.
The source of the money is unclear, including whether Epstein provided the funds. However, the emails show he was aware of the payment.
“Ask him to tell you why i million now and where will it be going,” Epstein wrote to Maxwell a few days after she received the wiring instructions from Publicis.
Maxwell’s involvement in the launch of the Clinton Global Initiative took place in 2004, before Epstein’s 2006 indictment and 2008 guilty plea for solicitation of prostitution with a minor, and long before Maxwell, a daughter of media baron Robert Maxwell, was sentenced in 2022 to two decades in prison for conspiring with Epstein to sexually exploit under-age girls.
The emails support an assertion Maxwell made last year in an interview with the Justice Department that she played a key role in helping set up the global conference.
Clinton has said he stopped speaking with Epstein sometime before his 2006 indictment. In a statement, Angel Ureña, a spokesperson for the Clintons, said the former president had “called for the full release of the Epstein files” and “has nothing to hide”.
“He knew nothing about Epstein’s crimes,” Ureña said. “When it became clear Epstein had no genuine interest in life-saving philanthropic work, there was no reason for further contact. The facts are the facts and the truth is the truth, and they’re both on our side.”
The new documents provide texture about the connections between the Clinton and Epstein circles, which have long generated a swirl of conspiracy theories and unverified allegations.
The emails reinforce previous accounts that Clinton and those around him had a more enduring relationship with Maxwell than with Epstein. In addition to her involvement with the Clinton Global Initiative, the records reveal that Maxwell had flirtatious exchanges in the early 2000s with Doug Band, who at the time was Clinton’s top aide.
She was known to have attended Chelsea Clinton’s 2010 wedding along with her then-boyfriend, Ted Waitt, a tech billionaire who was a friend of the Clintons and a prolific Clinton Foundation donor. And she remained in the Clinton orbit even after reports began surfacing accusing her of misconduct related to Epstein’s abuse of young women. Maxwell told the Justice Department last year that she last saw Bill Clinton sometime between 2016 and 2018, when she said they had dinner together in Los Angeles.
In a Justice Department interview last year, Maxwell said “president Clinton was my friend, not Epstein’s friend”. Her lawyer did not return requests for comment.
A review by The New York Times of references to the Clintons in the recently released files found very little related to former US secretary of state Hillary Clinton and limited new information about the former president’s interactions with Epstein, a Democratic donor who supported Bill Clinton’s 1992 political campaign and donated $US10,000 to help refurbish the White House. He also donated $US20,000 to Hillary Clinton’s Senate campaign in 1999.
Logs that have previously been made public show that Epstein visited the White House a number of times during the Clinton administration and that Bill Clinton took four international trips on Epstein’s private jet in 2002 and 2003. Hillary Clinton has said she never flew on Epstein’s plane.
The former president has said he never visited Epstein’s private island in the US Virgin Islands, an account supported by emails between Epstein and his associates. (The Secret Service has indicated in the past that its agents have not been to the island, and said in a statement that “at this time, we have no new information to provide regarding this matter”.)
House Republicans have sought to put a spotlight on ties between the Clintons and Epstein, and threatened to hold them both in criminal contempt of Congress if they did not testify in the House oversight committee’s investigation into the convicted sex offender. Those depositions are scheduled for the end of this month.
Bill Clinton has tried to downplay his association with Epstein. In a sworn declaration submitted to the House panel last month, Clinton said while Epstein may have visited the White House while he was president, “I do not recall encountering Epstein, or any specific interactions with him, while in office”.
The former president also said that he did not recall when he first met Maxwell, “though I believe she was working for Epstein at the time”. Clinton said he did not recall his specific interactions with her or when he last saw her, “but it was many years ago”.
US President Donald Trump, who socialised extensively with Epstein and also travelled on his private plane, has expressed misgivings that the Clintons are being forced to testify, despite his repeated attacks on both of them over the years.
“I think it’s a shame, to be honest,” Trump told reporters this week. “I always liked him. Her? Yeah, she’s a very capable woman.”
For his part, Trump had warm words for Maxwell in 2020, after her arrest, saying, “I just wish her well, frankly”. Both presidents appear to have provided messages for a book put together for Epstein’s 50th birthday, though Trump’s staff has denied it.
A behind-the-scenes role
The Clinton Global Initiative was conceived in the early 2000s as Clinton’s version of the annual gathering of the global elite in Davos, Switzerland, with the goal of imbuing it with a more charity-minded mission to shape his post-presidential legacy.
Band, who has since had a bitter break with the Clintons, has long been credited with being the driving force behind the project. Maxwell’s involvement has been largely unknown.
But in her Justice Department interview last year, Maxwell said she had a “very central” role in setting up the Clinton Global Initiative, though she added that the idea was not originally hers. “I don’t try to elevate myself in any form of importance here,” she added.
Maxwell also indicated that Epstein was engaged in the effort, saying he “supported me to help them, but then I think he may have tried to use that to insert himself in some way”.
Richard Attias, a former top executive at Publicis, said in an interview this past week that Maxwell had played a key role in getting the project going.
“She was in Davos with president Clinton, and this is when they realised the amazing impact of Davos, and they came up with the idea of creating something similar, but with a different philosophy,” he said.
Attias said Maxwell sent the $US1 million to Publicis to pay for its work producing the event, which was held in New York in September 2005. He said he was not aware of who provided the funding but believed it likely came from multiple sources.
After initially saying he did not believe Epstein was involved, Attias later described Epstein as “one of the sponsors”, but in follow-up texts to the Times, he also said he didn’t really remember, noting the discussions took place more than two decades ago.
Attias, who left Publicis in 2008 – and who has since produced conferences for the Times – said in texts and the interview that he was ultimately uncertain about the extent of Epstein’s involvement in the Clinton conference.
In 2007, when Epstein’s lawyers were seeking lenient treatment for their client as he was being investigated for sex trafficking, they asserted in a letter to prosecutors that he “was part of the original group that conceived the Clinton Global Initiative”.
‘President Clinton was my friend, not Epstein’s friend.’Ghislaine Maxwell in a Justice Department interview last year
The Times identified one 2004 email to Maxwell from Attias in which he appeared to reference Epstein.
“I trust you and JE at 300 percent,” Attias wrote, while pleading for her to call off what appeared to be a lawyer for Epstein who was demanding a wide range of specific budget details early in the planning stages. (“We have no idea of what will be the programme, the venue, the hotels, the consultants, the speakers, etc. … ” Attias wrote to Maxwell.)
In a statement, the Clinton Foundation, which now runs the Clinton Global Initiative, said it accepted only one $US25,000 donation in 2006 from an Epstein-affiliated foundation, which has been previously reported. The foundation said it did not have any record of any other financial contributions to the Clinton Foundation or the Clinton Global Initiative related to Epstein or Maxwell.
“Publicis funded the development of the event which they were ultimately hired to produce,” the foundation said, adding that it “was not responsible for raising money for Publicis’ business”.
Post-presidential ties
Maxwell’s involvement in the kick-off of the Clinton Global Initiative came during a period when she and Epstein were both socialising with the former president.
In 2002, less than two years after leaving the White House, Clinton flew on Epstein’s plane on a 10-day trip to seven countries, including Ghana and Nigeria. Other passengers on the trip, which has been previously reported, included Maxwell and actors Kevin Spacey and Chris Tucker, according to flight manifests and photos that are among the documents that have been released.
At some point, Clinton appears to have handwritten a thank-you note to Epstein on stationery that Epstein kept on one of his planes. The Times obtained a photo of the undated note, which was framed and recovered from Epstein’s estate. In it, the former president thanked the financier for letting him “invade your private space” and explained that he had been “exhausted and had to get away from the crowd”. He also wrote that “as we forge ahead, i’ll finally figure out the financial stuff!”
The newly released files show numerous interactions between Maxwell and the former president’s aides.
In November 2002, Maxwell arranged to send Clinton what she described as “devil slippers” for his birthday, an email shows. The next month, Maxwell and a Clinton aide corresponded about talking points for how to respond to a Vanity Fair reporter who was writing a profile on Epstein. The same day, another Clinton aide, Ira Magaziner, sent Maxwell an email describing a Clinton project to combat AIDS.
Asked about the contact, Magaziner said in an email to the Times that he had sent the kind of information he shared with potential donors about what would become the Clinton Health Access Initiative, a group that fights disease in dozens of countries.
During this period, Maxwell and Band, then a Clinton aide, were also exchanging suggestive emails, the documents show.
“Booboo,” Maxwell wrote to him in 2002, “are you around? I am very ill and require immediate medical attention – I am suffering from boobooitis – a very serious condition. Without a booboo fix the symptoms become very pronounced.”
She referred to “cries into the night that sound like Shakespeare sonnets that sound like this – Oh Douglas – oh Douglas – wherefore art though Douglas”.
The same day, Band replied that “my boobooitis is also reaching epic poportions”, adding, “Lots going on but will be In boobooville the second you arrive”.
During their exchanges, they facilitated connections between Clinton and Epstein. In an April 2002 message, Band wrote: “the pres wanted me to tell you to tell jeffrey he says hello and he misses him.”
In a statement to the Times, Band said his communication with Maxwell occurred when he was in his late 20s and unmarried.
“There was absolutely no physical relationship that occurred between us. Ever,” he said, calling Maxwell “a monster”.
In 2011, Band sent an email to another Clinton aide, directing him to “remove” Maxwell “from all lists” giving her access to Clinton-related events as questions about her conduct grew, according to a copy of the email viewed by the Times.
Earlier that year, a Daily Mail report had dubbed her “Epstein’s ‘Girl Friday’ Fixer”.
Ureña, the Clintons’ spokesperson, said nothing was communicated broadly across the organisation at the time about banning Maxwell.
Maxwell resurfaced at a Clinton Global Initiative event in 2013, after Band left the Clintons’ employ, and was honoured for an ocean conservation project.

What’s the secret to a well-rounded life? These researchers have a theory
Whether it’s crafting or learning to play a ukelele, a hobby can boost your mental health and improve your ability to focus. Here’s why.
Everybody should have a hobby, Winston Churchill famously declared, ideally two or three. The wartime British PM daubed landscapes in oil, collected butterflies and even tried his hand at bricklaying to distract himself from the threat of Nazi invasion. Churchill, who was also a passionate advocate for the restorative properties of a power nap, preferably after a boozy lunch, believed hobbies helped stave off depression and boosted creativity.
Indeed, there is a body of evidence that suggests what might be seen as frivolous extracurricular activities – quilting, choir singing, bush dancing, boat-building, restoring motorcycles, whatever – can maintain our mental health and, in particular, improve our ability to focus for long periods. Especially if they generate the beneficial state of mind the Hungarian-American psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi called “flow”, when you are so absorbed in a task that it shuts out everything else.
“Sometimes a hobby finds you,” says Coral Ware, a former librarian who is still surprised that she now plays the ukulele in an amateur ensemble. “I had never played a musical instrument before, could not read music, still can’t, but had promised myself that one day, when I retired, I would learn to play an instrument,” she tells us. She met a ukulele teacher, gave it a go and one thing led to another. “I love performing, and when I am doing that I don’t think of anything else. That’s why I persist, even if sometimes they play some stuff that I don’t like, like Frank Sinatra.” She also dances classical ballet, gardens, knits, sews and reads “whodunits”.
Is watching TV a hobby? Are some hobbies better than others for you? Should we all have one?
What’s a hobby?
Definitions of “hobby” can vary, not least because the word itself is a little unfashionable, evoking creaky model railways and mildewed stamp collections – both of which were popular in Churchill’s day (today, we might prefer to describe our interest in vintage vinyl or Bitossi ceramics as a “pursuit” or “passion”).
That said, we still tend to recognise a hobby when we see it. Broadly, it’s an activity done for fun, outside paid work, that’s not passive relaxation (like watching TV) and that typically requires a degree of dedication.
A good hobby, it’s generally agreed by those who study these things, should be absorbing, offer opportunities to improve skills or knowledge (or scratch the completist itch) and should transport us away from our everyday cares. “You need to learn something, you need to have commitment, dedication to something, and then it becomes part of your identity after a while,” says Yazdan Mansourian, an expert on leisure behaviours at Charles Sturt University.
‘The spirit of a hobby, the essence of a hobby, is choice. If it becomes compulsory, if it becomes a kind of a to-do list, it’s not a hobby any more.’
A hobby’s purpose should be intrinsic: you don’t do it for any other reason than the enjoyment of the hobby itself. Think, fishing, sudoku-solving, Lego-building, scrapbooking, bonsai-growing, language-learning, pub-quizzing, birdwatching, pot-throwing, harpsichord-playing, colouring-in, woodworking, no-knead sourdough-baking. (Also, depending on your definition: pickleball, tai chi, scouring op shops, niche cinema, bodybuilding, wild swimming, unicycle riding.)
“There are varieties of leisure experience, and it’s useful to make even fuzzy distinctions,” suggests Joshua Rothman in his 2025 New Yorker essay Do We Need Hobbies? “To a degree, it matters how you do what you do. Certain kinds of video-gaming might be a hobby; others could be more like an escape. I listen to a lot of music, but I’d consider music an interest, or maybe just a source of happiness. Photography, on the other hand, is – for me – a traditional hobby. I read publications, acquire skills, buy and sell equipment, set goals, and mull various photographic problems and dilemmas in a not-quite-professional way that’s also not exactly amateurish.”
Tom Hanks hunts for vintage typewriters. Julia Roberts knits. Rod Stewart builds vast model railway dioramas. Angelina Jolie collects vintage daggers. The American songwriter Jimmy Webb built a collection of memorabilia from the defunct supersonic airliner Concorde, including several ultra-rare cockpit dials, a pair of passenger seats and even a flight attendant’s hat. Joshua Sapan, former CEO of the AMC television network (Breaking Bad, Walking Dead), amassed the world’s largest collection of lightning rods.
In Japan, there are not only regular trainspotters but hobbyists who choose to specialise in niche minutiae of the rail network: among them the yomi-tetsu, who collect and absorb train schedules (tetsu means train); the eki-tetsu, who admire stations; and the ekiben-tetsu, fascinated by the many and varied (and usually delicious) boxed meals sold at stations. Such a passion might be described as ikigai, meaning, broadly, something that brings value and joy to life.
Another Japanese word, otaku, commonly translated as “geek or nerd”, might be used to describe people whose hobbies verge on unhealthy obsessions. And beware the hobby that morphs into a side hustle or chore, says Mansourian. “The spirit of a hobby, the essence of a hobby, is choice. If it becomes compulsory, if it becomes a kind of a to-do list, it’s not a hobby any more. It becomes work again.”
Aren’t hobbies a bit old-fashioned?
Hobbies were once mostly the preserve of the wealthy. The British nobility of the 17th century (who had time for recreation, unlike the rural poor they lorded over, for whom turnip-pickling, pig raising and darning were work, not fun) enjoyed falconry and hunting on their vast estates during the day, cards and dancing after dark. A century later, Jane Austen, like her characters, wrote letters, played the piano and sewed. In the Victorian era, middle-class homemakers were gripped by “pteridomania”, an obsession with collecting and displaying rare ferns, some in elaborate greenhouses, others in new-fangled terrariums. “No home was complete without a fern under glass,” observed the 1877 book The New Practical Window Gardener.
… a Miss Margaret Allen modelled ‘fascinating’ clay horses and bred Dalmatians; actress Mrs Ian Gibson was a ‘ping-pong enthusiast’ ...
In the early 20th century, when working hours began to become more civilised and there was time for recreation that wasn’t necessarily drinking or watching TV (it not yet having been invented), fads emerged for coin collecting, railway modelling, macrame, flower-pressing, pigeon fancying. In 1933, a crowd of 30,000 Brits turned out to watch a model yacht race, of all things.
People’s hobbies became newsworthy, The Sydney Morning Herald in 1938 reporting the pastimes of some “well-known girls”: a Miss Margaret Allen modelled “fascinating” clay horses and bred Dalmatians; actress Mrs Ian Gibson was a “ping-pong enthusiast”; Mrs Lorimer Dods combined a talent for sculpture with her “skiing prowess”; Miss Jean Monckton, a member of the Australian hockey team, played the piano-accordion; Miss Joan Marks painted, cooked, sewed and taught “with equal skill”.
The paper ran a regular column, Hobby Corner, in which readers would share their tips and interests. The big one was stamp collecting, popularised by King George V (known as the “collector king”) in Britain and Australia and President Franklin Roosevelt (who himself sketched stamp designs for the postmaster-general) in the United States. In the US, the pastime blossomed during the 1930s and 1940s, having been promoted on the radio to the Great Depression-era unemployed as an affordable hobby. By 1949, philately was the most popular hobby in the US, according to the Hobby Federation, with some 2 million active collectors out of 19 million members of America’s 22,000 hobby clubs (10 million women, 7 million men and 2 million children).
By the time of the 1956 annual exposition of the Hobby Industry Association of America, in New York, where hundreds of booths were filled with recently popularised plastic models of planes, trains, cars and boats, there were some 6500 specialised hobby shops across the US and another 10,000 that carried hobby merchandise.
More recently, of course, it was the COVID pandemic that re-introduced many of us to the wonderful world of hobbies as we sought creative ways (sourdough bread baking, crocheting pot plant holders) to fill long days in lockdown and attempt to stay off our screens while “looking for meaning and purpose”, suggests Mansourian (who collected rocks as a child and now is a keen runner).
Public servant Lisa Reed also tried learning the ukulele, which didn’t stick; neither did knitting nor crochet. Somehow, though, she heard about metal detecting, bought an inexpensive machine and was instantly hooked. Not on the prospect of striking gold – her prized finds include largely worthless but interesting historical artefacts like old badges and tin toys – but on having a reason to get outdoors and enjoy a hobby with other people. “It makes me feel very content and happy if I do it every week,” she says.
Another COVID lock-in, web designer Jim Yencken, took up collecting vintage computer games then pivoted to building Lego sets, sometimes faithfully following the instructions, sometimes constructing his own unique creations. His current masterpiece, which he has displayed with a group of fellow enthusiasts called the Melbourne Lego Users Group, combines both his interests: an immensely detailed rendition of an imaginary landscape based on those in a popular Nintendo game called Animal Crossing, built from some 30,000 individual blocks (each drawn from 3D-printed, colour-coded containers in a neat IKEA-based drawer system so as to keep the townhouse he shares with his partner and six-year-old son as uncluttered as possible).
“I have spent far too much money on Lego,” he admits, estimating he runs to around 400 sets. It appeals, he says, as both a creative outlet and a way to zone out. “It is incredible for my mental health. I work a very, very stressful job in tech. It’s very difficult sometimes to put it to sleep, so that you can get to sleep. My mind’s always going and thinking about the next day and trying to solve problems that you know can probably wait, but my brain won’t turn off. And doing Lego sets, or sorting Lego pieces, is an incredible way to just turn off and be mindful and focus on what you’re doing.”
A fellow Lego enthusiast, Eve Sellars, is an artist with a background in financial planning. “So I have both a creative and a mathematical brain, and Lego just taps into both of those things. It’s all about problem-solving. It’s all about colour and creativity. It’s about engineering and making things fit and making things work. So it taps into both of those sides of my personality. It’s just perfect.”
IT professional Justin Baker’s hobby is not just an opportunity to relax but to gain some perspective on existence. By night, he captures images of other-worldly galaxies, using a special telescope that automatically tracks the movement of light from distant objects. Some mornings when he checks the night’s takings, there’s nothing but a washed-out blur, sometimes there’s an extraordinary vision.
“Every morning, I get a buzz out of it,” he tells us. “It’s relatively inexpensive and peaceful and gives you a bit of opportunity to reflect on the bigger picture. Last week, I took a really beautiful picture of the Orion Nebula, which is probably the easiest and brightest thing to see from the southern hemisphere. And it’s just got these incredible colours and beautiful shape. It’s really quite mesmerising.”
What does science have to say about hobbies?
Why hobbies can satisfy in ways that passive recreation doesn’t is of increasing interest to science. “The research shows that people who have hobbies tend to have better mental health and wellbeing, and they’re more satisfied with their overall life,” says Sharon Parker, a professor of management at Curtin University’s Future of Work Institute in Perth (who, in her spare time, makes beautiful creations from super-heated glass).
“Having a hobby reduces depression, anxiety and stress,” says Danielle Le Lagadec, a senior lecturer at CQUniversity who last year co-authored a scoping review of 11 studies into hobbyists. “It improves wellbeing, quality of life, which is closely linked to depression and anxiety, of course. And then there’s social connections, the interactions, the support. All of these things are closely related.”
Her paper, published in the journal Issues in Mental Health Nursing, also suggests that hobbies can provide emotional relief from work demands. “Individuals can achieve a healthier and more fulfilling balance between work and life by making time for personal interests,” it concludes, adding that maintaining this balance is “key to a sustainable career” and may mitigate fatigue and burnout.
‘The right approach to gaming, cooking, or hanging out with friends can have restorative benefits that spill over into the workplace.’
This was borne out by another recent study, of some 2400 working professionals, reported in Harvard Business Review. The authors, led by workplace researcher Alexander Hamrick, focused on what they described as “leisure crafting”, an approach to recreational pursuits that emphasises goal-setting and personal development. They found the study’s participants who had structured leisure time had improved mental health, overall life satisfaction and even enhanced work performance compared with those who engaged primarily in passive activities. Moreover, they said, “Our research suggests that it’s not about the specific hobby but rather the approach to it. The right approach to gaming, cooking, or hanging out with friends can have restorative benefits that spill over into the workplace.”
It’s about being in the moment, suggests Luke Smith, a clinical neuropsychologist at the Monash Centre for Consciousness and Contemplative Studies. “When you find an activity you’re interested in, it naturally lends itself to that quality of just paying fully immersive attention to something.” Sharon Parker agrees. “That’s partly why it’s such a good form of recovery from work, because you’re in that flow state. You’re fully absorbed in the activity or hobby, what you’re doing and that, by definition, means you’re not thinking about work and worrying about work and ruminating about what you need to do tomorrow. It’s psychologically healthy for people, it gives your brain a bit of a rest.”
Especially in a society that increasingly values paid work over everything else, says Mansourian. “If you are not busy, it means you are lazy, you know. And then we actually overestimate the value of work [as a source of wellbeing and personal identity]. And then, in the long term, it exhausts people. And we don’t have enough time just to be, just to be who we are, to do something that we really wish to rather than we have to.”
That was the experience of David Donohue, who 10 years ago found himself in a senior management role that was all-consuming. “I found I was getting to work then getting home from work, and by the time I wound down, it was time to go to bed and then get up and start all over again. After a while, that gets wearing and takes a toll on your mental health to the point where you go, I can’t do this, why am I here?”
‘The thing I love is a process – clear steps, read the process, understand the process. Glue A to B … It’s not rocket science.’
He turned, almost randomly, to a hobby he enjoyed as a 1970s schoolboy: gluing together and painting model planes. “It’s just such an absolute contrast to work. The phone doesn’t ring. There’s no email involved. The thing I love is a process – clear steps, read the process, understand the process. Glue A to B. Don’t get glue on your fingers, glue on the outside of the parts. It’s not rocket science.”
Building such skills, however esoteric, to the point that you really are very competent in your activity of choice, can be extremely valuable, Parker tells us, because it involves mastery. “Your hobby is a really powerful form of growth and development and self-esteem,” she says. “The research … actually shows that people who engage in activities that involve mastery recover better from work. It helps you to feel good about yourself and recover and replenish yourself.” (But beware the urge to perfect your hobby skills at the expense of enjoyment: it’s beneficial to dabble, too, say the experts.)
Hobbies that engage you with other people, meanwhile, bring additional benefits, says Smith (who loves swimming and collecting vinyl records). “When you look at longitudinal studies that have explored human wellbeing, things like our success in life, our happiness, longevity and health, research tells us that the quality of our relationships and connections to other people is crucial for most of these things. So you could have an individual hobby, which is wonderful, where you feel really immersed and interested, but you could also have a hobby where you get to share that passion with other people.”
‘There are embroidery groups and knitting groups and they get together and have a good old natter ...’
Absolutely, says Pauline Moncrieff, who solves cryptic crosswords with a group of like-minded puzzlers convened by the University of the Third Age. “I just love the group interaction as well. If you’ve got a hobby, it’s lovely to be able to do it with someone else. There are embroidery groups and knitting groups, and they get together and have a good old natter while they’re doing it. And I think it’s very healthy.”
David Donohue admits he’s not a “joiner” but found his hobby led him to find his own tribe, too, advertised on a little sign at the local library: The North Queensland Scale Modellers. “People talk about what they’re building, ask you what you’re doing, glue some stuff together, have a chat, a few jokes. It’s just very casual, no dramas, and it was really a comfortable place to be.”
Bottom line, says Mansourian: “Looking for meaning and purpose, that’s the main thing. We are looking for ourselves. We are looking for a sense of agency. We want to have a space to be whoever we are and do whatever we wish.”

Taylor faces formidable task rebuilding Liberals' electoral fortunes
About 48 hours before two-thirds of the Liberal party room voted to oust Sussan Ley as leader, a Parliament House security guard working the X-ray machine remarked it was shaping up to be a "big week".
The man confessed there was "not a political bone" in his body, but an almost decade-long career in the building meant he knew the signs.
"It's the body language," he said, referring to the Liberals.
"The depression, the stress … they're miserable."
The clear air Ley was never granted
The Liberals' dire polling reflects a party that is under siege from the right and yet to make inroads reclaiming votes from what Ley once described as the "sensible centre".
Then there's the extraordinarily fractured relationship with the Nationals, who have consistently chased their own policy priorities no matter the impact on the Coalition.
And all this played out against a backdrop of sniping and undermining that never really granted Ley the "clear air" she has now promised to give her successor, Angus Taylor.
It's no wonder her supporters were wearing their despair so plainly on their faces as they trudged into Parliament House each day.
But the depressed mood went beyond moderates and the loosely unaligned Liberals who had backed Ley in the last leadership battle with Taylor.
Many in the party's right faction were growing tired of waiting on tenterhooks for their preferred leader, who had never planned to take on Ley so early in her tenure, to make a move.
When Taylor did walk into Ley's office to offer his resignation on Wednesday evening, the relief among Liberals was palpable.
From the populist conservatives still smarting over Andrew Hastie's pre-emptive leadership contest withdrawal, to the Ley staffers aware they may have to imminently update their resumes, there was a shared sense the limbo had ended.
What followed was a textbook spill orchestrated to maximise momentum, ultimately delivering Taylor a comfortable 34-17 win as fence-sitters in the party room realised where the numbers lay.
LoadingABC obtains talking points
In the days since Taylor defeated Ley, plenty has been said about where it all went wrong for the federal Liberals' first female leader.
Few in the party believe Ley ever really cut through to voters.
But her backers argue a dedicated group of agitators were determined to make sure she never got the chance.
As Taylor outlined his vision for the party on Friday, some in the Ley camp pointed out his focus on values, immigration, housing attainability and the economy was not so unfamiliar.
Shadow ministry "talking points" from the day before Ley was rolled, obtained by this column, begin with a section called "our values".
The document, which is updated daily with guidance on various current news topics to assist senior Liberals fronting the media, declared "aspiration is the foundation of the Australian promise".
It stated the Liberal Party wanted to "reward effort, not punish success", while several pages were dedicated to the economy and housing.
The "message of the day" was that it was "Labor's cost of living crisis. They spend, prices rise. Australians pay".
Then there was the finalised immigration policy — described as "hardline" by sources familiar with the version Ley was to hand down on Monday — as well as housing and small business policies in the works.
"We had a plan," one Liberal in the Ley camp said.
Another said Ley also knew she "had to go if she couldn't turn it around", but their internal overtures for her to be given a little more time fell on deaf ears.
The challenge ahead
Liberal MPs and senators not strongly aligned to either side of the leadership contest wondered if realistically there was any chance Ley and her team could bounce back.
Even moderates privately remarked Ley had drifted from the vision she outlined upon taking the role when she vowed to win back young Australians, women and multicultural communities who have abandoned the party in droves.
There was also an inevitability to her facing a challenge this term.
Taylor may have been forced to move on an accelerated timeline set in motion by Hastie's supporters, but his leadership ambitions were no secret.
He now picks up the formidable task of rebuilding the Liberals' electoral fortunes.
Taylor and his new deputy, Jane Hume, must beat back a resurgent One Nation and woo the city and suburban seats that have ditched the Liberals in favour of teal independents and Labor.
The new leadership team chose the backyard of a family home in the regional NSW town of Goulburn to launch an attack on Labor's economic record and pledge support for aspiration.
Noting the owners were considering downsizing to keep up with soaring costs, Senator Hume declared families were "looking for an opportunity to get ahead".
Within weeks their early strategy will be tested with what could end up being a messy four- or even five-corner contest by-election in Ley's rural NSW seat of Farrer.
If Taylor, who is a traditional Liberal in almost every sense, fails to chart a course back from the brink of electoral oblivion, his colleagues will next look for generational change.
In 12 months, a fresh leadership ballot could spark another contest involving the likes of Hastie or even moderate Victorian MP Tim Wilson.
Friday's decisive spill result will give Taylor more internal authority than Ley ever had, but the distrust and impatience in the party room that cut her tenure short still lingers.
The agenda Ley was developing shows the Liberals were already circling the policy terrain Taylor now wants to lead on.
Stabilising the right flank and restoring metropolitan credibility will require time — something not enough Liberals were inclined to give Ley.
The paralysing uncertainty that weighed on the Liberals' faces has lifted for now, but morale in politics follows results rather than reshuffles.

Are new protest laws protecting safety or limiting democracy?

Australians' right to protest may be more fragile than you think
From 418 arrests in 1977 to fresh clashes in Sydney: Debate over Australia's right to protest continues
"The day of the political street march is over," Joh Bjelke-Petersen declared. "Don't bother to apply for a permit. You won't get one. That's government policy now."
A few weeks later, thousands of people defied then-Queensland premier Bjelke-Petersen's proclamation and gathered in Brisbane for an anti-uranium march.
Ian Curr remembers an intense, unrelenting heat on that day nearly 50 years ago. It was "boiling hot", the long-time anti-nuclear activist says. So hot that when protesters sat on the road, arms-linked in passive defiance, it was "not very pleasant" because the tarmac was scorching. Other memories emerge from the haze: lines of police, three and four deep, surrounding protesters; a woman with tears streaming down her face who had just heard her partner was arrested.
Fear swirled up spines and into the air. These were the years after the Springbok tour anti-apartheid protests had been violently suppressed.
That afternoon in October 1977, 418 people were arrested and Queensland's "right to march" movement was baptised. Civil liberties demonstrations continued until the ban — originally enacted to curb a growing anti-nuclear movement — was lifted two years later.
Ross Gwyther was exhilarated seeing some 5,000 anti-nuclear marchers turn out that day. But the sensation was tempered by an "intense fear because there'd already been many cases of police brutality".
These were extraordinary times, as the Fitzgerald Inquiry would later attest. For Gwyther and many of the ratbags, activists and civil libertarians of Queensland it was a defining moment. That era in Brisbane radicalised a lot of people, Gwyther says, who embarked on a lifetime of "political activism, both through parliamentary politics or by grass roots politics".
These moments mark you, Curr says, turning to the events in Sydney this week. "The people who saw that violence in Sydney, in 40 or 50 years, they will not forget it. In the same way I do not forget police brandishing batons and punching and throwing people into paddy wagons. It's something you do not forget."
In the aftermath of last Monday's protest against Israeli President Isaac Herzog's visit in Sydney, shaky, chaotic videos began to emerge online. A man lies on tram tracks, restrained by officers, who punch him 18 times. Protesters are pushed, they struggle to their feet, crowds stumble around them. Men bowed in prayer are wrenched from their worship by police. A grandmother is in hospital with a spinal injury. She says she feared being suffocated in a stampede as she lay on the ground in agony. She alleges she was pushed over by police.
NSW Premier Chris Minns and senior police officers have defended police, calling their actions "proportionate" and saying they faced an "impossible situation". Civil liberties and human rights groups have sounded the alarm and NSW's police watchdog, the Law Enforcement Conduct Commission, has announced it will investigate officers' conduct.
The footage and reports of protesters being punched and pushed by police officers in Sydney last Monday have sparked concerns about the fragility of Australians' right to protest and what constitutes a reasonable police response.
What many may not realise is that the right to protest in Australia is not protected by one simple law. It's implied in the constitution under freedom of political communication and exists under international human rights law, which Australia has agreed to uphold. Only Queensland, Victoria and the ACT explicitly protect the right to peaceful assembly, freedom of association and freedom of expression. And laws protecting the right to peaceful protest in Australia can be limited.
People assume that a right to protest means "you and I are free to get around the place, free to gather with people and free to express ourselves," says Simon Rice, professor emeritus of law and social justice at the University of Sydney.
Saying we have a right to protest "is too simple", he says. "A better description is that we have a right to protest subject to constraints imposed by legislation."
Australian governments have increasingly been passing laws restricting certain protest activities — the Australian Human Rights Commission says this trend is particularly evident when it comes to environmental protests.
In the past five years alone, South Australia established Australia's harshest fine — up to $50,000 — for "obstructing a public place" following climate protests in Adelaide that caused traffic chaos. NSW created tougher penalties for protesters who "shut down major economic activity" after climate activists disrupted operations around Sydney's Port Botany. Tasmania brought in harsher penalties around trespass and committing any action that obstructs a business, and Victoria established laws to protect logging sites from protesters.
Victoria has also passed laws to crack down on "dangerous and radical" protest behaviour, giving police new powers to unmask protesters and banning symbols used by terrorist organisations and attachment devices like glue, ropes or locks — the kind often used in non-violent direct action by environmental activists and famously used by feminist activists like Zelda D'Aprano who locked herself to buildings calling for better conditions for women in the workforce. A statue of Zelda, chains in hand, was unveiled in Melbourne by former PM Julia Gillard in 2023.
NSW passed hate speech laws which included a provision to restrict protests near places of worship and, after the Bondi attack, passed a law to restrict mass protests in the wake of a terrorism incident.
An analysis of anti-protest legislation introduced in parliaments across Australia by the Human Rights Law Council concluded the right to protest in Australia was being eroded. The report, published in 2024, found 49 laws have been passed in the last two decades that constrict the right to protest. "The state of greatest concern is NSW, which has enacted the highest number of anti-protest laws in the last 20 years," the report found.
Some legal scholars have been critical of such laws, arguing they're often poorly designed, rushed through parliament and even unconstitutional.
In 2020, at the height of the pandemic, law professor Simon Rice suggested to his students researching protesting laws they might like to observe a protest over student fees occurring at the University of Sydney. Tension between a right to protest and the need for public health safe-distancing restrictions would come to a head.
The restrictions to protest imposed in Sydney last week were not a one-off. Limitations on freedom of expression, peaceful assembly and freedom of association can be imposed by governments, and it's generally argued are necessary in a democratic society, for a raft of reasons, including to protect the rights and freedoms of others. Rice thought it would be interesting to observe how this tension played out one grey Sydney afternoon. Then he was arrested.
"I was grabbed from behind … My legs were kicked out from under me and I fell to my hands and knees. Trying to get up, I was pushed back down. Told I was under arrest, I was issued a fine for breaching the COVID Public Health Order," he wrote. He later successfully sued NSW Police over the arrest.
How police interpret the wide-ranging powers they have to respond to protests and maintain public order — the specifics differ from state to state — is something that concerns Rice.
The laws regarding the right to protest "are in the hands of police," he says. "Police are exercising discretion. So the manifestation of the limits on our right to protest are decisions that the police make on the ground." He believes police regulating the right to protest is a problem "because they're unaccountable in the way they do that".
Monday's protest in Sydney occurred under what the NSW government had declared a "major event" which gave police additional powers to issue move-on orders, close certain locations and search people in designated parts of the city. The government argued the declaration was aimed at ensuring public safety, something the state's supreme court ultimately agreed with when it dismissed the Palestine Action Group's legal challenge against the extra powers given to police.
Rice says the additional powers essentially created a "protest exclusion zone" but argues that does not render them "human rights-free zones".
He argues a national Human Rights Act would define standards against which protest laws could be measured. "At the moment we've just got opinion and feeling and nothing objective to point to," he says.
Rice says the stakes are high. If protest becomes too legally risky, he argues, it not only impacts how public order is kept but threatens democracy itself.
Luke McNamara, a law professor at the University of NSW who researches criminalisation as a public policy tool, was at the Sydney march last week. He attended as both a long-time supporter of Palestinian self-determination and to gather information for his academic work: who gets to march, who is moved on, who decides.
He describes "a large gathering of peaceful protesters. Lots of speeches, lots of cheering, lots of chanting".
McNamara says the size of the police presence and the strategy to restrict the movement of protesters was atypical. The incidents of violence, which he did not witness, left him "saddened and shocked".
"Using cliches, we associate that kind of environment with other parts of the world," he says.
McNamara argues new laws introduced last year which suspend the mechanism enabling a protest organiser to notify police and seek the status of an authorised protest are poor.
"That [authorisation] system relies on the idea that there is an underlying right to peaceful assembly," McNamara says. "And that includes the right to move, to march, to process."
He is concerned these limitations creep towards criminalising protest, exposing demonstrators to the risk of being charged.
With fresh challenges to these laws already before the courts, McNamara hopes for a less adversarial outcome: "Calm, unhurried consideration of what the legal landscape should be."
"Many of the things that we can celebrate today started as protests," says Adam Al Hayek, a healthcare worker who volunteers with Legal Observers NSW.
"Whether it's around women's rights and social justice, environmental rights, LGBT rights, even when it comes to things like the referendum in the 1960s to include First Nations people to be able to vote."
These protest movements weren't always popular, Al Hayek says, "but over time they did become popular and were able to elicit the change that we saw."
History's arc motivates his voluntary work with the network, which monitors police action and supports activists at protests. Its volunteers hand out "bust cards" educating protesters on their legal rights and advocate for their safety.
Legal observer networks have existed throughout the world within different struggles; in Australia their roots are in Redfern. In the late 1960s Aboriginal activists started monitoring and documenting instances of police harassment and brutality.
Of Monday's protest Al Hayek says he believes police tactics escalated what was a peaceful protest — something the government and senior police deny.
"A lot of times I've had people come up to me at a protest and ask, 'Why is there so many police?'" He says it "spooks" people. "When you ask the police, they tell you, 'We're here for your safety' but when you ask a protester they tell you they don't feel safe."
This concerns him most because he believes high visibility policing discourages people from attending protests. "I think that's problematic because it feels like police are discouraging the use of protest as an avenue [in a democracy]."
Sean Scalmer, a political historian at the University of Melbourne, says historically, the right to protest has never been definitively secured or forfeited but is "an ongoing process of contest and renegotiation".
By their nature, if protest movements are going to be effective, they are going to involve disruption, Scalmer says, "and that disruption, if it becomes significant enough, is always going to provoke anger and sometimes encourage governments to limit it".
He goes even further, arguing a degree of disruption is embedded in the very meaning of protest. If a meeting place between the right to protest and the authority of representative governments was reached, "it would only be defined by representative governments and democracy itself would lose its vitality".
Scalmer highlights the middle of the 19th century — an era of "mass enfranchisement" specifically of white men — as a bold democratic experiment in Australia. It also marked the moment restrictions were placed on citizens' right to protest, he says.
In 1860, some 3,000 demonstrators gathered outside the Victorian parliament. They threw stones at police and pushed on the doors of parliament house, demanding access to land for small-scale farming. This battle against the power of the squattocracy was a defining moment, Scalmer says. The result was legislation which limited the capacity of people to assemble near Parliament House.
Back in 1860 — at a time when representative government was gaining strength — debate around protest centred on whether white men, who were allowed to vote, should be entitled to protest at all. The thinking went that surely this right was accommodated at the ballot box and people on the streets could threaten parliamentary authority.
During World War I the federal government passed the War Precautions Act 1914, delivering sweeping powers that restricted civil liberties including controlling public gatherings, imposing censorship and restricting freedom of speech. Scalmer argues the attorney-general at the time, Billy Hughes, used the Act to suppress dissent.
In WWII, the national Security Act of 1939 did similar work.
As the 20th century progressed, social movements became more emboldened, taking to the streets to challenge governments to change their policies. Scalmer names the protest movements which occurred under Bjelke-Petersen as some of the most determined and significant for those who believe protest is vital to a healthy democracy.
Almost 50 years after the Queensland "right to march" movement, activist Ian Curr is in awe of the "ordinary men and women" who sat down on a Brisbane street in defiance of a protest ban with their arms linked.
"It was very hard to get people to even do that as a means of solidarity and self-defence," he says. "I believe ordinary people, especially in Australia, they're very averse to any sort of confrontation."

I have visited every country in the world. Here’s what hurt and what made my soul soar

I have visited every country in the world. Here’s what hurt and what made my soul soar
A dry windswept stretch of coast unfolds in front of the derelict Red Sea Diving Resort, a site made famous by a film of the same name. In the mid-1980s, Israeli Mossad agents used it as a secret base in the evacuation of Ethiopian Jewish refugees who were being persecuted.
Today, the wind blows through the rusted door frames. There is no glass in the windows. I am in Sudan, and I have now visited every country in the world.
Fewer than 500 people (including about 10 Australians) have had the privilege of doing this, according to NomadMania, a group that verifies people’s claims, including mine.
Visiting a country is not about ticking it off a list. It is about meeting people, sharing experiences and making friends across cultures and communities. It is a mindset as much as an activity. It is, above all, about a willingness to learn.
I have seen a lot in the years of visiting every country – things traumatic and things that made my soul soar. And I have learnt a lot. This is a small selection of what I experienced.
Working for the Red Cross in Rwanda in the 1990s, I had 3500 rotting corpses at my feet in a church outside Kigali. The smell has never left me. I saw scenes of devastation in the former Yugoslavia; the dead children remain burnt into my soul. I returned to Rwanda and Bosnia in 2016 to see a peace – if fragile – in both countries.
In 1999, I had the privilege of being part of the team that monitored the independence referendum in Timor-Leste, and later, I helped train officials to monitor their own elections. The president-designate, Xanana Gusmao, surprisingly turned up to one of my training sessions. He said to me: “Andrew, you are helping my country, so you don’t come to see me, I come to see you.” The man’s humility was inspiring.
From 2005 to 2008, I was in Pakistan, dealing with the emergency relief and recovery following the massive earthquake in Kashmir. I worked with a leader in the Pakistan army, Nadeem Ahmed, not something I would have expected when I did my own military training with the Australian army. Nadeem was the military co-ordinator for the relief effort and later head of the reconstruction. We developed a close relationship, like a “big brother, little brother”, through the shared experience of fighting a natural catastrophe. I stay in touch with him to this day.
In the Philippines, I ran a program using advanced DNA techniques to help children find their sex tourist fathers and gain the rights and support to which they are entitled.
In a central African country that shall remain nameless, I was contacted by the prime minister who asked me to “transfer some money” to his nephew in Italy. I kept giving excuses until I could get out of the country.
In Tuvalu, the country in the world perhaps most at risk of sea-level rise, I met a child whose life objective was to be “a climate warrior” to save her “mother”, Tuvalu.
In Saudi Arabia, I saw how fast and real the change is, and how genuinely excited young people, including women, are for the future there.
In North Korea, I was stunned by just how much a government can control the thinking of a population. Human beings can only have choice if they have two or more sources of competing information. In North Korea, people have only one source of information, and most believe, wrongly, that they live in a good country.
Surprisingly, North Korea was one of the easier countries to visit. On the other hand, two of the most difficult countries for me to visit were Nauru and Nicaragua.
In Libya, I met Hails Kennedy, a blind forty-something woman with alopecia. She is the first registered disabled female to visit every country. In many “difficult” countries, the frequent travellers I met most were female. It was they who taught me that “gender doesn’t prevent or restrict travel, mindset does”.
And then to Sudan, my last country to visit. About 20 years ago, I wrote an internal UNHCR document that recognised killing in the Sudanese region of Darfur as genocide. The killing continues today, and the number of deaths far exceed that of Gaza. In Sudan now, I think of the Black Lives Matter movement, and the massive protests supporting Palestinians, and I can’t help but wonder why it is that these black lives don’t matter enough to protest, too?
I have trauma from some of the things I have seen and experienced, particularly in the 1990s. But even though I have travelled to every corner of the world, I find an antidote to the trauma in a very Australian place. When I go to the MCG and watch up to 100,000 people enjoying a game, supporters all mixed together, I think of how lucky we are. This place helps me bury the worst of my memories.
Of all things I have learnt from visiting every country in the world, three things rise above all others.
Firstly, most people in the world want the same thing. They want a better future for their children. It’s just that often they have a different definition or idea of the word “better”.
Secondly, I learnt that one should never feel guilty about one’s privilege. Feel guilty only if you do nothing with it.
Thirdly, never assume the safety we have in Australia will remain. We must be constantly vigilant to protect what makes us great – both tolerance and multiculturalism. Our strength and culture is being tested now.

Sneaker moguls more than double their money on $18m Rose Bay pad
Hype DC co-founders Danny and Cindy Gilbert turned a hobby into a business 28 years ago, and that move appears to have paid off in the property world.
The couple have sold their waterfront Rose Bay apartment for a figure around the $18 million guide, local sources have revealed, more than doubling their money. Records show the pair bought the three-bedroom, three-bathroom unit off the plan for $7.85 million in 2016.
A European holiday in 1998 inspired then-26-year-old sneaker fanatics Danny and Cindy to open their first store in Sydney upon their return, which they did in Mosman.
The same year they purchased the unit, Hype DC was bought for about $105 million by RCG Corporation. The deal was 15 months after RCG Corporation acquired shoe retailer and apparel group Accent Group Ltd for around $200 million.
Accent Group also owns Platypus, Skechers, Stylerunner and Glue. The ASX-listed company has a market capitalisation of $544 million. Danny and Cindy resigned in 2017.
A sold sticker on the listing indicated a sale by private treaty on February 6, with the sale price undisclosed. Michael Pallier of Sydney Sotheby’s International Realty held the listing and declined to comment on any aspect of the sale. The exact sale price and buyer’s identity will be revealed at settlement.
The top-floor pad in a block of three occupies 254 square metres and offers 180-degree views to the Harbour Bridge, city skyline, North Sydney and Mosman.
There are oak floors, expansive glass, a marble kitchen, designer lighting and remote-control curtains. Leisure and entertainment options include an alfresco terrace, bar and butler’s pantry with icemaker and cool room.
The abode is in the same triplex as Dancing with the Stars’ Kym Johnson and her husband, Robert Herjavec, of Shark Tank fame, who are also selling their apartment with a price guide of $19 million. They paid $13.5 million in 2021 for the three-bed unit.
The Gilberts also own a four-bedroom, three-bathroom house in Palm Beach, purchased for $10.05 million in cash in 2020 from hotelier Roslyn Short, records show.
They may wish to eventually knock down and rebuild the beach house with the interiors somewhat dated. The standout feature is the location, smack-bang on the beach.
There is a terrace with uninterrupted coastal views and a boat shed.
Byron Shire acreage for sale
The widow of horse breeder Paul Makin, Lyndall, is downsizing from their acreage in Talofa after “10 wonderful years” to be closer to family. She has listed the Byron Shire property with a price guide of $18 million-plus.
Records show the Makins purchased the five-bedroom, four-bathroom house on just over 14 hectares for $4,025,000 in 2016 from Richard Korhammer.
Paul died aged 82 in 2019. He went from selling newspapers at The Doncaster Hotel opposite Royal Randwick Racecourse to being a successful horse player and breeder.
His stallion Starcraft was outstanding, winning multiple prestigious horse races including the 2004 Australian Derby.
The estate in Talofa, about 12 minutes from the heart of Byron Bay, is a lodge-style home consisting of four pods that are connected by walkways.
High ceilings, floorboards, stone walls, expansive glass, timber detail and pendant lighting adorn the interiors. There is a media room, 25-metre lap pool, spa, poolside lounge, tennis court and barn with electric sliding doors.
Prestige extras include private creek frontage and a swimming hole with a waterfall.
Will Phillips and Elisma Iesu of Sotheby’s International Realty Byron Bay are accepting expressions of interest.
Fashion whiz lists home
Selena Mazuran saw a niche in the fashion industry back in 1994, founding FBI Fashion College in Sydney, and now years on, she looks set to cash in on property.
The businesswoman has put her Dover Heights home on the market with a price guide of $14 million. She purchased the six-bedroom, five-bathroom abode for $3.2 million in 2012.
Mazuran worked her way up the managerial levels at David Jones before founding the college specialising in global fashion business and fashion design courses. She told Marie Claire Australia in 2017: “In 1994, no one was teaching fashion business subjects like styling, buying, marketing and PR.”
The property consists of a three-level residence with an attic and a separate two-bedroom residence. There is a pool, private courtyard and entertainment zones with Harbour Bridge and city skyline views.
Design details include Italian terrazzo tiling, custom woodwork in the kitchen, library and on door frames, and there’s a restaurant-grade cooker and rangehood in the kitchen.
DA approval is in place for a new freestanding two-storey property.
An auction has been scheduled for February 25, and Steven Zoellner of Laing+Simmons Double Bay is the listing agent.

Israel makes history but no major wins in first week at 2026 Winter Olympics
Skeleton’s Jared Firestone ends Olympic run in 22nd place, as country’s first-ever cross-country skier crosses the finish line second to last at Milano Cortina Games
Amy Spiro is a reporter and writer with The Times of Israel
A week into the 2026 Winter Olympics, and Israel has made history at the Milano Cortina Games just by showing up, though it has yet to mark any major athletic achievements.
On Friday evening, Israel’s Jared Firestone completed his 4th heat in skeleton in 22nd place out of the 24 competitors, ending his Olympic run.
“I just wrapped up my competition last night, it was a storybook ending,” Firestone said in a video message to fans. “It was a dream come true and I couldn’t have done it without you, without everybody in Israel.”
Firestone, 35, told The Times of Israel in an interview last month that his final Olympic run will be his last slide, after chasing the Olympic dream for close to a decade: “I’m excited for civilian life.”
He is the second-ever skeleton athlete to compete for Israel at the Olympics, after AJ Edelman — who is leading this year’s Olympic bobsleigh team — became the first at the 2018 Games.
Also on Friday, Israel’s Attila Mihaly Kertesz just managed to accomplish his goal of not finishing last in the men’s 10km cross-country freestyle ski race.
Kertesz crossed the finish line second to last, officially taking 110th place out of 113 athletes with a time of 31:24:4, after two skiers did not finish the race: “I’m absolutely exhausted,” he said in a video message after the race. “Thank you everybody for supporting me.”
Kertesz, a native of Hungary who lives in Thailand, became an Israeli citizen in 2024 after several years of trying, and made history as Israel’s first-ever Olympic cross-country skier, to “give back to my nation.”
In an interview with The Times of Israel in December, Kertesz noted the likelihood that he would finish at the end of the pack: “Everybody is preparing very hard, because nobody wants to be the last in the Olympic Games – but somebody has to,” he said at the time.
On Saturday, Israeli skier Barnabas Szollos finished 41st overall out of 81 skiers following two runs in the giant slalom, after an injury a day earlier.
“Today was a very tough day,” said Szollos in a video message on Saturday. “Yesterday, after the training, I was brought home in an ambulance — had a bit of an accident. This morning, I was not sure if I could even do the race today, but I was not willing to give up; I was not willing to disappoint anyone.”
Saturday’s event was the third so far at the Games for Szollos, who finished 33rd in the super-G race on Wednesday, and last Saturday completed the downhill in 30th place. He has one event left to go at the Olympics — the slalom on Monday.
On Sunday, his sister, Noa Szollos, will compete in her first event — the women’s giant slalom, and on Wednesday she’ll ski in the slalom.
Also up this coming week: the bobsleigh’s two-man team will compete on Monday and Tuesday; figure skater Mariia Seniuk will take to the ice Tuesday for the short program, aiming for a spot in Thursday’s free skate; and the four-man bobsleigh team will slide on Saturday and next Sunday.

Ukrainian skeleton racer Heraskevych posts photo of IOC president receiving award from Zimbabwean dictator
Ukrainian skeleton racer Vladyslav Heraskevych has criticised a statement by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) regarding the political importance of the state award he was given by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy the day before.
Source: Vladyslav Heraskevych on Instagram
Details: Heraskevych posted a picture of IOC President Kirsty Coventry receiving an award from former Zimbabwean dictator Robert Mugabe.
Quote: "The IOC directly mentions the fact that I received a state award from Ukrainian President Zelenskyy as an alleged political component of my desire to wear a helmet of remembrance.
Will Kirsty Coventry be disqualified for her political medal-winning performance as an athlete at the Olympic Games because she was rewarded for it by the dictator Mugabe?"
Details: Kirsty Coventry was a swimmer who formerly represented Zimbabwe and won 7 Olympic medals: 2 gold, 4 silver, and 1 bronze.
Background:
- Vladyslav Heraskevych was disqualified from the 2026 Olympics for wearing a helmet of remembrance during several official training sessions. The helmet features images of 20 Ukrainian athletes killed due to Russian aggression. Heraskevych was barred from taking part in the competition.
- The Ukrainian athlete appealed the suspension. On 12 February, the day before the verdict was announced, he met with IOC President Kirsty Coventry, but they were unable to reach an agreement. The IOC later restored his accreditation, but Heraskevych was still not allowed to compete.
- On 12 February, Heraskevych received the Order of Freedom from President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

Russian-controlled Luhansk region claims 19 injured in Ukrainian drone strike on village
3 in serious condition after alleged attack on Tsentralny, eastern Ukraine; Kyiv has not commented
ISTANBUL
Authorities in Ukraine’s Russian-controlled Luhansk region said 19 civilians were injured in a Ukrainian drone strike on the village of Tsentralny, while Kyiv has not commented on the claim.
Regional Health Minister Natalya Pashchenko said on Telegram that drones struck the village in the Perevalsk district of eastern Ukraine over the weekend.
She said all of the injured were locals who were either near the impact site or inside their homes at the time.
Three people are in serious condition and six are in moderate condition, while the others were treated as outpatients, she added.
Earlier, regional head Leonid Pasechnik said 15 civilians had been injured in what he described as a massive Ukrainian drone strike. He also claimed that dozens of residential and social facilities were damaged.
Claims in the conflict are difficult to confirm due to the conditions of the war, which is set this month to reach the four-year mark.
There was no immediate comment from Ukrainian authorities.

Netanyahu pushes to water down terrorist death penalty bill over fear of global fallout

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has asked National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir to soften a proposed bill mandating the death penalty for terrorists, citing concerns over potential international fallout, officials familiar with the matter told ynet on Saturday.
Netanyahu’s aides approached Ben-Gvir, who opposes changes to the legislation, arguing that Israel cannot enact a death penalty law harsher than the standard applied in the United States. Sources said the prime minister and coalition leaders would not allow the bill to pass in its current form.
In an unusual move, the Prime Minister’s Office also contacted a lawmaker from Netanyahu’s Likud party, who in turn asked Likud lawmaker Eli Dallal to submit a reservation against the version being advanced in committee by lawmaker Limor Son Har-Melech of Ben-Gvir’s Otzma Yehudit party.
The National Security Council, the Shin Bet internal security agency and the Foreign Ministry have also raised objections, officials said. About 1,000 reservations have been filed against the bill, most by opposition lawmakers. During one committee discussion, the Knesset’s legal adviser warned that the current draft may face constitutional barriers due to legal concerns.
According to the amendment submitted by Dallal at Netanyahu’s request, one key change would eliminate a mandatory death sentence for terrorists from the West Bank without judicial discretion. Under the revised language, judges would be able to choose between imposing the death penalty or life imprisonment.
Another proposed change would grant defendants the right to appeal a death sentence based on Israel’s obligations under international law. In Ben-Gvir’s draft, there is no right to appeal the sentence itself, only the conviction.
Netanyahu is also pressing to remove a clause that would make the death penalty a maximum — but not mandatory — sentence only in cases of murder committed in an act of terrorism by an Israeli citizen or resident. He is seeking its deletion to avoid distinctions based on the nationality of victims and potential discrimination in cases of Jewish terrorism against Palestinians, such as the case of Ami Popper, who was convicted of murdering seven Palestinian laborers who were not Israeli citizens or residents.
The Security Cabinet has discussed the bill, which remains in committee ahead of its second and third readings.
Before the return of all living hostages from Gaza, captives and missing persons coordinator Gal Hirsch warned the Cabinet that advancing the legislation could endanger the hostages. After their return, he said Netanyahu had changed his position and that the concern had been lifted. Still, Hirsch said the prime minister continued to seek reservations to the bill and asked that security assessments by his office and other agencies be made available to judges in exceptional cases involving the death penalty.
Opposition lawmaker Gilad Kariv of The Democrats party, who has led efforts against the bill, said: “We have argued all along that Ben-Gvir’s proposal does not align with the positions of the security agencies, the Ministerial Committee for Legislation or international law. The prime minister’s request proves that. Given Ben-Gvir’s insistence, the coalition should oppose the bill.”
Officials in Netanyahu’s circle confirmed the details. Ben-Gvir’s office did not respond to a request for comment.

What the Canada school shooting suspect’s online history reveals
- Jesse Van Rootselaar, 18, killed nine people, including her mother, stepbrother, five schoolchildren and an education assistant, in Tumbler Ridge, British Columbia, before dying from a self-inflicted injury; 27 others were injured.
- Van Rootselaar maintained an extensive online presence, including accounts on forums like WatchPeopleDie, where she shared and consumed content glorifying mass violence and gore and created a Roblox game simulating a mall shooting.
- Her digital footprint also revealed struggles with mental health, including depression and an autism diagnosis, and discussions about suicidal thoughts and her gender transition, for which she was awaiting hormonal treatment.
- Police confirmed Van Rootselaar was transgender and used she/her pronouns, a detail that became a focus on social media, despite data showing transgender individuals are rarely perpetrators of mass shootings and are more often victims of violence.
- Experts and law enforcement are increasingly concerned about online radicalization leading to “Nihilistic Violent Extremism,” a trend that glorifies violence and its perpetrators, which Van Rootselaar's online activity appears to reflect.

Zelensky: US proposes 15-year security guarantees, but Ukraine needs more than 20
He made the remarks during a briefing in Munich on Saturday, Ukrinform reports.
"Today we met with senators. We very much want to extend the duration of security guarantees so that they are more effective for investors. We just had a meeting with investors and business representatives, and they need guarantees that last longer than five or ten years. Today, we have a proposal from the United States for 15 years. We want 20 or more years – 30, 50," Zelensky said.
He noted that the final decision regarding the duration of the security guarantees will depend on the U.S. leadership and Congress.
Zelensky met with U.S. senators in Munich earlier in the day. Among other issues, the sides discussed work on security guarantees for Ukraine.

Son of Iran's last shah urges US action as 200,000 supporters rally in Munich

The exiled son of Iran's last shah said he was ready to lead the country to a "secular democratic future" at a rally in Munich on Saturday, February 14, after US President Donald Trump said a change of power would be the "best thing." It came as Washington continued to engage diplomatically with Tehran's government, with Switzerland on Saturday confirming that mediator Oman would host a fresh round of talks in Geneva next week.
US-based Reza Pahlavi, who has not returned to Iran since before the 1979 Islamic revolution that ousted the monarchy, told the crowd of around 200,000 people of his supporters that he could lead a transition.
"I am here to guarantee a transition to a secular democratic future," he said. "I am committed to be the leader of transition for you so we can one day have the final opportunity to decide the fate of our country through a democratic, transparent process to the ballot box."
"Javid shah (long live the shah)," the crowd chanted as they waved green-white-and-red flags with a lion and a sun – the emblem of the toppled monarchy.
Pahlavi has urged Iranians at home and abroad to continue demonstrations against the authorities, calling on them to chant slogans from their homes and rooftops at 8:00 pm (1630 GMT) Saturday and Sunday, to coincide with protests in Germany and elsewhere.
Trump had said on Friday that a change of government in Iran would be the "best thing that could happen," as he sent a second aircraft carrier to the Middle East to ratchet up military pressure on Tehran.
He had earlier threatened military intervention to support a wave of street protests in Iran that peaked in January and were met by a violent crackdown that rights groups say killed thousands.
"To President Trump... The Iranian people heard you say help is on the way, and they have faith in you. Help them," Pahlavi had earlier told reporters gathered at the Munich Security Conference. "It is time to end the Islamic republic," he said.
Iranian opposition divided
When Iran began its crackdown on protests, Trump initially said the United States was "locked and loaded" to help demonstrators. But he has recently focused his military threats on Tehran's nuclear program, which US forces struck last July during Israel's unprecedented 12-day war with Iran.
Representatives of Iran and the US, who have had no diplomatic relations since shortly after the 1979 revolution, held talks on the nuclear program last week in Oman. On Sunday, a Swiss foreign ministry spokesman told AFP that Oman would host a new round of talks in Geneva next week, without providing further details.
Videos verified by AFP showed people in Iran this week chanting anti-government slogans despite the ongoing crackdown, as the clerical leadership celebrated the anniversary of the Islamic revolution.
According to US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency, at least 7,008 people, mostly protesters, were killed in the crackdown, though they and other rights groups warn the toll is likely far higher. More than 53,000 people have been arrested, it added.
Pahlavi had encouraged Iranians to join the wave of protests, which Iranian authorities have said were hijacked by "terrorists" fueled by their sworn enemies, the US and Israel.
Many protest chants had called for the monarchy's return, and Pahlavi, 65, has said he is ready to lead a democratic transition.
The Iranian opposition remains divided and Pahlavi has faced criticism for his support for Israel, making a highly publicized visit in 2023 that fractured an attempt to unify opposition camps. He has also never distanced himself from his father's autocratic rule.
Trump declined on Friday to say who he would want to take over in Iran from Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, but he added that "there are people."

Fresh sabotage disrupts Italy’s high-speed rail services
Deputy premier calls incidents ‘criminal acts’ as investigation begins
LONDON
Following three attempts to disrupt railways earlier this month, suspected sabotage disrupted Italy’s high-speed rail network Saturday, causing hours-long delays, with Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini condemning the incidents as “criminal acts.”
The Rome-Naples and Rome-Florence high-speed lines were affected by what authorities described as new sabotage attempts, as the Winter Olympics Games are underway in Italy.
Police confirmed that a manhole had been tampered with in Rome’s Salaria district, resulting in burnt cables, the Italian news agency ANSA reported. Authorities have opened an investigation.
In a separate incident in Capena, a technical fault was reported. Another incident occurred on Via di Salone, on the outskirts of Rome.
Salvini, who also serves as transport minister, denounced the disruptions.
“Surveillance has been increased and we have stepped up inspections to root out these criminals, hoping that no one downplays or justifies criminal acts that put people’s lives at risk,” Salvini wrote on the US-based social media platform X.
Earlier this week, an anarchist group claimed responsibility for the three attempted acts of sabotage targeting railway lines in Italy on Feb. 7, the same day the first competitions of the Milano-Cortina Winter Olympics were held.

PA minister warns of 'existential threat' as Israel blocks funds

Palestinian finance minister warns of 'existential threat' as Israel withholds tax revenues
Palestinian Finance Minister Estephan Salameh warned on Saturday that 2026 will be the most financially difficult year in more than three decades, accusing Israel of seeking to “destroy” the Palestinian Authority (PA) by imposing a "financial siege".
Speaking to the official Voice of Palestine radio, Salameh said the Israeli government had taken a decision to undermine the PA by withholding key revenues.
"The Israeli government has taken its decision to destroy the Authority through a financial siege," he said, adding: "This year will, in my estimation, be the most financially difficult since the establishment of the Palestinian National Authority."
The PA was established in 1994 under the Oslo Accords signed between the Palestine Liberation Organization and Israel in 1993.
Salameh described the Israeli economic pressure as an "existential threat" aimed at weakening the Palestinian national project and preventing the realisation of a Palestinian state.
He said Israel has not transferred Palestinian clearance tax revenues for 10 months “with the aim of exhausting the PA's ability to provide basic services to citizens”.
According to the minister, the Palestinian government’s public debt has exceeded $15.4 billion, a figure he described as "very large compared to the size of the local economy".
Arabi21 reported that the government has been forced to resort to borrowing from banks as an emergency measure to manage the shortfall.
The PA has faced recurring financial crises since 2019 due to Israeli deductions from clearance revenues. The crisis intensified in 2025, which Palestinian officials described as the most difficult year, with accumulated deficits and unpaid dues reaching $4.26 billion, according to Palestinian data.
Clearance revenues are taxes collected by Israel on goods imported into Palestinian areas on behalf of the PA. However, Israel has frequently withheld or deducted portions of these funds, using them as leverage in political disputes.
Following the start of Israel’s war on Gaza on 7 October 2023, Tel Aviv began transferring only about 30 percent of clearance revenues, after deducting funds allocated by the Palestinian government to salaries and social services in Gaza.
Israeli ministers have also escalated rhetoric against the PA. Far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir has described it as "terrorist" and called for its removal.
The financial strain comes as violence in the occupied West Bank has intensified.
Since the start of the Gaza war, at least 1,112 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank, around 11,500 injured and approximately 22,000 arrested, according to official figures.
Palestinian officials warn that without the restoration of clearance revenues, the PA's ability to function and provide basic services could deteriorate further in the coming year.

Zelensky, Rubio discuss air defense for Ukraine, possibility of leader-level peace talks
Editor's Note: This is a developing story and is being updated.
President Volodymyr Zelensky spoke with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference on Feb. 14, Presidential Office Spokesperson Serhii Nykyforov told the media.
The discussion focused on the situation on the battlefield, Russian attacks, and the damage caused to Ukraine's energy infrastructure. Part of the discussion included ways to support Ukraine with additional air defense missiles during the winter, according to the Presidential Office.
Rubio and Zelensky also discussed the next round of trilateral peace talks among the U.S., Ukraine, and Russia, set to take place in Geneva on Feb. 17–18.
"It's important that the planned negotiations in Geneva be productive, and I thank the United States for its constructive approach," Zelensky said after the meeting. "We also touched on the sequence of steps. It's important to make progress on issues of security guarantees and economic recovery."
The peace negotiations will eventually require a top-level meeting with the leaders of Ukraine, the U.S., and Russia, the Presidential Office said in a statement published after the talks.
"Ukraine believes that a meeting at the leadership level should ultimately be held to resolve the most problematic issues," the statement said.
Zelensky met with Rubio following his conference speech earlier in the day. Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha and Secretary of the National Security and Defense Council Rustem Umerov joined him in the talks.
Following the meeting, Zelensky also held a phone call with Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, U.S. President Donald Trump's envoys representing Washington in the ongoing negotiations. They discussed the upcoming talks, the recent rounds of negotiations in Abu Dhabi, and the meeting with Rubio.
"Not everything can be disclosed over the phone, and our negotiating team will present Ukraine's position next week," Zelensky said after the call on Feb. 14. He thanked the U.S. team for their "constructive attitude."
Both Zelensky and Rubio addressed the conference in separate speeches on Feb. 14. Zelensky stressed Ukraine's commitment to the ongoing peace negotiations among Kyiv, Moscow, and Washington, but said territorial concessions to Russia would not lead to peace.
Rubio also acknowledged that the question of control over Ukraine's eastern Donbas region has not been resolved in the current negotiations.
In a briefing after his speech, Zelensky told journalists that the U.S. had offered Ukraine a 15-year security guarantee, but that Kyiv was looking for a longer-term pledge.
"Today we have a proposal from the American side for 15 years," he said at a briefing. We want to have 20 years plus. Thirty, 50 ... We'll see what the administration and Congress will do."
The day before Zelensky's meeting with Rubio, Trump said that Zelensky needs to "get moving" to secure a peace deal with Russia.
"Russia wants to make a deal and Zelensky is going to have to get moving, otherwise he's going to miss a great opportunity," Trump claimed. "He has to move."
When asked about Trump's comments, Zelensky acknowledged on Feb. 14 that the U.S. president may be "preparing (the) atmosphere" ahead of the upcoming peace talks in Switzerland.
"Not losing our dignity, we can move," Zelensky said.

Two Palestinian Jerusalem families forced to demolish own homes

Two Palestinian Jerusalem families forced to demolish their homes amid West bank attacks
Two residents of Jerusalem have been forced to demolish their own homes following Israeli orders, amid continuing raids and settler attacks in the occupied West Bank.
Rami al-Bakri, a resident of Beit Hanina north of occupied Jerusalem, had received a demolition order for his 35 square metre-home on al-Zaytouna Street two weeks prior from Israeli authorities.
To avoid paying a hefty fine if the municipality were to carry out the demolition, al-Bakri was forced to carry out the process himself to destroy the home in which he and his wife lived for eight years.
Al-Bakri had previously paid fines estimated at about 40,000 shekels (US$13,000) to cover additional costs in addition to lawyers’ fees and payments for licensing procedures.
Another resident of the Jerusalem Governorate, Samer Alyan Arar, was likewise required to dismantle his house in Jabal al-Mukabber, southeast of Jerusalem.
On 26 January, Israeli soldiers raided his home and gave him three weeks to implement the demolition order or face a penalty for the municipality’s own work to destroy the house.
Israel claimed the building had been built without a permit despite the house existing since 2018 and housing seven people over an area of 80 square metres.
Arar already faced two penalties issued by Israeli authorities in 2014 when he had submitted planning maps for construction at the request of the municipality. He now faces an additional fine worth about 100,000 shekels (US$32,350).
Israel often claims that its demolition orders are due to a lack of building permits but human rights groups say that these are nearly impossible for Palestinians to obtain.
West Bank incursions continuing
The two demolitions coincided with raids by Israeli forces across the occupied West Bank, resulting in multiple injuries, arrests, and damage to property.
At dawn on Saturday, Israeli forces stormed Balata east of Nablus and deployed multiple soldiers to several of the refugee camp’s neighbourhoods, local sources told The New Arab’s sister site Al-Araby Al-Jadeed.
Multiple families were forced to evacuate their homes, according to the residents. Israeli forces also caused an explosion at the local headquarters of the Fatah movement.
Israeli forces also raided multiple locations in the Nablus and Bethlehem Governorates overnight, including the Dheisheh refugee camp, detaining dozens of Palestinians.
A young man was shot and sustained injuries in his thigh after confrontations broke out between residents and Israeli soldiers in the town of Tuqu’, southeast of Bethlehem, on Friday night.
Separately, the Palestinian Red Crescent said a 59-year-old man was hospitalized after being shot in the foot with live ammunition near the so-called separation wall in Dar Salah, east of Bethlehem.
Settler attacks also continued overnight, with a group of Israelis piercing the tires of more than 10 trucks and vehicles belonging to Palestinians in the town of Sur Baher, southeast of Jerusalem.
Multiple acres of Palestinian land were fenced off by Israeli settlers northeast of Ramallah at dawn on Saturday, under the protection of Israeli soldiers.
Settlers also destroyed olive trees in the southern area of al-Mughayyir on Friday evening.
Three residents from the Dabbabseh family in Khirbet Khallat al-Dab, in the Masafer Yatta area, had to receive medical treatment after being assaulted by settlers, according to al-Baidar Human Rights Organisation.
Following the incident, Israeli soldiers stormed homes of neighbouring Khirbet al-Halawah.

LA Olympics leader Wasserman will sell talent agency in wake of Epstein emails discovery
Casey Wasserman, the chairman of the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics organizing committee, is selling his eponymous talent agency in the wake of the release of emails between himself and Ghislaine Maxwell
- Bookmark
Casey Wasserman, the chairman of the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics organizing committee, is selling his eponymous talent agency in the wake of the release of emails between himself and Ghislaine Maxwell.
Wasserman's emails with Maxwell were revealed by his appearance in recently released government files on Jeffrey Epstein. Wasserman, whose agency represents some of the top pop music artists in the world, has not been accused of any wrongdoing.
The recently released documents revealed that in 2003 he swapped flirtatious emails with Maxwell, who would years later be accused of helping Epstein recruit and sexually abuse his victims. Wasserman said in a Friday evening memo to his staff that he has begun the process of selling the company, according to a company spokesperson who provided the memo to The Associated Press.
Wasserman's memo to staff said that he felt he had become a distraction to the company's work.
“During this time, Mike Watts will assume day-to-day control of the business while I devote my full attention to delivering Los Angeles an Olympic Games in 2028 that is worthy of this outstanding city,” the memo stated.
The memo arrived days after the LA28 board's executive committee met to discuss Wasserman's appearance in the Epstein files. The committee said it and an outside legal firm conducted a review of Wasserman's interactions with Epstein and Maxwell with Wasserman's full cooperation.
The committee said in a statement: “We found Mr. Wasserman’s relationship with Epstein and Maxwell did not go beyond what has already been publicly documented.” The statement also said Wasserman “should continue to lead LA28 and deliver a safe and successful games.”
Wasserman has said previously that he flew on a humanitarian mission to Africa on Epstein’s private plane at the invitation of the Clinton Foundation in 2002. Exchanges between Wasserman and Maxwell in the files include Wasserman telling Maxwell: “I think of you all the time. So, what do I have to do to see you in a tight leather outfit?”
His agency, also called Wasserman, has lost clients over the Maxwell emails. Singer Chappell Roan and retired U.S. women's soccer legend Abby Wambach are among them.
Wasserman said in his memo to staff that his interactions with Maxwell and Epstein were limited and he regrets the emails.
“It was years before their criminal conduct came to light, and, in its entirety, consisted of one humanitarian trip to Africa and a handful of emails that I deeply regret sending. And I’m heartbroken that my brief contact with them 23 years ago has caused you, this company, and its clients so much hardship over the past days and weeks,” the memo said.

- US Ambassador Whitaker stated China enables Russia's Ukraine war, providing critical parts and buying oil. He believes China could end the conflict. Beijing denies these "baseless criticisms."
- US Democratic leaders at the Munich conference reassured European allies of the US commitment to transatlantic alliances, despite President Trump's past actions.

MUNICH, Germany – China is providing crucial support for Russia’s aggression in Ukraine and could end the war with a phone call, US Ambassador to NATO Matthew Whitaker said.
“China could call Vladimir Putin and end this war tomorrow and cut off his dual-purpose technologies that they’re selling,” Mr Whitaker said, during a late Feb 13 panel at the Munich Security Conference.
“China could stop buying Russian oil and gas.”
“You know, this war is being completely enabled by China,” the US envoy added, during a panel on US foreign policy moderated by Bloomberg’s Francine Lacqua.
China and Russia have forged an even tighter partnership since the start of the war, and Russia relies on China for critical parts and components for drones and other war material. China is also once again the biggest buyer of Russia’s crude oil shipments even as international pressure intensifies on Moscow’s critical oil trade.
Tracking data show 1.65 million barrels a day of crude offloaded at Chinese ports in January. That is the most since March 2024 and the second-highest monthly total since Moscow’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine.
China’s Foreign Ministry in a statement on Feb 14 dismissed allegations regarding its support for the war as an “entirely baseless criticism.”
Beijing has repeatedly said it wants to have a “constructive” role in ending the crisis. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi met with his Ukrainian counterpart, Andrii Sybiha, in Munich this week and offered humanitarian aid to the country
The Munich conference, which runs from Feb 13 to 15, attracts global policy leaders to discuss foreign relations and international security. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and French President Emmanuel Macron are among the dignitaries assembled.
Mr Whitaker was joined on the Munich Security Conference panel by two potential 2028 Democratic presidential contenders: Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a New York Democrat, and Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer.
Other prominent Democratic political figures, including California Governor Gavin Newsom, travelled to the conference, seeking to reassure European allies of US commitment to the transatlantic alliance as President Donald Trump threatens to uproot relationships across the globe.
“The Democratic Party is here for our allies,” Ms Ocasio-Cortez said. “The vast majority of the American people do not want to see these relationships frayed, and they are committed to our allies.”
Ms Whitmer said strains between the US and European allies, including trade tensions and Mr Trump’s pressure campaign to obtain Greenland
“It will take time to rebuild but I’m confident that we’ll do that,” the Michigan governor said.
Mr Whitaker, who Mr Trump appointed as his envoy to NATO, said the alliance is “stronger than ever” because of the US president’s pressure on allies to ramp up military spending.
“The United States of America keeps showing up, and we will keep showing up. We just expect our allies to be equally as strong,” Mr Whitaker said. BLOOMBERG

150,000 Afghans have returned from Pakistan, Iran this year: UN
Nearly 150,000 Afghans have returned from Pakistan and Iran this year, with the speed and size of the migration pushing Afghanistan deeper into crisis, the UN refugee agency said Friday.
After decades hosting Afghans fleeing crises at home, Pakistan and Iran have ramped up deportations and forced millions back across the border to a country struggling to provide for them.
"So far this year, nearly 150,000 Afghans have returned from Iran and Pakistan", Arafat Jamal, the UNHCR representative to Afghanistan, told a press briefing in Geneva.
"The high number of returns already this year is concerning given the severity of winter, with freezing temperatures and heavy snowfall", he said, speaking from Kabul.
"These arrivals come on top of already unprecedented returns - 2.9 million people in 2025, bringing the total to some 5.4 million since October 2023".
Jamal said they were returning, or being forced to return, in extremely difficult circumstances.
Whether arriving at the frontier surrounded by family or alone, Afghan returnees must establish a new life in a nation beset by poverty and environmental woes.
"The speed and scale of these returns have pushed Afghanistan deeper into crisis, as the country continues to face a deteriorating humanitarian and human rights situation - particularly for women and girls - a fragile economy, and recurring natural disasters", said Jamal.
UNHCR spokesman Babar Baloch told AFP the number of returns was up more than 50 percent on this time last year, when just under 100,000 had returned.
Jamal said that, according to a UNHCR survey of returnees, many families said that members lacked civil documentation, and more than 90 percent were living on less than $5 a day.
And he voiced deep concern over the sustainability of returns, saying some were already leaving Afghanistan again.
"These decisions are not driven by a desire to leave, but by the reality that many are unable to rebuild a viable and dignified life", he said.
UNHCR is focusing its efforts on supporting reintegration of returnees.
The agency said it needed $216 million this year to support displaced people and returnees across the country, but its appeal was currently just eight percent funded.
"This is a critical moment to act while there is an opportunity to find long-term solutions and resolve displacement for Afghan returnees in their homeland, often after years or decades in exile", said Jamal.

Anti-Hamas militia says it is destroying terror group’s tunnels in Gaza
Popular Forces leader al-Duhaini says militia ‘dismantling’ Hamas tunnels, confirms increasing Israeli support; troops kill Palestinian who crossed Gaza’s Yellow Line, IDF says
Emanuel (Mannie) Fabian is The Times of Israel's military correspondent
The leader of an anti-Hamas militia based in IDF-controlled areas of the southern Gaza Strip said recently that it is working on demolishing the terror group’s tunnels, a confirmation that further shows Israel’s support for the armed gang.
“We have gradually begun dismantling the tunnels, as they are the most important weapons. Then the weapons production facilities, then the rockets, and finally the light weapons,” said Ghassan al-Duhaini, the leader of the Popular Forces.
“In the future, not a single illegal weapon will enter Rafah, and smuggling operations will be dealt with in full force,” Duhaini said in a Facebook post on Thursday.
Alongside the post, he published an image showing members of the Popular Forces outside an entrance to a tunnel while wearing oxygen masks.
The Popular Forces was founded by an anti-Hamas armed Bedouin leader, Yasser Abu Shabab. Abu Shabab was killed in December in what the group described as a family feud. He was replaced by his deputy, Duhaini, who vowed no let-up in the fight against Hamas.
Israel has previously acknowledged its support for militias fighting Hamas in the enclave. It has provided them with weapons, air support, intelligence, food, and cigarettes, as well as airlifted wounded militia members into Israel for medical care.
The militia controls an area between the Rafah Border Crossing between Gaza and Egypt and an Israel Defense Forces checkpoint screening Palestinians returning to the Strip. There have been reports of harsh treatment by members of the Popular Forces against Palestinians returning to Gaza, before the militia members handed them over to the IDF.
Last month, the militia captured a prominent Hamas commander in the Rafah area after he fled a tunnel, and later handed him over to the Israeli military. According to the IDF, the Hamas commander was among eight terror operatives who emerged from a tunnel overnight and were targeted in airstrikes, and added that he was a “key commander” in Hamas’s East Rafah Battalion.
On Monday, the spokesman for Hamas’s armed al-Qassam Brigades, Abu Obeida, issued a threat to the Popular Forces and other Israeli-backed Palestinian militias in Gaza, saying: “A dark fate is coming soon.”
“Their ending will be death and annihilation, and the enemy will not protect them from the justice of our people,” said Abu Obeida.
The threat appeared to come in response to a statement by Popular Forces leader Duhaini on Monday mocking the death of the scion of a prominent Hamas family.
Troops kill Gazan who crossed Yellow Line, IDF says
Elsewhere in the Strip, the IDF said that a Palestinian who crossed the ceasefire line in northern Gaza earlier Saturday was killed by troops.
According to the military, the terror operative crossed the Yellow Line and approached soldiers of the Gaza Division’s Northern Brigade “in a manner that posed an immediate threat.”
“Immediately after identification, the forces eliminated the terrorist in order to remove the threat,” the IDF said.
Since the start of the ceasefire in October, the IDF has said it has killed dozens of terror operatives and other “suspects” who have crossed the Yellow Line — demarcating the military’s withdrawal in the Strip — and approached troops. Such incidents have taken place on a near-daily basis.
Times of Israel staff contributed to this report.

Israeli FM Saar to attend Trump’s first Board of Peace meeting on Thursday, officials say
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
Feb 14 - Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar will attend U.S. President Donald Trump's first formal Board of Peace meeting on February 19, two Israeli officials said on Saturday.
U.S. officials told Reuters this week that Trump will announce a multi-billion dollar reconstruction plan for Gaza and detail plans for a U.N.-authorized stabilization force for the Palestinian enclave at the meeting in Washington.
Delegations from at least 20 countries, including heads of state, are expected to attend the meeting of the board whose creation was endorsed by a United Nations Security Council resolution as part of Trump's plan to end the Gaza war.
While regional Middle East powers, including Turkey, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Qatar, as well as major emerging nations such as Indonesia, have joined the board, global powers and traditional Western U.S. allies have been more cautious.
The U.S. officials said the meeting will focus on Gaza, where two years of war have left much of the Palestinian enclave in ruins.
Israel and Palestinian militant group Hamas agreed to Trump's plan last year with a ceasefire taking effect in October. More than 590 Palestinians, many of them civilians, and four Israeli soldiers have been killed in rounds of violence that have erupted since.
Both sides have accused each other of violating the ceasefire, even as Trump's administration has pressed for progress to the next steps envisaged in the plan.
One of those is the deployment of the International Stabilization Force, as Israeli troops further withdraw and Hamas disarms.
The U.S. officials said Trump will announce that several countries plan to provide several thousand troops to the stabilization force that is expected to deploy in Gaza in the months ahead.
Hamas has so far rejected demands to lay down its weapons and Israel has said that if the group does not disarm peacefully, Israel will have to force it to do so. REUTERS

Libya's Haftar reshuffles southern forces after border clash
Libyan military commander Khalifa Haftar has moved to reorganise his military deployment in southern Libya following an armed challenge by tribes at a key border crossing and a helicopter crash.
Last week, Haftar issued a decision forming a new unit, the “18th Infantry Brigade”, consolidating several of his main southern militias, including the 176th, 634th, 672nd and 676th battalions, under one command structure.
Haftar's forces control most of eastern and southern Libya but do not operate under the authority of the Libyan government in Tripoli.
The brigade was granted "full public force in terms of personnel, vehicles, equipment, weapons, communications devices, military supplies, headquarters and financial allocations", according to the decision.
The move comes days after a tribal armed group calling itself the "Southern Liberation Operations Force", composed of Tebu fighters, seized control of the Tumm border crossing with Niger on 31 January. The confrontation left three members of Haftar’s forces dead and ten captured.
Haftar’s forces quickly regained control of the crossing. However, they did not announce the recovery of the captives. Reinforcements were later sent to the nearby town of al-Qatrun in an apparent effort to secure the border corridor and prevent further instability.
The border incident was preceded by the crash of a military helicopter at al-Sarra base in southeastern Libya on 9 February.
Libyan sources from Kufra told The New Arab's Arabic sister outlet Al-Araby Al-Jadeed that five people were killed, including two foreigners. Kufra’s municipal council mourned three victims, two members of the military medical evacuation unit and a nurse from Kufra hospital.
Belarusian outlet Nashaniva reported that the dead included a Russian pilot, his Belarusian assistant and three Libyans.
Haftar’s command has not issued an official explanation. The lack of comment has fuelled speculation over whether the crash was a technical failure or the result of deliberate targeting.
In parallel with the military reshuffle, local sources from al-Qatrun told Al-Araby Al-Jadeed that Haftar’s leadership had opened contacts with leaders of the Tebu tribes, whose presence spans the Libya-Niger border.
The aim, according to the sources, is to contain tensions and isolate the armed group responsible for the takeover of the Tumm crossing.
The discussions reportedly included the possibility of incorporating Tebu elements into Haftar-aligned forces to help secure crossings and corridors within what is known as the "Salvador Triangle" linking Algeria, Niger and Libya.
The emergence of Haftar’s son Khaled Haftar as a player in the south forms part of what sources have described as a redistribution of roles within the leadership circle. Khaled has been granted broader authority to oversee military units as chief of staff, while his brother Saddam Haftar has focused more on external relations.
The decision to base the 18th Infantry Brigade in Murzuq, rather than Um al-Aranib, previously a central hub for southern deployments, signals a shift in the centre of command closer to al-Qatrun and the contested border belt.
The consolidation of militias coincided with the appointment of a new head of the Murzuq Security Directorate. This suggests a recalibration from a purely military posture toward a security-focused approach that also seeks to manage relations with local tribes and stabilise the border region.
Southern Libya remains strategically significant due to its oil fields, gold mines and proximity to Chad, Niger and Sudan.
The al-Sarra base, where the helicopter crash occurred, has gained increased importance because of its location overlooking Chad and Sudan, as well as the reported Russian military presence there since early last year.

Russia deliberately attacks Azerbaijan's diplomatic representation in Ukraine – Aliyev
Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev said during a panel at the Munich Security Conference, Ukrinform reports.
"There have been not only attacks on Azerbaijan's energy infrastructure in Ukraine, but also three times attacks on Azerbaijan's embassy in Ukraine. And after the first attack, we could imagine that that was accidental. And we gave our Russian colleagues all the coordinates of Azerbaijan's diplomatic representations, including the consular department, our cultural center and embassy. Despite all that, there have been two more attacks. So that was a deliberate attack on Azerbaijan's diplomatic representation," Aliyev said.
The Azerbaijani president noted that the issue of Russian attacks on Azerbaijan's energy infrastructure and diplomatic missions in Ukraine has been repeatedly raised in numerous contacts between officials at the level of foreign ministries and presidential administrations.
"And we issued special statements and also the ambassador was invited and a diplomatic note was submitted. We act only in a diplomatic way. We cannot do anything else… all the necessary diplomatic steps have been taken by the Azerbaijani government," he emphasized.
He stressed that such actions by Russia are considered unfriendly toward Azerbaijan.
As Ukrinform reported, in November last year, the Azerbaijani Ministry of Foreign Affairs summoned the Russian ambassador in Baku to deliver a protest note over a Russian strike that damaged the Republic's embassy in Kyiv. At that time, the strike damaged the embassy building, service vehicles, the administrative building, and the consular section.
Earlier, on March 10, 2022, an airstrike on the building of the Honorary Consulate of the Republic of Azerbaijan in Kharkiv caused severe damage to the administrative building, and a service vehicle was rendered unusable.

Iran, US spar as diaspora organises rallies abroad calling for action
Iranian families release footage online commemorating loved ones shot during nationwide antigovernment protests.
Tehran, Iran – Iran and the United States are presenting clashing views before expected talks as diaspora Iranians rally across the world to demand action after thousands were killed during last month’s nationwide protests.
Amid reports that a second round of mediated talks may take place over the coming days, Washington has maintained it wants to limit Iran’s missile programme and end all its nuclear enrichment.

Iran has consistently rejected both demands, saying it could dilute highly enriched uranium – all said to be buried under rubble after being bombed by the US in June – in exchange for the lifting of sanctions.
US President Donald Trump said at the White House on Friday that he is sending a second aircraft carrier to the Middle East, adding that “regime change” in Iran would be the “best thing that could happen”.
Speaking at a conference in Tehran on Saturday aimed at attracting regional investment for railroad projects, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian thanked the leaders of Azerbaijan, Turkiye, Qatar, Oman, Saudi Arabia and others for mediating to prevent a US military attack.
“All of these countries are working so that we can resolve our own problems with peace and calm, and we are able to do this. We do not need a custodian,” Pezeshkian said, warning that a war would impact the entire Middle East.
Switzerland’s Foreign Ministry said on Saturday that Iran and the US would hold the next round of talks in Geneva next week. Oman, which hosted the first round in Muscat last week, will mediate.
Major rallies in US, Europe
A large number of Iranians abroad who are opposed to the theocratic establishment governing Iran since a 1979 revolution participated in rallies across the world on Saturday to demand an end to religious rule.
Reza Pahlavi, son of Iran’s US-backed shah who was deposed in the revolution, called on Iranians living abroad to be part of a “global day of action” aimed at “taking Iran back” from the Islamic Republic. He also addressed the Munich Security Conference in Germany and met with leaders such as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and senior US Senator Lindsey Graham.
The three main cities designated for the protests were Munich, Los Angeles and Toronto. Iranians also marched in cities in Australia, including Sydney and Melbourne.
A similar rally last month in Toronto saw more than150,000 people in attendance and no adverse incidents, according to city police. About 100,000 people registered early to attend the Munich rally on Saturday.
The rallies are some of the largest ever held by the Iranian diaspora and the biggest since demonstrations in solidarity with the deadly 2022-2023 nationwide protests in Iran, triggered by the death in police custody of Mahsa Amini, 22, for allegedly wearing the mandatory hijab for women improperly.
The latest protests were held days after the Iranian establishment organised demonstrations and burned the flags of Israel and the US to mark the 47th anniversary of the 1979 revolution.
“They killed my innocent girl for a few strands of hair and nobody was held accountable, but now they record women with bare heads and so-called unconventional attire in their official ceremonies and nobody yells that Islam is in danger,” Amini’s father wrote in an Instagram story after state television interviewed a pro-establishment woman without a hijab.
Since the killing of thousands of protesters last month, mostly carried out on the nights of January 8-9, similar rallies have been held to raise awareness in dozens of cities across the globe, including The Hague, Zurich, Rome, Budapest and Tokyo.
The United Nations and international human rights organisations said they documented widespread use of lethal force by state forces against peaceful protesters. But the Iranian government rejected all their allegations, claiming “terrorists” and “rioters” armed and funded by the US and Israel were behind the killings across Iran.
Families united in grief, strength
From Kuhchenar county in southern Iran’s Fars province to central Arak and Mashhad in the northeast, families continue to release footage online to commemorate their loved ones killed during the demonstrations.
Behesht-e Zahra, a cemetery in Tehran, was crowded on Friday as people gathered in solidarity with multiple families holding mourning ceremonies to mark “chehelom”, or 40 days since the killing of their loved ones.
Bereaved relatives somberly clapped, played music and showed the “victory” sign in an attempt to express pride, strength and defiance despite their losses.
Among those remembered were Ayda Heydari, 21, a medical student, and Zahra “Raha” Behloulipour, who attended Tehran University. Both were shot and killed with multiple live rounds in separate incidents.
The state-run Mehr news agency reported Heydari was “a victim of Mossad agents in recent riots” and released a short clip of an interview with her family. Heydari’s mother said her daughter was not a “munafiq”, a term the Islamic Republic uses to describe dissidents.
Mohammad-Hossein Omid, head of Tehran University, last week told the semiofficial ISNA news agency that “most” of the people taking part in the nationwide demonstrations were “protesters not terrorists”.
Concerns for prisoners
The Iranian judiciary confirmed on Saturday that a number of senior reformist politicians arrested last week for criticising the establishment were released on bail while others remained behind bars to face previous charges.
Vahid Shalchi, a deputy science minister, cited judiciary officials as saying “a considerable” number of arrested students will be released soon but did not say how many are being held.
Tens of thousands of people have been arrested during and after the protests, and human rights organisations said some are in immediate danger of being executed – allegations the Iranian judiciary has rejected.
Amnesty International said 18-year-old wrestling champion Saleh Mohammadi has been sentenced to public execution in Qom after being forced to make confessions about being involved in the death of a security agent.
Mai Sato – UN special rapporteur on Iran, who previously said more than 20,000 civilians may have been killed during the demonstrations – said three other people face execution and “What is happening now is not new.”
“The same patterns documented in those individual cases are being replicated on a mass scale after the nationwide protests,” she said.
A specific casualty toll from the demonstrations is unknown as information remains extremely limited because of ongoing heavy internet filtering.

Epstein’s girlfriend married a woman, showing how he gamed immigration
The late sex offender used student visas, English language courses and sham marriages to keep foreign women in the US
In early 2013, Jeffrey Epstein’s girlfriend, Karyna Shuliak, was stressed about her US visa status. Later that year, she married an American citizen and her worries were gone.
A Green Card followed, and in 2018, citizenship. Then Shuliak divorced her spouse: a woman named Jennifer who had been in a relationship with Kimbal Musk – Elon Musk’s brother – after Epstein connected them.
“now that she’s an american you should throw her a big ole party,” one of Epstein’s go-to immigration lawyers messaged on the day of Shuliak’s naturalisation interview. “with a mechanical bull, red white and blue balloons, and deep fried snickers bars on flag toothpicks”.
Shuliak’s immigration story – and the stories of several other women revealed in a cache of files released by the US Department of Justice – show how Epstein used student visas, English language courses and sham marriages to make sure the women in his orbit stayed right where he wanted them.
The convicted paedophile had arranged for Shuliak’s admission to Columbia University’s dental school, as a transfer student from Belarus who had not finished her degree, via a complicated process that began in 2011.
After she got in, communications between her and members of the Ivy League school’s international student office show her immigration case was another hurdle to clear.

- Switzerland announced Oman would host US-Iran talks in Geneva to limit Iran's nuclear programme, following previous indirect talks. The US is increasing military pressure.
- Switzerland, a neutral "protecting power" since 1980, facilitates US-Iran diplomatic ties and consular affairs, offering its "good offices" for dialogue.

GENEVA - Switzerland said on Feb 14 that Oman would host talks between the United States and Iran in Geneva next week, with Washington pushing Tehran to make a deal to limit its nuclear programme.
“Switzerland stands ready at all times to offer its good offices to facilitate dialogue between the United States and Iran,” a Swiss foreign ministry spokesman told AFP.
On Feb 6, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi held talks in Oman with US envoy Steve Witkoff and US President Donald Trump’s influential son-in-law Jared Kushner.
The talks were indirect, with the Omanis acting as mediators.
Mr Trump has recently focused his military threats on Tehran’s nuclear programme, which US forces struck in July 2025
Mr Trump said on Feb 13 that a change of government in Iran ratcheting up military pressure
Go-between
Switzerland has played a key role in diplomatic relations between Iran and the US for decades.
Renowned for its neutrality, Switzerland has been representing US interests in Iran since Washington broke off relations with Tehran after the 1980 hostage crisis, a year after the Iranian revolution.
In its role as the so-called protecting power, Switzerland has for decades allowed the two feuding nations to maintain a minimum of diplomatic and consular relations.
The Swiss embassy in Tehran handles all consular affairs between the US and Iran, including passport requests, altering civil status and consular protection for US citizens in Iran.
Under the protecting power mandate, “Switzerland can either offer to act as a go-between on its own initiative or can fulfil this function at the request of the parties concerned, provided that all those involved agree,” the foreign ministry says on its website.
The US will be holding separate talks, also in Geneva next week, between Russia and Ukraine.
Moscow and Kyiv will hold US-brokered talks on Feb 17 and 18 in the Swiss city, both countries have said, announcing the next leg in fraught negotiations seeking to end the four-year war.
Mr Trump is pushing to halt the conflict, but two previous rounds of US-mediated talks in Abu Dhabi have not yielded signs of a breakthrough. AFP

New archbishop of Westminster urges greater understanding of struggles of ‘the vulnerable’
Unknown

The new leader of Roman Catholics in England and Wales has said the church has failed vulnerable people, urging more work to be done to address the struggle of refugees and learn from victims of abuse.
At a ceremony where he was officially installed in his new role as archbishop of Westminster, Richard Moth said: “Here, I am most aware of every occasion on which members of the church, or the church as a whole, have failed – most especially when the vulnerable have been abused.
“Such failure calls for listening to, and learning from, those who have suffered so grievously – and a continuing commitment to ensuring that our communities are places where all are safe in their encounter with Christ and with one another.”
Addressing the congregation of 2,000 people in Westminster Cathedral on Saturday, the new archbishop added that the church’s “vital” evangelical work is “fragile and adversely impacted by our failures in love, power and self-control”.
Moth was named as the 12th archbishop of Westminster by Pope Leo XIV in December, when he became the leader of the approximately 4 million Catholics in England and Wales.
The Westminster role was previously held by Cardinal Vincent Nichols, who retired after 16 years. Moth said Nichols is now moving “to slightly more restful pastures”.
Moth was born in Zambia but moved to Kent in his early years. His previous role was as bishop of Arundel and Brighton; before that he was bishop of the Forces.
The new leader has spoken publicly about issues surrounding migration and condemned the recent comments made by billionaire and co-owner of Manchester United, Sir Jim Ratcliffe.
In an interview with the Press Association, he said: “Speaking into a debate is fine, but the language is unfortunate, and I think that approach that he expressed is a deeply unfortunate one. I would disagree with it wholeheartedly.”
He also criticised government policies to house asylum seekers in hotels. “I think the debate I would like to see is how can we best approach this issue? Having people living in hotels for long periods of time is not ideal,” he said in the same interview.
At the ceremony in Westminster, the new archbishop of Canterbury, Dame Sarah Mullally, said Moth has a “deep concern for the dignity of every person”.
“In a world marked by division and uncertainty, the call to unity flows from the heart of the gospel itself – our traditions are not weakened by friendship, they are deepened when we walk together in charity, honesty and truth,” she said.
Moth has also spoken about the “opportunity” for the church to capture the interest of new believers.
In an interview with the Catholic Herald this month, he said: “Most dioceses report increased adult baptisms and a gradual rise in people coming to church. Numbers are picking up again after Covid, though not yet back to pre-pandemic levels. There is also growing interest from young adults exploring or entering the church. So there is a great opportunity here.”

US completes transfer of 5,700 IS detainees from Syria to Iraq

US military completes transfer of 5,700 IS detainees from Syria to Iraq
The United States Central Command said it has completed the transfer of more than 5,700 detained Islamic State group suspects from Syria to Iraq.
The detainees from some 60 countries had for years been held in Syrian prisons run by Kurdish-led forces before the recapture of surrounding territory by Damascus prompted Washington to step in.
CENTCOM said it "completed a transfer mission following a nighttime flight from northeastern Syria to Iraq on Feb 12 to help ensure ISIS detainees remain secure in detention facilities."
"The 23-day transfer mission began on Jan 21 and resulted in US forces successfully transporting more than 5,700 adult male ISIS fighters from detention facilities in Syria to Iraqi custody," it added in a statement.
The US had previously announced it would transfer around 7,000 detainees.
IS swept across Syria and Iraq in 2014, committing massacres and forcing women and girls into sexual slavery.
Backed by US-led forces, Iraq proclaimed the defeat of IS in the country in 2017, and the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) ultimately beat back the group in Syria two years later.
The SDF went on to jail thousands of suspected jihadists and detain tens of thousands of their relatives in camps.
61 countries
Last month, Syrian troops drove Kurdish forces from swathes of northern Syria, sparking questions over the fate of the IS prisoners.
Lingering doubts about security pushed Washington to announce it would transfer them to Iraq to prevent "a breakout" that could threaten the region.
"We appreciate Iraq's leadership and recognition that transferring the detainees is essential to regional security," said head of CENTCOM Admiral Brad Cooper.
"Job well done to the entire Joint Force team who executed this exceptionally challenging mission on the ground and in the air," he added.
Iraq's National Centre for International Judicial Cooperation (NCIJC) said 5,704 IS detainees of 61 nationalities have arrived in Iraq.
They include 3,543 Syrians, 467 Iraqis, and another 710 detainees from other Arab countries.
There are also more than 980 foreigners including those from Europe, Asia, Australia and the United States.
The NCIJC said Iraq's judiciary will interrogate the detainees before taking legal action against them.
Many prisons in Iraq are already packed with IS suspects.
Iraqi courts have handed down hundreds of death sentences and life terms to those convicted of terrorism offences, including foreign fighters.
Under Iraqi law, terrorism and murder offences are punishable by death, and execution decrees must be signed by the president.
The detainees in Syria were transferred to Baghdad's al-Karkh prison, once a US Army detention centre known as Camp Cropper, where former ruler Saddam Hussein was held before his execution.
To make space for the newcomers, authorities moved thousands of prisoners from the Karkh prison to other facilities, a lawyer and an inmate told AFP news agency on condition of anonymity.
Repatriation
Iraq has issued calls for countries to repatriate their nationals among the IS detainees, though this appears unlikely.
For years, Syria's Kurdish forces also called on foreign governments to take back their citizens, but this was done on a small scale limited to women and children held in detention camps.
Most foreign families have left northeast Syria's Al-Hol camp, which holds relatives of IS fighters, since the departure of Kurdish forces who previously guarded it, humanitarian sources told AFP on Thursday.
Last month, the Syrian government took over the camp from Kurdish forces who ceded territory as Damascus extended its control across swathes of Syria's northeast

Rio Carnival street party dogs parade as humans protest against pet killers
Dozens of dogs dressed as alligators, fairies and superheroes have gathered at a Rio de Janeiro Carnival street party as their owners protested cruelty against pets
- Bookmark
Dozens of dogs dressed as alligators, fairies and superheroes gathered Saturday at a Rio de Janeiro Carnival street party as their owners protested cruelty against pets. The canines wagged their tails to samba music, ate a delicious breakfast from several bowls and made new friends at the so-called Blocao, a traditional event during Brazil's biggest bash.
About 300 people and their pets gathered in the neighborhood of Barra da Tijuca, on Rio’s west side. They sang and danced to old-style Carnival songs as their pets kept their paws protected in the shade as Rio's thermometers marked 30 Celsius degrees (86 Fahrenheit).
“Dogs are a part of our families. Families come to a street party for dogs because it's sweet, it is joyful and loving,” said Marco Antonio Marinho, 72, the Blocao's chief organizer. “When we are sad at home, they are by our side, they are sad too," he said. "Now that we are happy, they have to be happy too. So we take care of their paws, we keep water for them to be comfortable and safe too.”
A hydration station helped keep the dogs' energy through the two hours of the street celebration at a square, as many cariocas, as Rio residents are known, honked their cars to show support for the dogs and to owners protesting violence against pets. In previous years, the dogs would parade through the streets, but their gentle paws were often scorched by the hot pavement.
The name Blocao is a mixture of “bloco,” which means Carnival street party, and “cao,” or dog in Portuguese. The street party has taken place for more than 20 years.
Marinho and other partygoers waved white ribbons and sang a song in a tribute to Orelha, a dog that was killed in southern Brazil in January in a case that caused national rage.
Santa Catarina state police charged a 15-year-old who allegedly spanked the dog to death but authorities have recommended the teenager be tried under the juvenile corrections system. The judge in the case has yet to rule.
The teenager's lawyer denied any wrongdoing, .
Natalia Reis, 28, came to Blocao for the first time with her 11-year-old dog Theo, partly because of Orelha's killing. She had tears in her eyes when organizers took the microphone to talk about the importance of protecting pets from cruelty.
“This was so unfortunate, we need perpetrators of his death to be punished,” Reis said. “We need to raise awareness. This could have happened to me, to any of us.”

After the anniversary of the 1979 revolution, defiant protesters say they will return to the streets

On Tuesday night, on the eve of the fireworks marking the anniversary of the 1979 Revolution in Iran, many neighborhoods in Tehran and other major cities became scenes of confrontation between opponents and supporters of the regime.
While a limited number of pro-government residents in each neighborhood chanted the customary “Allahu Akbar,” opponents, unafraid of identification, responded with chants of “Death to Khamenei” and “Death to the dictator,” signaling that protests in Iran are far from over.
Meanwhile, the families of thousands killed in the bloody crackdown of January 8 and 9 are preparing to hold memorial ceremonies in the coming days. Two protesters in Tehran told The Media Line that they are no longer afraid and are determined to return to the streets to complete the unfinished 47-year struggle to bring down the Islamic Republic.
Arghavan, a law student in Tehran who spontaneously went onto her rooftop Tuesday night to chant against Khamenei and drown out pro-regime slogans, said: “The regime is trying to normalize the atmosphere through celebrations and festivities, even moving ahead to mark the upcoming Mid-Sha’ban holiday. But people are angry and deeply wounded. They will not back down so easily.”
Arghavan was struck by multiple pellets during clashes in western Tehran and still struggles to walk properly. She sought refuge at her boyfriend’s home, where his mother removed the pellets without anesthesia using basic medical supplies. According to Arghavan, they were fortunate that phone lines were down, as injured individuals taken to nearby hospitals had been detained. She described the scale of live ammunition and pellet fire as so intense that “almost everyone in the crowd was hit,” with many killed or wounded.
Reflecting on the 1979 Revolution, Arghavan said it had been driven by aspirations for freedom, equality, and a better life, but that people were misled by Ayatollah Khomeini’s promises. Not only were those hopes dashed, she argued, but living conditions deteriorated significantly, personal freedoms were curtailed, and the country experienced a profound regression.
Maryam Afshari, a political activist based in Sweden, offered a broader perspective: “Various contradictions, including those between modernity and tradition, fuelled the 1979 Revolution. However, the clerical establishment ultimately rode that wave and diverted it from its original demands.” This debate has continued within Iranian society for 47 years. The Islamic Republic, having suppressed its opponents in the early years of its rule, regards itself as the rightful victor of the revolution.
On Wednesday, the government staged official celebrations and marches, in which even some unveiled women participated, with state media highlighting their presence as evidence of broad societal support. Social media users, meanwhile, drew attention to the state broadcaster’s use of artificial intelligence to depict large crowds.
The volume of “Death to Khamenei” chants the night before was so overwhelming that the slogan was even mistakenly repeated by a local television presenter during a live broadcast. In response, the state broadcaster dismissed the broadcast director of the Sistan and Balochistan provincial channel and referred members of the program’s production team to a disciplinary committee.
A resident of Azadi Street in Tehran noted that despite official pressure and efforts to mobilize state employees, turnout toward Azadi Square appeared lower than in previous years.
Amid an atmosphere of fear, intimidation, and ongoing arrests, some protesters are now speaking openly on social media under their real names, saying they are no longer afraid.
Samad, a restaurant worker in southern Tehran, says he has witnessed scenes in protests unlike anything he has seen even in apocalyptic films. A former art student expelled for being unable to pay tuition, he is now worker. “Freedom has a cost,” he says. “We have paid it. And after all this killing and violence, our anger has only deepened. We have no choice but to return to the streets empty-handed. But we know the regime cannot kill 90 million Iranians.”
He describes the country’s economic and social conditions as a kind of slow death. “Dying with dignity is better than this daily, gradual death. Our history is now written in blood in the winter of 2026. We must finish this unfinished task after 47 years.”
The restaurant where Samad works has seen a sharp decline in business since the bloody crackdown of January 8 and 9, and he fears losing his job. He earns just $70 a month for ten-hour shifts. Even with free meals and living with his family rent-free, nothing remains at the end of the month to save, or even to buy a book.
“Iranian legends about resisting tyranny and Zahhak are not just stories to read,” Samad says. “Last month, we embodied them in the streets. That is why we will return.”
As authorities brace for upcoming memorials for those killed during the uprising, concerns over potential U.S. or Israeli military action have further heightened tensions. For the first time, the Islamic Republic’s leader did not attend the annual Air Force Day meeting with commanders on February 8, with domestic media citing “security reasons.”
Instead, they met with Hassan Khomeini, grandson of the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. A website called Rouydad 24, which is reportedly connected to former President Hassan Rouhani, speculated that Khomeini, alongside Alireza Arafi, Mohsen Araki, Sadiq Larijani, and Rouhani himself, could be among Khamenei's potential successors.
The Islamic Republic marks its 47th year in power amid official inflation nearing 48 percent, a sharply depreciated national currency, and widespread economic stagnation following the January protests. The livelihoods of citizens who once aspired to a better future nearly half a century ago have visibly diminished.
Many domestic analysts warn that the violent suppression of protests is not the end of the story and that authorities must remain prepared for renewed unrest. Afshin Davarpanah, an anthropologist in Tehran, said, “Young people under 30 and women are the main driving forces of the protests,” adding that since their demands remain unmet, “the protests will not end here but will continue in different and potentially more complex forms.” Even Judiciary Chief Gholam-Hossein Mohseni Eje’i has cautioned security forces to anticipate protesters’ return to the streets.
Despite what many describe as de facto martial law in numerous cities and a wave of arrests, students, retirees, workers, and various groups continue to strike and protest. With nightly rooftop chants and protest graffiti persisting until the moment, many believe that soon, mass demonstrations once again fill the streets.

Russia Killed Alexei Navalny Using Poison Dart Frog Toxin – Europe Statement

Kremlin opposition leader Alexei Navalny was killed using toxin from poison dart frogs while held in an Arctic penal colony two years ago, according to a Joint Statement published by the UK on Saturday.
Britain, France, Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden said analyses of samples from Navalny’s body “conclusively confirmed” the presence of epibatidine, a toxin found in poison dart frogs in South America and not found naturally in Russia.

The official statement, published by the UK Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, says “given the toxicity of epibatidine and reported symptoms, poisoning was highly likely the cause of his death.”
It adds that “Russia’s repeated disregard for international law and the Chemical Weapons Convention is clear” and that “only the Russian state had the combined means, motive and disregard for international law to carry out the attacks.”
In a follow-up tweet, UK Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper added that only the Russian government had the “opportunity”
Russia had previously claimed that Navalny died of natural causes.
The BBC quotes toxicology expert Jill Johnson as saying epibatidine is “200 times more potent than morphine” and that by acting on receptors in the central nervous system, it can cause “muscle twitching and paralysis, seizures, slow heart rate, respiratory failure and finally death.” She added that the extremely rare neurotoxin is only found in one wild frog species in tiny quantities, and only when the frog eats a specific diet.
Trump’s Trading of Ukraine
The findings underline the need to hold Russia accountable for its repeated violations of the Chemical Weapons Convention and, in this instance, the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention, according to the official statement released today.
Furthermore, allies are concerned that Russia “did not destroy all of its chemical weapons” and the UK and partners “will make use of all policy levers at our disposal to continue to hold Russia to account.”
The UK has informed the Organisation on the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons of Russia’s alleged breach of the Chemical Weapons Convention.
Meanwhile Britain’s Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said Navalny’s “determination to expose the truth has left an enduring legacy” and the Russia and Putin have demonstrated “murderous intent.”
Navalny – Russia’s most prominent and outspoken opposition leader – died suddenly in a Russian jail on Feb 16, 2024. He was arrested and imprisoned upon returning to Russia after being poisoned in 2020 with the Novichok nerve agent and receiving treatment in Germany.
Before Saturday’s announcement, Navalny’s wife Yulia Navalnaya had repeatedly claimed that her husband was killed by poisoning.

"There is no decision about Taurus from Germany. The war is not over yet," he noted.
Zelenskyy stressed that Ukraine is receiving other assistance for the Armed Forces from Berlin.
"Yesterday, we opened the line of co-production. We began to build drones. And already these drones are on the frontline," he said by way of example. "We don't have a decision from the German side. I will, I'll be honest with you. But, I have to find this balance in dialogue in what to choose," he explained.

Background:
- In January 2026, the Bundesrat called for increased support for Ukraine "where necessary", including the transfer of long-range Taurus missiles to Kyiv.
- In the same month, the Bundestag also urged the delivery of additional air defence systems and Taurus missiles to Ukraine.

Claims of Navalny's poisoning are Western propaganda hoax — Russian MFA

MOSCOW, February 14. /TASS/. Russian Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova has dismissed claims that blogger Alexey Navalny, who is officially designated as a terrorist and extremist in Russia, was poisoned with frog-derived poison as a Western propaganda hoax.
"When the test results are available and the formulas for the substances are disclosed, we will comment accordingly," Zakharova stated. "Until then, all such assertions are merely propaganda aimed at diverting attention from pressing Western issues." She criticized the timing of these allegations, noting, "Just as the investigation into the Nord Stream explosions was about to yield results, suddenly Navalny's poisoning is brought into focus. When asked for Navalny's test results, Western officials instead circulated sensational stories about the Skripals. This pattern continues unabated."
On February 14, Germany, Britain, the Netherlands, Sweden, and France issued a joint statement claiming that Navalny was allegedly poisoned with epibatidine, a toxin derived from the skin of the Ecuadorian poison dart frog. Their conclusion was reportedly based on analyses of Navalny's biological samples. These countries accused Russia of violating the Chemical Weapons Convention in connection with the incident.

Defense forces stop Russian attempt to consolidate in Chasiv Yar – military
The 24th Separate Mechanized Brigade named after King Danylo stated this on Facebook, Ukrinform reports.
"Chasiv Yar. Poor visibility. Ruins and basements. Russians operate in small groups – two or three people. They try to slip between positions, consolidate, and bring in reinforcements," the report said.
In the video, one of these groups was discovered by Ukrainian soldiers in the basement of a destroyed building. They were cornered and blocked inside.
"No options left. Prisoners or death," the Ukrainian defenders captioned the video, showing how the Russians surrendered and were escorted to Ukrainian positions under drone surveillance.
As Ukrinform reported, the Russian army, taking advantage of the weather conditions, increased pressure on the city of Chasiv Yar in the Donetsk region.

Barack Obama publicly states support for anti-ICE demonstrators in Minneapolis

Barack Obama publicly gave his support to demonstrators in Minneapolis for standing up to the “unprecedented nature” of the Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operation in Minnesota.
Speaking in an interview with progressive YouTuber Brian Tyler Cohen on Saturday, the former president discussed the power that US citizens hold when standing up for the values they believe in and his hopes for the next generation of American leaders.
“The reason I point out that I don’t think the majority of the American people approve of this is because ultimately, the answer is going to come from the American people,” he said. “We just saw this in Minnesota, in Minneapolis.”
“It is important for us to recognize the unprecedented nature of what ICE was doing in Minneapolis, St Paul, the way that federal agents, ICE agents were being deployed, without any clear guidelines, training, pulling people out of their homes, using five-year-olds to try to bait their parents, all the stuff that we saw, teargassing crowds simply who were standing there, not breaking any laws,” he added.
The Twin Cities area of Minnesota has been the site of ongoing anti-immigration enforcement protests. These demonstrations have grown in scope following the killings of Renee Good and Alex Pretti at the hands of federal agents.
But this week, Tom Homan, the US border czar, said that the Trump administration would be drawing down its immigration crackdown in Minnesota following the killings after initial escalations by immigration agencies. Many have credited the decision to draw back as proof that the protests were successful in sending a message.
“Right now, we’re being tested, and the good news is, what we saw in Minneapolis and St Paul, and what we’re seeing in places across the country, including here in Los Angeles, has been the American people saying no,” Obama said. “At least a good number of the American people saying, we’re going to live up to those values that we say we believe in.”
“As long as we have folks doing that, I feel like we’re going to get through this,” he added.
Obama, along with the former first lady, Michelle Obama, called the killing of Alex Pretti “a heartbreaking tragedy” and “a wake-up call to every American, regardless of party, that many of our core values as a nation are increasingly under assault”.
In a statement released last month, the Obamas said federal law enforcement and immigration agents were not operating in a lawful or accountable way in Minnesota. They said the tactics employed by ICE and other federal agents seemed “designed to intimidate, harass, provoke and endanger the residents of a major American city”.

No, Russia's attacks on energy infrastructure are not 'retaliation' for Ukraine's strikes on oil refineries

Why Russia’s attacks on Ukraine’s energy grid aren’t ‘revenge’ for Kyiv’s deep strike campaign

After its largest winter mass attack on Feb. 3, Russia's Defense Ministry said the strikes on Ukrainian energy infrastructure were carried out "in response to terrorist attacks by Kyiv on civilian objects" in Russia. Some state media described the attack as "another act of retribution."
It's an old story — the first mass Russian strike on Ukraine's civilian infrastructure in October 2022 was framed by Russian President Vladimir Putin as retaliation for Kyiv's first successful strike against the Crimean Bridge, a key military logistics route on the occupied peninsula.
Since then, Russia has repeatedly framed repeated large-scale attacks as "responses," "revenge," or "forced measures." Just last month, a State Duma official called for the use of more powerful "weapons of retaliation."
It's a common theme from the Kremlin and its supporters. It's also completely false for several reasons.
Self-defense
The idea that any Russian strike is retaliation for Ukrainian military actions ignores one crucial factor — Russia and Russia alone started the full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
"The retaliation narrative risks creating false equivalency between Russian international aggression, and Ukraine’s justifiable efforts to defend itself.," the Razom Advocacy Team wrote in an article in response to the October 2022 strike.
If that weren't enough, there are also huge differences in both the tactics and the targets of Russian and Ukrainian long-range strikes.
The targets
Russia's now years-long campaign of mass missile and drone strikes have consistently targeted civilian infrastructure, often located in densely populated cities.
Take the strike on Feb. 3 for example — 71 missiles and around 450 drones hit combined heat and power plants and thermal power stations in Kyiv, Kharkiv, and Dnipro.
"This was a deliberate strike on energy infrastructure, with a record number of ballistic missiles," President Volodymyr Zelensky said.
Such strikes regularly result in the deaths and injuries of civilians. A drone strike on Kharkiv this week killed three toddlers and their father, and also injured their pregnant mother.
Ukrainian long-range strikes target a very different type of energy infrastructure — the oil refineries used to produce the oil that the Kremlin sells to fund its war machine.
And because of the toxic pollutants these facilities emit, they are usually located far from cities and other urban areas with civilian casualties vanishingly rare.
"Russian attacks on Ukraine's energy generation facilities appear designed specifically to affect civilians," Michael Clarke, a British defense expert and professor at King's College London, told the Kyiv Independent, adding that such strikes are "automatically evidence of a war crime."
The evidence for the effect of these strikes on civilians is currently visible across Ukraine right now — much of the population is struggling with blackouts, lack of heating, and sometimes even lack of water during one of the coldest winters in years.
"Ukrainian attacks, by contrast, target oil and fuel infrastructure that sustains Russia's war effort — a legitimate set of economic targets," he added.
Ukraine's strategy
Ukraine has openly acknowledged its campaign of long-range strikes, which escalated and expanded greatly over 2025.
Ukraine's General Staff, as well as the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) and military intelligence (HUR) regularly report attacks on oil production and refining facilities.
"Ukraine is trying to increase the economic costs of the war for Russia and create a sense among the Russian population that this war will not be cost-free as it continues into a fourth year," Clarke said.
In official statements, the operations are framed as systematic efforts to weaken Moscow's military capacity.
"Ukraine's Defense Forces will continue to carry out measures aimed at reducing the combat potential of the Russian aggressor," the SBU said following the last operation on Feb. 10.
Though energy facilities do not produce weapons, they underpin Russia's ability to wage war. Energy exports remain a core source of state revenue, funding a war budget that now consumes about 40% of federal spending.
"Russia sells oil, takes the money, and invests it in weapons. Those weapons are used to kill Ukrainians. That is why this energy sector is a legitimate target," Zelensky said on Feb. 8.
In addition, oil products, such as diesel and aviation fuel, are essential for powering tanks and armored vehicles at the front, supplying military transport, and fueling bombers and fighter jets conducting airstrikes.
In 2025 alone, Ukraine carried out nearly 160 strikes against oil production and refining facilities across Russia, former Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) head Vasyl Maliuk said in October 2025.
According to Maliuk, the campaign contributed to a 20% domestic fuel deficit in Russia, forced 37% of refining capacity to halt operations at various points, and led to fuel shortages in 57 regions. The disruptions prompted Moscow to temporarily ban gasoline exports through the end of the year.
And the strikes have only become more precise over time — in June 2025, U.S. and CIA officials worked with Ukrainian counterparts to target a specific type of pipe in the refineries that is exceptionally difficult to repair or replace, according to The New York Times.
Russia's strategy
In Russia's own long-range strike campaign, civilians and civilian infrastructure are among the hardest hit, with particular impact now on facilities supplying heat and electricity to residential areas.
The aim, Zelensky said, is not to weaken Ukraine's armed forces, but to break society under the strain of cold, and darkness.
"When Russia cannot break the military, it strikes civilians," he said.
Clarke said Russia has always seen civilian infrastructure as a legitimate pressure point.
"The Russians have always believed in targeting civilians as they judge it to be a successful tactic in warfare," he said.
"In public, the Russians claim they always stick to international and humanitarian law in their targeting. But their military doctrine and their conduct over the last five wars in 26 years — not to mention the Soviet experience in Afghanistan and during the Second World War — indicate quite the opposite."
For Ukrainian civilians, 2025 was the deadliest year since the beginning of the full-scale invasion, the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine (HRMMU) reported in January.
The mission documented 2,514 civilians killed and 12,142 injured — a 31% increase compared to 2024 and a 70% increase compared to 2023. HRMMU said 97% of the civilian casualties occurred in Ukraine-controlled areas and were caused by attacks launched by Russia.
Since October 2025, Russia has damaged around 8.5 gigawatts of Ukraine's generating capacity through repeated strikes on power plants and substations.
In January, President Volodymyr Zelensky declared an emergency in Ukraine's energy sector, with particular attention on Kyiv, where 1,400 residential buildings remained without heating as of Feb. 11.

What We Learned From Marco Rubio’s Foreign Policy Speech to European Leaders
Unknown

Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the United States wants to “revitalize” its relationship with Europe in a key foreign policy speech to the continent’s leaders on Saturday.
Speaking at the Munich Security Conference, Rubio said the U.S. and Europe shared a centuries-old history and “belong together,” a message that some European leaders viewed as an olive branch after an antagonistic appearance by Vice President J.D. Vance at the same forum the previous year.
“We want Europe to be strong,” Rubio said, adding that the two world wars of the 20th century serve as a reminder that “our destiny is and always will be intertwined with yours.”

His speech comes at a time when U.S.-European relations have been strained by President Donald Trump's aggressive efforts to annex Greenland, his Administration’s ongoing trade war with most European allies, and a years-long divide over the future of NATO and European security.
Rubio argued that the U.S. still cares deeply about Europe’s future and suggested disagreements stem from “profound concern” for the continent, which he described as the birthplace of a common civilization. He said the U.S. intends to work with the Europeans, not against them.
"We are connected not just economically, not just militarily. We are connected spiritually, and we are connected culturally," he added.
Here’s what we learned from the speech:
A change in tone
Rubio’s speech marked a dramatic shift in tone from the United States' contribution to last year's conference, delivered by Vice President Vance, who rebuked European leaders for marginalizing far-right parties and accused them of curbing free speech.
While his remarks were met with silence, Rubio’s speech drew bursts of applause and laughter.
The Secretary of State offered a conciliatory message, saying the U.S., under Trump, seeks to lead a global “renewal and restoration.”
Rubio said the “euphoria” that followed the West’s Cold War victory gave rise to a “dangerous delusion that we had entered ‘the end of history,’ that every nation would now be a liberal democracy, that the ties formed by trade and by commerce alone would now replace nationhood ... and that we would now live in a world without borders where everyone became a citizen of the world.”
“We made these mistakes together, and now together we owe it to our people to face those facts and to move forward to rebuild,” Rubio said.
“This is why we Americans may sometimes come off as a little direct and urgent in our counsel,” he said. “This is why President Trump demands seriousness and reciprocity from our friends here in Europe.”
Despite the softer tone, Rubio shared much of Vance's criticism of Europe over migration.
Rubio warned of the dangers of "mass migration" and “civilizational erasure,” and pointed to what he described as the weakening of post-World War II institutions such as the United Nations, which he said require sweeping reform.
“We in America have no interest in being polite and orderly caretakers of the West‘s managed decline,” he said.
Trump has floated both Rubio and Vance as potential 2028 presidential frontrunners, so their contrasting speeches will likely be dissected by European leaders over the next few years for clues about where the U.S. will be heading if Republicans win.
U.N. needs reform
Rubio said the United Nations “still has tremendous potential,” but argued that on today’s most pressing issues, “it has no answers and has played virtually no role.” Instead, he praised American leadership for “problem-solving.”
“The U.N. could not solve the war in Gaza; it has not solved the war in Ukraine,” Rubio said.
His comments come as Trump’s Board of Peace, which some view as a potential rival to the U.N., is set to hold its first meeting on Feb. 19, in Washington, D.C.
The Board of Peace is designed to oversee Gaza’s redevelopment and resolve global conflicts. The inaugural meeting aims to raise funds for Gaza’s reconstruction and convene international leaders from the 27 countries that signed the charter.
The United Arab Emirates and the United States have already pledged $1 billion to Trump’s Board of Peace, according to two officials close to the board's funding matters.
Speaking immediately after Rubio, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi struck a contrasting tone.
“The main reason for the inadequacy of the current international system is not the United Nations itself, but the fact that some countries magnify differences, pursue national priorities ... and even revive the Cold War mentality,” he said. “All these have undermined the basis of trust, worsened the atmosphere of cooperation, and made the operation of international mechanisms difficult.”
Despite Ukraine’s fate looming over this year’s conference, Rubio made little mention of Russia’s full-scale invasion, citing it only as an example of the United Nations’ shortcomings.
“It has not solved the war in Ukraine. It took American leadership and partnership with many of the countries here today just to bring the two sides to the table in search of a still elusive peace," he said.
The war remains a major concern for Europe as the Trump administration increases pressure on Ukraine to make concessions for a peace deal with Russia. Ukrainian officials recently said American negotiators had called for Ukraine to hold elections by May 15, a deadline seen as unlikely while the war continues.
Speaking later at the conference, President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine said his country would hold elections only after a cease-fire. Zelensky, who has been president since 2019, noted that elections have not been held since Russia’s full-scale invasion in 2022 and stressed that Ukraine needed strong security guarantees before agreeing to any end to the war.
“We hope President Trump hears us,” he said.
European reaction
European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said she was "very much reassured by the speech of the secretary of state,” calling him a “good friend” and a “strong ally.”
Upon taking the stage after Rubio’s speech, she started with a simple message: "Europe must become more independent – there is no other choice."
"The European way of life – our democratic foundation and the trust of our citizens – is being challenged in new ways. On everything from territories to tariffs or tech regulations," she said, appearing to reference the U.S., but also citing Russia's ongoing aggression against Ukraine.
This independence must be wide-ranging and cover areas including "Defence and energy. Economy and trade. Raw materials and digital tech," she said.
"Some may say the word ‘independence’ runs counter to our transatlantic bond. But the opposite is true. An independent Europe is a strong Europe. And a strong Europe makes for a stronger transatlantic alliance," she also said.
“We know some in the administration have a harsher tone on these topics,” she conceded, without naming Trump or Vance.
But not all Europeans were impressed by the softer approach.
“In substance, nothing changes, Europe now has to become more independent and assume more responsibility, also in the security and defense area,” Austria’s Foreign Minister Beate Meinl-Reisinger told POLITICO.
Similarly, although Democratic politicians in Munich acknowledged that Rubio’s speech signaled a change in tone, they questioned whether it would alter the substance of the transatlantic relationship.
“He was clearly trying to escape the vituperative ghost of J.D. Vance in seeking to be calming and reassuring, but it was so lacking in substance and specificity that in the end, its impact will be very limited,” Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, said.
He added, “I don't think the speech was about turning the page [after Greenland], but just getting over the moment, yeah, has given no signs that he's backing down from the antagonism and hostility.”
Sen. Thom Tillis, the top Republican on the Senate NATO Observer Group, praised Rubio’s speech, saying it reinforced efforts to reassure allied leaders that NATO will endure.
“I thought it was great,” Tillis said. “We all know that that speech would not have been delivered if the White House hadn't agreed with it. Yeah. So I think that's not only a message from Marco, but it's a message from the president.”
A dose of reality
Despite Rubio’s conciliatory message, his speech came a day after he skipped the “Berlin Format” meeting with European leaders on the war in Ukraine, a key point of contention between Europe and the Trump Administration.
At the same time, Trump continues to pressure Zelensky of Ukraine to accept a deal that could involve ceding significant portions of the country to Russia. Both European governments and Ukrainian officials have rejected such a proposal, arguing that it would not resolve the conflict but merely pause it, leaving the region’s future uncertain.
“Ukrainians will not gift their land to the occupier,” Zelensky said in a video address from Kyiv in December. He added that any decisions made without Ukraine “are at the same time decisions against peace” and called such measures “dead decisions; they will never work.”
Praise for NATO
At the conference, Rubio praised NATO, citing instances when U.S. and NATO troops fought and died alongside one another.
"We have fought against each other, then reconciled, then fought and reconciled again. And we have bled and died side-by-side on battlefields from Kapyong to Kandahar," he added. "And I'm here today to make it clear that America is charting the path for a new century of prosperity, and that once again, we want to do it together with you, our cherished allies and our oldest friends."
Rubio’s comments stood in contrast to recent comments made by Trump about America’s NATO allies. Since the turn of the year, Trump has repeatedly questioned NATO’s willingness to support the U.S.
“I DOUBT NATO WOULD BE THERE FOR US IF WE REALLY NEEDED THEM,” he blasted on Truth Social on Jan. 7. “We will always be there for NATO, even if they won’t be there for us.”
In an interview with Fox in Davos, the President also asserted that while NATO allies sent troops to Afghanistan, they "stayed a little back, a little off the front lines."

Nobel winner transferred to prison in northern Iran: husband
Iranian authorities have, without prior warning, transferred Nobel Peace Prize winner Narges Mohammadi to a prison in the north of the country as concern grows over her health, her husband said on Saturday.
Mohammadi, who won the peace prize in 2023 in recognition for more than two decades of campaigning, was arrested on 12 December in the eastern city of Mashhad after speaking out against the clerical authorities at a funeral ceremony.
She spent time on hunger strike earlier this month and had been hospitalised before being returned to prison.
The Norwegian Nobel Committee said this week it was "deeply appalled" by reports detailing "physical abuse and ongoing life-threatening mistreatment" of Mohammadi both during her arrest and in detention.
Since her arrest, Mohammadi had been held in Mashhad at the detention facility of the intelligence ministry and had only been allowed one phonecall with a brother inside Iran and another to her Iranian lawyer.
But she has now been transferred to prison in the city of Zanjan in the north of the country, said her husband Taghi Rahmani, who is based in Paris.
"This action was carried out without informing her family or her lawyer", he said on X, adding it was "intended to exile and displace Narges".
On 7 December, she was handed a further six years in prison on charges of harming national security and was also given a one-and-a-half-year prison sentence for propaganda against Iran's Islamic system.
On 2 February she began a hunger strike to protest the conditions of her imprisonment and the inability to make phone calls to lawyers and family but then ended the action after a week.
Her foundation has described her physical condition as "deeply alarming", saying she was transferred to hospital in Mashhad but then returned to prison "before completing her treatment".
Mohammadi was arrested before protests erupted nationwide later in December. The movement peaked in January, with authorities launching a crackdown that activists say has left thousands dead.
Over the past quarter-century, Mohammadi, 53, who was born in Zanjan, has been repeatedly tried and jailed for her campaigning against Iran's use of capital punishment and the mandatory dress code for women.

Epstein files: Former Trump advisor corresponding over ways to undermine pope
Unknown

02:09:01 KST

The newest Jeffrey Epstein files release includes messages dating from 2019 from former White House adviser Steve Bannon with the convicted sex offender about ways he could work to undermine Pope Francis.
CNN on Saturday reported that the correspondence, disclosed as part of a recent document dump, indicates that Bannon saw Francis -- who died in 2025 -- as a key ideological opponent to his nationalist-populist agenda and sought support from Epstein in advancing efforts against him.
In one June 2019 message, Bannon wrote: “Will take down (Pope) Francis,” adding, “The Clintons, (Chinese President) Xi, Francis, EU -- come on brother.”
CNN reported that the exchanges included discussions about French journalist Frederic Martel’s controversial book In the Closet of the Vatican, which examines secrecy and power within the Catholic Church.
Bannon suggested Epstein, who died in jail in August 2019, could serve as executive producer for a potential film adaptation, writing: “You are now exec producer of ‘ITCOTV’ (In the closet of the Vatican).” Martel told CNN he believed Bannon wanted to “instrumentalise” the book in his campaign against the pope.
Though no longer an advisor to US President Donald Trump, Bannon hosts a podcast and remains influential in circles close to the president.
‘Catholics must choose’
The files show Epstein emailing himself references to the book and sharing articles critical of Francis, while Bannon replied to one headline, “Pope Francis or Steve Bannon? Catholics must choose,” with “easy choice.”
Austen Ivereigh, a biographer of the late pope, said Bannon appeared to misunderstand both the book and Francis’ leadership, while Rev. Antonio Spadaro, a Vatican official close to the pontiff, told CNN the messages suggested an attempt to merge “spiritual authority with political power for strategic ends,” and added:
“What those messages reveal is not merely hostility toward a pontiff, but a deeper attempt to instrumentalise faith as a weapon -- precisely the temptation he sought to disarm.”
The exchanges occurred years after Epstein’s 2008 conviction for child sex offenses and shortly before his later arrest on sex trafficking charges.
CNN reported that Epstein’s replies also included provocative remarks, quoting John Milton’s Paradise Lost: “Better to reign in Hell, than serve in Heaven.”

Mistrial declared in case of students charged after Stanford pro-Palestinian protests
A judge declared a mistrial on Friday in a case of five current and former Stanford University students related to the 2024 pro-Palestinian protests when demonstrators barricaded themselves inside the school president's office.
Twelve protesters were initially charged last year with felony vandalism, according to prosecutors who said at least one suspect entered the building by breaking a window. Police arrested 13 people on June 5, 2024, in relation to the incident and the university said the building underwent "extensive" damage.
The case was tried in Santa Clara County Superior Court against five defendants charged with felony vandalism and felony conspiracy to trespass. The rest previously accepted plea deals or diversion programs.
The jury was deadlocked. It voted nine to three to convict on the felony charge of vandalism and eight to four to convict on the felony charge to trespass. Jurors failed to reach a verdict after deliberations.
The charges were among the most serious against participants in the 2024 pro-Palestinian protest movement on U.S. colleges in which demonstrators demanded an end to Israel's war in Gaza and Washington's support for its ally along with a divestment of funds by their universities from companies supporting Israel.
Prosecutors in the case said the defendants engaged in unlawful property destruction.
"This case is about a group of people who destroyed someone else's property and caused hundreds of thousands of dollars in damage. That is against the law," Santa Clara County District Attorney Jeff Rosen said in a statement, adding he sought a new trial.
Anthony Brass, a lawyer for one of the protesters, told the New York Times his side was not defending lawlessness but "the concept of transparency and ethical investment."
"This is a win for these young people of conscience and a win for free speech," Brass said, adding "humanitarian activism has no place in a criminal courtroom."
Protesters had renamed the building "Dr. Adnan's Office" after Adnan Al-Bursh, a Palestinian doctor who died in an Israeli prison after months of detention. Over 3,000 were arrested during the 2024 U.S. pro-Palestinian protest movement, according to media tallies. Some students faced suspension, expulsion and degree revocation.

Chinese police detain woman over AI-generated video of Shanghai road collapse
State media say widely shared clip of metro site incident was false
ISTANBUL
Chinese state media said Saturday that a widely shared video purporting to show a major road collapse in Shanghai was generated by artificial intelligence and was false.
A 49-year-old woman, identified only as Luo, was placed under administrative detention for spreading the misinformation, according to a notice from a local branch of the Shanghai Public Security Bureau cited by the Global Times.
Luo was accused of “claiming a partial ground collapse in a metro construction site in Shanghai to attract followers, causing adverse social impact,” the notice said.
The video circulated widely on social media Thursday and Friday. It claimed that a partial ground collapse had occurred at the construction site of the Jia-Min Line metro project in Shanghai’s Jiading district. The post also alleged it was the second such collapse risk in less than four months, according to the notice.
“After verification by the public security authorities, the information was found to be fake,” the notice said.
Shanghai Metro said on its WeChat account that a localized leakage occurred Wednesday on the Jia-Min Line. No casualties were reported.
On Thursday afternoon, however, Shanghai Shentong Metro Group told reporters that a collapse had occurred at the site in the same area as the leakage the previous day.
The area was sealed off and no one was injured, the company said. The cause remains under investigation.

For Winter Olympic favorites, the pursuit of gold brings risk for their legacies, unfair or not
Olympic stars are learning that the same spotlight that elevates their sport can also potentially tarnish their legacies
- Bookmark
Mikaela Shiffrin signed up for this. So did Ilia Malinin, Scotty James and all the rest.
Nobody is forced to come to the Olympics. The athletes in Milan and Cortina dreamed about these two weeks long before the flames were lit in northern Italy. They have poured their lives into the pursuit of this moment. This chance.
For some — for most really — merely getting here is the goal. It is enough. More than enough.
For others who arrived here as the bold-faced names in their sport and heavy medal favorites, the business of the Olympics is more complicated.
Shiffrin knows there is a danger to all this. Yes, there is nothing like the platform the Olympics provide. The winningest ski racer of all time likened the opportunity for Olympians to showcase their respective sports to those who only tune in once every four years to a “beautiful gift."
Yet the price of that gift can come at a considerable cost. The spotlight can shine so intensely that it threatens to render everything else on your resume an afterthought, no matter how accomplished it might be.
Shiffrin acknowledged as much shortly after she arrived, saying she's well aware the perception of an athlete's legacy can hinge on a“sole moment" that doesn’t come close to capturing the full picture of a career.
She received an uncomfortable education four years ago after failing to medal in any of the six events she entered. Suddenly, the slalom gold she captured as an 18-year-old in Sochi in 2014 and two more medals she brought home from PyeongChang four years later didn't seem to matter as much, outwardly anyway.
And while Shiffrin stressed those forgettable days in Beijing were behind her as her fourth Olympics began, she heard the negativity after a sluggish performance in the women's combined on Tuesday dropped her and teammate Breezy Johnson from first to fourth.
“The Olympics ask us to take a real risk on the world stage,” she posted on Instagram ahead of Sunday's giant slalom, where she will be among the favorites as usual. “One that requires courage and vulnerability to erroneous judgment and narratives built on a limited understanding of what this sport truly demands.”
Shiffrin wasn't complaining. She was speaking the quiet part out loud.
A painful and public learning experience
The reality of the Olympics is that it is nothing more than a festival in which the world championships of disparate sports are being held in the same place (or at least the same country) at the same time.
The field in the women's giant slalom will largely mirror the field at the World Cup event in Czechia three weeks ago. It was much the same in men's figure skating.
The charismatic and electrifying Malinin, all of 21, came to Milan as a two-time world champion and the face of his sport. He picked up his first Olympic gold early in the Games when he helped the U.S. triumph in the team competition and held a comfortable five-point lead going into the men's free skate on Friday.
Over the course of a nightmarish 4 minutes and 30 seconds, it all came apart. The “Quad God” fell back to earth not once, but twice. The groans from a crowd that included two-time Olympic all-around champion gymnast Simone Biles were audible. The anguish on Malinin's face as he finished a program that sent him tumbling to eighth was unmistakable. So were the tears.
Malinin, who reached drinking age in the U.S. all of two months ago, thought he had a handle on the attention he commanded.
Turns out, maybe he didn't.
“I think all of this pressure, all of the media and just, you know, being the Olympic gold hopeful was just a lot,” he said. "Too much to handle.”
Sitting a few rows up inside the Milano Ice Skating Arena, Biles — who knows a thing or two about being singed by critics unable or unwilling to see things in their entirety — could empathize: “totally devastated for Ilia,” she later posted on Threads.
Malinin talked afterward about sifting through the rubble in an effort to figure out what happened. He has the benefit of youth. There's a chance by the time he takes the ice in Nice, France, for the 2030 Games, what happened on Friday night will serve as a valuable learning experience.
A ticking clock and a hole in the resume
James may not have the luxury of time.
The 33-year-old Australian snowboarding great dropped into the halfpipe for his fifth Olympics on Friday night, still in search of the one piece of hardware that has eluded the four-time world champion. The lack of an Olympic gold on his resume was, he said before the competition, “ the elephant in the room.”
Over three runs in snowy Livingo, he tried desperately to shed it. He crashed out during his first run. His brilliant second run scored a 93.50. Good, but not quite good enough to top world No. 1 Yuto Totsuka.
James went “full send” on his final trip down the pipe. Knowing something special was required, he pushed himself into uncharted territory, attempting to land a 1620-degree spin only to come up a half-revolution short. Gold was gone — again — and he knew it, raising his red gloves to his helmet as he tried to come to grips with another missed chance, and another long wait to try again.
There were tears afterward, but they weren't just for him.
“My team,” he said, sobbing. “They live this dream with me as well. They have families as well, like me, and they spend a lot of time away from their families, like me. My ‘why’ is to do my best so that it makes it worth it.”
Three Olympic medals like the ones James has — including the silver from Friday he plans to give to his toddler son, Leo — are more than enough for most lifetimes.
Yet the lack of a gold will keep (for now) James pointing toward the French Alps in four years, so long as his body holds up.
A bargain that's ultimately worth it
Inside his sport, his status as one of the GOATs has long been secure. The Olympics prop open the door for the outside world to embrace — and judge — snowboarding. For all of his remarkable success, James' inability to walk all the way through it will stick with him.
Whether that's fair is not for James to decide. It's the bargain every athlete makes with themselves when they come here.
“Heartbreak and victory live right next door," Shiffrin wrote. "Disappointment and gratitude often co-exist.”
The line between the two is incredibly thin. The challenge of landing on the right side of it is what keeps them coming back. Nowhere is that challenge greater than at the Olympics, where the pressure is unyielding and the stakes never higher. There's not another race next week to wipe the slate clean; it's years away.
Finding a way to successfully navigate that pressure is part of the challenge. Perhaps the biggest part. The one that makes an event whose motto is "Faster, Higher, Stronger – Together” so special.
It's why they keep throwing themselves into the breach, laying themselves and their sport bare for all the world to see, fairness be damned.
“May we all champion one another, tread lightly on what we don’t fully comprehend,” Shiffrin said, "and have the fortitude to keep showing up.”

FM Sa'ar to represent Israel at Trump's Washington 'Peace Council' summit

Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar will represent Israel at US President Donald Trump’s Board of Peace summit in Washington on Thursday, a source familiar with the matter told The Jerusalem Post.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu initially accepted the US president’s invitation to join the Board of Peace in January. At the time, the prime minister signed a letter “on behalf of Israel” to “refer to the charter of the Board of Peace.”
“By this communication, I confirm that the said signature is definitive,” the letter signed by Netanyahu read, adding that this constituted “the consent of the State of Israel to be bound by the charter.”
Netanyahu makes Israeli membership to Board of Peace official
This past Wednesday, Netanyahu made Israel’s membership on the Board of Peace official during a meeting with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio at Blair House in Washington.
The Board of Peace initiative was originally designed with the intent of bringing the war in Gaza to a close, but Trump later said that it would resolve conflicts globally.
Before it was confirmed that Sa’ar would represent Israel at the conference, the Prime Minister’s Office noted that Netanyahu would not be in the US this coming week.
On Thursday, the PMO said that Netanyahu would participate remotely in the annual American Israel Public Affairs Committee AIPAC conference and therefore would not be traveling to the US.

From hostages to heritage: Defending Diaspora Judaism's modern world - opinion

On October 7, Israel experienced something unprecedented. An entire nation was psychologically taken hostage.
Hamas did not merely kidnap civilians. It placed the fate of those hostages at the emotional center of Israeli life.
Every debate, military calculation, and public conversation revolved around one imperative: Bring them home.
The country functioned, the army fought, businesses stayed open, and yet emotionally, Israel was frozen. A nation known for resilience felt psychologically immobilized.
Today, yet another hostage crisis is unfolding, and while it is slower and quieter, it is potentially even more dangerous.
A generation of young Jews, in Israel and across the Diaspora, is increasingly being held hostage in a cognitive war fought not with rockets but with narratives, algorithms, identity confusion, and historical erasure.
And unlike the hostages in Gaza, many do not realize that they are captives.
When the ‘why’ disappears
Holocaust survivor and psychiatrist Viktor Frankl famously wrote: “Those who have a ‘why’ to live can bear almost any ‘how.’”
Frankl observed that survival depends less on physical strength than on meaning. Prisoners who retained purpose endured unimaginable suffering; those who lost meaning collapsed.
The lesson applies not only to individuals but also to nations.
Israel’s founding generation knew its why: survival after catastrophe, national rebirth, and a homeland after 2,000 years of exile.
Today, many young people in Israel and abroad struggle to articulate that same purpose, and when the why weakens, resilience weakens with it.
Research over the past decade suggests weakening connections between youth and both Zionist history and Jewish identity, particularly in secular frameworks.
Studies by the Jewish People Policy Institute (JPPI), the Pew Research Center, and the Institute for Jewish Policy Research (IJPR) show declining familiarity with Zionist history, weaker emotional attachment to Israel among younger
Diaspora Jews, and growing discomfort in publicly identifying as Jewish or Zionist in hostile environments.
The result is a generation less equipped to answer a simple but critical question: Why does Israel matter?
The long game our enemies understood
Israel’s adversaries have often played a longer game than Israelis have realized.
The conflict against Israel was never only military. It was demographic, cultural, educational, and psychological. Arab leaders like Gamal Abdel Nasser often spoke of a “long struggle” in which patience and time would ultimately decide the conflict rather than a single decisive battle.
Over decades, their influence has expanded across universities, NGOs, media narratives, and increasingly through digital ecosystems. Social media algorithms reward outrage, reduce complex conflicts into moral binaries, and amplify emotionally charged content.
Cognitive warfare has acquired weapons of mass manipulation. Repeated exposure to distorted narratives reshapes reality itself. Context disappears. Victims become villains. Complexity collapses into slogans.
Young Jews abroad increasingly face environments where Jewish or Zionist identity invites hostility. The result is quiet withdrawal: Better to stay silent, better to disengage.
Resilience erodes quietly.
Education, identity, and strategic vulnerability
Within Israel itself, structural changes also pose long-term challenges.
Debates continue over curriculum and national identity education in increasingly diverse classrooms.
Following a Channel 14 investigation, MK Avi Maoz raised concerns in the Knesset and to the education minister regarding how Arab teachers are increasingly teaching Bible studies in Jewish-sector schools, arguing that sensitive elements of Jewish history and identity may be shaped by educators who do not share the cultural or national framework the curriculum intends to convey.
Individually, none of these trends threatens Israel’s future. But combined with a cognitive war targeting identity and legitimacy, they create strategic vulnerability.
A country that is strong militarily can still weaken psychologically.
October 7 demonstrated how surprise occurs when threats are underestimated. Cognitive warfare carries a similar risk: erosion is unnoticed until consequences are already visible.
New definition of resilience
Israel’s resilience was forged through wars, terror attacks, and isolation. Society absorbed trauma and rebuilt. But cognitive warfare now targets identity itself.
If young people no longer feel connected to their history, if they fear publicly identifying as Jewish, and if Israel becomes emotionally distant rather than personally meaningful, resilience becomes harder to sustain.
The Super Bowl 2026, one of the most-watched sporting events each year, included a commercial paid for by Robert Kraft, a Jewish leader worthy of much praise and appreciation, who reportedly invested some $15 million to address the growing wave of antisemitism in the USA. The commercial quoted a horrifying statistic: “Two in three Jewish teens have experienced antisemitism.”
A Jewish high-school student walking through school hallways finds that other students have secretly affixed a yellow note reading “dirty Jew” to his backpack. A Black student approaches him, places a blue square sticker over the hateful note, and says, “Do not listen to that.”
Resilience cannot be built on ignoring reality or running away from it. Instead, it must be met with courage, not cowardice, and pride, not fear of our identity.
Resilience today must include historical literacy, identity confidence, cultural belonging, and moral clarity about both Jewish and Israel’s existence.
It must be strategically conceived, articulated, and implemented – not merely mentioned at social gatherings.
Leadership beyond governments
Governments alone cannot solve this.
Civilian leaders, educators, media professionals, community institutions, and families shape identity. Identity is built through lived experience, education, storytelling, and communal confidence.
The goal is not propaganda but coherence. Young Jews do not need slogans; they need understanding. Complexity can be taught without surrendering legitimacy. Israel’s imperfections do not erase its moral foundation or historical necessity and responsibilities.
Frankl’s lesson applies again: Meaning sustains resilience.
If young Jews know why their story matters, they can withstand hostile narratives. If they do not, cognitive captivity follows.
Bringing the hostages home –all of them
Israel and the global Jewish community remained committed to bringing home the hostages taken on October 7.
But another rescue mission must begin, that of bringing home a generation drifting away from identity and purpose.
This responsibility is not Israel’s alone. It belongs to Jewish families and communities worldwide. The cognitive war is being fought in classrooms, campuses, media feeds, and conversations at home.
Victory will not be measured by military success alone, but also by whether the next generation stands confidently in its identity and commitments.
When a people loses their “why,” even victory feels hollow, but when our “why” and purpose are clear, resilience follows. And resilience remains the Jewish people’s oldest and strongest defense.
As the saying goes, “Home is where the heart is.” The same is true of our “why.” Reinforcing our individual and collective purpose must begin at home, among family and friends.

A 20-year-old man was shot dead in Nazareth on Saturday, marking the 48th murder in the Arab sector since the start of the year.
The Magen David Adom (MDA) team that responded to the incident was forced to pronounce him dead at the scene.
MDA paramedic Amjad Nikola, who treated the victim, said, “The wounded man was in his vehicle, unconscious, without a pulse and not breathing, with severe gunshot wounds to his body. We conducted medical examinations, but unfortunately, his injuries were critical, and we had no choice but to declare him dead.”
The police later released a statement saying, “The Israel Police have opened an investigation into a shooting incident targeting a person in Nazareth. As a result of the shooting, a man whose identity is still unknown was pronounced dead.”
Police added that officers who were dispatched to the scene began searching for suspects and launched an investigation into the circumstances. The background is believed to be criminal.
Killing marks 48th Arab sector murder in 45 days
This was the 48th murder in Arab society in 45 days, after a record six people were killed in a single day last week.
On Friday, police arrested two residents on suspicion of involvement in a shooting that led to the death of a Tamra resident, Wafa Awad. A preliminary investigation indicated that the incident began as a local dispute in the morning and escalated into deadly gunfire at the victim’s home during the night.
Investigators said a minor dispute between individuals in the city escalated over the course of the day. At night, unidentified suspects arrived and opened fire on the Awad family’s home. The victim, who was standing near a window at the time, was hit in the upper body by bullets that entered the house. Medical teams were forced to pronounce her dead at the scene.
Following the incident, Northern District Commander Meir Eliyahu conducted a situational assessment at the scene and assigned the investigation to the central unit. In an operational effort, two suspects, aged 23 and 36 and residents of the city, were arrested. Police are expected to request an extension of their detention in court on Sunday.

Palo Alto Networks becomes Tel Aviv Stock Exchange's most valued company at $115 billion

The cybersecurity giant Palo Alto Networks announced on Wednesday that it will start a dual listing on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange (TASE), as part of its acquisition of the Israeli cybersecurity platform CyberArk.
With this move, the company would become the most valuable company listed on the Israeli market, with a current market cap of $115 billion.
Palo Alto Networks is a US-based cybersecurity firm founded by Israeli entrepreneur Nir Zuk, which is currently traded only on the American stock market, but will now also have a listing on the TASE.
The listing will also honor CyberArk, with Palo Alto Networks using the ticker CYBR on the TASE instead of its Nasdaq ticker PANW.
"Building on CyberArk's heritage and Israel's position as a global cybersecurity powerhouse, Palo Alto Networks announces its intent to pursue a secondary listing on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange (TASE),” the company said in a statement.
“By adopting the CYBR denomination, we are providing a world-class tribute to the brand CyberArk built while ensuring its identity remains a cornerstone of the global strategy," it added.
Palo Alto Networks will surpass companies like Teva Pharmaceuticals, which has a market cap of $40 billion, and Bank Leumi and Bank Hapoalim, which have market caps of $38.4 billion and $35.3 billion, respectively, on the TASE, according to a report by Globes Israel.
“The choice by a company of this magnitude built on the foundation of groundbreaking Israeli innovation to deepen its local footprint, especially in the current climate, is a powerful testament to the robustness, maturity, and resilience of the Israeli financial ecosystem,” said the TASE in a statement welcoming Palo Alto Networks’ double listing.
Palo Alto Networks' acquisition of CyberArk
According to Globes Israel, the total deal to acquire CyberArk will be worth $21.5 billion, with Palo Alto paying $45 per share of CyberArk and 22005 shares of PANW to stockholders of the Israeli company.
CyberArk’s platform, which will remain available during the initial stage of the acquisition, provides cybersecurity solutions against AI agents and identity-related vulnerabilities. “Existing customers will not experience service disruptions and are expected to benefit from an accelerated development roadmap,” said Palo Alto Networks.
"The emerging wave of AI agents will require us to secure every identity, human, machine, and agent. For our customers, this means the end of 'identity silos.' They can now manage privileged access across their entire hybrid cloud environment from the same company they trust for Network Security and Security Operations," said Nikesh Arora, Chairman and CEO of Palo Alto Networks.
“Our partnership with Palo Alto Networks creates a stronger cybersecurity force than ever before for modern organizations. It’s a win-win: our customers gain access to the most comprehensive suite of security solutions, and our employees join a global technology company that leads the way in innovation,” added Matt Cohen, CEO of CyberArk.

Zelensky, Aliyev discuss energy projects and peace process
According to Ukrinform, the Office of the President of Ukraine stated this on its website.
It was noted that Zelensky expressed gratitude for the recent package of energy support, which included generators and transformers, among other things.
The Ukrainian President informed Aliyev about the overall situation in the energy system and the impact of Russian strikes on infrastructure facilities.
The leaders also discussed the development of bilateral relations and the implementation of energy projects in which Azerbaijan is interested and ready to deepen cooperation.
"Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Ilham Aliyev agreed that their teams will work through all the necessary issues," the Office of the President noted.
During the meeting, the presidents also focused on the negotiation process to achieve peace.
Zelensky emphasized that Ukraine always constructively supports efforts that can help achieve a just peace. "The only reason the war is still ongoing is Russia's unwillingness to end it," he added.
As Ukrinform reported, President Zelensky will participate on Saturday, February 14, in a special session of the Munich Security Conference and hold a series of bilateral meetings. Planned bilateral talks include meetings with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and U.S. Congress senators (separately), NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev, as well as leaders of 18 international investment companies.

Bahrain, Egypt reportedly mediating UAE-Saudi rift
Bahrain and Egypt are attempting to mend ties between the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, two sources told AFP news agency, weeks into a diplomatic rift between the Arab world's most powerful countries.
Saudi Arabia and the UAE had a public falling out in December when the kingdom accused its neighbour of threatening its national security by supporting Yemeni separatists who orchestrated a brief land grab.
A source close to the Saudi government insisted there was "no need for mediation" because direct channels are open between the two countries.
Although Riyadh and Abu Dhabi did not break ties, they have had no high-level diplomatic contact since the last week of December, AFP reported- citing several sources.
"Bahrain is leading mediation efforts between Saudi and the UAE that aim at ending the ongoing misunderstanding," said a Gulf official, who requested anonymity to discuss sensitive matters.
The goal, he said, was to "bridge the gap and bring viewpoints closer".
"It's a Gulf issue and it should be resolved in the Gulf," he said, adding that this was a "Bahraini effort, not a GCC effort", in reference to regional bloc the Gulf Cooperation Council.
This week, Bahraini Crown Prince and Prime Minister Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifa met Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in Riyadh and UAE President Mohamed bin Zayed in Abu Dhabi.
A regional source in the Gulf, who also requested anonymity to speak on sensitive matters, said Egypt was pursuing efforts to end the rift.
"Egypt is playing a sort of mediating role and conveying messages between Saudi Arabia and the UAE," he said.
On January 5, the Saudi foreign minister met his Egyptian counterpart Badr Abdelatty and President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi in Cairo.
The next day, Abdelatty called his Emirati counterpart Abdullah bin Zayed.
Egypt conveyed Saudi messages to the UAE, the source said.
"The Saudi foreign minister discussed in Cairo the details of the crisis with his Egyptian counterpart, who then made calls to his Emirati counterpart," the source added.
The UAE, Saudi Arabia and Bahrain did not respond to the claims.

LUGANSK, February 14. /TASS/. The number of casualties in the Ukrainian strike on the village of Tsentralny in the LPR has risen to 19, according to the republic's Health Minister, Natalya Pashchenko.
Earlier, LPR Head Leonid Pasechnik reported 15 civilian casualties.
"At 2:28 p.m. Moscow time (11:28 a.m. GMT) on the weekend, enemy drones struck the village of Tsentralny in the Perevalsk Municipal District," Pashchenko wrote on her Telegram channel.
"According to the latest data, 19 civilians have sought medical assistance. All of them are residents of the village who were near the landing site or in their homes at the time of the attack."
Among the injured there is a girl born in 2016, who was taken to the Lugansk Republican Children's Clinical Hospital. Three wounded are in serious condition, another six are in moderate condition, and the rest received outpatient care. Some of the wounded were taken to Alchevsk; after their condition stabilizes, they will be transferred to the Lugansk Republican Clinical Hospital.
Medics continue house-to-house visits to identify the injured. Two ambulance crews are on duty on site. The LPR healthcare system has been put on high alert. Russian Health Minister Mikhail Murashko has taken personal control of the situation.
Pasechnik previously reported a massive Ukrainian drone strike on the village of Tsentralny. An emergency response center has been deployed in the Perevalsk District to deal with the aftermath of the attack. Dozens of residential and social facilities were damaged in the village.

Top Indian diplomat says IMEC ‘progressing but not at pace initially expected’
World heading towards greater multipolarity, Subramanyam Jaishankar tells Munich Security Conference
NEW DELHI
The India-Middle East-Europe Corridor (IMEC) is “progressing but not at pace initially expected," Indian External Affairs Ministry Subrahmanyam Jaishankar said on Saturday as he addressed the Munich Security Conference.
IMEC, a multinational railway and maritime project, was announced in 2023 between India, the US, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Israel, France, Germany, Italy, and the EU, aiming to connect India to the Middle East and Europe to enhance trade, provide energy resources, and develop digital connectivity.
Speaking at the panel discussion, "Navigating Uncertainty: India and Germany in a World in Disarray," Jaishankar was asked if IMEC is progressing.
"Answer is kind of yes. But not at the pace at which people initially expected it to, which is understandable, because there was a big conflict going on in the Middle East, and everybody's attention was on that conflict,"Jaishankar said.
There is a "big European and Indian interest" in the IMEC, he said, adding that the "purpose of the IMEC is really to address connectivity, logistics issues, and improve the economy…the purpose of the IMEC is not to solve the Palestinian issue."
Noting that the world is "heading towards greater multipolarity," the Indian minister said “there will be many more independent or autonomous centers of decision-making."
The world order, he said, suffered "a series of shocks" over the past five years and it "accelerated" changes in that order.
The COVID-19 "was a shock, the conflict in Ukraine was a shock. What's happening in the Middle East was a shock ... even in Europe, some years ago, Brexit was a shock," he said.
To another question whether India's weaning off Russian oil under the recently announced India-US trade pact impacts its strategic autonomy, Jaishankar said: "We are very much wedded to strategic autonomy. Because it's very much a part of our history and our evolution."
“Where the energy issues are concerned, look, this is today a complex market," he said. "I think oil companies in India, as in Europe, as probably in other parts of the world, look at availability, look at costs, look at risks, and take the decisions that they feel is in their best interest."

US ocean regulator faces criticism over changes to right whale protection rule
The U.S.’s ocean regulator plans to make industry-friendly changes to a longstanding rule designed to protect vanishing whales
- Bookmark
The U.S.'s ocean regulator plans to make industry-friendly changes to a longstanding rule designed to protect vanishing whales, prompting criticism from environmental groups who cite the recent death of an endangered whale.
The rules protect the North Atlantic right whale, which numbers less than 400 and lives off the East Coast. The giant animals are protected by a vessel speed rule that requires large ships to slow down at certain times to avoid collisions, which is a leading cause of death for the whales.
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said in a Thursday statement to The Associated Press that it plans to soon announce proposed new rules designed to “modernize” the whale protections. The proposal will be a “deregulatory-focused action” that will seek to “reduce unnecessary regulatory and economic burdens while ensuring responsible conservation practices for endangered North Atlantic right whales,” the statement said.
A notice of rulemaking about the right whale rules is listed on the U.S. Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs website, but it does not include any details about the proposal. NOAA said in its statement that more information about the rules was forthcoming and that the agency was focused on “implementing new technologies, engineering approaches, and other advanced tools” to protect the whales.
Several environmental groups criticized the move away from vessel speed rules. Some cited the Feb. 10 confirmation of the death of a 3-year-old female whale off Virginia. The cause of the animal's death was not yet determined, but it died at a far younger age than typical.
“Another female right whale — the future of this species — has lost her life. We urgently need more right whale protections, not fewer. The Trump administration’s apparent determination to weaken the vessel speed rule could not come at a worse time,” said Jane Davenport, senior attorney at conservation group Defenders of Wildlife.
Right whales migrate every year from calving grounds off Florida and Georgia to feeding grounds off New England and Canada. Along the way, they are vulnerable to collisions with ships and entanglement in commercial fishing gear. They were once numerous off the East Coast but were decimated during the commercial whaling era and have been federally protected for decades.
The Biden administration planned to expand slow zones off the East Coast to protect the whales. It also planned to expand the classes of boats required to slow down. However, the federal government withdrew the proposal in the final days of the administration, with officials saying it didn't have time to finalize the regulations due to the scope and volume of public comments.
Some shipping businesses and other marine industries have long pushed back at vessel speed rules. The National Marine Manufacturers Association has described speed restrictions as “archaic” and advocated for solutions that rely on technology.

Italy says remains committed to implement Gaza peace plan, reconstruction
Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani reiterates attempts to annex Palestinian territories 'unacceptable'
LONDON
Italy's foreign minister on Saturday said Rome will continue its commitment to implement the Gaza peace plan and reconstruction of the Palestinian enclave also involving the Italian private sector.
Antonio Tajani attended a meeting together with European and regional partners on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference in Germany with the attendance of Palestinian Foreign Minister Varsen Aghabekian Shahin.
"The reconstruction of #Gaza was the focus of today's meeting in #Munich," he wrote on the US social media platform X.
He said Italy is on the front line with a $60 million plan for humanitarian aid, demining activities, strengthening health and education facilities, renovating housing for displaced persons, and more broadly supporting Palestinian institutions.
"We will continue our commitment to implementing the Peace Plan and rebuilding the Strip, involving also our private sector," said Tajani.
The foreign minister noted that the key goal now is to maintain the ceasefire, which was reached in October, "whereas the endgame is to have the conditions for a Two-State solution" to the Israel-Palestine conflict.
"This is why we deem unacceptable any attempt to annex Palestinian territories," he added.
Israel killed more than 71,000 people in Gaza over a period of two years, starting in October 2023, almost leveling it to the ground.

American Jordan Stolz wins 2nd speedskating gold at Winter Olympics
Jordan Stolz won his 2nd Olympic speedskating gold medal on Saturday, becoming the first American since 1980 to win two gold medals in the sport.
He placed first in the 500-meter event. He previously earned a gold medal in the 1,000-meter event, marking the first time an American medaled in the race since 2010.
Stolz will compete in two more events in Milan: The 1,500-meter race on Thursday and the mass start next Saturday. Stolz previously told CBS News that he expects his future events to be "some of the best races I've had all year."
"That's what I'm looking for," Stolz said on Wednesday.
Stolz has set a number of speedskating records. He holds the record for fastest 1,000-meter skate and is a two-time world champion at the distance. He went 5-for-5 in the World Cup circuit this season in the same event.
He also skates professionally for the Dutch speedskating team, Albert Heijn Zaanlander. Speedskating is a popular sport in the Netherlands. Stolz told CBS News before the Milan Cortina Winter Games that he hopes to help bring speedskating to the U.S.
He previously competed at the Beijing Games in 2022 as a 17-year-old, where he came in 14th in the 1,000 and 13th in the 500.

Epstein files show former Trump advisor corresponding over ways to undermine pope
Newly released documents show Steve Bannon discussing strategies with Jeffrey Epstein in 2019 and declaring he would ‘take down’ the pontiff
ISTANBUL
The newest Jeffrey Epstein files release includes messages dating from 2019 from former White House adviser Steve Bannon with the convicted sex offender about ways he could work to undermine Pope Francis.
CNN on Saturday reported that the correspondence, disclosed as part of a recent document dump, indicates that Bannon saw Francis -- who died in 2025 -- as a key ideological opponent to his nationalist-populist agenda and sought support from Epstein in advancing efforts against him.
In one June 2019 message, Bannon wrote: “Will take down (Pope) Francis,” adding, “The Clintons, (Chinese President) Xi, Francis, EU -- come on brother.”
CNN reported that the exchanges included discussions about French journalist Frederic Martel’s controversial book In the Closet of the Vatican, which examines secrecy and power within the Catholic Church.
Bannon suggested Epstein, who died in jail in August 2019, could serve as executive producer for a potential film adaptation, writing: “You are now exec producer of ‘ITCOTV’ (In the closet of the Vatican).” Martel told CNN he believed Bannon wanted to “instrumentalize” the book in his campaign against the pope.
Though no longer an advisor to US President Donald Trump, Bannon hosts a podcast and remains influential in circles close to the president.
‘Catholics must choose’
The files show Epstein emailing himself references to the book and sharing articles critical of Francis, while Bannon replied to one headline, “Pope Francis or Steve Bannon? Catholics must choose,” with “easy choice.”
Austen Ivereigh, a biographer of the late pope, said Bannon appeared to misunderstand both the book and Francis’ leadership, while Rev. Antonio Spadaro, a Vatican official close to the pontiff, told CNN the messages suggested an attempt to merge “spiritual authority with political power for strategic ends,” and added:
“What those messages reveal is not merely hostility toward a pontiff, but a deeper attempt to instrumentalize faith as a weapon -- precisely the temptation he sought to disarm.”
The exchanges occurred years after Epstein’s 2008 conviction for child sex offenses and shortly before his later arrest on sex trafficking charges.
CNN reported that Epstein’s replies also included provocative remarks, quoting John Milton’s Paradise Lost: “Better to reign in Hell, than serve in Heaven.”

India’s Suryakumar shrugs off rain threat to Pakistan T20 World Cup game
Pakistan on Monday reversed their decision to boycott their T20 World Cup match against India, but rain could intervene.
Indian captain Suryakumar Yadav said his players are not concerned about the threat of rain for Sunday’s Twenty20 World Cup clash with Pakistan, adding that the defending champions are focused on preparing for the showdown between bitter rivals.
Pakistan had initially boycotted the Group A fixture in Colombo over Bangladesh’s removal from the tournament for refusing to play in India over security concerns, but reversed their decision on Monday.

But weather forecasts have warned of heavy rain between Sunday afternoon and evening, casting new doubts over the match.
“Weather is something which is not in our control,” Suryakumar told reporters on Saturday.
No complacency from India against Pakistan
He said the clash would not be a routine game for the co-hosts.
“When you play an India vs Pakistan game it’s more about the occasion. It’s a big platform, obviously. No matter how many times you say, it’s just another game … It’s human tendency, you know which game you’re about to play,” the 35-year-old said.
“Whatever we have worked hard on and practised, we try to execute them in the game.”
India and Pakistan have both won two games each in the tournament. While Pakistan played both their games in Colombo due to an agreement that they would play each other only on neutral venues, India arrived after a win over Namibia on Thursday.
Suryakumar said India would not be disadvantaged by unfamiliarity with the ground.
“We have similar wickets back home, and we’ve played a lot of cricket here during bilaterals against Sri Lanka, so we’re also very familiar with the conditions,” he said.
India and Pakistan most recently faced off in last year’s Asia Cup, where India won all three of their meetings, including the final.
“You can’t carry history into the ground, because it can cause complacency,” Suryakumar said.
India ready for Pakistan’s ‘out of syllabus’ Tariq
India have carried out preparations to face Usman Tariq, a spinner with an unorthodox action, who took three wickets for Pakistan during Tuesday’s win over the United States.
Pakistan captain Salman Ali Agha said earlier on Saturday that Tariq was a trump card against India.
“At an exam, when there’s an out-of-syllabus question, we can’t just skip it; we have to try something to tackle it,” Suryakumar said about Tariq.
“We practise with similar bowlers, with similar actions. We’ll try to execute what we practise in the net sessions.”
Salman had also expressed hope that Indian opener Abhishek Sharma, who is the highest-ranked batter in the 20-over format, will play on Sunday after missing the previous game due to illness.
“All right, if (Salman) wants him to play, then we’ll play him tomorrow,” Suryakumar said about Sharma.

Assailants kill at least 30 in northwest Nigeria villages, residents say

MAIDUGURI, Nigeria, Feb 14 - Armed assailants on motorbikes killed at least 30 people and burned houses and shops during raids on three villages in northwest Nigeria's Niger State early on Saturday, residents who escaped the violence told Reuters.
The attacks on villages in the Borgu Local Government Area, near the border with Benin Republic, are part of a surge in attacks blamed on "bandits," who have carried out deadly assaults, abductions for ransom, and displaced communities across northern Nigeria.
Insecurity is a pressing concern in Nigeria and the government is under mounting pressure to restore stability.
Wasiu Abiodun, Niger State police spokesperson, confirmed the attack in one of the villages.
"Suspected bandits invaded Tunga-Makeri village … six persons lost their lives, some houses were also set ablaze, and a yet-to-be ascertained number of persons were abducted," Abiodun said.
He added that the assailants had moved on to Konkoso village, while details of other attacks remained unclear.
Jeremiah Timothy, a resident of Konkoso who fled to a nearby locality, said the attack on his village began in the early hours with sporadic gunfire.
"At least 26 people were killed so far in the village after they set the police station ablaze," said Timothy, adding that the attackers entered Konkoso around 6 a.m. (0500 GMT), shooting indiscriminately.
He said residents heard military jets flying overhead.
Another witness who requested anonymity, said the attackers, riding more than 200 motorbikes, swept through the area targeting the villages.
Auwal Ibrahim, a resident of Tunga-Makeri, recounted the early-morning assault on his village at approximately 0200 GMT.
"The bandits stormed our town around 3:00 a.m. (local time), riding so many motorcycles while shooting sporadically, beheading six people and killing others. They set shops on fire and forced the whole village to flee," Ibrahim said.
He added that many villagers fear returning as the gunmen remain nearby. REUTERS

Nancy Guthrie kidnapping investigation draws scrutiny as case drags on
-
Click here to listen to this article - Share via
- Authorities face mounting criticism for how the Pima County Sheriff’s Department has handled the abduction of Nancy Guthrie, with experts calling it “a debacle” marked by mishandled evidence.
- The Sheriff’s Department released Guthrie’s home as a crime scene a day after she was reported missing, allowing reporters and delivery workers to contaminate vital evidence.
- An initial suspect was detained and released without charges; the FBI has since doubled its reward to $100,000 and fielded more than 13,000 tips.
Nancy Guthrie had been missing less than three days when family members and reporters, and even an Amazon delivery worker, could be seen wandering onto her property, with drops of her blood still staining the front entryway.
It’s been nearly two weeks since the 84-year-old mother of “Today” host Savannah Guthrie was abducted. With no suspects in custody as of Saturday, scrutiny is growing over how authorities have handled the case.
Some questions have focused on Pima County (Ariz.) Sheriff Chris Nanos and his department, which was the first to respond when Guthrie was reported missing from her Tucson home Feb. 1. Since then, Nanos has been the leading law enforcement communicator on the investigation, including after reports emerged of ransom notes demanding millions of dollars in cryptocurrency for Guthrie’s return.
The global spotlight is now on him.
“I’m not used to everyone hanging on to my every word and then holding me accountable for what I say,” Nanos said at a news conference early in the probe. “This is really, for me, pretty new.”
Critics pointed out his department opened up the crime scene a day after Guthrie was reported missing and sent vital evidence across the country to be analyzed for free, and the sheriff was seen at a weekend college basketball game while a ransom deadline still hung over the family.
President Trump has even weighed in on the issue.
“It was a local case originally, and they didn’t want to let go of it, which is fine,” Trump said when asked about the case at the White House on Friday. “It’s up to them, it’s really up to the community, but ultimately where the FBI got involved, I think, you know, progress has been made.”
The case took another bizarre turn Wednesday morning when TMZ announced that the outlet received a letter demanding a payment of one bitcoin — about $67,000 — in exchange for the name of Guthrie’s kidnapper.
Guthrie was discovered missing after she didn’t show up at a friend’s house to watch a church service. She was taken from her home without any of her heart medication, and it’s unclear how long she can survive without it.
Though she initially was considered missing, the urgency to quickly find Guthrie pulsed through the first days of media coverage because of her heart condition. So it came as a surprise to some observers that just a day after she’d been reported missing, Nanos declared the crime scene clear and released the home back to the family.
Forensic workers had processed the ranch-style home for evidence, including DNA and fingerprints, but could not recover images from a camera because the family did not pay for a subscription to back up the recordings, Nanos said.
Afterward, as the home stood unguarded, reporters, photographers and others wandered the property, walking to the front door and capturing video of blood drops along the porch.
The crime scene eventually was closed again so the FBI could conduct its own search, and Nanos told reporters opening the scene up the first time may have been premature.
“Monday morning quarterback. Absolutely. I probably could have held off on that,” Nanos said at a news conference, with top FBI agents flanking him.
Sheriff‘s deputies eventually were stationed outside the home, but even so, a pizza delivery driver walked food that had been ordered for someone in the neighborhood up to the door of the Guthrie home. On Friday, a company showed up to service Guthrie’s backyard pool, which was accommodated at the “request of the Guthrie family,” the Sheriff’s Department said.
Breaks in the investigation have come in fits and starts.
Investigators believe someone will recognize the intruder through their clothing, gait or appearance, giving the case crucial momentum after days with few leads.
After searching the home last week, FBI technicians have been processing evidence from in and around it. Testing revealed the blood drops outside the door belonged to Guthrie.
Then, a series of ransom notes arrived in the tip boxes of two Tucson television stations and TMZ, seeking $4 million and $6 million in bitcoin, and included details about Guthrie’s home.
The fact that law enforcement announced Guthrie disappeared and then publicly gave credence to reports she was being held for ransom put authorities at a disadvantage, said Adam Bercovici, who has worked multiple kidnappings as the former supervisor of the Los Angeles Police Department’s special investigations unit.
“It is a debacle,” he said. “This kidnapping is one of the worst cases of incompetence I have seen.”
With so much information floating around, Bercovici said, it would be difficult to verify a legitimate ransom demand. Indeed, not long after news about the ransom notes broke, officials said a man in Hawthorne sent an imposter demand to the Guthries. He has been charged with a federal crime.
Much is still unknown about the details inside the investigation and exactly what evidence detectives have collected. Because of this, it will take time to fully assess their tactics and truly understand the complexity of the case.
The first big break in the case came Tuesday, when the FBI released surveillance videos of someone approaching Guthrie’s door wearing a holstered gun, ski mask and backpack. The videos, recovered by Google engineers, provided the first look at Guthrie’s kidnapper and last less than a minute. More than 4,000 tips flooded law enforcement agencies in the 24 hours after the images were broadcast.
By the following evening, sheriff‘s investigators were detaining a 36-year-old man after a traffic stop south of Tucson. Sheriff’s officials announced they obtained a court-approved search warrant for his Rio Rico home, immediately raising expectations among those closely watching the case.
But those hopes soon were deflated.
Surrounded by the throng of cameras and reporters, investigators and FBI forensic technicians swarmed the man’s home. His mother-in-law, under the glare of camera lights, declared him innocent, saying she didn’t know who Savannah Guthrie was, and told them “you won’t find anything here, we have nothing to hide.”
By the next morning, the man was free and his house cleared of investigators. The Times is not naming him because he has not been arrested or accused of any wrongdoing.
“I hope they get the suspect because I am not it,” the man told reporters. “And they better do their job and find the suspect that did it so they can clear my name.”
On Friday night, authorities served a search warrant at a home in Tucson and swarmed a parked Range Rover. In the end, officials said no arrests were made.
Investigators are casting an even wider net to find photos, videos and any other clues. Other people in the area should expect to be detained and questioned, Nanos told local station KOLD.
On Thursday, authorities revealed a series of images of men in the dark with backpacks near cars and homes. About two miles from the Guthrie home, investigators discovered a glove on the ground, then several others farther from the home, the Sheriff’s Department announced Friday. They’ll all be analyzed for DNA in hopes it leads to the 84-year-old grandmother. The department said other DNA found at the home did not match Guthrie or anyone in close contact with her, and investigators are working to identify who it belongs to.
Meanwhile, the FBI doubled its reward for information this week to $100,000 and released a description of the person seen at her front door.
“The suspect is described as a male, approximately 5’9” - 5’10” tall, with an average build. In the video, he is wearing a black, 25-liter ‘Ozark Trail Hiker Pack’ backpack,” the bureau said. More than 13,000 tips have flowed into the bureau.
On Friday, the Sheriff’s Department sought to quash rumors that there was a divide between local and federal investigators, centered on the handling of evidence and which lab it should be sent to.
“Our strong partnership is critical, and we remain fully committed to this collaborative investigation. To ensure consistency and streamline testing, evidence requiring forensic analysis is being sent to the same out-of-state lab that has been utilized since the beginning of this case,” the Pima County Sheriff’s Department said in a statement. “This decision was discussed with and agreed upon by local FBI leadership.”
But Nanos himself expressed frustration about the pace of the probe.
“It’s exhausting, these ups and downs. But we will keep moving forward,” he told the New York Times. “Maybe it’s an hour from now. Maybe it’s weeks or months or years from now. But we won’t quit. We’re going to find Nancy. We’re going to find this guy.”

USA and Europe are part of the same civilization; we must build new Western Century together - Secretary of State Rubio in Munich
The criticism and advice that the United States and President Donald Trump are directing toward Europe may seem too blunt and insistent, but they are driven by a desire to preserve the shared future of Western civilization, of which both Europe and the United States are a part, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said, according to an Interfax-Ukraine correspondent.
He said speaking at the Munich Security Conference on Saturday that the fate of Europe will never be a matter of indifference to them, adding that they are defending a great civilization that must be in charge of its own destiny. He also said that it is advisable to think about how to advance their interests together, in other words to build a new Western Century.
Rubio noted that the United States will always be a child of Europe; they are connected not only militarily, but also economically and culturally.
At the same time, the Secretary of State called for an honest approach to our shared heritage and an acknowledgement of the mistakes made in relation to free and unrestricted trade, which was abused by other countries, deindustrialization, ineffective "green" policies, and the outsourcing of nationally important functions, which resulted in Western countries becoming dependent on others and vulnerable to crises. The Secretary of State identified mass migration as one such crisis, threatening the unity of Western societies, the continuity of their cultures, and the future of their peoples.
He called for joint reindustrialization of the economy, the construction of Western supply chains for critical materials, a joint fight for market share in the Global South, and the development of commercial spaceflight and artificial intelligence.
Rubio also stated that the so-called world order cannot be placed above national interests. He argued that global institutions do not need to be dismantled, but they must be reformed and restored.
As an example, he cited the UN, which has failed to resolve the wars in Gaza, Ukraine, and Iran, while the United States has achieved success on these issues, although it has still not ended Russia’s war against Ukraine.
“We increasingly outsourced our sovereignty to international institutions while many nations invested in massive welfare states at the cost of maintaining the ability to defend themselves. This, even as other countries have invested in the most rapid military buildup in all of human history and have not hesitated to use hard power to pursue their own interests,” the State Secretary believes.
According to him, Washington wants Europe to be strong because this strengthens the United States.
“In a perfect world, all of these problems and more would be solved by diplomats and strongly worded resolutions. But we do not live in a perfect world, and we cannot continue to allow those who blatantly and openly threaten our citizens and endanger our global stability to shield themselves behind abstractions of international law which they themselves routinely violate,” Rubio stressed.
He added that this is the path that President Trump and the United States have embarked on, and it is the path that Europe is being asked to join.
“We in America have no interest in being polite and orderly caretakers of the West’s managed decline. We do not seek to separate, but to revitalize an old friendship and renew the greatest civilization in human history,” the Secretary of State summed up.

Egyptian woman faces death threats for filming alleged harasser

Egyptian woman faces death threats for filming alleged harasser
A young Egyptian woman is facing death threats after posting a video showing the face of a man she says repeatedly harassed her, reviving debate over how victims are treated in the country.
Mariam Shawky, an actress in her twenties, filmed the man aboard a crowded Cairo bus earlier this week, accusing him of stalking and harassing her near her workplace on multiple occasions.
"This time, he followed me on the bus," Shawky, who has been dubbed "the bus girl" by local media, said in a clip posted on TikTok.
"He kept harassing me," added the woman, who did not respond publicly following the release of the video.
Hoping other passengers would intervene, Shawky instead found herself isolated. The video shows several men at the back of the bus staring at her coldly as she confronts her alleged harasser.
The man mocks her appearance, calls her "trash", questions her clothing and moves towards her in what appears to be a threatening manner.
No one steps in to help. One male passenger, holding prayer beads, orders her to sit down and be quiet, while another gently restrains the man but does not defend Shawky.
Death threats
As the video spread across social media, the woman received a brief flurry of support, but it was quickly overwhelmed by a torrent of abuse.
Some high-profile public figures fuelled the backlash.
Singer Hassan Shakosh suggested she had provoked the situation by wearing a piercing, saying it was "obvious what she was looking for".
Online, the comments were more extreme. "I'll be the first to kill you," one user wrote. "If you were killed, no one would mourn you," said another.
The case has revived a longstanding national debate in Egypt over harassment and violence against women.
A 2013 UN study found that 99.3 percent of Egyptian women reported experiencing harassment, with more than 80 percent saying they faced it regularly on public transport.
That same year, widespread protests against sexual violence rocked the Egyptian capital.
In 2014, a law criminalising street harassment was passed. However, progress since then has been limited. Enforcement remains inconsistent and authorities have never released figures on the number of convictions.
Public concern spiked after previous high-profile incidents, including the 2022 killing of university student Nayera Ashraf, stabbed to death by a man whose advances she had rejected.
The perpetrator was executed, yet at the time "some asked for his release," said prominent Egyptian feminist activist Nadeen Ashraf, whose social-media campaigning helped spark Egypt's MeToo movement in 2020.
Denials
In the latest case, the authorities moved to act even though the bus company denied any incident had taken place in a statement later reissued by the Ministry of Transport.
The Interior Ministry said that the man seen in the video had been "identified and arrested" the day after the clip went viral.
Confronted with the footage, he denied both the harassment and ever having met the woman before, according to the ministry.
Local media reported he was later released on bail of 1,000 Egyptian pounds (around $20), before being detained again over a pre-existing loan case.
His lawyer has called for a psychiatric evaluation of Shawky, accusing her of damaging Egypt's reputation.
These images tell "the whole world that there are harassers in Egypt and that Egyptian men encourage harassment, defend it and remain silent", said lawyer Ali Fayez on Facebook.
Ashraf told AFP news agency that the case revealed above all "a systemic and structural problem".
She said such incidents were "never taken seriously" and that blame was almost always shifted onto women's appearance.
"If the woman is veiled, they'll say her clothes are tight. And if her hair is uncovered, they'll look at her hair. And even if she wears a niqab, they'll say she's wearing makeup."
"There will always be something."

Five European countries, including Britain, France and Germany, accused Russia on Saturday of having poisoned jailed opposition figure Alexei Navalny with a rare and lethal toxin in 2024, speaking on the margins of the Munich Security Conference, as the United Kingdom, Sweden, France, Germany and Netherlands said in a joint statement that analyses of samples from Navalny’s body left them confident he had been poisoned, following the death of the outspoken critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin in an Arctic prison in February 2024 while he was serving a 19-year sentence. France24 correspondent Nick Holdsworth reports from Munich.

Russia poisoned Alexei Navalny with dart frog toxin, European nations say
Epibatidine, a deadly chemical not found naturally in Russia, was detected in samples taken from the body of the late Putin critic
Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny was poisoned by the Kremlin with a rare and lethal toxin found in the skin of poison dart frogs, five European countries said on Saturday.
The foreign ministries of the UK, France, Germany, Sweden and the Netherlands said analysis of samples taken from Navalny’s body “conclusively confirmed the presence of epibatidine”.
It is a neurotoxin found in the skin of dart frogs in South America that is not found naturally in Russia, they said.
A joint statement said: “Russia had the means, motive and opportunity to administer this poison.”
They five countries said they were reporting Russia to the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons for a breach of the Chemical Weapons Convention.
The announcement came as Navalny’s widow, Yulia Navalnaya, attended the Munich Security Conference in Germany as the second anniversary of Navalny’s death approaches.

India Orders 288 Anti-Aircraft Missiles for S-400 Air Defense Systems from Russia

The Indian Defense Procurement Council has approved the purchase of 288 anti-aircraft missiles for the S-400 Triumph systems, which the country previously purchased from Russia.
This was reported by the Hindustan Times.
According to the publication’s sources, the deal covers the purchase of 120 short-range missiles and 168 long-range missiles.
The total cost of purchasing this number of missiles is 10,000 crore rupees (about $1.2 billion).
After analyzing the results of Operation Sindur and considering the experience of combat clashes with Pakistani forces, the Indian government decided to significantly expand its air defense network.
The Indian Air Force plans to purchase five more S-400 Triumph anti-aircraft missile systems, which will create a dense protective dome over strategically important regions of the country.
In addition to long-range systems, India is focusing on protecting critical infrastructure and military airfields. To this end, the authorities are considering the purchase of short-range Pantsir-M anti-aircraft missile and gun systems.
It should be noted that despite these plans, as of today, the Indian government and the Ministry of Defense have faced delays in receiving S-400 anti-aircraft missile systems. This is directly related to the war in Ukraine and Russia’s urgent need for these systems.
During a bilateral meeting between Indian Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and Russian Defence Minister Andrei Belousov in 2025, they discussed new deadlines for the transfer of S-400 air defense systems — 2026–2027. This is the second postponement, as the transfer of the last two batteries of the complex was to be completed by April 2023.
It should be recalled that in 2021, India began deploying the first regimental set of S-400 air defense missile systems in the Punjab sector to counter Pakistani aviation.
In total, India ordered five divisions of these systems from Russia, but their delivery has become a constant problem due to numerous delays, which, according to Indian sources, has negatively affected the country’s defense capabilities amid growing external threats.

US military preparing for potentially weeks-long Iran operations

- The US military is preparing for sustained, weeks-long operations against Iran, significantly escalating potential conflict with major troop and naval deployments.
- Diplomacy is ongoing, but President Trump openly suggested regime change in Iran and stated all options remain on the table.
- Experts warn of greater risks to US forces, significant Iranian retaliation, and potential regional conflict due to Iran's missile arsenal.

WASHINGTON - The US military is preparing for the possibility of sustained, weeks-long operations against Iran if President Donald Trump orders an attack, two US officials told Reuters, in what could become a far more serious conflict than previously seen between the countries.
The disclosure by the officials – who spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitive nature of the planning – raises the stakes for the diplomacy under way between the United States and Iran.
US envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner will hold negotiations with Iran on Feb 17 in Geneva, with representatives from Oman acting as mediators.
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio cautioned on Feb 14 that while Mr Trump’s preference was to reach a deal with Tehran, “that’s very hard to do”.
Meanwhile, Mr Trump has amassed military forces in the region, raising fears of new military action.
US officials said on Feb 13 the Pentagon was sending an additional aircraft carrier
Mr Trump, speaking to US troops on Feb 13 at a base in North Carolina, openly floated the possibility of regime change in Iran, saying it “seems like that would be the best thing that could happen”.
He declined to share who he wanted to take over Iran, but said “there are people”.
“For 47 years, they’ve been talking and talking and talking,” Mr Trump said.
Mr Trump has long voiced scepticism about sending ground troops into Iran, saying in 2025 “the last thing you want to do is ground forces”, and the kinds of US firepower arrayed in the Middle East so far suggest options for strikes primarily by air and naval forces.
In Venezuela, Mr Trump demonstrated a willingness to rely also on special operations forces to seize that country’s president, Nicolas Maduro, in a January raid.
Asked for comment on the preparations for a potentially sustained US military operation, White House spokesperson Anna Kelly said: “President Trump has all options on the table with regard to Iran.”
“He listens to a variety of perspectives on any given issue, but makes the final decision based on what is best for our country and national security,” Ms Kelly said.
The Pentagon declined to comment.
The US sent two aircraft carriers to the region in 2025, when it carried out strikes against Iranian nuclear sites.
However, June’s “Midnight Hammer” operation
Risks increasing
In a sustained campaign, the US military could hit Iranian state and security facilities, not just nuclear infrastructure, one of the officials said. The official declined to provide specific detail.
Experts say the risks to US forces would be far greater in such an operation against Iran, which boasts a formidable arsenal of missiles. Retaliatory Iranian strikes also increase the risk of a regional conflict.
The same official said the US fully expected Iran to retaliate, leading to back-and-forth strikes and reprisals over a period of time.
The White House and Pentagon did not respond to questions about the risks of retaliation or regional conflict.
Mr Trump has repeatedly threatened to bomb Iran over its nuclear and ballistic missile programmes and crushing of internal dissent. On Feb 12, he warned the alternative to a diplomatic solution would “be very traumatic, very traumatic”.
Iran’s Revolutionary Guards have warned that in case of strikes on Iranian territory, they could retaliate against any US military base.
The US maintains bases throughout the Middle East, including in Jordan, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates and Turkey.

Democratic senators launch inquiry into EPA’s repeal of key air pollution enforcement measure

More than three dozen Democratic senators have begun an independent inquiry into the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) following a huge change in how the agency measures the health benefits of reducing air pollution that is widely seen as a major setback to US efforts to combat the climate crisis.
In a regulatory impact analysis, the EPA said it would stop assigning a monetary value to the health benefits associated with regulations on fine particulate matter and ozone. The agency argued that the estimates contain too much uncertainty.
Previously, the EPA placed a dollar figure on the benefits of cleaner air, factoring in outcomes such as fewer premature deaths and reduced illness, including asthma attacks.
The 2009 endangerment finding determined that greenhouse gases threaten public health and welfare and should therefore be controlled by the EPA. By revoking it on Thursday, officials eliminated the legal foundation enabling the government to control planet-heating pollution.
The senators criticized the updated policy as “particularly troubling” and said the repeal “destroys that framework and results in a failure to faithfully execute EPA’s statutory mandate to protect human health”, according to a letter sent to the EPA on Thursday.
The effort is being led by the ranking member of the Senate committee on the environment and public works, Sheldon Whitehouse. The lawmakers have asked the EPA to provide documents and details explaining how it reached its decision by 26 February.
Senate Democrats are seeking to know the reasoning behind the EPA’s move; what factors the agency will consider when carrying out Clean Air Act rule-making; whether it has considered no longer quantifying health effects for other pollutants; and whether it consulted any outside parties, including the secretary of health and human services, the US surgeon general, or public health specialists.
“It is literally zero surprise that they knew their hand-picked climate deniers weren’t putting out real science,” Whitehouse wrote on X in response to an article suggesting the Trump administration ignored the recommendations of scientists. “Their nonsense has never been real, but part of a fraudulent propaganda campaign, designed by fossil fuel to protect its ‘free-to-pollute’ business model.”
The repeal is part of Trump’s sweeping attacks on US climate policy. On Thursday, he said the endangerment finding formed “the basis for the green new scam”. Since returning to office last January, the Trump administration has taken aggressive steps to roll back pollution regulations and promote fossil fuel production. Critics argue that this anti-environmental agenda benefits the president’s fossil fuel-industry donors.
Trump’s decision drew broad condemnation from climate scientists and advocates focused on environmental protection, public health and economic justice. Asked on Thursday to address environmental concerns about the new rule, Trump said: “Don’t worry about it.”
“This has nothing to do with public health,” he said of the endangerment finding. “This is all a scam, a giant scam.”

Trump’s communications chief uses derogatory slur in rant against lawmakers over the Epstein files
Steven Cheung used the slur against lawmakers Ro Khanna and Thomas Massie

White House Communications Director Steven Cheung called two lawmakers the R-word, a slur long used to demean people with disabilities, in a social media post shared Friday evening.
Cheung called Democratic Representative Ro Khanna and Republican Representative Thomas Massie “some of the dumbest r****** ever to be in Congress.”
“They knowingly and willfully ruined the lives of innocent people who had nothing to do with [Jeffrey] Epstein,” Cheung wrote on X.
This isn’t the first time a Trump administration official — or the president himself — has used the slur in recent months.
President Donald Trump called Minnesota Governor Tim Walz “seriously r*******” in a Truth Social post on November 27. Harmeet Dhillon, the Justice Department’s assistant attorney general for civil rights, used the slur in an X post on December 28.
The Independent has contacted the White House, Khanna and Massie for comment.
Cheung’s statement came in response to a post from investigative journalist Jacqueline Sweet. She reported for The Guardian that four men Khanna named in a recent House floor speech about Epstein had no apparent ties to the dead sex offender.
“Reps Khanna and Massie pushed the DOJ to unredact a file in the Epstein files. Then Khanna read four men's names from it in a House floor speech, calling them ‘wealthy and powerful men that the DOJ hid for no apparent reason,’” Sweet wrote on X.
“The only problem is that file is a SDNY photo lineup, and the 16 people on it have no known ties to Epstein, the DOJ confirmed,” she added. “We identified 12 of the people on the list, and spoke to two of the men Khanna named, who denied any connection to Epstein and were seeking answers as to why their names were in the news.”
A spokesperson for Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche confirmed the file is a photo lineup, The Guardian reports.
“Rep Ro Khanna and Rep Thomas Massie forced the unmasking of completely random people selected years ago for an FBI lineup – men and women. These individuals have NOTHING to do with Epstein or Maxwell,” the spokesperson told the outlet.
Being mentioned in the Epstein files does not in itself imply wrongdoing.
Khanna said he appreciates Sweet’s reporting confirming the four men were “just part of a photo line up and are not connected to Epstein's crimes.”
“I wish DOJ had provided that explanation earlier instead of redacting then unredacting their names. They have failed to protect survivors, created confusion for innocent men, and have protected rich and powerful abusers. We must have full transparency and the truth,” he wrote on X.
Massie responded directly to Sweet’s post: “I told DOJ on Monday this might be a lineup, and if so, they should explain that. How long did it take DOJ to figure it out after I told them?”
The Republican lawmaker also responded to Cheung, writing, “Sorry about your Sultan bro.” He included a screenshot of a Wall Street Journal article detailing the resignation of DP World CEO Sultan Ahmed Bin Sulayem, who reportedly stepped down after his apparent ties to Epstein were revealed.

European allies say Alexei Navalny was poisoned by dart frog toxin; Russia rejects claims
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
- Five European allies blamed Russia on Feb 14 for Alexei Navalny's Feb 2024 death, citing epibatidine toxin from poison dart frogs.
- Analyses confirmed epibatidine, a foreign toxin. Allies state Russia had "means, motive, and opportunity"; Russia denies responsibility, claiming natural causes.
- Navalny's widow called for Putin's accountability. Allies demand Russia answer for violating chemical and biological weapons conventions due to this "alarming pattern."

LONDON - Five European allies on Feb 14 blamed Russia for killing late Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny using toxin from poison dart frogs while he was held in an Arctic penal colony two years ago.
In a joint statement, Britain, France, Germany, Sweden and the Netherlands said analyses of samples from Navalny’s body “conclusively” confirmed the presence of epibatidine, a toxin found in poison dart frogs in South America and not found naturally in Russia.
The Russian government, which has repeatedly denied any responsibility for Navalny’s death, dismissed the latest allegations as “a Western propaganda hoax”, according to the Russian state’s TASS news agency, while the Russian embassy in London said: “One must ask what kind of person would believe this nonsense about a frog.”
“When the test results are available and the formulas for the substances are disclosed, we will comment accordingly,” Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova was quoted as saying by TASS.
“Until then, all such assertions are merely propaganda aimed at diverting attention from pressing Western issues,” the news agency cited her as saying. The report also said she described Navalny as a blogger “officially designated as a terrorist and extremist in Russia”.
Britain on Feb 14 said the poisoning demonstrated “an alarming pattern of behaviour”. The country held a public inquiry into the poisoning in Britain of Russian double agent Sergei Skripal in 2018. It concluded in 2025 that Russian President Vladimir Putin must have ordered the Novichok nerve agent attack.
The British government did not immediately respond to a Reuters query about how the samples from Navalny’s body were obtained or where they were assessed. Foreign minister Yvette Cooper told reporters that “UK scientists worked with our European partners to pursue the truth” on Navalny’s death.
Second anniversary
Russian opposition leader Navalny died in an Arctic prison colony
His death was announced minutes before the opening of the Munich Security Conference in 2024. In response, the conference made a rare schedule adjustment to allow his widow, Mrs Yulia Navalnaya, to address the conference and she called for the Russian leader to be held accountable.
“I was certain from the first day that my husband had been poisoned, but now there is proof... I am grateful to the European states for the meticulous work they carried out over two years and for uncovering the truth,” she said on social media while attending this year’s Munich conference on Feb 14.
The Feb 14 statement from the European allies almost exactly two years after Navalny’s death said Moscow had the means, motive and opportunity to administer the poison as Navalny died in prison.
“Russia claimed that Navalny died of natural causes. But given the toxicity of epibatidine and reported symptoms, poisoning was highly likely the cause of his death,” the joint statement said.
His death was followed by memorial gatherings and protests across Europe, with demonstrators in cities including London, Berlin, Vilnius and Rome condemning the Kremlin and demanding accountability.
The joint statement added that the latest findings underlined the need for Russia to be held accountable for “its repeated violations of the Chemical Weapons Convention and, in this instance, the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention”. REUTERS

IMF lifts prior conditions for Ukraine loan program, Ukraine's Prime Minister says

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has lifted the conditions for Ukraine's new $8.1 billion loan program, Prime Minister Yuliia Svyrydenko told reporters on Feb. 13.
The IMF has streamlined the agreements established in November by reviewing the preliminary measures and structural benchmarks, Svyrydenko said on Feb. 13. The announcement followed "numerous" discussions and consultations, including direct communication with IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva.
According to Svyrydenko, the program will be considered at the next meeting of the IMF Executive Board with "no prior actions" required, while there has been "much discussion about how this will be done."
"We are working with parliamentarians and will most likely adopt these measures as part of a consolidated tax bill. It will also include issues related to digital platforms, parcels, and the preservation of the military tax after the end of martial law," Svyrydenko said.
Ukraine's debt management head, Yuriy Butsa, told Reuters on Feb. 13 that Ukraine expects its program to be formally approved in weeks. "I think February is still doable in terms of a timeline," Butsa said.
Finalizing the $8.1 billion IMF loan is required for securing a 90 billion euro ($105 billion) lifeline from the European Union, without which Ukraine's finances will run dry in a matter of months.
"The cooperation program with the IMF for Ukraine is the anchor for all international financial support, in particular for obtaining a 90-billion-euro loan from the European Union," Svyrydenko said.
Kyiv has been pushing to delay a new tax on self-employed entrepreneurs until after the war ends, as well as raise the threshold at which entrepreneurs start paying the levy, a person in the Ukrainian government familiar with the talks told the Kyiv Independent on the condition of anonymity.
The renegotiations started on Jan. 21, a week after IMF chief Kristalina Georgieva told Reuters in an interview that she expected the Washington-based lender's executive board to give the final stamp of approval in "a matter of weeks."

Olympics committee defends sale of T-shirt commemorating 1936 Nazi-era Games

The governing body for the Olympics is defending its sale of a limited-edition T-shirt commemorating the 1936 Olympic Games in Berlin under Adolf Hitler’s Germany.
The $42 shirt, which was condemned by Jewish organizations, has already sold out from the official Olympics online store.
A spokesperson for the International Olympic Committee acknowledged the Games’ Nazi connections but said the 1936 design fit with its lineup of historical apparel marking “130 years of Olympic art and design.”
In its statement the IOC also invoked Jesse Owens, the Black American track-and-field athlete whose dominating performance at the 1936 Games was widely seen as a rebuke of Hitler’s “master race” ideology.
“While we of course acknowledge the historical issues of ‘Nazi propaganda’ related to the Berlin 1936 Olympic Games, we must also remember that the Games in Berlin saw 4,483 athletes from 49 countries compete in 149 medal events,” the IOC spokesperson said in a statement to media. “Many of them stunned the world with their athletic achievements, including Jesse Owens.”
The design, based on an official poster for the Games, depicts the Olympic rings and a golden statue of a muscular man crowned in laurels next to a chariot of horses atop Berlin’s Brandenburg Gates.
Another item based on an Olympics event overseen by the Nazis, a T-shirt commemorating the 1936 Winter Games in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany, was also being sold through the collection. That poster shows a victorious skier with an arm upraised in what could be a Nazi salute and was designed by Ludwig Hohlwein, a leading artist in Joseph Goebbels’ propaganda division.
Jewish groups voice frustration
European Jewish groups said the Berlin shirt was insensitive, given that the 1936 Games were intended to function as a propaganda tool for Hitler’s regime. Some pointed to the modern-day resurgence of antisemitism as justification for their objections.
“As the world reflects on this latest controversy, it is impossible not to recall that we are approaching 90 years since the 1936 Berlin Olympics, an event the Nazi regime used to legitimize itself on the global stage while persecution of Jews was already well underway,” Scott Saunders, CEO of International March of the Living, the educational program that organizes trips to concentration camps, told CNN.
“Sport has the power to unite, to inspire, and to elevate the very best of humanity,” Saunders added. “But history reminds us that it can also be manipulated to sanitize hatred and normalize exclusion. The lesson of Berlin is urgent. When antisemitism resurfaces in public life, whether in stadiums, streets, or online, silence is not neutrality. It is complicity.”
Christine Schmidt, the co-director of the Wiener Holocaust Library in London, also condemned the sale of the shirts.
“The Nazis used the 1936 Olympics to showcase their oppressive regime to the world, aiming to smooth over international relations while at the same time preventing almost all German-Jewish athletes from competing, rounding up the 800 Roma who lived in Berlin, and concealing signs of virulent antisemitic violence and propaganda from the world’s visitors,” Schmidt told CNN.
The screen-printed shirt is based on a poster for the actual games created by graphic artist Werner Würbel, according to an IOC catalog of posters from the Games. The aesthetic of the 1936 Games, which emphasized strongman caricatures in keeping with the Nazi ideal of a superhuman Aryan race, was memorialized in Nazi filmmaker Leni Riefenstahl’s propaganda documentary “Olympia.”
The Heritage collection also sold a T-shirt bedecked with a poster from the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich, during which the entire Israeli athletic delegation was taken hostage and killed by the Palestinian terror group Black September. The Jewish Telegraphic Agency has reached out to the IOC for further comment about the shirt, which is also marked as sold out.
The Munich Games were honored in a different commemorative product that drew criticism: sneakers produced in 2024 by Adidas, which was founded by Nazi Party members and had recently taken weeks to break ties with Kanye West after he embarked on an antisemitic spree.

Zelenskyy responds to Macron's intention to speak with Putin
President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is not against French President Emmanuel Macron being involved in negotiations with Russian leader Vladimir Putin, but stresses the importance of Europe working together.
Source: European Pravda citing Volodymyr Zelenskyy speaking to journalists at the Munich Security Conference
Details: The president emphasised that he is aware of the specifics of Emmanuel Macron's plan to negotiate with Putin. "This is his decision, he told me [about the intention to have this conversation]. Emmanuel was very honest with me about this," Zelenskyy said.
Zelenskyy did not offer any criticism regarding Macron's intentions and stated his trust in the support of his French counterpart for Ukraine.
However, the Ukrainian president holds the view that it is crucial that negotiations with the Russian Federation be conducted jointly with Europe.
Quote: "I think that Europe must decide how it wants to coordinate the negotiations. Because in my opinion, Putin will play games with one side, with the other, then with the third, and with the fourth, to divide Europe and give everyone candy, and just to give them the feeling that they have a decisive say."
Details: Zelenskyy expressed dissatisfaction with Europe's failure to participate in negotiations with Russia in the format that was secured by the United States.
Background:
- Macron is already involving other Europeans in resuming dialogue with Putin.
- This week, Macron is discussing demands on Putin with European leaders.
- At the same time, most Germans want direct negotiations between German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and Putin.

SDF to reorganize into four brigades under deal with Syrian government
The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are redistributing their fighters within a new military structure as part of a ceasefire deal with the Syrian government, following clashes last month which saw government forces take most of the territory once held by the SDF.
Farhad Shami, a spokesman for the SDF, told the Iraq-based Kurdistan 24 website on Friday that SDF forces will reorganise into four brigades, one to be based around the Kurdish-majority town of Kobane (also known as Ain Al-Arab) in Syria’s Aleppo province, and three to be stationed in the Jazira region of northeastern Syria.
He explained that the Hasakah Brigade will cover the areas of Darbasiyah and Sari Kani (Ras al-Ain), while the Qamishli Brigade will be responsible for the areas of Amuda, Qamishli, Tel Brak, and Tel Hamis. Meanwhile, the Derik Brigade will extend from the city of Derik (also known as Malikiya) to Tel Kocher.
On the ground, SDF military forces withdrew from positions to the south of the city of Qamishl on Friday, handing them over to Asayish security forces, which are associated with the SDF and the Kurdish-led Democratic Autonomous Administration of Northeastern Syria (DAANES).
This is part of a repositioning agreed upon with the Syrian government.
The New Arab’s sister site Al-Araby Al-Jadeed reported that the SDF is scheduled to withdraw its fighters and vehicles from contact points with Syrian government military forces, while the latter will carry out a similar withdrawal from their side, to be followed by the deployment of government security forces.
In March 2025, the SDF agreed to integrate its forces and institutions with those of the Syrian government but this was repeatedly stalled and the agreement broke down last January, with fighting breaking out around two SDF-held areas in Aleppo and spreading to northeastern Syria.
Most of the territory once held by the SDF was Arab-majority and Syrian government forces were able to capture it relatively quickly last month, leaving the SDF in control of Qamishli, Hasakeh, Kobane, and surrounding areas.
Under the new ceasefire agreement signed on January 18, the SDF once again agreed to integrate its forces into the Syrian government, while government security forces have entered SDF-held towns.
The SDF also agreed to “expel non-Syrian leaders and members of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) from Syria” and “integrate all civil institutions in Hasakah province into state institutions and structures.”
Turkey, a key backer of the current Syrian government, has long accused the SDF of being a front for the PKK, which has fought for independence or autonomy for Turkey’s Kurdish minority since the 1980s.

European governments move to oust UN rapporteur over anti-Israel remarks

A growing number of European governments are calling on the United Nations to remove Francesca Albanese, the UN special rapporteur on the Palestinian territories, citing what they describe as extreme and inflammatory statements, some of which critics say raise concerns of antisemitism beyond opposition to Israel.
After France and Germany, Austria and the Czech Republic joined the calls in recent days to dismiss the Italian human rights expert from her post. Dozens of British lawmakers have urged the Foreign Office to seek her removal. Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani said this week that Albanese’s statements and conduct make calls for her resignation “inevitable.”
Italy’s ruling Brothers of Italy party has also begun collecting signatures demanding her dismissal.
The latest controversy erupted after Albanese participated by video in a conference organized by Al Jazeera in Doha, where speakers included Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi and senior Hamas official Khaled Mashaal. France was the first to protest after Albanese was quoted as saying that Israel is the “common enemy of humanity.”
French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot denounced her remarks as “antisemitic.” In her speech, Albanese referred to Israel as a “common enemy” that had, in her words, enabled what she called a “genocide” in Gaza.
She accused much of the international community of arming Israel and providing it with political cover and financial support instead of stopping it. “It’s also true that never before has the global community seen the challenges that we all face,” she said. “We who do not control large amounts of financial capitals, algorithms and weapons.”
Barrot said Albanese “presents herself as an independent UN expert, but she is neither an expert nor independent — she is a political activist who fuels hatred.” He added that her conduct harms both the Palestinian cause she claims to defend and the credibility of UN institutions.
As criticism mounted, Albanese said her comments had been taken out of context and manipulated. In an interview with France 24, she denied ever saying that Israel is the “common enemy of humanity.” She said she had been referring to “war crimes, crimes against humanity and acts that constitute genocide,” and that the “common enemy” she condemned was a system that, in her view, prevents accountability or an end to Israeli actions.
Left-wing parties in Europe have rallied to her defense, along with dozens of artists known for anti-Israel activism, including actors Javier Bardem and Mark Ruffalo and singer Annie Lennox, who signed a letter to the United Nations supporting her.
Over the past two years, Albanese has made a series of sharply critical statements about Israel that have made her a prominent figure among segments of Europe’s anti-Israel left. Days after the Oct. 7 Hamas attack, she publicly cast doubt on allegations of sexual violence and rape by Hamas terrorists and accused Israel and the United States of spreading falsehoods to justify escalating the war.
She has argued that Israel has no right to self-defense after the Hamas incursion and said that, in her view, Israelis should be “considered suspect” and investigated when they are abroad. She has called for a pharmaceutical boycott of Israel, described it as a “genocide-supporting society” and accused it of standing against global justice.
Albanese has also said that when senior Hamas officials declare they want to “kill Jews,” they “do not really mean Jews.” She denied involvement by staff of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees in crimes attributed to Hamas and promoted claims of global Israeli and Jewish control over the arms trade.
At an award ceremony in Italy, she publicly rebuked a mayor who presented her with a prize after he called on Hamas to release hostages. To applause from the audience, she warned him not to repeat such a demand, saying it was not a legitimate request.

On a February evening in 2019, Yann, then 18, wandered through the streets of downtown Bordeaux. He nervously checked his phone, the notification volume turned up all the way. Suddenly, thumbs-up emojis flooded his screen, signaling it was time for him to step in. He rushed into a bar and called out to his friend, spotting her and feigning surprise: "Lucie, I was looking for you everywhere! We have to go to that surprise birthday party for Valentine." This improvised exit line still made them laugh today.
A few days earlier, Yann and Lucie, his childhood friend, spent an evening hanging out. She confided in him that she wanted to meet new people. Slouched on a mutual friend's couch, balancing a plate of pesto pasta on their knees, they got to work. Yann created Lucie's very first Tinder profile, spending hours with her sorting through which photos to highlight. The first date was quickly set. Lucie hesitated. "She was stressed out, so I told her I'd hang out near the bar, just in case the date went sour," he recalled. "But we hadn't really thought the plan all the way through and it was pretty obvious," he said, laughing. While the exit mission was shaky, the story itself became "legendary": a case of friends acting as a safety net, as Cupid and as the creators of romantic connections. In short, the Swiss Army knives of emotional support.

Five European states blame Russia for poisoning Navalny

Five European countries have concluded that Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny died after being poisoned with epibatidine, a rare toxin found in South American dart frogs, and have held the Russian state responsible.
The United Kingdom, France, Germany, Sweden and the Netherlands issued a joint statement on Saturday following laboratory analysis of biological samples taken from Navalny’s body.
Navalny died on 16 February 2024 in the IK-6 penal colony in Harp, north of the Arctic Circle, where he was serving a 19-year sentence.
The five governments said independent national laboratories identified epibatidine in samples linked to Navalny.
“Epibatidine can be found naturally in dart frogs in the wild in South America. Dart frogs in captivity do not produce this toxin and it is not found naturally in Russia,” the joint statement said.
“There is no innocent explanation for its presence in Navalny’s body.”
British Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper, speaking at the Munich Security Conference, said only the Russian state had the capacity to deploy the substance.
“Only the Russian government had the means, motive and opportunity to deploy this lethal toxin against Alexei Navalny during his imprisonment in Russia,” Cooper said.
She added that the United Kingdom would inform the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons of what it described as a breach of the Chemical Weapons Convention.
“Considering the toxicity of epibatidine and the reported symptoms, poisoning was a highly likely cause of death,” the joint statement said.
The countries expressed concern that Russia had not destroyed all of its chemical weapons stockpiles, despite declaring in 2017 that it had done so.
Navalny’s widow, Yulia Navalnaya, said she had been convinced from the outset that her husband was poisoned.
“I was certain from the first day that my husband had been poisoned, but now there is proof,” she wrote on X. “Putin killed Alexei with a chemical weapon.”
Navalnaya said in September that she had obtained biological samples from her husband’s body and sent them abroad for analysis. She said laboratories in two countries concluded that he had been murdered, though she did not at the time name the toxin involved.
Russian authorities have maintained that Navalny died of natural causes linked to existing health conditions. According to official accounts, he felt unwell after a walk in the prison yard and collapsed.
The Kremlin has not commented on the latest allegations.
Navalny, 47, was Russia’s most prominent opposition figure and an anti-corruption campaigner who built a nationwide network challenging President Vladimir Putin.
In 2020 he survived a poisoning attempt with the nerve agent Novichok while campaigning in Siberia. German military laboratories later confirmed the presence of the Soviet-era nerve agent after he was evacuated to Berlin for treatment.
He returned to Russia in 2021 and was arrested at the airport. Courts later handed him multiple sentences on charges his supporters described as politically motivated.
The five European governments said their findings followed a two-year inquiry and would be submitted to the OPCW in coordination with the United Nations.
“Only the Russian state had the means, motive and opportunity to deploy this lethal toxin to target Navalny during his imprisonment in a Russian penal colony in Siberia, and we hold it responsible for his death,” the statement said.

Swansea man jailed for life after killing his older brother
Police said that the impact on the family had been ‘significant’ and the wider community in Swansea was shocked
- Bookmark
A man has been jailed for life after he was found guilty of killing his older brother. Darren Steel, 41, from Swansea, was told he must serve a minimum term of 20 years, after being convicted of murder and counts of grievous bodily harm and actual bodily harm from his initial trial, South Wales Police said.
The body of Martin Steel, 48, was discovered at an address in the Clase area of Swansea in May 2023.
Jurors heard during a previous trial that the brothers had shared a “love-hate” relationship which could turn “volatile” when alcohol was consumed.
Detective inspector Stuart Prendiville said: “This has been a long and complex investigation into an incident which has shocked the communities of Clase, Morriston, and the wider community of Swansea. The impact on the family has been significant.”
“Darren Steel committed the ultimate betrayal against his older brother and caused further distress by pleading not guilty and putting the family through the ordeal of not one, but two trials.”
He added that police felt the life sentence was “wholly justified” and came as a relief.
“Darren Steel is a violent and dangerous individual and the life sentence and minimum tariff of 20 years is wholly justified in this case.
“We are relieved with the outcome and glad that the court proceedings have now come to an end. Our thoughts are with the family.”

Yulia Navalnaya releases statement following latest revelations on husband’s death
- Alexei Navalny's widow, Yulia Navalnaya, announced that scientists from five European countries confirmed her husband was poisoned with epibatidine.
- Epibatidine is identified as a deadly neurotoxin, naturally found on the Ecuadorian dart frog, which causes paralysis and respiratory arrest.
- Navalnaya directly accused Vladimir Putin of using a chemical weapon to kill her husband, stating she had been certain of this from the outset.
- She thanked European states for their two-year investigation, which she said uncovered the truth about the poisoning.
- While the Kremlin denies involvement, the UK and its allies maintain that only the Russian state possessed the capability and motive for such an attack.

Ukraine facing pressure from US to make concessions, not Russia: Zelenskyy

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy expressed hope that US-brokered peace talks next week in Geneva will be serious and substantive, but he voiced concern that Ukraine was being asked "too often" to make concessions in the negotiations.
"We truly hope that the trilateral meetings next week will be serious, substantive, helpful for all us but honestly sometimes it feels like the sides are talking about completely different things," Zelenskyy said on Saturday in a speech at the Munich Security Conference.
The Ukrainian leader said he was feeling "a little bit" of pressure from US President Donald Trump, who yesterday said Zelenskyy should not miss the "opportunity" to make peace soon.
"The Americans often return to the topic of concessions and too often those concessions are discussed only in the context of Ukraine, not Russia," Zelenskyy said.
However, he added that he hoped the US would stay involved in the negotiations, and that there would be an opportunity for Europe, which he said was currently sidelined, to play a bigger role.
Zelenskyy has in the past expressed concern that US Congressional mid-term elections could focus the Trump administration on domestic political issues after the summer.
Ukraine and Russia have engaged in two recent rounds of talks brokered by Washington in Abu Dhabi, which were described by the sides as constructive but did not achieve any major breakthroughs.
Russia said its delegation to Geneva would be led by Putin adviser Vladimir Medinsky, a change from Abu Dhabi at which Russia's team was led by military intelligence chief Igor Kostyukov.
Ukrainian sources have previously criticised Medinsky's handling of the talks, accusing him of delivering history lessons to the Ukrainian team instead of engaging in substantive negotiations.

Ukrainian defenders in southern sectors simultaneously hold off three to four Russian armies – Voloshyn

Ukrainian defenders in southern sectors simultaneously hold off three to four Russian armies – Voloshyn
The spokesperson for the Southern Defense Forces, Vladyslav Voloshyn, stated this during a live broadcast, in response to a question about what today is the main indicator of stability in the southern defense, Ukrinform reports.
"When people talk about successes in the south, I would like to note that today the Defense Forces of Ukraine in the south are fighting against three, or even four, Russian armies. The 5th, 29th, 35th, and 36th Russian armies are trying to break through toward Huliaipole and take control of some settlements in the Zaporizhzhia region," he said.
Voloshyn reported that a regrouping of the Russian forces aiming to capture Huliaipole is currently underway.
"Effectively, three sets of Russian military units have already been, as they say, worn down by the Ukrainian Defense Forces. The southern defenders are fighting heroically, and every centimeter, meter, and kilometer the enemy loses comes at a heavy cost in personnel, weapons, and military equipment," he noted.
According to his data, in the south, the enemy loses about 300–350 personnel and up to a hundred units of weapons and military equipment per day, "which is a fairly high price for every centimeter of our land."
Answering a question about how the open steppe terrain in the south affects Ukrainian defense, Voloshyn explained that the open terrain in southern Ukraine is present in two directions – Huliaipole and Orikhiv.
"Here, the enemy first tries to move personnel from assault groups to the frontlines and only then conducts assaults. In general, the Russian 5th Army operates here, and its main tactic is infiltration and small infantry group assaults," he said.
He clarified that the Russians conduct these assaults in waves, one following another.
"The main goal is to prevent us from bringing in reinforcements, to deny time to organize logistics. That's why the enemy first delivers massive strikes, destroys everything, and then assaults in waves," Voloshyn explained.
He noted that in the Oleksandrivka direction, the terrain is slightly different – there are several rivers.
"The enemy is operating there with the 29th and 36th armies. There, besides the small infantry group assault tactic, they sometimes use mechanized columns. Usually, these are mechanized platoons with several armored vehicles – tanks, combat armored vehicles, and transport vehicles – moving ahead to assault our positions and settlements," he explained.
Voloshyn noted that these armored columns try to break into Ukrainian settlements, and then, sacrificing equipment and weapons, the enemy infantry disperses.
"...After that, it's quite difficult to expel them from the settlement and conduct a clearing operation. This tactic is widely used in the Oleksandrivka direction, and the enemy does not want to abandon it, because according to our intelligence, they are bringing in more armored vehicles to continue such assaults," he said.
As Ukrinform previously reported, Voloshyn emphasized that despite reports of alleged Russian advances near Robotyne, there is no actual progress or offensive in the Orikhiv direction.

Cuba calls off cigar festival amid economic crisis

Cuba on Saturday announced the cancellation of its iconic cigar festival, amid a major energy crisis sparked by US pressure on the cash-strapped island.
In a message to participants seen by AFP, organizers said they were postponing the annual event, scheduled to take place from February 24-27, but did not give a new date.
The cigar festival typically raises millions of dollars from auction sales that are then funneled into the country's health care system. Last year, it took in about $19.5 million.
International sales of Cuban cigars, the island nation's most emblematic export, bring much needed income to its struggling economy, with Europe the main market for the luxury smokes.
The United States cut off oil deliveries to Cuba from Havana's key ally Venezuela following the abduction of longtime president Nicolas Maduro in early January.
US President Donald Trump also signed an executive order allowing his country to impose tariffs on countries selling oil to Havana.
International airlines including Air Canada have halted Cuba flights due to a lack of fuel on the island, and several governments have urged citizens to reconsider travel there, warning they could be stranded.

UK says it will deploy Carrier Strike Group to North Atlantic, High North this year
'This deployment will help make Britain warfighting ready, boost our contribution to NATO, and strengthen our operations with key allies,' says British defense chief
LONDON
The British government announced Saturday that it will deploy a carrier strike group to the North Atlantic and High North this year in a bid to boost regional security.
In a statement, the Defense Ministry said the UK will send a carrier strike group in 2026 "in a major show of force across the Euro-Atlantic and High North, reinforcing NATO’s deterrence at a time of rising Russian threats in the region."
According to the plan, deployment will include major exercises alongside US, Canadian, and Northern European allies.
"Known as ‘Operation Firecrest’ and led by HMS Prince of Wales -- the largest warship in the Royal Navy -- the UK will deploy the strike group across the North Atlantic and Arctic."
The plan came as Russia’s military activity in the North Atlantic "continues to increase," as over the past two years, there has been a "30% increase in Russian navy vessels threatening UK waters," according to the statement.
"The Carrier Strike Group will sail across the Atlantic to visit a US port, with US jets also expected to operate from the flight deck of HMS Prince of Wales," it added.
In the statement, Defense Secretary John Healey said: "This deployment will help make Britain warfighting ready, boost our contribution to NATO, and strengthen our operations with key allies, keeping the UK secure at home and strong abroad."
The statement came following Prime Minister Keir Starmer's announcement of the plan during his address at the Munich Security Conference in Germany.

US, Syrian top diplomats meet at Munich conference
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio met with his Syrian counterpart Asaad al-Shaibani on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference on Friday and they discussed Damascus's recent agreement with the Kurds.
A post by the Syrian foreign ministry included pictures showing that the head of the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, Mazloum Abdi, also attended the meeting.
Syria's government and the Kurdish-led authorities signed last month an agreement to gradually integrate the Kurds' military and civilian institutions into the state.
It came after Kurdish forces ceded territory to advancing government troops following months of tensions and sporadic clashes.
Rubio and Shaibani on Friday discussed the "latest domestic and regional developments, while stressing the unity, sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Syrian Arab Republic", the foreign ministry statement said.
The ministry added that Rubio expressed US support for "the recent integration agreement with the Syrian Democratic Forces".
SDF leader Abdi later announced that he attended the meeting, describing it as "positive" and telling local media that the meeting discussed the integration process.
The meeting coincided with a move by Damascus to appoint a Kurdish governor of Hasakeh province in eastern Syria, according to a decree published Friday, as part of the integration deal between the government and the SDF.
The official news agency SANA reported a presidential decree appointing Noureddine Ahmed Eissa, a Kurd from Qamishli, to govern Hasakeh, a former stronghold of the Kurdish administration.
Alongside the US-led coalition against the Islamic State group, the SDF spearheaded the battle that led to the extremist group's territorial defeat in Syria in 2019.
The United States has however drawn close to Syria's new authorities, recently saying the purpose of its alliance with the Kurdish forces was largely over.
As Damascus seeks to extend its control over all of Syria, US forces confirmed on Thursday their withdrawal from Al-Tanf base near Syria's border with Jordan and Iraq.

United Kingdom Initiates Discussions on Confiscating Russia’s Shadow Fleet Tankers

The United Kingdom and its European allies in the Combined Joint Expeditionary Force are considering confiscating ships belonging to Russia’s shadow fleet, regardless of their flag.
This was reported by Bloomberg.
The Combined Joint Expeditionary Force is a group of 10 countries (the United Kingdom, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and the Netherlands), united by common commitments to the security of the North Atlantic and the Baltic Sea, took place on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference.
British Defence Minister John Healey met with his counterparts from the Baltic and Northern European countries to discuss the possible seizure of shadow fleet oil tankers as part of Europe’s efforts to tighten restrictions against Russia’s war economy.
As the publication noted, the meeting demonstrated the allies’ growing willingness to more actively restrict revenues that finance the war against Ukraine.
“The atmosphere and general understanding was that we need to be more proactive. The message is that countries that provide flags to shadow fleet vessels should know that other states may take action,” Estonian Defence Minister Hanno Pevkur said after the meeting.
According to Pevkur, further discussions are needed before any decision is made. Some participants remain cautious due to “fears of escalation,” Estonian Foreign Minister Margus Tsahkna said in a separate interview.
The meeting was also attended by British Chief of Defence Staff Richard Knighton, who presented options for action, including the possibility of joint operations to seize ships.
If a decision is made to confiscate ships, the Combined Joint Expeditionary Force could draw on the experience of the United States in intercepting tankers transporting goods to and from Venezuela. Some of these ships had ties to Russia.
It is currently unclear to what extent the US will be involved in the UK-led initiative. However, according to one of the publication’s sources, some coordination is likely to take place. The interception of ships linked to Russia has caused concern in Moscow, with Russian officials privately demanding that the US stop such actions.
In January 2026, fourteen European countries issued a joint statement warning Russia that its shadow fleet tankers would no longer be able to operate freely in the Baltic Sea.
The document was signed by Belgium, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Sweden, and the United Kingdom.
The statement says that from now on, tankers that change flags, turn off transponders, or do not have the necessary documents will be considered stateless vessels. Such ships can be detained without legal risk, which significantly limits the ability of Russian carriers to circumvent sanctions.

Ukraine hits Russia's BK-16 landing craft in Crimea and other targets in Russian-occupied territories, military says
Ukrainian forces successfully attacked a Russian BK-16 landing craft and other targets in Russian-occupied territories, the General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces said on Feb. 14.
The General Staff reported that Russia's BK-16 landing vessel, a high-speed landing craft for coastal operations and troop transport, was "successfully hit" on Feb. 12 in the Novoozerne area, Russian-occupied Crimea.
Some other military targets were also hit on Feb. 12, such as the RSP-10 radar station in Crimea and Russia's communications node in the occupied part of Zaporizhzhia Oblast, the General Staff said.
Additionally, on Feb. 13, Ukraine hit a Russian ammunition depot near the village of Novoeokonomichne in occupied Donetsk Oblast.
"The Ukrainian defense forces will continue to systematically carry out measures aimed at weakening the combat potential of the Russian aggressor," the General Staff said.
Crimea has been under Russian occupation since its illegal annexation in 2014.
Ukraine has stepped up strikes on military infrastructure on the peninsula and other newly occupied territories since the full-scale invasion began in 2022.

US military says struck more than 30 IS targets in Syria
The US military said Saturday that its forces had struck more than 30 Islamic State group targets in Syria this month, maintaining pressure on the jihadists after a deadly attack on US troops last year.
The strikes also came as the United States Central Command (CENTCOM) in recent weeks transferred thousands of IS detainees from Syria to Iraq, after they had been held in prisons run for years by Kurdish-led forces.
US forces "conducted 10 strikes against more than 30 ISIS targets in Syria... to sustain relentless military pressure on remnants from the terrorist network," a CENTCOM statement said, using another acronym for IS.
The air strikes, carried out between February 3 and February 12, hit IS "infrastructure and weapons storage targets", it said.
The forces additionally conducted "five strikes against an ISIS communication site, critical logistics node, and weapons storage facilities" between January 27 and February 2, the statement said.
Washington has blamed an IS fighter for ambushing and killing two US soldiers and a US civilian interpreter in Palmyra on December 13.
Syria's interior ministry has said the IS gunman was a member of the security forces who had been set to be fired for extremism.
The US launched Operation Hawkeye Strike in response to the attack.
"More than 50 ISIS terrorists have been killed or captured and over 100 ISIS infrastructure targets have been struck with hundreds of precision munitions during two months of targeted operations," the CENTCOM statement added.
On Friday, CENTCOM said it had completed the transfer of more than 5,700 detained IS suspects, from 61 countries, from Syria to Iraq.
The operation began last month as Damascus's capture of territory surrounding the prisons from Kurdish-led forces sparked questions over the fate of the IS prisoners, prompting Washington to step in.
Alongside the US-led anti-IS coalition, the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces spearheaded the battle that led to the jihadist group's territorial defeat in Syria in 2019.
Washington has however drawn close to Syria's new authorities, recently saying the purpose of its alliance with the Kurdish forces was largely over.
As Damascus seeks to extend its control over all of Syria, US forces confirmed on Thursday their withdrawal from Al-Tanf base near Syria's border with Jordan and Iraq.

US military used Anthropic’s AI model Claude in Venezuela raid, report says

Claude, the AI model developed by Anthropic, was used by the US military during its operation to kidnap Nicolás Maduro from Venezuela, the Wall Street Journal revealed on Saturday, a high-profile example of how the US defence department is using artificial intelligence in its operations.
The US raid on Venezuela involved bombing across the capital, Caracas, and the killing of 83 people, according to Venezuela’s defence ministry. Anthropic’s terms of use prohibit the use of Claude for violent ends, for the development of weapons or for conducting surveillance.
Anthropic was the first AI developer known to be used in a classified operation by the US department of defence. It was unclear how the tool, which has capabilities ranging from processing PDFs to piloting autonomous drones, was deployed.
A spokesperson for Anthropic declined to comment on whether Claude was used in the operation, but said any use of the AI tool was required to comply with its usage policies. The US defence department did not comment on the claims.
The WSJ cited anonymous sources who said Claude was used through Anthropic’s partnership with Palantir Technologies, a contractor with the US defence department and federal law enforcement agencies. Palantir refused to comment on the claims.
The US and other militaries increasingly deploy AI as part of their arsenals. Israel’s military has used drones with autonomous capabilities in Gaza and has extensively used AI to fill its targeting bank in Gaza. The US military has used AI targeting for strikes in Iraq and Syria in recent years.
Critics have warned against the use of AI in weapons technologies and the deployment of autonomous weapons systems, pointing to targeting mistakes created by computers governing who should and should not be killed.
AI companies have grappled with how their technologies should engage with the defence sector, with Anthropic’s CEO, Dario Amodei, calling for regulation to prevent harms from the deployment of AI. Amodei has also expressed wariness over the use of AI in autonomous lethal operations and surveillance in the US.
This more cautious stance has apparently rankled the US defence department, with the secretary of war, Pete Hegseth, saying in January that the department wouldn’t “employ AI models that won’t allow you to fight wars”.
The Pentagon announced in January that it would work with xAI, owned by Elon Musk. The defence department also uses a custom version of Google’s Gemini and OpenAI systems to support research.

Top entertainment figures back UN rapporteur Francesca Albanese
Over a hundred top figures from the world of entertainment signed an open letter Saturday in support of UN Palestinian human rights expert Francesca Albanese who faces calls from Israel's allies to resign over comments about the war in Gaza.
France and Germany have called for Albanese to step down over remarks last weekend in which she referred to a "common enemy of humanity" after criticising "most of the world" and the media for enabling Israel's genocide in Gaza.
Israel and its supporters have accused the UN Special Rapporteur of referring to Israel as a "common enemy", while Albanese has denounced this as a "manipulation" and "completely false".
In a letter organised by the Artists for Palestine group, over a 100 cultural figures backed her, including actors Mark Ruffalo and Javier Bardem, Nobel-winning author Annie Ernaux and British musician Annie Lennox.
The signatories "offer our full support to Francesca Albanese, a defender of human rights and therefore also of the Palestinian people's right to exist," the letter says.
"There are infinitely more of us, in every corner of the Earth, who want force no longer to be the law. Who know what the word 'law' truly means," it concludes.
Published in French on the website of Artists for Palestine, it also reproduces the full remarks by Albanese who was speaking via videoconference at a forum last Saturday organised by the Al Jazeera TV network.
Other celebrities to offer support for her include actresses Rosa Salazar and Asia Argento, Oscar-nominated film directors Yorgos Lanthimos and Kaouther Ben Hania, Latin music star Residente, and photographer Nan Goldin.
A group of French MPs sent a letter to French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot on Tuesday denouncing Albanese's remarks as "antisemitic".
Barrot called for her to step down a day later, saying that France "unreservedly condemns" what he characterised as "the outrageous and reprehensible remarks".
German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul on Thursday said her position was "untenable".
'Shame of our time'
Albanese is one of the most outspoken critics of Israel's more-than-two-year bombardment of Gaza which has resulted in the deaths of over 70,000 people and the destruction of most of the territory's infrastructure.
She has called it the "the shame of our time" and says she always asks prime ministers, presidents and foreign ministers the same question: "How do you sleep? When will you act?"
The Italian-born legal expert, who began her unpaid role in 2022, was targeted with sanctions by the Trump administration in July last year over what it called her "biased and malicious" work.
UN special rapporteurs like Albanese are independent experts who are appointed by the UN rights council, but do not speak on behalf of the United Nations.
UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres distanced himself from Albanese on Thursday when his spokesman said "we don't agree with much of what she says."
"We wouldn't use the language that she's using in describing the situation," his spokesman Stephane Dujarric added.

Israel’s goal is to weaken the regime in Iran, not change it - opinion
Unknown

As the drumbeat of war continues to echo, a less binary reality is becoming increasingly clear: Israel is not truly striving to topple the Iranian regime. Instead, it is pursuing a less ambitious yet more practical goal of weakening the regime and rendering it non-threatening, to the point where its ability to harm Israel nears zero.
This mirrors the strategic reality Israel has imposed on Hezbollah’s Lebanon.
Truthfully, this is an achievable goal, and it is closer than it appears. If a direct exchange occurs now, the Iranians will likely manage to retaliate; in the next round, their response will be weaker; and after one or two more phases of strikes, Israel will have almost completely neutralized their retaliatory capabilities.
This is the reality Israel is striving for: to create operational dominance in Iran similar to what has been established in Lebanon. This would allow the Jewish state to carry out strikes there, on a regular basis, to thwart any attempts at reconstruction without Iran having the ability to react, and without the world holding its breath every time Israeli jets head toward Tehran.
This reality would also bolster Iran’s opposition forces and provide relief to protesters by making them less vulnerable.
The current US administration’s tendency to think in “spectacular” terms – planning a multi-systemic, hyper-sophisticated, simultaneous mega-strike to collapse the Revolutionary Guards’ house of cards in a single hammer blow is, unfortunately, neither realistic nor attainable. It stems from an idealistic pursuit of a “magic solution” – a quick fix intended to avoid a history of getting bogged down in overseas wars. It also stems from a profound hesitancy within the Pentagon regarding the actual use of assets beyond exercises, publicized troop buildups, and displays of grandiosity involving stealth jets and aircraft carriers.
US military supposed to be a deterrent
The US wants to strike without being struck. This is an almost absurd expansion of the “no boots on the ground” approach into a “no military forces in a war zone” doctrine. The US military, with all its might, is supposed to be the force that projects deterrence, not the one being deterred.
Instead, Washington seeks hermetic protection for its forces, feeling that its warships and bases in the Middle East are so threatened by Iranian missiles that it raises a fundamental question: What is the world’s strongest military worth if it is so vulnerable, exposed, and fragile?
Furthermore, how can the US tolerate direct threats to the spearhead of its strategic power, the potential sinking of its aircraft carriers?
However, the Americans will eventually have to confront the same brutal reality that Israel has already accepted: An agreement does not intercept the missiles of jihadist entities. A diplomatic signature from a revolutionary theocracy offers little physical protection to a carrier task force in the Persian Gulf.
Sooner or later, Washington will likely reach the inevitable conclusion that the only way to safeguard its forces in the Middle East is through the systematic neutralization of Iran’s ballistic capabilities – mirroring the decimation of Hezbollah’s long-range arsenal. Until then, its strategic spearhead will remain a collection of potential, high-priced hostages.
In Israel, by contrast, the “fear barrier” was crossed long ago. The experience of war has revealed a dormant inner strength within Israelis and a readiness to confront challenges of this magnitude. They have discovered reserves of courage they hadn’t recognized in recent decades, and have become far more pragmatic regarding the use of force and its consequences.
They want to strike. They know they will be hit in return, but they do not fear it. They are willing to pay the price, and not just with military personnel. Unlike the US, whose military alone is in the region while its civilian population remains safe across the ocean, Israel and its people are within missile range. Israelis are well aware of this and do not bow before the threat.
Their confidence also stems from the fact that when they hear declarations like “The Iranian Air Force is ready; the war with Israel helped us restore combat capability,” they view them with immense skepticism. This is because, like other combat branches of the Iranian military (excluding missile units), the Iranian Air Force played no significant part in the war against Israel and demonstrated no real capability.
In other words, the Iranian military’s entire operational contribution in the 12-Day War amounted to firing missiles from underground command centers. And sooner or later, even that capability will be taken from them.

European governments say Alexei Navalny died after toxin poisoning in Russian prison

Five European allies on Saturday blamed Russia for killing late Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny using toxin from poison dart frogs while he was held in an Arctic penal colony two years ago, a claim Moscow rejected as propaganda.
In a joint statement, Britain, France, Germany, Sweden and the Netherlands said analyzes of samples from Navalny's body "conclusively" confirmed the presence of epibatidine, a toxin found in poison dart frogs in South America and not found naturally in Russia.
The Russian government, which has repeatedly denied any responsibility for Navalny's death, dismissed the latest allegations as "a Western propaganda hoax," according to the Russian state's TASS news agency, while the Russian embassy in London said: "One must ask what kind of person would believe this nonsense about a frog."
Britain on Saturday said the poisoning demonstrated "an alarming pattern of behavior." The country held a public inquiry into the poisoning in Britain of Russian double agent Sergei Skripal in 2018. It concluded last year Russian President Vladimir Putin must have ordered the Novichok nerve agent attack.
"When the test results are available and the formulas for the substances are disclosed, we will comment accordingly," Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova was quoted as saying by TASS.
"Until then, all such assertions are merely propaganda aimed at diverting attention from pressing Western issues," the news agency cited her as saying. The report also said she described Navalny as a blogger "officially designated as a terrorist and extremist in Russia."
The British government declined to comment to a Reuters query about how the samples from Navalny's body were obtained or where they were assessed. Foreign Minister Yvette Cooper told reporters that "UK scientists worked with our European partners to pursue the truth" on Navalny's death.
Russian opposition leader Navalny died in an Arctic prison colony in February 2024, after being convicted of extremism and other charges, all of which he denied.
His death was announced minutes before the opening of the Munich Security Conference in 2024. In response, the conference made a rare schedule adjustment to allow his widow, Yulia Navalnaya, to address the conference and she called for Putin to be held accountable.
"I was certain from the first day that my husband had been poisoned, but now there is proof... I am grateful to the European states for the meticulous work they carried out over two years and for uncovering the truth," she said on social media while attending this year's Munich conference on Saturday.
Russia denies responsibility
The Russian embassy spokesperson said the European allies' move was "not a quest for justice but a mockery of the dead."
"Even after the death of the Russian citizen, London and the European capitals cannot allow him to rest in peace - a fact that speaks volumes about those who instigated this campaign," the spokesperson added.
Saturday's statement from the European allies, almost exactly two years after Navalny's death, said Moscow had the means, motive and opportunity to administer the poison as Navalny died in prison.
"Russia claimed that Navalny died of natural causes. But given the toxicity of epibatidine and reported symptoms, poisoning was highly likely the cause of his death," the joint statement said.
His death was followed by memorial gatherings and protests across Europe, with demonstrators in cities including London, Berlin, Vilnius and Rome condemning the Kremlin and demanding accountability.
The joint statement added that the latest findings underlined the need for Russia to be held accountable for "its repeated violations of the Chemical Weapons Convention and, in this instance, the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention."

Tehran in the crosshairs: The dual US-Israel strategy pressuring Iran - opinion
Unknown

01:10:17 KST

Recent statements from American and Israeli officials have grown more pointed, moving beyond standard diplomacy to include explicit warnings and implied threats.
The atmosphere carries clear signals of mounting pressure on Tehran. This is not just speculation but a visible shift in strategy.
Iran now confronts more than routine political or diplomatic pressure. It faces deliberate targeting through a combination of naval deployments and targeted killings. These elements form a unified approach: using military and intelligence tools to force compliance rather than seek negotiation.
The actions exceed conventional shows of force. The rerouting of a carrier strike group – with destroyers, cruise missiles and fighter jets – signals readiness to act, if necessary, rather than providing mere reassurance to allies.
President Donald Trump has described a massive fleet and overwhelming military might while adding in the same breath that he “would rather not see anything happen.” This mix of tough rhetoric and stated preference for restraint is deliberate. It aims to demonstrate that military options remain available and that ignoring warnings will not lead to renewed talks but to a far more dangerous phase of conflict escalation.
Weakening Tehran
Targeted assassinations in the ongoing conflict with Israel have inflicted significant damage on Iran’s leadership structure. In a remarkably short period, these operations have eliminated several high-ranking figures: the commander of the Revolutionary Guards, the chief of the General Staff, the head of Khatam al-Anbiya Central Headquarters, and the commander of the Aerospace Force responsible for missiles and drones, along with key intelligence, air defense, and Basij officers, plus several nuclear scientists central to Iran’s nuclear and missile programs.
The strategy has shifted from issuing warnings to systematically weakening and gutting the command structure itself.
Assassination target lists have become a central strategic tool rather than mere operational details. The widely reported tally of roughly 30 officials killed in the latest strikes, including more than 30 senior security officials according to some Israeli statements, represents only the visible layer of a deeper penetration. There is evidence of broad compromise of the regime’s security and military apparatus, enabling adversaries to progress from surveillance to selective elimination.
Reports have also referenced the number “fifty” not merely as a body count but as an internal intelligence document or an expanded target matrix encompassing leadership figures, critical sites, and operational nodes tied to Iran’s military capabilities.
Shifting the regional balance of power
The real significance lies not in the numerical difference between thirty and fifty, but in the underlying political-security message. The scope of targeting is no longer confined to a narrow circle: It now extends across the entire power structure, from mid-level operatives to the highest echelons of the political and security leadership, with no guaranteed safe havens, no inviolable redlines, and no presumption of immunity – even for the supreme leader – should the approach shift from gradual erosion to outright decisive action.
Israel contributes extensive experience in dismantling covert networks, penetrating closed systems, and tracking sensitive leaders within the Iranian system. Its cumulative record of operations offers evidence that the talk of assassination target lists is not merely psychological warfare but part of an established targeting doctrine that treats leadership itself as a legitimate military objective rather than a deferred negotiation card.
Combining Israel’s targeted operations with American military mobilization at sea and in the air reveals an evidently dual strategy. On one hand is the systematic dismantling of the Iranian command structure through assassinations and strikes; on the other is regional encirclement with sufficient conventional firepower to neutralize Iran’s proxies and arms before they can be used.
The message is directed not only at Tehran but at its extended network from Iraq to Lebanon and Yemen: the time for operating under a margin of deniability and ambiguity is over. The target bank is no longer an assumption but a reality ready for activation.
Iran, for its part, continues to issue strong public rhetoric about crushing aggression and turning American bases into targets. However, what is called “Iranian deterrence” has become closer to a worn-out political narrative for internal consumption than to an effective deterrence equation. Successive breaches striking at the heart of the command system have revealed that the declared immunity was too weak to withstand the test of real power.
In this gray area between deterrence and execution, the true message lies not in the number of ships nor the length of lists, but in something deeper: that the regional balance of power is no longer open to gradual challenge or symbolic maneuvering. Whoever misreads this moment, or bets on a margin of maneuvering that no longer exists, will not face a new round of negotiations but a strategic reality imposed by force.
This is not a phase of posturing but one of delineating spheres of influence with the necessary harshness and severity – not in Tehran alone, but in every capital that believes geography grants it immunity or that chaos allows for rewriting the rules of the game. The regional order is being recalibrated – and whoever refuses to acknowledge this will learn it the hardest way.

Ex-Oxfam UK CEO alleges antisemitism, anti-Israel bias, premature push for 'genocide' label

Former Oxfam UK CEO Halima Begum is taking legal action against the organization for antisemitism, racism, and sexism, alleging that the charity focused disproportionately on the Israel-Hamas War, and accusing it of pushing for the conflict to be labeled a genocide without sufficient evidence.
Begum, a Bangladeshi-British Muslim, made her remarks in a Friday interview with Channel 4, where she said she was forced out of Oxfam UK in December of last year amid a “witch hunt.” She is currently taking the charity to an employment tribunal.
Pressure to call Gaza war a 'genocide'
“It always felt as though we were disproportionately working around the crisis in Gaza,” Begum told Channel 4, noting that she felt there was “strong pushback” to label the war as a “genocide” before the organization had the proper evidence and legal advice to arrive at the conclusion.
She added that, working at the organization, “it was very hard to hold on to neutrality and impartiality. And I say that as a Muslim woman.”
In response, Oxfam GB told Channel 4 that it had not received Begum’s employment tribunal claim and that it had zero tolerance for discrimination such as “racism, antisemitism, and sexism” and called the description “inaccurate and misleading.”
Additionally, a spokesperson for former Oxfam chair Charles Gurassa asserted to Channel 4 that Begum’s “allegations are completely spurious.”
Anti-Israel bias
Oxfam has been accused in the past of anti-Israel bias. It has also been accused of having been manipulated by Hamas. NGO Monitor said a 2021 document showed that the founders and officers of an Oxfam partner organization were affiliated with the terror organization.
According to the group, the document indicated that Hamas thought the company would prevent an Oxfam irrigation project from interfering with its security infrastructure.
“Revelations of vicious antisemitism and anti-Israel bias at Oxfam are as predictable as they are tragic,” NGO Monitor stated following the Channel 4 interview.
“Former Oxfam CEO Halima Begum’s assertions of overt bias – along with pressure to prematurely brand the Gaza war a genocide without evidence – echo developments at other NGOs, where activism and bigotry have replaced objectivity and universal human rights.”

Gaza’s al-Aqsa hospital risks collapse amid Israeli siege

Gaza’s al-Aqsa hospital at risk of collapse amid Israeli siege, aid restrictions
The Al-Aqsa hospital in central Gaza risks shutting down due to the breakdown of generators amid a continued Israeli siege on the territory.
The government hospital had previously been operating on two main generators that have since stopped working, forcing the medical centre, which serves more than one million people, to rely on a single, small backup generator.
The spokesperson for al-Aqsa hospital, Khalil al-Dakran, told The New Arab's sister site Al-Araby Al-Jadeed that the hospital risks being forced to halt operations due to the ongoing Israeli ban on bringing spare generator parts and fuel into the besieged Gaza Strip.
As a result, al-Dakran added, the medical staff at the hospital have begun rationing electricity and stop its supply to non-vital sections of the facility altogether to ensure the running of critical departments.
Al-Aqsa hospital hosts multiple intensive care, kidney and cardiac units, as well as operating rooms, emergency departments, and neonatal incubators.
It is also the only government hospital to remain functioning in central Gaza.
The single generator is not sufficient to cover the bare minimum needs of the hospital, al-Dakran told al-Araby al-Jadeed, adding that there was an ongoing crisis suffocating the operation of Gaza’s hospitals.
Under the ceasefire agreement reached in October 2025, 600 aid trucks should have entered Gaza daily to respond to the dire humanitarian conditions caused by two years of genocidal war.
Local authorities have said that only about 200 trucks carrying aid supplies enter the besieged territory daily, a third of the stipulated amount previously agreed upon by Israel.
Israel continues to impose a siege and stop the entry of fuel, despite UN officials suggesting critical operations in Gaza, including medical infrastructure, require a minimum of 1.9 million litres of fuel per week. This equates to roughly 270,000 litres per day as a minimum requirement.
Al-Dakran called Israel’s policy of allowing fuel into Gaza "drip-feeding", leaving hospitals under constant threat of closure.
The official also spoke of an acute shortage of medicines and medical supplies, adding that since the beginning of the war, Israel has allowed in less than 10% of the health system’s actual needs.
No new medical equipment has been permitted to enter Gaza, despite the large scale of destruction of medical facilities and hospitals because of Israel’s relentless bombardment during two years of war.
Despite most of Gaza’s hospitals going out of service during the war, many are unable to rebuild due to the continued ban of construction material from entering Gaza.

MEP believes Germany ‘needs peace’ with Russia, sanctions must go

MUNICH, February 14. /TASS/. European Parliament Member Ruth Firmenich (BSW party, formerly the Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance - Reason and Justice) has voiced a compelling call for peace with Russia, urging the immediate lifting of sanctions. Speaking at a demonstration in central Munich against arms supplies to Kiev, she emphasized, "We need peace with Russia; we want peace with Russia." Firmenich criticized EU leaders, recalling that top diplomat Kaja Kallas "dreams of eliminating Russia," while the European Union continues to implement its 20th round of sanctions against Moscow. She insisted that "the sanctions must be lifted immediately."
Firmenich also pointed out that the EU has yet to propose a genuine initiative to resolve the Ukraine conflict, instead focusing on militarization and preparations for war. "The EU has not put forward a single peace initiative of its own," she argued, "but is now solely committed to prolonging the conflict." She highlighted that "every war has a prehistory, just like the war in Ukraine," and cited NATO's eastward expansion as a contributing factor to the crisis.
She further criticized recent EU actions, noting, "Just this week, the European Parliament approved 90 billion euros in loans to Ukraine, ostensibly to support its defense, but primarily to prolong the war." Firmenich called for a shift in approach, stating, "The will to negotiate is finally needed." She pointed out that the Minsk agreements have been exploited to bolster Ukraine's military capabilities, with former German Chancellor Angela Merkel admitting as much. Firmenich also referenced comments by former German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock, who reportedly expressed a desire to destroy Russia, describing such rhetoric as "madness" that must end.
Warning of escalating tensions, she warned, "Everything we are witnessing is preparation for war." She criticized the Munich Conference for serving as a platform to divide labor in Europe's militarization efforts. Firmenich called for an end to arms supplies to what she termed "corrupt Ukraine" and demanded the withdrawal of US troops and weapons from Germany. "Weapons must never be directed against Russia from German soil again," she declared. She reiterated her stance against nuclear armament, stating, "We do not need American nuclear weapons, nor European or German nuclear weapons. We need peace with Russia and the entire world." Her closing appeal was clear: "That country must never become a battlefield for nuclear war.".

‘Small but precious breakthrough’ for paralysed Hong Kong dancer Mo Li
Father reveals progress in rehabilitation but says ‘path to recovery is still a marathon’
“It has been over 3½ years. Throughout this long journey, Mo’s body has been like a computer that suddenly shut down – severed nerves cut off all connections. When the system finally rebooted, the old settings had completely vanished,” his father, Reverend Derek Li Shing-lam, said in a prayer letter posted on social media.
“However, we have recently witnessed a small but precious breakthrough: he has begun to slowly differentiate the sensation of his bladder and bowel movements.”
He added that the breakthrough was still far from that of a normal person; it was the result of constant neural pairing and training.
It was the 176th such prayer letter since Mo Li was crushed by a falling four-by-four-metre screen in July 2022. The 500kg (1,102lbs) LED panel fell from the ceiling of the Hong Kong Coliseum during a Mirror concert, leaving the dancer at risk of permanent paralysis.

Record 1,000 UK taxpayers under 30 earned more than £1m last year

Their generation is often derided for being work-shy, self-centred and overly sensitive. But when it comes to making money, people under 30 are proving they are something else entirely: successful.
A record 1,000 taxpayers under 30 earned more than £1m last year, an 11% increase on the year before, HMRC records show.
In total, these earners took home more than £3bn in the past year, making an average of £3m each.
Lubbock Fine, the accountancy firm which obtained the figures from HMRC, suggested that the surge could partly be driven by influencers’ income from marketing spend on social media platforms such as Instagram, TikTok and YouTube.
The record increase may also be down to bigger pay deals for sports, music and media stars, as well as higher salaries in technology and financial services, the accountancy firm suggested.
Under 30s now account for roughly 3% of all £1m+ earners and are thought to include Erling Haaland, the 25-year-old Manchester City striker who is estimated to earn £525,000 a week (about £27.3m a year) and 26-year-old Molly-Mae Hague, a former Love Island contestant and influencer who is reported to command up to £60,000 per post.
Overall, there are now 31,000 taxpayers who earn £1m a year or more, which is only a 1% rise on the year before.
This indicates the number of very high earners under 30 is increasing at a much faster pace than the number of high earners in older age groups.
But earning so much when you are young does not necessarily mean you will be wealthy for life, warned Russell Rich, head of sports and entertainment for Lubbock Fine. “Footballers, boxers, and sports people generally tend to live beyond their means when they retire,” he told the Times. “People in the arts also do not tend to be good at saving and investing the money they make.”
The number of people under 30 who earn over £1m has risen by 54% since the pandemic, when just 650 young taxpayers were recorded by HMRC in this income bracket.
Over roughly the same period, the amount spent on influencer marketing in the UK tripled to £917m, according to Lubbock Fine, and is predicted to exceed £1bn this year.
But it is not just young people who are cashing in – older generations are now waking up to their earning potential as influencers. Research from media analysts Ampere recently found it was people in the 55 to 64 age bracket who were delivering the highest growth in YouTube traffic, up 20% since 2020 in the US and 14% in the UK. TikTok, too, has had a 16% rise in British users in this age bracket in the past year.
“We’ve been seeing this trend over the last few years where older audiences who have traditionally [focused on] linear and broadcast TV have been digitising,” Minal Modha, the head of Ampere’s consumer research division, told the Guardian in December.
High profile older influencers include Caroline Idiens, a 53-year-old personal trainer from Berkshire who has 2.4m followers on Instagram, and Valerie Mackay, 62, who posts about her life as an older woman as @embracingfifty.
However, their reach still pales in comparison to the likes of Abby Roberts, a 24-year-old makeup influencer and music artist who has 15 million followers on TikTok and reportedly earns £14,000 per post.

250,000 rally in Munich against Iran’s regime as Pahlavi urges ‘global day of action’
On sidelines of global security conference, crowds wave imperial flags and chant ‘long live the shah,’ urging regime change a month after brutal protest crackdown
MUNICH, Germany — About 250,000 people joined a demonstration against the Iranian government in Munich on Saturday, police said, as world leaders gathered nearby for a security conference.
The protesters rallied on Munich’s Theresienwiese fairgrounds, denouncing the leadership of Iran’s Islamic Republic following the deadly repression of nationwide protests in January.
The demonstration was held as the exiled son of the former shah of Iran, Reza Pahlavi, spoke nearby at the Munich Security Conference and called on US President Donald Trump to “help” the Iranian people.
Pahlavi, who has lived in exile since his father was overthrown in the 1979 revolution, urged an outside “humanitarian intervention to prevent more innocent lives being killed” in Iran.
Banging drums and chanting for regime change, the large and boisterous demonstration in Munich was part of what Pahlavi described as a “global day of action” to support Iranians in the wake of deadly nationwide protests. Pahlavi also called for rallies in Los Angeles and Toronto. German police said in a post on X that the number of protesters in Munich reached some 250,000, more than the organizers had expected.
“Change, change, regime change” chanted the crowd, as well as “Javid shah” (long live the shah)” while waving green-white-and-red flags with lion and sun emblems. Iran used that flag before its 1979 Islamic Revolution that toppled the Pahlavi dynasty.
Some demonstrators sported “Make Iran Great Again” red caps, mimicking the MAGA caps worn by Trump’s supporters. Many waved placards showing Pahlavi, some that called him a king. The son of Iran’s deposed shah has been in exile for nearly 50 years but is trying to position himself as a player in Iran’s future.
“We have huge hopes and [are] looking forward that the regime is going to change hopefully,” said Daniyal Mohtashamian, a demonstrator.
The crowd chanted “Pahlavi for Iran” and “democracy for Iran” as drums and cymbals sounded.
Mohtashamian said he traveled from Zurich, in Switzerland, to speak up for protesters inside Iran who faced repression.
“There is an internet blackout and their voices are not going outside of Iran,” he said.
Iranian leaders are already under intense pressure, facing renewed threats of US military action. Trump wants Iran to further scale back its nuclear program. He suggested Friday that regime change in Iran “would be the best thing that could happen.”
Iran was also the focus of protests in Munich on Friday, the opening day of the annual security conference in the city gathering European leaders and global security figures. Supporters of the Iranian opposition group People’s Mujahedeen Organization of Iran, also known as the Mujahedeen-e-Khalq, demonstrated against Iran’s deadly crackdown on protesters last month.
“The Iranian regime is a dead regime,” a 62-year-old protester originally from Iran who gave his name only as Said told AFP on Saturday. “It must be game over.”
At a news conference in Munich, Pahlavi warned of the likelihood of more deaths in Iran if “democracies stand by and watch.”
“We gather at an hour of profound peril to ask: Will the world stand with the people of Iran?” he asked.
He added that the Iranian government’s continued survival “sends a clear signal to every bully: kill enough people and you stay in power.”
“To President Trump… The Iranian people heard you say help is on the way, and they have faith in you. Help them,” Pahlavi continued. “It is time to end the Islamic Republic. This is the demand echoing from the bloodshed of my compatriots who are not asking us to fix the regime but to help them bury it.”
According to the US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency, at least 7,005 people were killed in the crackdown, mostly protesters, though rights groups warn the toll is likely far higher. More than 53,000 people have been arrested, the group added.
Iran’s government offered its only death toll on January 21, saying 3,117 people were killed. Iran’s theocracy in the past has undercounted or not reported fatalities from past unrest.
The Associated Press has been unable to independently assess the death toll, given that authorities have disrupted internet access and international calls in Iran.

US military reports a series of airstrikes against Islamic State targets in Syria
The U.S. military is reporting a series of strikes against Islamic State group targets in Syria
- Bookmark
The U.S. military on Saturday reported a series of strikes against Islamic State group targets in Syria in retaliation for the December ambush that killed two U.S. soldiers and one American civilian interpreter.
U.S. Central Command said in a statement that American aircraft had conducted 10 strikes against more than 30 IS targets between Feb. 3 and Thursday, hitting weapons storage facilities and other infrastructure.
At least 50 members of IS have been killed or captured, while more than 100 IS targets have been struck since the United States began its strikes after the Dec. 13 ambush, according to Central Command. That attack killed Sgt. Edgar Brian Torres-Tovar, Sgt. William Nathaniel Howard, and Ayad Mansoor Sakat, the civilian interpreter.
Meanwhile, the Syrian Defense Ministry said Thursday that government forces took control of a base in the east of the country that was run for years by U.S. troops as part of the fight against IS. The Al-Tanf base played a major role after IS declared a caliphate in large parts of Syria and Iraq in 2014.
The U.S. military on Friday completed the transfer of thousands of IS detainees from Syria to Iraq, where they are expected to stand trial. The prisoners were sent to Iraq at the request of Baghdad, in a move welcomed by the U.S.-led coalition that had for years fought against IS.

Pots, mop buckets, even babies: Anything can be a curling stone if you get creative
People are turning household items into curling gear
- Bookmark
Dig out your squidgy mop, a few pots and pans — or a robotic vacuum if you have one — and a pair of slippers.
It’s curling time!
Social media has been ablaze with people deploying common household wares to mimic what the world’s top curlers are doing at the Winter Olympics.
“Every four years, it blows up,” American curler Tara Peterson said. “Everyone’s like, ‘We want to do it,’ and then, yes, they get creative with things, so it’s awesome.”
Creative is perhaps an understatement. In one video, two jacketed adults push a baby in a car seat across the ice, chest-bumping in glee. In another, popular Swedish comedian Mans Moller dons a wig a la Isabella Wrana, the Swedish mixed doubles champion, and slides pans into other pans, screaming “CUUUURL!” (Bonus points: He's outside, like the olden days of curling.)
Then there are the Italian nonnas in the country's southern Puglia region pushing a silver pot along a stony courtyard, sweeping with broomsticks. Or the hair salon in the Swedish city of Sundsvall, where a stylist hurls hair products toward her colleague. She screams “Curl!” and looks frustrated when the colleague approaches with a — wait for it — curling iron.
Despite such valiant attempts by the public, curlers say you really do need some specialized equipment to do the sport properly (along with a sheet of pebbled ice).
Put on your curling shoes
You can't use your normal sneakers to go curling. You'll just slip a lot on the ice. Instead, you'll need specialist curling shoes that have grips either built into the soles or those that can be strapped on.
Costs vary but Swedish curler Johanna Heldin said you can pay up to around $700 for them.
Styles vary, too. While most curlers at the Olympics are wearing plain black curling shoes, some have a more casual look — like Taylor Anderson-Heide of the United States, who has donned white, sneaker-style shoes in Cortina.
Sweeping left, sweeping right
Despite sharing the same name, curling brooms and cleaning brooms are very different.
Curling brooms swap carbon fiber for the wooden or plastic rods typical of household brooms. Nylon pads replace straw bristles. Olympic-level models will set you back around $200-$250, Peterson said.
Broom lightness directly correlates to a curler's control over a stone's speed and trajectory. The lighter the broom, the quicker the sweep and the faster the melting of ice pebbles that make up a curling sheet.
In fact, sweeping technology has actually grown so advanced that certain models have been banned from competition. That's what led to the “Broomgate” scandal, which rocked the curling world beginning in 2015.
Curlers began debuting high-tech brooms that gave sweepers so much control over the stone that the skill of the thrower failed to matter. Those kinds of brooms were then barred from competition by World Curling, which now maintains strict parameters on what kinds of brooms are allowed.
Rock ‘n’ roll
The homegrown curling seen on social media makes one thing clear: To the public, anything can be a curling stone.
Even if pots, pans, hair products — and even babies — can do the trick in a pinch, they're nothing like the curling stones on the ice in Cortina.
If you want Olympic-level material, you'll have to look to the uninhabited isle of Ailsa Cragi, located 10 miles (16 kilometers) off the coast of Scotland.
All the stones at these Games are made of the super-dense granite from that isle, manufactured by Kays Curling.
The company has a history with the Olympics dating back to the first winter edition in 1924 in Chamonix, France. The curling competition then was long thought to have been an exhibition event but eventually was confirmed as official. The company has continued to make stones for the Games since curling returned as a medal sport in Nagano 1998.

Drone pilot who flew over firefighters battling huge blaze given four-figure fine in ‘first conviction of its kind’
An amateur drone pilot who piloted the aircraft over a large factory fire as emergency services responded has been sentenced in what police say is the first conviction of its kind.
Christopher McEwen, 46, of Crome Road, Norwich, pleaded guilty to 17 offences including flying a drone close to where an emergency response is ongoing, Norfolk Police said.
A court heard McEwen flew his drone over an industrial fire at a disused factory in Norwich in January last year three times as firefighters, police and ambulance crews were at work, with police releasing footage recorded by the device.
McEwen was ordered to pay a £2,000 fine sentenced at Norwich Magistrates’ Court on Friday (13 February) and to hand over his £3,000 DJI Mavic 3 Pro Cine drone for destruction.

Zelenskyy, NATO chief Rutte discuss PURL initiative, air defense funding
'We are counting on continued funding for this initiative, which enables us to purchase missiles for air defense systems,' says Ukrainian leader
ISTANBUL
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy met NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte in Munich to discuss the funding and expansion of the Prioritized Ukraine Requirements List (PURL) initiative, which facilitates the purchase of missiles for air defense systems, his office said.
"Ukraine deeply values every country’s contribution. We are counting on continued funding for this initiative, which enables us to purchase missiles for air defense systems," Zelenskyy said during the meeting held on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference.
He said the discussion touched upon strengthening Ukraine's defense capabilities through joint ventures in Europe and expressed gratitude for the "highly productive" meeting in the Ramstein format, where partners confirmed the allocation of €38 billion in military aid for the war-torn country.
At the annual forum, Zelenskyy termed European "unity" as the "best interceptor" against threats. He also insisted that elections in Ukraine can only take place two months after a ceasefire with Russia is declared.

European nations accuse Kremlin of using dart frog toxin to poison Alexei Navalny

European nations accuse Kremlin of using dart frog toxin to poison Alexei Navalny
Group of 5 countries reveals that testing ‘confirmed the presence of epibatidine’ in body of Russian opposition leader, whose widow says ‘murderer’ Putin ‘must be held accountable’
LONDON — Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny was poisoned by the Kremlin with a rare and lethal toxin found in the skin of poison dart frogs, five European countries said Saturday.
The foreign ministries of the UK, France, Germany, Sweden and the Netherlands said analysis of samples taken from Navalny’s body “conclusively confirmed the presence of epibatidine.” It is a neurotoxin found in the skin of dart frogs in South America that is not found naturally in Russia, they said.
The countries said in a joint statement that “Russia had the means, motive and opportunity to administer this poison.” They said they were reporting Russia to the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons for a breach of the Chemical Weapons Convention.
They made the announcement as Navalny’s widow Yulia Navalnaya attended the Munich Security Conference in Germany as the second anniversary of Navalny’s death approaches.
Navalny, who crusaded against official corruption and staged massive anti-Kremlin protests as President Vladimir Putin’s fiercest foe, died in an Arctic penal colony on February 16, 2024. He was serving a 19-year sentence that he believed to be politically motivated.
“Russia saw Navalny as a threat,” British Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper said. “By using this form of poison, the Russian state demonstrated the despicable tools it has at its disposal and the overwhelming fear it has of political opposition.”
Navalny’s widow said last year that two independent labs had found that her husband was poisoned shortly before he died. Navalnaya has repeatedly blamed Putin for Navalny’s death, something Russian officials have vehemently denied.
Navalnaya said Saturday that she had been “certain from the first day” that her husband had been poisoned, “but now there is proof.”
“Putin killed Alexei with chemical weapon,” she wrote on social network X, calling Putin “a murderer” who “must be held accountable.”
Russian authorities said that the politician became ill after a walk and died from natural causes.
Epibatidine is found naturally in dart frogs in the wild, and can also be manufactured in a lab, which European scientists suspect was the case with the substance used on Navalny. It works on the body in a similar way to nerve agents, causing shortness of breath, convulsions, seizures, a slowed heart rate and ultimately death.
Navalny was the target of an earlier poisoning in 2020, with a nerve agent in an attack he blamed on the Kremlin, which always denied involvement. His family and allies fought to have him flown to Germany for treatment and recovery. Five months later, he returned to Russia, where he was immediately arrested and imprisoned for the last three years of his life.
The UK has accused Russia of repeatedly flouting international bans on chemical and biological weapons. It has accused the Kremlin of carrying out a 2018 attack in the English city of Salisbury that targeted a former Russian intelligence officer, Sergei Skripal, with the nerve agent Novichok. A British inquiry concluded that the attack “must have been authorized at the highest level, by President Putin.”
The Kremlin has denied involvement.

'Extermination' of Palestinians must stop: African Union chair
The "extermination" of the Palestinian people must end, the chairman of the African Union Commission Mahmoud Ali Youssouf said on Saturday as he launched the organisation's 39th summit.
"In the Middle East, Palestine and the suffering of its people also challenge our consciences. The extermination of this people must stop," said Youssouf, who was elected to head the institution a year ago.
The Gaza Strip, a small territory surrounded by Israel, Egypt, and the Mediterranean Sea, has been under a very strict Israeli siege since the start of the war triggered by Hamas's deadly attack on October 7, 2023.
That attack resulted in the deaths of 1,221 people on the Israeli side, mostly civilians, according to Israeli figures.
Since then, at least 71,667 Palestinians have been killed in the small coastal territory by Israel's military campaign, according to Gaza's health ministry.
He also touched on the multiple conflicts raging in Africa.
"From Sudan to the Sahel, to eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, in Somalia and elsewhere, our people continue to pay the heavy price of instability," Youssouf said.
The summit brings together heads of state from the 55 member states of the African Union over two days.
This year's theme is water sanitation.

'They ignored him like air': military prison conditions under scrutiny after officer’s death on camera
Unknown

15:52:36 UTC
00:52:36 KST

Footage broadcast by Kan 11 last week showing Capt. Tomer Eiges convulsing before his death at Military Prison 10 has renewed scrutiny of conditions at the facility and the treatment of soldiers held there.
Since the video aired, ynet spoke with former and current inmates who served sentences at the military prison, most for relatively minor offenses. Several described instances of humiliation, threats or dismissive treatment by guards, who are themselves soldiers.
Day-to-day supervision of inmates is carried out by young soldiers ages 18 to 21, overseen by officers, some in mandatory service and others career personnel. Military prison guards undergo training at Bahad 13, the Military Police training base, but often arrive at the prison just months after enlistment and, according to former inmates, may lack the mental preparedness required for the responsibility.
Some former prisoners described certain guards as confused, unmotivated or unaware of the gravity of their role.
The prison includes a separate wing for officers and military police, where conditions are somewhat better, as well as other wings that house soldiers according to the severity of their offenses, including an isolation unit. Still, former inmates said soldiers convicted of serious offenses are at times held in the same cell as those jailed for far lesser violations, some of them noncriminal.
The role of a military guard is meant to resemble that of a soldier-commander to the inmates, many of whom are otherwise normative soldiers sentenced for disciplinary or operational violations. Unlike in civilian life, some soldiers are jailed for offenses that might result in a warning or minor disciplinary action outside the military, including cannabis use, absence without leave, insubordination or minor altercations.
According to testimonies, conditions in certain prison companies resemble those of a harsh civilian jail.
Many guards act appropriately and humanely, and no one expects prison to be a pleasant experience. But in such a system, a single failure can have grave consequences.
That was the case on the eve of the Jewish holiday of Shavuot, when Eiges — until recently an intelligence officer identified publicly only as “Capt. T. from Military Intelligence” — collapsed and convulsed in his cell. According to the footage aired by Kan 11, no one reviewed security camera feeds or responded promptly to shouts from his cellmates as he struggled.
Even after guards arrived, the video appears to show confusion about how to respond. For an extended period, they did not touch Eiges or evacuate him on a stretcher. The call to the Magen David Adom emergency medical service was reportedly delayed, and he received initial medical treatment only after it was too late.
‘His eyes were screaming’
One of the soldiers interviewed, identified as T., said he spent a total of six months in military prison in 2020 and 2021 — during periods when Eiges was held in Prison 6 and Prison 10. T. described what he called “inappropriate treatment, to put it mildly,” by prison guards.
“They treat you like you’re an animal,” he said. “The tone of voice, the facial expressions, the commands, the humiliations. These aren’t people who committed rape, pedophilia or murder. In most cases, it’s some kid who was absent without leave for 20 days. I lost 10 kilograms in one month there. The food was awful. Inedible.”
T. said he also witnessed the guards’ treatment of Eiges. “In Prison 6, I remember they told us he had AIDS. He was in isolation and you couldn’t see him,” he said.
“Later, in Prison 10, I saw him a few times in the dining hall or during roll calls and heard them call his name. He wasn’t that isolated. Everyone had access to him. Anyone could go sit next to him on a bench. In Prison 6, they spoke to him like he was an animal. I was in prison when he started fainting. They ignored him, like he was air. No one cared.”
During one encounter, T. and Eiges briefly spoke. “After roll call, we went into the dining hall with him. He sat with everyone, but at the end, closest to the commanders. He didn’t talk much,” T. recalled.
“I sat at his table and asked him for something and he asked me for something too. I knew who he was, that he was Prisoner X and that he was special. I asked him a question and he looked at me. His eyes were a little scary, unhealthy. He had a look of death. Like he’d been torn apart inside. His eyes were screaming. He suffered a lot and you could see it.”
T. said he was shocked when he saw the footage of Eiges dying in the military prison. “How can something like this happen?” he asked. “I would steal a lighter and light a cigarette — and the guards would show up within two minutes. They would arrive quickly. They ignored him on a level worse than a boycott.”
In another incident, T. said he was speaking with his mother on the phone when a guard entered and ordered him to end the call. “I wanted to finish the call calmly so I wouldn’t worry my mom — and he screamed at me,” T. recalled.
“So I slammed the phone down and he got angry and threw me into solitary, and there they humiliated me badly. For two hours they made me stand at attention and at ease, and for two hours say ‘Yes, commander,’ while three guards watched me. They put me in a cell with walls smeared with feces and blood. It was unbearably hot and I was drenched in sweat.”
He described “constant yelling,” saying, “They treat you like a rag.” If someone did not listen or obey, he said, “they would line him up in front of the company, shout at him to take his things and throw him into solitary. In Prison 4 and Prison 6, solitary is a cell with a stone bed. In Prison 10, it’s a room about one meter by one and a half meters. You can barely move.”
According to T., “The light is on 24/7 and you’re not allowed to sleep during the day, only from 10 p.m. It’s real abuse of human beings. If you fall asleep, they wake you by screaming and punish you.”
The IDF said in a statement: “Abuse of inmates during their stay in military prison is contrary to the law and IDF regulations and is strictly prohibited. The detention facility is continuously monitored and under commanders’ supervision. Concrete complaints regarding inappropriate conduct by prison staff or inadequate conditions are reviewed by the relevant authorities and addressed accordingly. In cases where suspicion arises of irregular conduct or a criminal offense, investigations are opened by the appropriate investigative unit.”

Ukrainian Engineers Localized Production of Spare Parts for Western Armored Vehicles
Unknown

00:50:56 KST

Ukrainian engineers are restoring armored vehicles that Western partners had sent for dismantling for spare parts.
This was reported in an interview with Militarnyi by Major Ihor Simutin of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, one of the best specialists in vehicle repair in the Logistics Forces.
According to him, at a certain stage of the war, the US began to saturate the Ukrainian fleet with fourth-category equipment in order to use it for spare parts for the existing fleet. This applies in general to M-ATVs and HMMWVs.
“At the first stage, HMMWVs were taken from US military units in storage, most of which were serviceable. But in order to saturate us more, they began to supply fourth-category vehicles,” Simutin said.
The fourth category of serviceability means that the equipment is formally considered unfit for use. The only category worse than this is the fifth category, which is essentially scrap metal.
However, the repairmen refused to dismantle them and returned such vehicles to service.
“We repaired one of two or three, and then we even got those and continued working on them,” the officer added.
Some of the armored vehicles arrived in Ukraine directly from their previous service locations in arid regions of the world. During technical inspection and flushing of the systems, Ukrainian engineers found specific ‘Iraqi clay’ and fine sand in the tanks and filters.
In addition to sand, some units of equipment had clear signs of having been in water.
In parallel with the repairs, the Armed Forces of Ukraine launched a large-scale program to localize the production of spare parts.
“All types of rubber products, all silent blocks, bushings, dust covers, armored windshields of any class, plastic elements, plastic hoods, metal roofs, metal doors, radiator cores, radiators of any type, repair of all types of engines and automatic transmissions — all of this is localized in the Armed Forces,” Simutin listed.
This was a necessary step to reduce dependence on long delivery times for original components from abroad.

Territorial concessions by Ukraine won't bring peace, Zelensky says in Munich
Unknown
Unknown Publisher

15:49:42 UTC
00:49:42 KST

President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Feb. 14 that territorial concessions by Ukraine would not bring peace, just as the 1938 Munich Agreement did not prevent World War II.
"It would be an illusion to believe that this war can now be reliably ended by dividing Ukraine — just as it was an illusion to believe that sacrificing Czechoslovakia would save Europe from a greater war," Zelensky said at the Munich Security Conference.
The Munich Agreement was a compromise reached by Nazi Germany, the U.K., France, and Italy in 1938, allowing German dictator Adolf Hitler to annex Czechoslovakia's Sudetenland region. The agreement was touted as an effort to prevent a war but did not achieve its goal, with Germany invading Poland the following year.
It has since become the primary historical example of the failures of appeasement — the policy of granting concessions to an aggressor in hopes of achieving peace.
In his speech, Zelensky compared Russian President Vladimir Putin to the "previous Putin, who began dividing Europe" — a reference to Hitler.
As part of the ongoing peace talks between Moscow, Kyiv and Washington, Russia is demanding Ukraine's withdrawal from the parts of Donetsk Oblast that it still controls.
Zelensky has repeatedly stated that territorial concessions are unacceptable to Ukraine. He reiterated on Feb. 14 that concessions are often discussed during peace talks only in the context of Ukraine, not Russia.
Regarding elections, Zelensky said that Ukraine can make changes to its constitution and hold elections if there is a ceasefire. He added that Ukraine could also agree to a truce if Russia holds an election.
He also stressed that Ukraine will do "truly everything" to make these negotiations successful.
"Ukraine wants the result of all these efforts to be real security and real peace. Real peace. Not what came out of Geneva in 2021. Not what the Russians hope for, from this so-called spirit of Anchorage."
Zelensky's comments are a reference to Russian-U.S. talks held in Geneva in 2021 and in Anchorage, Alaska, in 2025.
Zelensky also argued that the absence of Europe at the negotiation table is a "big mistake."
"And it is we — Ukrainians — who are trying to bring Europe fully into the process, so that Europe's interests and voice are taken into account," he added.
In later remarks to journalists, Zelensky said that the U.S. had offered Ukraine a 15-year security guarantee as part of a peace deal, but that Kyiv is looking for guarantees that last at least 20 years.
"Today we have a proposal from the American side for 15 years," he said at a briefing.
We want to have 20 years plus. 30, 50 ... We'll see what the administration and Congress will do."
Following the briefing, Zelensky held private talks with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio.

Estonian Foreign Minister Margus Tsahkna told the Kyiv Independent that Zelensky's message was "very clear".
"The first thing is that the Ukrainian people are fighting and not giving in. This is most important. And second, that Putin is not changing the goal," Tsahkna said.
Tsahkna added that the Ukrainian people are willing to stop the war, but not under any conditions, as "Putin is actually not willing to change the goals."
"Putin will continue the aggressive behavior, and Ukraine is protecting Europe," he said. "And the other way around, Ukraine is an opportunity for Europe."
NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said at the conference that Russia does not seek a peace agreement, as indicated by the appointment of Vladimir Madinsky, a controversial Putin aide and historian, to the Russian negotiating team.
The return of Medinsky signals a potential hardening of Moscow's stance during the negotiations, given his history of uncompromising rhetoric in previous rounds of talks.
During the conference, Zelensky also met Rutte to discuss the funding of the PURL initiative and its further development.
Signed by the U.S. and NATO in July 2025, the Prioritized Ukraine Requirements List (PURL) agreement lays out a mechanism for NATO member states and partners to purchase high-priority equipment for Ukraine.
"We are counting on continued funding for this initiative, which enables us to purchase missiles for air defense systems," Zelenky wrote on X.
Zelensky also thanked for a "highly productive meeting" in the Ramstein format. After the meeting, the allocation of €38 billion in military aid for Ukraine was confirmed, Zelensky said.

Austrian minister deletes post accusing UN rapporteur of hate speech
European lawmakers back Francesca Albanese amid disinformation dispute
PARIS
Austrian Foreign Minister Beate Meinl-Reisinger deleted a social media post accusing UN Special Rapporteur on the occupied Palestinian territories Francesca Albanese of spreading hate speech after the claim was based on disinformation that distorted her remarks.
Meinl-Reisinger had posted on the US-based platform X that Albanese “brands Israel wholesale as an ‘enemy of humanity.’” She added: “Criticism of Israel's actions is legitimate, and Austria has always demanded compliance with international law.”
The Austrian minister shared the post following claims by senior politicians in France that Albanese had described “Israel as the common enemy of humanity,” a statement widely criticized as disinformation.
In the same deleted post, Meinl-Reisinger wrote: “Albanese, however, is spreading hate speech. Such language undermines the impartiality and highest standards required of a UN representative. Unfortunately, Ms. Albanese has repeatedly failed to meet these standards.”
Shoura Hashemi, a director of Amnesty International Austria, said on social media that Meinl-Reisinger had deleted the post containing false information about Albanese. Tagging the minister, Hashemi asked, “Where is the apology?” and questioned whether she would take responsibility for what she called a serious mistake.
Czech Republic echoes disinformation
In a statement on social media, the Czech Foreign Ministry said: “Patience has its limits. UN Special Rapporteur Francesca Albanese should resign from her position. Her latest statements, in which she described Israel as a ‘common enemy of humanity,’ are unacceptable and indefensible.”
Over 100 European lawmakers voice support for Albanese
French member of the European Parliament Manon Aubry said on X that “With more than 100 MEPs across Europe, we stand in support of Francesca Albanese, who is the target of a smear campaign by the French government over statements she never made. Rather than attacking the UN Special Rapporteur, France should take action to bring an end to the genocide in Gaza.”
Aubry shared a joint statement signed by more than 100 lawmakers from several countries, including France, the Netherlands, Denmark, Portugal, Italy, Sweden and Spain.
The statement backed Albanese and condemned the French government’s call for her resignation, saying it was based on distorted remarks and manipulated content, and reaffirmed support for international law.
French lawmaker presses FM Barrot
Among the signatories, Mathilde Panot, deputy head of the French National Assembly, tagged French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot on social media and questioned him over the claims.
Panot said Barrot had made what she described as a serious false statement in the National Assembly about remarks Albanese never made. “Your silence is deafening … When do you intend to offer your apologies?” she wrote.
Disinformation initiated by French lawmaker
The controversy began after French lawmaker Caroline Yadan addressed Barrot in parliament on Feb. 11, claiming that during a forum organized by Al Jazeera in Qatar on Feb. 7, Albanese had described Israel as “the common enemy of humanity.”
“Mr. Minister, will you confirm that France will make its voice heard for Albanese’s immediate removal from any UN post?” Yadan asked.
In response, Barrot told parliament that France “unequivocally condemns the outrageous and reprehensible remarks” of Albanese, which he said targeted “not the Israeli government … but Israel as a people and as a nation.”
Germany, Austria and Italy also reacted to the claims and criticized Albanese.
In France, two separate criminal complaints were filed against senior politicians for allegedly spreading disinformation by distorting Albanese’s statements.

Russia's behavior 'crazy at every level' – Rutte on war grinder
This is according to NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte who spoke during a discussion at the Munich Security Conference, an Ukrinform correspondent reports.
"One, we have to realize the Russians are not winning this war," Rutte said, adding that Russia lost 65,000 soldiers in the past two months alone as they made only fairly small gains.
"If there is a dictator in Moscow willing to do that, to get so many officers killed in that war, we have to take that seriously, because this is crazy behavior at every level," believes Rutte.
In this context, Rutte called on Ukraine's partners to make sure Ukraine has all it needs to defend itself, including capabilities to shoot down incoming missiles and also hit targets in Russia's rear.
Commenting on military aid initiatives, including PURL where European nations procure critical US weapons for Ukraine, Rutte also noted bilateral contributions on the part of Europeans and Canada.
At the same time, he urged partners to provide aid in line with Ukraine's real priorities.
"Please use what the Supreme Allied Commander Europe has drawn up together with the Ukrainians, the list of stuff they need, don't give bilateral stuff outside," Rutte said, admitting that such assistance might still look nice and "gives you nice pictures and photographs in the newspapers."
"We know exactly what they need," Rutte noted, recalling that NSATU, the NATO structure set up in Wiesbaden, is doing a good job coordinating such assistance.
As Ukrinform reported, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte rejected any history-related arguments put forward by Russia in an attempt to justify its military aggression against Ukraine.

Russia poisoned Navalny, according to five European countries' scientific findings

The heads of French, British, German, Dutch and Swedish diplomacy said that 'only the Russian state had the means, the motive and the contempt for international law' to carry out this attack.
Five European countries, including the UK, France and Germany, accused Russia on Saturday of poisoning opposition politician Alexei Navalny in prison in 2024 using a rare toxin, on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference.
"We know that the Russian state used this deadly toxin to target Navalny, fearing his opposition," the UK Foreign Office said in a joint statement with Sweden, France, the Netherlands and Germany on the eve of the second anniversary of the death of the fierce critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin.
The UK also said it had referred Russia to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW).
The foreign ministries of the UK, France, Germany, Sweden and the Netherlands said on Saturday that the analysis of samples taken from Navalny, who died two years ago, "conclusively confirmed the presence of epibatidine," which is a toxin found in South American dendrobatid frogs.
These countries claimed that "only the Russian state had the means, the motive and the contempt for international law to carry out this attack."
Navalny, who waged a fierce battle against corruption and organised large-scale anti-Kremlin protests as a fierce opponent of President Vladimir Putin, died in the Arctic prison colony in February 2024. He was serving a 19-year sentence that was believed to be politically motivated.
Navalny's widow, Yulia Navalnaya, said last year that two independent laboratories had concluded that he had been poisoned shortly before his death. She has repeatedly accused Putin of being responsible for Navalny's death, which the Russian authorities have categorically denied.
Navalny's murder now a scientifically proven fact, says widow
"The assassination of Russian opponent Alexei Navalny in an Arctic prison in 2024 is now a scientifically proven fact," his widow, Yulia Navalnaya, said on Saturday, after five European countries claimed that Moscow had used a lethal toxic agent against the Kremlin opponent.
"Two years ago, I came here and said that Vladimir Putin had killed my husband," she said on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference.
"Of course, I was certain that it was murder... but at the time, they were just words. Today, those words have become scientifically proven facts," she added.
The findings are based on independent laboratory analysis of biological samples that were secretly smuggled out of Russia. A public summary of the full technical report submitted to the OPCW is likely to be released on the OPCW official website.

Protests, poisoning and prison: The life of Alexei Navalny and his opposition to Vladimir Putin
Alexei Navalny was a fierce critic of Russian president Vladimir Putin
- Bookmark
Alexei Navalny, a thorn in the side of the Kremlin and Russia’s most prominent political dissident, died in prison after being poisoned by the Kremlin, the UK and its European allies have said.
Navalny, a fierce critic of Russian president Vladimir Putin, died while serving a 19-year jail term in a penal colony around 40 miles of the Arctic Circle in charges widely thought to be politically motivated.
He died in February 2024 after going for a walk at the jail and losing consciousness.
The political agitator has been behind bars since January 2021, when he returned to Moscow after recuperating in Germany from nerve agent poisoning that he blamed on the Kremlin.
Before his arrest, he campaigned against official corruption, organized major anti-Kremlin protests and ran for public office.
Now, Britain, France, Germany, Sweden and the Netherlands have said that he died after being poisoned with a lethal dart frog toxin - a development which has prompted his widow to call for Vladimir Putin to be held “accountable”.
Here's a look at Navalny’s life, political activism and the charges he has faced through the years:
1976
4 June 4 — Navalny is born in a western part of the Moscow region.
1997
Graduates from Russia’s RUDN university, where he majored in law; earns a degree in economics in 2001 while working as a lawyer.
2004

2008
Gains notoriety for alleging corruption in state-run corporations, such as gas giant Gazprom and oil behemoth Rosneft, through his blogs and other posts.
2010
Founds RosPil, an anti-corruption project run by a team of lawyers that analyzes spending of state agencies and companies, exposing violations and contesting them in court.
2011
December- Participates in mass protests sparked by reports of widespread rigging of Russia’s parliamentary election, and is arrested and jailed for 15 days for “defying a government official.”
2012
March - Following Mr Putin’s reelection and inauguration, mass protests break out in Moscow and elsewhere. Navalny accuses key figures, including then-Deputy Prime Minister Igor Shuvalov and Chechnya’s strongman leader, Ramzan Kadyrov, of corruption.
July - Russia’s Investigative Committee charges Navalny with embezzlement involving Kirovles, a state-owned timber company in the Kirov region, while acting as an adviser to the local governor. Navalny rejects the allegations as politically motivated.
December — The Investigative Committee launches another probe into alleged embezzlement at a Navalny-linked Russian subsidiary of Yves Rocher, a French cosmetics company. Navalny again says the allegations are politically motivated.
2013
Navalny runs for mayor in Moscow — a move the authorities not only allow but encourage in an attempt to put a veneer of democracy on the race that is designed to boost the profile of the incumbent, Sergei Sobyanin.
July - A court in Kirov convicts Navalny of embezzlement in the Kirovles case, sentencing him to five years in prison. The prosecution petitions to release Navalny from custody pending his appeal, and he resumes his campaign.
September — Official results show Navalny finishes second in the mayor’s race behind Sobyanin, with 27% of the vote, after a successful electoral and fundraising campaign collecting an unprecedented 97.3 million rubles ($2.9 million) from individual supporters.
October — A court hands Navalny a suspended sentence in the Kirovles case. February 2014 — Navalny is placed under house arrest in connection with the Yves Rocher case and banned from using the internet. His blog continues to be updated regularly, presumably by his team, detailing alleged corruption by various Russian officials.
December — Navalny and his brother, Oleg, are found guilty of fraud in the Yves Rocher case. Navalny receives a 3 ½-year suspended sentence, while his brother is handed a prison term. Both appeal to the European Court of Human Rights.
2015
December — Navalny’s Foundation for Fighting Corruption releases its first long-form video — a YouTube documentary called “Chaika,” which means “seagull” in Russian but is also the last name of then-Prosecutor General Yury Chaika.
The 44-minute video accuses him of corruption and alleged ties to a notorious criminal group and has piled up 26 million views on YouTube. Chaika and other Russian officials deny the accusations.
2016
February — The European Court of Human Rights rules that Russia violated Navalny’s right to a fair trial in the Kirovles case, ordering the government to pay his legal costs and damages.
November — Russia’s Supreme Court overturns Navalny’s sentence and sends the case back to the original court in the city of Kirov for review.
December — Navalny announces he will run in Russia’s 2018 presidential election.
2017
February — The Kirov court retries Navalny and upholds his five-year suspended sentence from 2013.
March — Navalny releases a YouTube documentary accusing then-Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev of corruption, getting over 7 million views in its first week. A series of anti-graft protests across Russia draw tens of thousands and there are mass arrests. Navalny tours the country to open campaign offices, holds big rallies and is jailed repeatedly for unauthorized demonstrations.
27 April — Unidentified assailants throw a green disinfectant in his face, damaging his right eye. He blames the attack on the Kremlin.
October — The European Court of Human Rights finds Navalny’s fraud conviction in the Yves Rocher case to be “arbitrary and manifestly unreasonable.”
December — Russia’s Central Electoral Commission bars him from running for president over his conviction in the Kirovles case, a move condemned by the EU as casting “serious doubt” on the election.
2019
July — Members of Navalny’s team, along with other opposition activists, are barred from running for Moscow city council, sparking protests that are violently dispersed, with thousands arrested. Navalny’s team responds by promoting the “Smart Voting” strategy, encouraging the election of any candidate except those from the Kremlin’s United Russia party. The strategy works, with the party losing its majority.
2020
Navalny seeks to deploy the Smart Voting strategy during regional elections in September and tours Siberia as part of the effort.
20 August — On a flight from the city of Tomsk, where he was working with local activists, Navalny falls ill and the plane makes an emergency landing in nearby Omsk. Hospitalized in a coma, Navalny’s team suspects he was poisoned.
22 August — A comatose Navalny is flown to a hospital in Berlin.
24 August — German authorities confirm Navalny was poisoned with a Soviet-era nerve agent. After he recovers, he blames the Kremlin, an accusation denied by Russian officials.
2021
17 January — After five months in Germany, Navalny is arrested upon his return to Russia, with authorities alleging his recuperation abroad violated the terms of his suspended sentence in the Yves Rocher case. His arrest triggers some of the biggest protests in Russia in years. Thousands are arrested.
2 February — A Moscow court orders Navalny to serve 2 ½ years in prison for his parole violation. While in prison, Navalny stages a three-week hunger strike to protest a lack of medical treatment and sleep deprivation.
June — A Moscow court outlaws Navalny’s Foundation for Fighting Corruption and about 40 regional offices as extremist, shutting down his political network. Close associates and team members face prosecution and leave Russia under pressure. Navalny maintains contact with his lawyers and team from prison, and they update his social media accounts.
2022
24 February — Russia invades Ukraine. Navalny condemns the war in social media posts from prison and during his court appearances.
22 March — Navalny is sentenced to an additional nine-year term for embezzlement and contempt of court in a case his supporters rejected as fabricated. He is transferred to a maximum-security prison in Russia’s western Vladimir region.
July — Navalny’s team announces the relaunch of the Anti-Corruption Foundation as an international organization with an advisory board including Francis Fukuyama, Anne Applebaum, and the European Parliament member and former Belgian Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt.
Navalny continues to file lawsuits in prison and tries to form a labor union in the facility. In response, penitentiary officials start regularly placing him in solitary confinement over purported disciplinary violations such as failing to properly button his garment or to wash his face at a specified time.
2023
Over 400 Russian doctors sign an open letter to Mr Putin, urging an end to what it calls abuse of Navalny, following reports that he was denied basic medication after getting the flu. His team expresses concern about his health, saying in April he had acute stomach pain and suspected he was being slowly poisoned.
12 March — “Navalny,” a film about the attempt on the opposition leader’s life, wins the Oscar for best documentary feature.
26 April — Appearing on a videolink from prison during a hearing, Navalny says he was facing new extremism and terrorism charges that could keep him behind bars for the rest of his life. He adds sardonically that the charges imply that “I’m conducting terror attacks while sitting in prison.”
19 June — The trial begins in a make-shift courtroom in the Penal Colony No. 6 where Navalny is being held. Soon after it starts, the judge closes the trial for the public and the media despite Navalny’s demand to keep it open.
20 July — The prosecution in its closing arguments asks the court to sentence Navalny to 20 years in prison, the politician's team reports. Navalny says in a subsequent statement that he expects his sentence to be “huge … a Stalinist term,” referring to the Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin.
4 August - Navalny is sentenced to 19 years in prison for “extremism”. He was accused by the Russian authorities of creating an extremist community, financing extremist activities and a number of other crimes. According to a message on Telegram, he said: “I am serving a life sentence. Where life is measured by the duration of my life or the life of this regime. The number from verdict is not for me. It is for you.”
December - Navalny was transferred this month to a penal colony north of the Arctic Circle. His lawyer said Russian authorities wanted to isolate Navalny ahead of Russia’s March presidential election.
2024
9 January - Navalny sarcastically heaped praise on the polar conditions at the prison north of the Arctic Circle where he was moved to shortly before Christmas. In a post on the Telegram messaging app Navalny said he had been put in a punishment cell for his attitude as soon as he left quarantine at the so-called “Polar Wolf” prison colony. He said that walking for half an hour in those temperatures you “manage to grow a new nose, new ears and new fingers.”
11 January - Navalny appeared before a Supreme Court judge by video link on Thursday to argue for the right to longer meal breaks and access to more books in prison. Wearing a black prison uniform and standing behind bars in a small, bare room, Navalny, 47, appeared gaunt but spoke animatedly, at length and without notes.
17 January - From his penal camp Navalny, said that Putin’s state would one day crumble along with the post-Soviet elite which he cast as venal, power-hungry and duplicitous. “Lies, lies and nothing but lies. It will collapse and crumble. Putin’s state is not viable. One day we will look at his place and he won’t be there.”
23 January - Navalny was placed in solitary confinement for 10 days for “incorrectly introducing himself” to a guard, his spokesperson said.
16 February - Russia’s prison agency has said that imprisoned opposition leader Navalny has died. He was 47.

Gaza administration committee demands full operational powers

Gaza administration committee demands full powers to begin transition
The National Committee for the Administration of Gaza on Saturday called for full administrative, civil and policing powers to enable it to carry out its duties in the besieged enclave "efficiently and independently", as it seeks to assume control during a fragile transitional phase.
In a statement, the committee said recent declarations from within Gaza, including from the Hamas-led government, expressing readiness to hand over management of all public institutions and facilities were "a step in the interest" of the people of Gaza.
The committee said this would pave the way for it to assume full responsibility for overseeing the transitional period.
It described the "declaration of readiness for an orderly transition" as a “pivotal milestone to begin exercising its duties as a transitional administration of the Strip, and a real opportunity to halt humanitarian deterioration and preserve the resilience of citizens who have suffered immense pain throughout the past period".
Various government sectors in Gaza have previously issued statements affirming their readiness to transfer powers. However, the committee faces significant obstacles, including differing interpretations of its mandate and what Palestinian sources describe as Israel’s disregard for the body.
Israel has so far not allowed the committee to enter Gaza and it is operating from Cairo.
"The priority at this stage is to ensure the flow of aid without obstacles, launch the reconstruction process, and create the necessary conditions to strengthen the unity of our people," the committee said.
It stressed that this path must be based on "clear and specific understandings characterised by transparency, enforceability and follow-up", in line with the 20-point plan presented by US President Donald Trump and UN Security Council Resolution 2803.
The committee warned that it cannot effectively fulfil its responsibilities unless it is granted "the full administrative and civil powers necessary to perform its tasks in addition to policing duties".
"Responsibility requires genuine empowerment that enables [the committee] to work efficiently and independently" the statement said, adding that such steps would open the door to serious international support for reconstruction, pave the way for a full Israeli withdrawal, and help restore normal daily life.
The committee called on mediators and all concerned parties to accelerate the resolution of outstanding issues "without delay", saying: "Our people cannot endure further postponement, and the stage requires immediate action to ensure an orderly and reliable transition."
Separately, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas called for the removal of "all obstacles" imposed by Israel on implementing the second phase of the Gaza ceasefire agreement.
In a speech delivered on his behalf by Prime Minister Mohammad Mustafa at the 39th African Union summit in Addis Ababa, Abbas said:
"We stress the necessity of removing all obstacles imposed by the Israeli occupation to the implementation of arrangements related to the second phase of the agreement, including the work of the National Committee for the Administration of Gaza, which will temporarily manage the Strip."
The committee was formed under a plan proposed by US President Donald Trump aimed at restructuring governance in Gaza and replacing the Hamas-led administration that has overseen the enclave for years.
Its formation was announced in mid-January in Cairo and it is led by Ali Shaath, a former minister in the Ramallah-based Palestinian Authority.
Palestinian factional sources say Israel has not provided the financial support required for the committee to assume its responsibilities, as well as denying it entry into Gaza.
A conference planned by Trump later this month is expected to address outstanding issues and could pave the way for the committee’s arrival in Gaza and the commencement of its duties, according to the same sources.

Ukraine capable of producing faster and more efficiently than Europe — Danish PM
Europe has problems with its industrial base, as the speed does not match the production lines, Ukraine is able to produce faster and better, despite being in a state of war, said Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen.
"We have a transatlantic problem with our industrial base. I mean, some of the capabilities that we have decided to invest in when it comes to the Arctic region cannot be provided to the USA because the speed simply does not match the production lines. We have exactly the same problem in Europe," Frederiksen said during a panel discussion at the Munich Security Conference.
"In Ukraine, it [the problem] does not exist. So, in Ukraine, they are able to produce faster and better than the rest of us, even despite the fact that they are at war. This is not only because they are really smart people, by the way, they are, and not only because they received money from us and other partners, but also because we work too slowly," she noted.
Frederiksen also noted that Putin does not want peace and will continue the war in Ukraine or "try to continue it somewhere else."

STOCKHOLM, February 14. /TASS/. Finland would be making another biggest mistake after joining NATO if it allowed nuclear weapons to be stationed on its territory, believes Armando Mema, a member of the Finnish national-conservative party Freedom League.
"Normalizing speculations about nuclear issues in Finland is becoming the new norm. The biggest mistake was joining NATO, the second biggest mistake would be letting nuclear weapons into Finland," the politician wrote on his social media page. The statement followed a report by Yle that Finland, according to sources, is participating in the European debate on nuclear deterrence.
"We reject this idea as dangerous and counterproductive for the country's future," Mema concluded.

US senator defends NATO, urges tougher pressure on Russia

US senator defends NATO, urges tougher pressure on Russia
'The American people know that our security and our future lies with NATO and lies with this community of shared principles,' says Democrat Chris Coons
WASHINGTON
US Sen. Chris Coons said Saturday that strong American support for NATO and collective defense remains intact, pushing back against suggestions that the US is reconsidering its commitment to European allies.
Speaking at a panel discussion on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference alongside Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen, Coons addressed concerns about US rhetoric on Greenland – a Danish territory – and transatlantic relations.
"You asked me to defend the American position. I will tell you only 17% of Americans want to, in any way, be involved in threatening Greenland. The vast majority of Americans saw this as a foolish gambit," said Coons, a Democrat, referring to President Donald Trump’s controversial push for the US to acquire Greenland.
Coons, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, stressed that NATO remains “overwhelmingly popular” with the American public.
He noted that Congress has approved significant funding for NATO, collective defense initiatives, and support for Ukraine.
"We should do more, and we will, because it remains popular with the American people," he said.
"The American people know that our security and our future lies with NATO and lies with this community of shared principles."
Asked is there a chance that NATO will emerge stronger from the end of Trump's second term than it was before, Coons said he hopes so, "and will work for it to be so."
Trump has been broadly dismissive of the NATO alliance, a position that has alarmed the US foreign policy establishment, Democrats, and the public at large.
'Europe should be seeking energy options where it can, but not from Russia'
Turning to energy policy and the war in Ukraine, Coons urged European nations to diversify energy supplies away from Russia.
"I think Europe should be seeking energy options where it can, but not from Russia. What is continuing to fund and fuel literally (Russian President Vladimir) Putin's murderous war machine is those countries that continue to buy Russian oil and gas, the single largest buyer being China," he said.
Coons welcomed recent sanctions imposed by Trump on two of Russia’s largest oil companies and efforts to expand economic pressure, saying such measures are broadly supported in the US Congress.
“It’s the pressure on Putin that is needed to move the war of aggression against Ukraine towards a just and sustainable resolution,” Coons said.
The senator also accused Trump of dedicating "as much time" to pushing Ukraine to make concessions to end the war.
"I am very grateful that our European partners have stepped up to provide the resources, the weaponry, much of which bought from the United States. But we have to balance this equation and push Putin to raise the costs of this war for him, or he will not conclude (it). And we have to achieve (this) through negotiations," he said.

Hariri signals Future Movement's return to Lebanon elections
Former Lebanese Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri, one of the country's best-known politicians, indicated on Saturday that his party would contest upcoming elections, four years after he stepped back from public office.
In a speech marking the 21st anniversary of the assassination of his father Rafik, who was also prime minister, Saad told supporters in Beirut that others would “hear our voice, and count our votes” when elections take place.
It was unclear whether Hariri plans to run himself, although his popularity amongst Lebanon's Sunni Muslims remains strong. Huge masses gathered in Beirut’s Martyrs Square waving his party's flag and chanting his name. “You're not a few, and you never were,” Hariri told his supporters.
Lebanese parliament speaker Nabih Berri said on Friday that elections will be held as scheduled on May 10, despite calls from some politicians to postpone the vote, due in part to security concerns in southern Lebanon, where Israel has carried out air strikes targeting group Hezbollah.
Hariri, a three-time former premier, stepped back from politics in 2022 and blocked his Future Movement from running in a parliamentary vote that year, citing reasons including Iran's influence in the country - an indirect reference to Hezbollah.
The Shi'ite Muslim Hezbollah had played a growing role in Lebanon's internal politics, but was severely weakened after a 2024 conflict with Israel. It is now under U.S.-backed pressure to disarm since a ceasefire in late 2024.
Before stepping back from politics, Hariri led one of parliament's biggest factions after inheriting his father's mantle.
His Future Movement's absence from Lebanon's 2022 parliamentary election resulted in fractured Sunni Muslim representation in parliament, where seats are divided according to a sectarian quota system.

'Hansa Arrangement': Norway, Germany sign defense pact to deepen military cooperation
Deal covers five key areas: space-based surveillance, maritime security, land operations, rapid reinforcement capabilities and defense industry cooperation
ISTANBUL
Norway and Germany signed a wide-ranging defense agreement on Saturday aimed at strengthening European security cooperation within NATO.
The accord, dubbed the “Hansa Arrangement,” was signed by Norwegian Defense Minister Tore O. Sandvik and his German counterpart Boris Pistorius on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference.
"Strong European cooperation is essential to fulfilling NATO’s burden-sharing commitments, where Europe must assume a greater share of responsibility for its own security," said Sandik.
Germany, he added, "is one of Norway’s most important allies in Europe and our key partner in the EU. Now, we are taking our close and robust cooperation a step further."
The deal covers five key areas: space-based surveillance, maritime security, land warfare, rapid reinforcement capabilities and defense industry cooperation.
European leaders have increasingly emphasized defense autonomy in recent months amid signals from Washington urging allies to shoulder more of the security burden.
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a speech at the conference that Washington seeks “to revive old friendships,” while European officials stress stronger regional capabilities.
Norway’s parliament, Stortinget, recently approved the acquisition of two additional submarines, bringing the total to six. Once delivered, Norway and Germany will each operate six identical 212CD submarines. The countries are also collaborating on the development of next-generation long-range maritime missiles (3SM).
Meanwhile, Germany’s forces regularly train and exercise in Norway, including during the upcoming winter exercise Cold Response 26.
Separately, Oslo has ordered 54 German-made Leopard 2 tanks, some of which will be produced in Norway, while Berlin has purchased Norwegian-developed JSM missiles worth about 6.5 billion kroner (over $683 million) for its F-35 fighter jets.
The partnership also extends into space cooperation. Norway’s Andoya Spaceport and German aerospace technology are expected to play a central role in plans to develop Europe’s first commercial satellite launch base.

Workers halt production at Belgian arms factory over Israeli officer visit

Some workers at Belgium’s major weapons manufacturer FN Herstal staged a spontaneous strike to protest the presence of an Israeli army officer who was part of a visiting delegation of defense attaches.
The walkout took place on Friday afternoon at the factory in Herstal and was initiated by members linked to the socialist trade union FGTB, the company confirmed, according to Belgian outlet L-Post cited by regional media.
Dyab Abou Jahjah, general director of the Brussels-based Hind Rajab Foundation, said on US social media company X that employees “stopped the machines and walked out after learning that an Israeli military officer had been received at the factory,” calling the action “a clear message” against arms-industry complicity during the Gaza war.
"If it is confirmed that the officer present was the Israeli military attaché in Belgium, then we are speaking about Moshe Tetro — implicated in attacks on hospitals and in managing the policy of hunger imposed on Gaza," he said.
Separately, Flemish public broadcaster VRT NWS reported that the Hind Rajab Foundation filed a complaint with prosecutors at the International Criminal Court in The Hague against the Israeli military attache in Brussels.
Abou Jahjah also urged Belgian authorities to expel the attache, saying the organization had already submitted documentation to the ICC in December 2024 concerning his alleged role.

2 Washington Post writers at the Olympics despite being laid off, say it was important to be there

2 Washington Post writers at the Olympics despite being laid off, say it was important to be there
A pair of Washington Post sports writers are reporting for the newspaper for the final time from the Winter Olympics
- Bookmark
Washington Post columnist Barry Svrluga was reporting from his first Winter Olympics when Lindsey Vonn left her hospital bed after a crash and returned to compete days later at the 2006 Turin Games.
He is back in Italy two decades later at the Milan Cortina Games and was there again to write about it when Vonn ended up back in the hospital following another crash. Even though he’s losing his job.
The Post announced two days before the Olympics opened last week that it was eliminating its sports section while laying off a third of its staff. Svrluga said the newspaper originally planned to send 14 staff members to these Games.
With air tickets and accommodation already paid for, Svrluga is one of four of the paper’s journalists who decided to still come: He is in Cortina, Rick Maese is in Bormio, and Les Carpenter and national staffer Robert Samuels are in Milan.
“They can take away our section,” Svrluga said, “but in a way, they can’t take away our spirit.”
Of the four, Svrluga and Carpenter are being laid off. They came to their final assignment anyway.
“I wanted to be occupied,” said Svrluga, who is at his 12th Games. “I love covering the Olympics. … I had Lindsey injured in Sestriere and then had her gold (Vancouver, 2010) and I’ve had every one of her Olympic races, whether they were successes or not. Same with (Mikaela) Shiffrin.”
The first Olympics that Svrluga worked at was the 2004 Athens Summer Games and he was immediately struck by the way colleagues at the paper collaborated at such a big event.
“It felt like a team sport for us and that benefited the section and the paper,” Svrluga said. “What we’re trying to do here is remind people — readers and decision makers — that these are a lot of committed people who were doing things for the right reasons."
Carpenter, the Post’s Olympics writer, is at his eighth Games. He's been covering figure skating, speedskating and hockey.
“The Post sports department always had such a great connection with its readers. I felt I had to stay to tell the story of this Olympics for them,” Carpenter said. “It’s what I’d want as a reader. If this is the end for Post sports, let’s give our most loyal readers our best.”
Shiffrin trusted Svrluga with some personal news
Svrluga gave his readers — and the wider skiing community — reason for pause even before he got to Cortina.
An extensive pre-Games interview with Shiffrin and her mother and coach, Eileen, turned into much more than an Olympic preview story when they revealed to Svrluga why Eileen was absent at the start of this World Cup season: She had been diagnosed with cancer and faced six weeks of treatments.
“This was a very personal situation,” Svrluga said. “I’m thankful for them that they trusted me with the information. It’s their story to tell.”
Staff reductions are ‘tragic for readers’
Changes across the industry have resulted in fewer American reporters attending events like the Olympics.
“That’s tragic for readers,” Svrluga said, noting how the extra space in the reporters’ interview areas at the finish lines are “great for logistics and sad for the business.”
Some of the people who Svrluga has reported on at the Olympics have reached out to him after word spread about the cuts at the Post. It's happened back in Washington, too, he said.
“People who have won World Series, people who own teams. I’ve been there 22 years, so you build relationships over time, even with people you battle with a little bit or you write something they don’t like. It’s still a human element to it," Svrluga said. "So I’ve heard from more people than I can count.”
But, Svrluga added, “You don’t want to be the story. You want to cover the story.”
The Post’s executive editor, Matt Murray, called the layoffs painful but necessary.
“You could argue maybe we’re in this position because we didn’t adapt or see what is coming next,” Svrluga said. “It’s obvious people get their news in different ways now. I’m ‘old school’ in one regard. … I hope that the people who are in their 20s and early 30s, like when I first went to the Olympics, are figuring out whatever’s next. I would love for it to include written storytelling, because that’s what I like to do.”
A final story and ‘the red wine will flow’
Eliminating the Post sports section was a sharp blow since the department has hosted many well-known bylines through the years, including the likes of John Feinstein, Michael Wilbon, Shirley Povich, Sally Jenkins and Tony Kornheiser.
Svrluga’s final column from these Games will mark his final story for the Post. In the meantime, he’s going to try and enjoy the Olympics — and being in Italy — more than he usually does while on assignment.
“The red wine,” he said, “will flow.”

Rutte praises resilience of Ukrainian civilians amid Russian attacks
Rutte spoke during a discussion at the Munich Security Conference, an Ukrinform correspondent reports.
Telling the audience of his latest visit to Ukraine, he said Russia's brutal strikes on critical infrastructure seem to be making Ukrainians "almost stronger" despite all difficulties they are facing in the winter cold.
Recalling his meeting with the Ukrainians whom the Russians had kept for weeks in the basement of a village in Chernihiv region at the time of the occupation in 2022, he said the face of the Russians is "the lack of decency and humanity."
The Ukrainians "told me they are resilient, we'll never give in, but tell this story to other people, what the Russians did here."
He also recalled the time he was shown Patron, a dog helping a Ukrainian bomb squad sniff out explosives in the rubble.
"The untold story of this war is the heroes - from the firefighters, ambulance services and all these people, and of course, soldiers, who are amazing, but sometimes we forget about the police and the firefighters and all the other civilian people who are helping," said the NATO secretary general.
As Ukrinform reported, President Volodymyr Zelensky stated that the longer the war continues, the more dangerous the evolution of Russian leader Vladimir Putin becomes.

Spain calls nuclear rearmament 'historic error,' says powers forgetting past lessons
'Nuclear powers have forgotten the lessons of the past, and they are expanding their nuclear arsenals once again,' Pedro Sanchez says at Munich Security Conference
LONDON
By expanding their arsenals once again, the nuclear powers are forgetting "lessons of the past," Spain’s prime minister warned Saturday, calling this a "historical error."
Speaking at the Munich Security Conference, Pedro Sanchez expressed concern over nuclear rearmament and called on nuclear powers to sign a new START treaty after the last one expired on Feb. 5, leaving the US and Russia’s strategic arsenals with no binding restraints.
"The world is becoming more unstable, and we Europeans must strengthen our defense capabilities," said Sanchez.
He argued, however, that nuclear rearmament is not the right way to ensure sovereignty, territorial integrity, or security.
"Treaties were signed and nuclear arsenals were dramatically reduced, but now the tide is turning," he warned.
Sanchez added: "Nuclear powers have forgotten the lessons of the past, and they are expanding their nuclear arsenals once again."
Saying that together, the nuclear powers are spending more than $11 million every single hour on their arsenals, he cited experts suggesting that the US alone will invest $946 billion in nukes over the next decade, a sum big "enough to eradicate extreme global poverty."
"In my view, this is a mistake, a historical error that we cannot commit again, particularly not today, with artificial intelligence casting a shadow of uncertainty over the entire world."
Sanchez called on nuclear nations to "stop nuclear rearmament, sit down, negotiate and sign a new START treaty" to ensure continuity of the one that just expired.
"We need to stop (Russian President Vladimir) Putin, we need to strengthen our deterrence capabilities, but let us do it in a coordinated and targeted way that we can control," he added.

US carried out strikes in Syria against ISIS targets: CENTCOM
Central Command forces targeted ISIS infrastructure and weapons storage facilities on Feb. 3-12, says US Central Command
WASHINGTON
The US Central Command (CENTCOM) said that on Feb. 3-12 its forces carried out 10 strikes against more than 30 ISIS (Daesh) targets in Syria.
The strikes targeted ISIS infrastructure and weapons storage facilities with precision munitions delivered by fixed-wing, rotary-wing, and unmanned aircraft, CENTCOM said in a Saturday statement.
The latest round of strikes follows five earlier operations conducted by CENTCOM forces from Jan. 27 through Feb. 2.
The campaign is part of Operation Hawkeye Strike, launched in response to a Dec. 13 ISIS ambush in the historic city of Palmyra, Syria. The attack targeted US and Syrian partner forces and resulted in the deaths of two US service members and an American interpreter.

Russia hit Azerbaijani energy sites and embassy in Ukraine three times, Azerbaijani president says
Russian forces have carried out three attacks on Azerbaijani energy infrastructure in Ukraine and three attacks on Azerbaijan's embassy in Ukraine.
Source: Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev in a comment to Ukrainska Pravda on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference
Quote: "There were three attacks on Azerbaijan's energy infrastructure in Ukraine and there were also three attacks on Azerbaijan's embassy in Ukraine. After the first attack we could assume it was accidental and we passed all the coordinates of Azerbaijan's diplomatic missions to our Russian colleagues, including the consular section, our cultural centres and everything else. Despite this, two more attacks took place. So this was a deliberate attack on Azerbaijan's diplomatic mission."
Details: Aliyev said his government had taken "all necessary diplomatic steps". He said "special" statements were issued, the ambassador was informed and a diplomatic note was submitted.
Quote: "We're acting exclusively through diplomatic channels. We cannot do anything else."
More details: Aliyev said that Russia's actions "are of course regarded as an unfriendly step towards Azerbaijan".

Olympic curling committee issues warning after cheating accusations

Olympic curling committee issues warning after Sweden accuses Canada of cheating in curse-filled fight
The Olympic curling committee issued a warning after a heated fight filled with cheating allegations and audible curse words overshadowed a feisty match between Sweden and Canada.
Canada's Marc Kennedy got offended Friday evening when he was accused by Swedish rival Oskar Eriksson of "double touching" — essentially, touching the rock again after initially releasing it down the sheet of ice — during Canada's 8-6 win in round-robin play late Friday.
Kennedy repeatedly used expletives to deny he broke any rules. The match came to a brief standstill as fingers were pointed and Kennedy argued with members of the Swedish team across the ice.
The World Curling Committee said in a Saturday statement that they spoke with the Canadian officials to issue a verbal warning regarding the language used by a Canadian men's player during the game. During the meeting, officials said they made it clear that inappropriate language would be met with additional sanctions.
The governing body added that starting from Saturday's afternoon session - which sees both Canada and Sweden in action - two officials will move to observing deliveries across the four matches.
The 44-year-old Kennedy said after the altercation, "I don't like being accused of cheating after 25 years on tour and four Olympic Games."
"So," he added, "I told him where to stick it. Because we're the wrong team to do that to."
Eriksson said he simply wanted everyone to "play by the same rules."
"We want a game that is as sportsmanlike, honest and clean as possible," he said, "so we call it out as soon as I see that the Canadian No. 2 is, in my eyes, there poking the stone."
The rules state that a stone must be delivered using the handle that sits on top of the rock and that it must be released from the hand before it reaches the hog line. At the Olympics, that is the thick green line at each end.
Replays appeared to show Kennedy releasing the stone using the handle, then touching it again — this time on the granite, not the handle — with an outstretched finger as it approached the hog line, which isn't allowed in the rules.
In the early ends of the match, Sweden notified the officials of their complaints. An official then remained at the hog line for three ends to monitor Canada's curlers and no violations were recorded, World Curling confirmed in its statement on Saturday.
Curling does not use video replays to review game decisions.
"Decisions made during a game are final," World Curling said.

European nations say Alexei Navalny was poisoned by the Kremlin with dart frog toxin

Russia poisoned Alexei Navalny with dart frog toxin, European nations say
Russia poisoned Alexei Navalny with dart frog toxin, European nations say
LONDON (AP) — Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny was poisoned by the Kremlin with a rare and lethal toxin found in the skin of poison dart frogs, five European countries said Saturday.
The foreign ministries of the U.K., France, Germany, Sweden and the Netherlands said analysis in European labs of samples taken from Navalny’s body “conclusively confirmed the presence of epibatidine.” The neurotoxin secreted by dart frogs in South America is not found naturally in Russia, they said.
A joint statement said: “Russia had the means, motive and opportunity to administer this poison.”
The five countries said they were reporting Russia to the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons for a breach of the Chemical Weapons Convention. There was no immediate comment from the organization.
Navalny, who crusaded against official corruption and staged massive anti-Kremlin protests as President Vladimir Putin’s fiercest foe, died in an Arctic penal colony on Feb. 16, 2024, while serving a 19-year sentence that he believed to be politically motivated.
“Russia saw Navalny as a threat,” British Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper said. “By using this form of poison the Russian state demonstrated the despicable tools it has at its disposal and the overwhelming fear it has of political opposition.”
French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot wrote on X that the poisoning of Navalny shows “that Vladimir Putin is prepared to use biological weapons against his own people in order to remain in power.”
The European nations’ assessment came as Navalny’s widow, Yulia Navalnaya, attended the Munich Security Conference in Germany, and just before the second anniversary of Navalny’s death.
She said last year that two independent labs had found that her husband was poisoned shortly before he died. She has repeatedly blamed Putin for her husband’s death. Russian officials have vehemently denied the accusation.
Navalnaya said Saturday that she had been “certain from the first day” that her husband had been poisoned, “but now there is proof.”
“Putin killed Alexei with chemical weapon,” she wrote on She said Putin was “a murderer” who “must be held accountable.”
Russian authorities said that the politician became ill after a walk and died from natural causes.
Epibatidine is found naturally in dart frogs in the wild, and can also be manufactured in a lab, which European scientists suspect was the case with the substance used on Navalny. It works on the body in a similar way to nerve agents, causing shortness of breath, convulsions, seizures, a slowed heart rate and ultimately death.
European officials said they had a high degree of confidence in the assessment that Navalny died from epibatidine poisoning. Asked why the results had taken so long, German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul said that it had been “a complicated process.”
Wadephul said “no one but Putin’s henchmen will be able to say in detail what happened on Feb. 16, 2024, in the Russian penal colony. But it is clear that Russian authorities had the possibility, the motive and the means to administer the poison to Navalny.”
Navalny was the target of an earlier poisoning in 2020, with a nerve agent in an attack he blamed on the Kremlin, which always denied involvement. His family and allies fought to have him flown to Germany for treatment and recovery. Five months later, he returned to Russia, where he was immediately arrested and imprisoned for the last three years of his life.
The U.K. has accused Russia of repeatedly flouting international bans on chemical and biological weapons. It accuses the Kremlin of carrying out a 2018 attack in the English city of Salisbury that targeted a former Russian intelligence officer, Sergei Skripal, with the nerve agent Novichok. Skripal and his daughter became seriously ill, and a British woman, Dawn Sturgess, died after she came across a discarded bottle with traces of the nerve agent.
A British inquiry concluded that the attack “must have been authorized at the highest level, by President Putin.”
The Kremlin has denied involvement. Russia also denied poisoning Alexander Litvinenko, a former Russian agent turned Kremlin critic who died in London in 2006, after ingesting the radioactive isotope polonium-210. A British inquiry concluded that two Russian agents killed Litvinenko, and Putin had “probably approved” the operation.

MSF suspends some work at Gaza’s Nasser Hospital due to presence of armed men

MSF suspends some work at Gaza’s Nasser Hospital due to presence of armed men
MSF suspends some work at Gaza’s Nasser Hospital due to presence of armed men
TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Doctors Without Borders has announced the suspension of some operations at one of Gaza ‘s largest functioning hospitals after patients and staff reported seeing armed, masked men roaming parts of the building.
Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis is one of the territory’s few functioning hospitals. Hundreds of patients and war-wounded have been treated there daily, and the facility was a hub for Palestinian prisoners released by Israel in exchange for Israeli hostages as part of the current ceasefire deal.
It was a rare announcement by an international organization about the presence of armed men in a medical facility in Gaza since the war began over two years ago.
The aid group also known by its acronym MSF said in a statement all its noncritical medical operations at Nasser Hospital were suspended due to security breaches that posed “serious” threats to its teams and patients. MSF said there had been an increase in patients and staff seeing armed men in parts of the compound since the U.S.-brokered October ceasefire was reached.
“MSF teams have reported a pattern of unacceptable acts including the presence of armed men, intimidation, arbitrary arrests of patients and a recent situation of suspicion of movement of weapons,” it said.
While the suspension occurred in January, it was first disclosed in MSF’s “frequently asked questions” section on its website. It’s unclear when the post was made, but the site said it was updated Feb. 11.
Attacks on health facilities
MSF said it wasn’t able to indicate the armed men’s affiliation. It said it had expressed concern to the “relevant” authorities, without elaborating, stressing that hospitals must remain neutral, civilian spaces. It said its concerns were heightened by previous, deliberate Israeli attacks on health facilities.
Throughout the war, which began with the Hamas-led attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, Israel has repeatedly struck hospitals, including Nasser, accusing the militant group of operating in or around them. Hamas security men often have been seen inside hospitals, blocking access to some areas.
Some hostages released from Gaza have said they spent time during captivity in a hospital.
While Hamas remains the dominant force in areas not under Israeli control, including Nasser Hospital, other armed groups have mushroomed across Gaza as a result of the war, including groups backed by Israel’s army in the Israeli-controlled part of the strip.
Nasser Hospital staff say that in recent months it has been repeatedly attacked by masked, armed men and militias, despite police presence there.
Police to be deployed
The Hamas-run Interior Ministry, which oversees police in Gaza, said officers would be deployed to secure hospitals and rid them of armed presence. It said it was implementing stricter measures to ensure patients’ safety.
While international law gives hospitals special protections during war, they can lose this immunity if combatants use them to hide fighters or store weapons, according to the International Committee of the Red Cross. Still, there must be plenty of warning to allow the evacuation of staff and patients before any operations take place. If harm to civilians from an attack is disproportionate to the military objective, it is illegal under international law.
Aid groups and rights organizations say Israel has decimated Gaza’s health system, forcing most hospitals to shut down while heavily damaging others. During the war, Israeli forces raided a number of hospitals, detaining hundreds of staff.
Israel also has targeted the police in Gaza.
A weakened medical system
MSF said it will continue supporting critical services at Nasser Hospital, including inpatient and surgical departments for patients with traumatic or burn injuries. However, it is ending support to the pediatrics and maternity wards, including the neonatal intensive care unit. It has also indefinitely suspended its outpatient consultations for 3D burn screening and mental health, as well as other services.
Zaher al-Waheidi, head of the records department at Gaza’s Health Ministry, said MSF’s suspension would have a significant impact as hundreds of patients are admitted to the maternity and burn wards daily. He said the ministry would take over maternity patient care, but said burn victims won’t have many options.
Israel has been cracking down on aid groups operating in Gaza and the occupied West Bank, including MSF. The group is one of more than three dozen that Israel has banned from operating in the strip for failing to comply with new registration rules.
MSF says Israel’s decision will have a catastrophic impact on its work in Gaza, where it provides funding and international staff for six hospitals and operates two field hospitals and eight primary health centers, clinics and medical points. It also runs two of Gaza’s five stabilization centers, helping children with severe malnutrition.
The toll of war
While the heaviest fighting has subsided, the fragile ceasefire has been seen almost daily Israeli fire. Israeli forces have carried out repeated airstrikes and frequently fire on Palestinians near military-held zones, killing 591 Palestinians since the ceasefire took effect, according to Gaza health officials.
Israel’s military on Saturday said its troops “eliminated” a person in northern Gaza who crossed the line dividing the territory and approached them. Later in the day, the military said its troops “eliminated” two armed people in northern Gaza who had taken cover under debris on the Israeli-controlled side of the line near soldiers.
Gaza’s Health Ministry said the overall Palestinian death toll from the war is at least 72,051.
The ministry, part of the Hamas-led government, maintains detailed casualty records that are seen as generally reliable by U.N. agencies and independent experts. It does not give a breakdown of civilians and militants. Militants have carried out shooting attacks on troops, and Israel says its strikes are in response to that and other violations. Four Israeli soldiers have been killed.

Son of Iran's last shah urges US military intervention in Iran

Iranian opposition figure Reza Pahlavi on Saturday said U.S. military intervention in Iran could save lives and urged President Donald Trump's administration not to spend too long negotiating with Tehran's clerical rulers on a nuclear deal.
The exiled son of Iran's toppled shah told Reuters in an interview that there were signs that the Iranian government was on the brink of collapse and that an attack could weaken it or accelerate its fall. Pahlavi was speaking on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference, where officials from the Iranian government are banned.
"It's a matter of time. We are hoping that this attack will expedite the process and the people can be finally back in the streets and take it all the way to the ultimate regime's downfall," said Pahlavi, who is based in the United States and has lived outside Iran since before his father was toppled in the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
A campaign of mass arrests and intimidation has led to the arrests of thousands as Iranian authorities seek to deter further protests after last month's crackdown on the bloodiest unrest since 1979. The protests began on December 28 as a modest demonstration in Tehran's Grand Bazaar over economic hardship and quickly spread nationwide.
Trump has questioned level of support for Pahlavi
Iran's opposition is fragmented among rival groups and ideological factions - including the monarchists who back Pahlavi - and appears to have little organized presence inside the Islamic Republic. In an interview with Reuters last month, Trump sounded skeptical about the level of Pahlavi's support inside Iran.
The Trump administration has engaged with Iran to see if a nuclear deal can be struck as Washington amassed military forces in the region. U.S. and Iranian diplomats held talks in Oman last week and further talks in the coming week are expected.
"People are hoping that at some point the decision will be made that there's no use, there's no point, we're not going to get anywhere with negotiations. Therefore, that's time for the United States to intervene and do what President Trump promised he will do, to have the people's back," Pahlavi said.
"Intervention is a way to save lives," he added. On Friday, in a speech to U.S. troops in North Carolina, Trump said Iran has been difficult in nuclear negotiations and suggested that instilling fear in Tehran may be necessary to resolve the standoff peacefully.
Two U.S. officials speaking on the condition of anonymity told Reuters on Friday that the U.S. military was preparing for the possibility of a sustained, weeks-long operation against Iran if Trump ordered an attack.

‘I was sacrificed on the altar of vice’: Gisele Pelicot describes impact of abuse in first televised interview
French rape survivor Gisele Pelicot has described the impact of the horrific abuse suffered at the hands of her former husband and the men he invited to sexually assault her, in her first televised interview.
In December 2024, Dominique Pelicot was sentenced to 20 years in prison for drugging and raping Ms Pelicot, and for allowing other men to assault her while she was unconscious.
In an interview with Newsnight to be broadcast tomorrow night (15 Feb), Gisele Pelicot described the case as “a descent into hell”, telling presenter Victoria Derbyshire: “I was truly sacrificed on the altar of vice. I was a martyred woman thrown as prey to all these individuals.”
Explaining one of the men who assaulted her was HIV-positive, she added: “It was sheer luck that I didn’t contract the virus. Because of that too, I feel someone up there protected me, because I really am a survivor.”

World artists back Palestine rapporteur Francesca Albanese despite criticism
Albanese faces calls from France and Germany to step down over remarks in which she criticised ‘most of the world’ for enabling Israel’s ‘genocide’ in Gaza.
Over a hundred top figures from the world of entertainment signed an open letter on Saturday in support of UN Palestinian human rights expert Francesca Albanese, who faces calls to resign over comments about the war in Gaza.
France and Germany have called for Albanese to step down over remarks last weekend in which she referred to a “common enemy of humanity” after criticising “most of the world” and the media for enabling Israel’s “genocide” in Gaza.
Critics and Israel have accused the UN Special Rapporteur of referring to Israel as a “common enemy”, while Albanese has denounced this as a “manipulation” and “completely false”.
In a letter organised by the Artists for Palestine group and shared with journalists, over 100 cultural figures backed Albanese, including actors Mark Ruffalo and Javier Bardem, Nobel-winning author Annie Ernaux and British musician Annie Lennox.
The signatories “offer our full support to Francesca Albanese, a defender of human rights and therefore also of the Palestinian people’s right to exist,” the letter says.
“There are infinitely more of us, in every corner of the Earth, who want force no longer to be the law. Who know what the word ‘law’ truly means,” it concludes.
Published on the website of Artists for Palestine, it also reproduces the full remarks by Albanese, who was speaking via videoconference at a forum in Doha last Saturday organised by the Al Jazeera TV network.

US launches airstrikes on dozens of Islamic State targets in Syria

The US military conducted 10 strikes on more than 30 Islamic State targets in Syria between 3 and 12 February as part of a campaign against the extremist group in Iraq and Syria.
US Central Command (Centcom) said in a statement on Saturday that the US had struck IS infrastructure and weapons storage targets.
The attacks formed part of Operation Hawkeye Strike, in which the US killed or captured what it said were IS fighters and hit more than 100 IS targets. The campaign began after a member of Syria’s general security forces affiliated with IS ambushed US and Syrian forces in the city of Palmyra, killing two US soldiers and an interpreter, and wounding three members of the Syrian government forces.
The US has led the international coalition to defeat IS in Syria and Iraq since 2014, partnering with the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) to defeat the radical group. In November, Syria officially joined the coalition and Washington has since turned towards Damascus as its principal anti-IS ally.
Analysts warn that the group has been trying to reconstitute itself since the fall of Assad in December 2024, exploiting the security vacuum and weapons that flooded the country when Assad’s soldiers abandoned their posts.
On Saturday, the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, praised Damascus for its participation in the anti-IS coalition, welcoming the Syrian government’s commitment to fully cooperate with the US and the global coalition.
The US has steadily been evacuating male detainees accused of being IS fighters out of north-east Syria over the past month, announcing on Friday it had successfully transported 5,700 detainees to Iraq, where they are expected to stand trial. The US military is reducing its troop presence in Syria, evacuating its base in al-Tanf this week after nearly a decade there.
Damascus took control of key IS prisons and camps last month as part of its offensive against the SDF, in which the SDF lost 80% of its territory. Among the camps Damascus now controls is al-Hawl camp, which previously held about 25,000 family members of suspected IS fighters.
Humanitarians said on Friday that almost the entire foreigners’ annexe of the camp, which had held about 6,000 women and children from 42 different countries, had been emptied over the past month. It is unclear where the foreign residents went or who removed them from the camp.

European reaction to Rubio's speech on transatlantic ties at Munich Security Conference

BERLIN, Feb 14 - U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio cast the United States as the "child of Europe" in a message of unity on Saturday at the Munich Security Conference, offering some reassurance as well as more criticism to allies after a year of strained ties.
This is the European reaction to his keynote speech at the annual gathering of political and military leaders:
EU COMMISSION CHIEF URSULA VON DER LEYEN
"I was very much reassured by the speech of the Secretary of State. We know him. He's a good friend, a strong ally ... and this was, for me, very reassuring to listen to him. We know that in the administration, some have a harsher tone on these topics. But the Secretary of State was very clear. He said 'We want strong Europe in the Alliance', and this is what we are working for intensively in the European Union."
FRENCH FOREIGN MINISTER JEAN-NOEL BARROT
"Referring to (our) common legacy can only be welcomed with applause in Europe. The second thing that Secretary Rubio mentioned that I think is also very important and that is very consistent with the view of European countries is that some challenges cannot be addressed by a single nation, as powerful and as rich as it may be ...
"Is it going to change our strategy? Of course not. Because, you know, what we're hearing today, we heard already in the past, and we heard this from Democratic administrations, Republican administrations. Build a strong and independent Europe. We will deliver a strong and independent Europe. Independent, of course, irrespective of the speeches that we hear at the Munich Security Conference, however right they may be."
GERMAN FOREIGN MINISTER JOHANN WADEPHUL
"This was the speech I expected from Secretary Rubio. We know that he is a true partner ... I would say (it was) a very clear message from Secretary Rubio that we have...to stay and stick to our international rules-based order, which is, of course, in first line the United Nations. This is our Board of Peace. And we want to keep it like that. We have, of course, to reform it. We have to make it more effective, as Rubio said this morning.
"And the most important sentence for me was 'let's do it again'. So he was looking forward. This is good."
FINNISH FOREIGN MINISTER ELINA VALTONEN
"I am very satisfied with the tone and I also think that the content was largely what we here in Europe expected. He said so many times, that we must stand together and be strong for our values. We are, of course, very strongly committed to the international community and to international law." REUTERS

Russia poisoned opposition politician Alexei Navalny with a toxin from a poison dart frog, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden and the United Kingdom said on Saturday.
The five governments made the announcement at the Munich Security Conference, two years after news broke during the same event of the pro-democracy campaigner’s death in a Russian prison.
Analyses of samples from Navalny’s body “conclusively confirmed” the presence of a toxin called epibatidine, which is found in poison dart frogs in South America and could only have been deployed by Russia, the countries said in a joint statement.

Zelenskyy says ‘unity’ in Europe, Euro-Atlantic community ‘best interceptor’ against Russia
In speech at Munich Security Conference, Ukraine’s president reaffirms need for ‘real, strong’ security guarantees for his country, Europe
ISTANBUL
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Saturday termed “unity” in Europe and in the Euro-Atlantic community as the “best interceptor” against Russia.
In a speech at a panel discussion on day two of the Munich Security Conference, Zelenskyy argued there is “no country in Europe that could rely only on its own technology and money to defend itself,” and that “no one would stand alone” in a full-scale conflict.
Expressing that this is why Ukraine invests in “interceptors and protection,” Zelenskyy claimed Russia is seeking to break unity in Europe and in the Euro-Atlantic community.
“They want to break it. Why? Because our unity is the best interceptor against Russia’s aggressive plans, the best one, and we still have it,” Zelenskyy said. “Our unity is what protects us.”
He reaffirmed the need for “real” and “strong” security guarantees for Ukraine, as well as for Europe, and that agreements in this regard are ready to be signed with the US.
“And with Europe, we think that the agreement on security guarantees should come before any agreement to end the war,” he said, adding those guarantees answer the main question of “how long there will be no war again.”
He hoped US President Donald Trump, Congress, and the American people hear them, expressing gratitude for “all the real help.”
Speaking about peace negotiations to end the war with Russia, which will enter its fifth year later this month, Zelenskyy said a “lot of time” is now being spent on these talks and hoped the next round will be “serious, substantive, helpful for all of us.”
Following two round of negotiations in the UAE capital Abu Dhabi in January and earlier this month, trilateral talks between Russia, Ukraine, and the US are due in Geneva, Switzerland on Feb. 17-18.
“But honestly, sometimes it feels like the sides are talking about completely different things,” Zelenskyy said, noting that the Russian side often refers back to agreements reached during the summit in Alaska between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin last August.
Zelenskyy said the US often refers back to the topic of concessions and that “too often those concessions are discussed in the context only of Ukraine, not Russia.”
He called the absence of Europe in the negotiations as a “big mistake."
He said the Ukrainian side will do “truly everything” to make these negotiations successful, and that Ukraine is ready for a deal that brings "real peace" not only for his country, but for Europe as well.
"And I'm confident that this war can be ended, and ended with dignity,” he added.

Expert calls meeting on interception Russia-related tankers piracy conspiracy
Unknown

00:11:47 KST

MOSCOW, February 14. /TASS/. NATO countries are intensifying their efforts to disrupt maritime trade routes and undermine Russian civilian and military fleets - an activity that could be characterized as a form of piracy, according to Alexander Stepanov, a military expert at the Institute of Law and National Security at the Russian Presidential Academy of National Economy and Public Administration (RANEPA).
As Bloomberg previously reported, citing sources, British Defense Secretary John Healey engaged in discussions with counterparts from Scandinavia and the Baltic states regarding the interception of tankers believed to be connected to Russia. The meeting of the Joint Expeditionary Force - a coalition of ten nations - took place on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference. Stepanov commented, "It appears that Britain is now de facto leading this initiative, and in Munich, we observed a kind of piratical collusion from above. I am convinced that NATO naval departments, particularly those in Northern Europe, are actively working alongside Britain to enhance efforts to block maritime trade routes, conduct sabotage against Russian civilian and military fleets, rehearse scenarios for closing the Danish straits, and develop measures aimed at obstructing maritime navigation."
He further explained that conditions have already been established for the routine deployment of maritime and aerial patrols, which facilitate the coordination and implementation of new strategies to impair Russian capabilities in the Baltic-Arctic region. "These joint expeditionary forces are currently being reinforced with surface naval assets. Britain, Germany, and other regional allies are supporting the construction and commissioning of new surface ships, including frigates and destroyers. Additionally, surface and underwater strike reconnaissance drones are being actively developed," Stepanov noted.
He emphasized Norway's significant role, highlighting the involvement of Kongsberg Defence & Aerospace, as well as Sweden's military-industrial complex, which is focusing on developing and deploying advanced stealth submarines designed for operations in the Baltic Sea.

Foreign Office’s chief mouser Palmerston dies after swapping London for Bermuda

Palmerston, a rescue cat who became the chief mouser of the Foreign Office, has died in Bermuda.
The cat, adopted from Battersea Dogs & Cats Home, retired in 2020 after four years of service in Whitehall.
In February 2025, a post on a popular social media account in Palmerston’s name said he had come out of retirement in order to start work “as feline relations consultant (semi-retired) to the new governor of Bermuda”.
Announcing his death, a post on Palmerston’s X account read: “Palmerston, Diplocat extraordinaire, passed away peacefully on 12 February. “Palmy” was a special member of the government house team in Bermuda, and a much-loved family member, it added.
On his retirement in 2020, a letter to Sir Simon McDonald, permanent under-secretary at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, read that the cat would like to spend more time “away from the limelight” after enjoying “working from home” during the coronavirus pandemic.
“I have found life away from the frontline relaxed, quieter, and easier,” the letter signed in Palmerston’s name read. “My 105,000 Twitter followers show that even those with four legs and fur have an important part to play in the UK’s global effort,” Palmerston’s letter said.
“I have championed our work, built our relationships, and celebrated the diversity of our staff.”
Cats have been a celebrated feature of British political life for decades. Winston Churchill had a cat named Nelson, and Humphrey was chief mouser to the Cabinet Office under Margaret Thatcher, John Major and briefly Tony Blair.
Downing Street’s current chief mouser, Larry, is celebrating 15 years in the job this weekend. Also adopted from Battersea Dogs & Cats Home, he has served six prime ministers, and been claimed as a symbol of continuity in a roiling political era.
An unofficial X account paid tribute to Larry’s “old friend” Palmerston despite a 2019 video showing what appeared to be a hostile relationship.

Soldiers of the 19th Army Corps and the 44th Separate Mechanized Brigade of the Ukrainian Ground Forces published a video showing that they are freely moving around Kostiantynivka in Donetsk region and stated that reports about the alleged capture of the city by Russian troops are fake.
According to Ukrinform, the 19th Army Corps of the Armed Forces of Ukraine released the video on Facebook.
"Kostiantynivka is Ukraine. The city is under the control of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, and no fakes about the 'presence' of the occupiers here have anything to do with reality," the military said.
They urged people to trust only official sources, emphasizing that "verified facts are our strength."
As Ukrinform reported, information about the alleged capture of the settlement of Zaliznychne in Zaporizhzhia region by Russian forces is not true. The locality remains under the control of Ukrainian defenders despite daily airstrikes.

Rubio says UN has ‘no role’ in solving wars, like Gaza; seeks to reassure Europe on Trump

Rubio says UN has ‘no role’ in solving wars, like Gaza; seeks to reassure Europe on Trump
Using a softer tone than the US president and VP, top diplomat tells Munich conference that Washington looking to ‘revitalize’ ties, says Trump wants ‘Europe to be strong’
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio sought to reassure a nervous Europe on Saturday, saying that Washington wanted to recharge the transatlantic alliance so that a strong Europe could help the US on its mission of global “renewal,” while criticizing the United Nations for having “virtually no role” in resolving conflicts, including Gaza.
Speaking at a security conference in Munich after months of turmoil in US-European relations sparked by US President Donald Trump’s vows to seize Greenland and his often derisive remarks about US allies, Washington’s top diplomat struck a markedly soothing tone.
“We do not seek to separate, but to revitalize an old friendship and renew the greatest civilization in human history,” Rubio said, calling for “a reinvigorated alliance.”
“We want Europe to be strong,” Rubio said, adding that the continent and the US “belong together.”
He echoed the Trump administration’s oft-stated assertion that immigration posed a threat, saying that “mass migration” was “a crisis which is transforming and destabilizing societies all across the West.”
He said that Europe and the US were “heirs to the same great and noble civilization” and that he hoped Europe, together with us are willing and able to defend it.”
Rubio argued that the “euphoria” of the Western victory in the Cold War led to a “dangerous delusion that we had entered ‘the end of history,’ that every nation would now be a liberal democracy, that the ties formed by trade and by commerce alone would now replace nationhood … and that we would now live in a world without borders where everyone became a citizen of the world.”
“We made these mistakes together and now together we owe it to our people to face those facts and to move forward to rebuild,” Rubio said.
“This is why we Americans may sometimes come off as a little direct and urgent in our counsel,” he said. “This is why President Trump demands seriousness and reciprocity from our friends here in Europe.”
Rubio: UN plays ‘no role’ in ending wars, including Gaza
Shifting focus to the United Nations, Rubio sharply criticized the global forum for having “virtually no role” in resolving conflicts, and called for global institutions to be reformed.
“The United Nations still has tremendous potential to be a tool for good in the world,” he told the Munich conference.
“But we cannot ignore that, today, on the most pressing matters before us, it has no answers and has played virtually no role,” he said.
“It could not solve the war in Gaza,” he said. Trump’s newly formed Board of Peace was given a UN mandate to govern the war-ravaged Palestinian territory for two years, but many countries have expressed concerns that the board looks to usurp some of the UN’s power and become the main forum for solving global issues.
Change in tone
Aside from immigration and the UN, Rubio otherwise largely avoided the MAGA flashpoint and culture war issues that German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said Friday, had deepened a “rift” between US and Europe.
Rubio said that an end of the trans-Atlantic era “is neither our goal nor our wish,” adding that “our home may be in the Western hemisphere, but we will always be a child of Europe.”
He acknowledged that “we have bled and died side-by-side on battlefields from Kapyong to Kandahar,” a contrast with disparaging remarks by Trump about NATO allies’ troops in Afghanistan that drew an outcry. “And I’m here today to make it clear that America is charting the path for a new century of prosperity. and that once again, we want to do it together with you, our cherished allies and our oldest friends.”
Rubio’s speech marked a sharp contrast to that of US Vice President JD Vance a year ago, when he used the same stage to attack European policies on a range of issues, including free speech, shocking European allies.
The Trump administration has also charged that Europe faced a “civilizational decline” and has courted far-right parties on the continent.
Ties plunged last month when Trump stepped up threats to annex Greenland, an autonomous territory of NATO member Denmark, forcing European nations to stand firm in protest.
European security, Ukraine war
European leaders at the Munich Security Conference have pledged to shoulder more of the burden of shared NATO defenses, saying this was essential for Europe to counter a hostile Russia.
European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen told the gathering on Saturday that “Europe needs to step up and has to take on its responsibility” for its security, including closer ties with Britain 10 years after Brexit.
British Prime Minister Keir Starmer echoed the sentiment, saying “We must build our hard power, because that is the currency of the age,” calling for the building of “a shared industrial base across Europe which can turbocharge our defense production.”
Also speaking at the conference was Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, as Kyiv is set to mark five years of grueling war since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of the country in 2022.
Zelensky decried that political efforts to end the war have not worked: “Weapons evolve faster than political decisions meant to stop them,” he said, calling for speedier arms deliveries for Ukraine’s Western-supplied air defense systems.
He said that “there is not a single power plant in Ukraine that is not damaged by Russian strikes” after Russia stepped up its attacks on infrastructure over the past few months, as the coldest snap since the war started in February 2022 hit the country.
“No one in Ukraine believes (Russian President Vladimir Putin) will ever let our people go, but he will not let other European nations go either, because he cannot let go of the very idea of war,” Zelensky warned.
At the White House on Friday, Trump urged Kyiv to “get moving” to end the war. “Russia wants to make a deal… He has to move,” the US leader said.
But Rubio said on Saturday that “We don’t know if the Russians are serious about ending the war.”
EU says speech ‘very reassuring,’ some leaders unconvinced
EU top diplomat von der Leyen said Rubio’s speech was “very reassuring” but noted that “in the administration, some have a harsher tone on these topics.”
In her speech to the conference, she stressed that “Europe must become more independent,” including on defense. She insisted on Europe’s “digital sovereignty” — its approach to hate speech on social media.
UK leader Starmer said that “we shouldn’t get in the warm bath of complacency,” saying the UK must re-forge closer ties with Europe to help the continent “stand on our own two feet” in its own defense, and said there needs to be investment that “moves us from overdependence to interdependence.”
Hanno Pevkur, the defense minister of EU and NATO member Estonia, said it was “quite a bold statement to say that America is ‘a child of Europe’.”
“It was a good speech, needed here today, but that doesn’t mean that we can rest on pillows now,” he told The Associated Press. “So still a lot of work has to be done.”

French foreign minister says 'too often' UN fails to act on atrocities
Jean-Noel Barrot calls for urgent Security Council reform, warns legitimacy and efficiency gaps undermine global response to crises
ISTANBUL
French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot warned on Saturday that the UN is increasingly unable to respond effectively to global crises, saying the Security Council too often fails to act when mass atrocities occur.
“Too often now we're seeing situations of mass atrocities where the UN Security Council is not able to project force or to take action, or sanctions,” Barrot told a press briefing at the Munich Security Conference.
He said discussions among G7 members and partners such as India show broad agreement that reform of the UN system is urgent, citing what he described as a growing global perception that the organization “cannot provide full-fledged solutions."
Barrot stressed that the problem is not the UN’s relevance but its structure.
He said reform must address both legitimacy and efficiency, arguing the Security Council should be expanded to better reflect current geopolitical realities.
France supports adding new permanent members, including Japan, India, Germany, Brazil, and two African countries, he added. Currently, the permanent members are the US, UK, Russia, China, and France.
On decision-making, he pointed to a France-Mexico initiative urging permanent members to voluntarily refrain from using veto power in cases involving mass atrocities.
According to Barrot, 107 countries have endorsed the proposal so far, and Paris hopes to push for further commitments or even a resolution before the end of the year if conditions allow.
“It’s not about abolishing veto,” he said. “It’s about maintaining a reasonable use of veto ... when the world witnesses the unbearable reality of human humanitarian catastrophes.”
Despite criticism of the Security Council’s performance, Barrot emphasized the UN’s operational importance, particularly in humanitarian crises. Recalling visits to refugee camps near Sudan, he said that without UN logistics networks “the situation would be untenable. It would be inhuman, it would be dire.”
Barrot also said Paris plans to use upcoming diplomatic platforms, including an Africa-focused summit it will co-chair with Kenya in May, to build support for reform proposals and improvements to peacekeeping and humanitarian delivery.
Beyond UN reform, Barrot addressed broader security issues discussed in Munich, including Europe’s defense posture and the war in Ukraine.
He said Europe has “clearly stood up” militarily over the past decade and must continue strengthening its industrial and defense capabilities, while also preparing for future discussions on continental security architecture that could eventually include dialogue with Russia.
He added that Europe should not interpret possible adjustments in US military commitments as negative, describing them instead as an incentive to build a stronger European pillar within NATO.
On China, Barrot reiterated the EU’s position that Beijing is simultaneously “a partner, a competitor, and a systemic rival,” stressing the need for economic rebalancing while avoiding broad protectionism.
He warned that if cooperation fails, Europe may ultimately have to take steps to protect its economic interests.

Finland secured bronze in the women’s 4x7.5km cross-country relay at the Milan–Cortina Winter Olympics, ending a 12-year wait for an Olympic medal in the event.
The quartet of Johanna Matintalo, Kerttu Niskanen, Vilma Ryytty and Jasmi Joensuu finished third in heavy, wet snow as Norway took gold and Sweden silver.
Norway won in 1:15:44.8. Sweden followed 50.9 seconds behind. Finland crossed the line 1 minute 14.7 seconds after the winners and 21.3 seconds ahead of Germany in fourth.
Matintalo opened the relay in testing conditions on the classic leg. She handed over in sixth place, 12.2 seconds behind Sweden’s Linn Svahn.
“Quite okay. Not super good, but the conditions and the course were challenging,” Matintalo said. “A few main rivals struggled more than I did.”
The opening leg saw several falls on the first downhill. Matintalo later said she had not been able to ski the course in advance and described the track as difficult.
“Conditions are the same for everyone. We won’t hide behind them,” she said.
On the second classic leg, Niskanen moved Finland into contention. She lifted the team to second at the exchange, 23.4 seconds behind Norway.
Her leg included drama as Sweden’s Ebba Andersson fell twice and broke a binding, losing more than a minute.
“It was eventful,” Niskanen said. “I started too hard. My mind wanted to go with Slind, but my legs were further back.”
Niskanen, competing in her fourth Olympics, claimed her fifth Olympic medal and her third in a relay across different Games. She later embraced coach Teemu Pasanen in the service area.
“I said earlier that on Valentine’s Day we have to succeed,” Niskanen said with a smile.
Ryytty, racing her first major championship relay, skied the first freestyle leg. Norway extended their lead to 48.3 seconds, but Ryytty held second place and broke clear of Switzerland’s Marina Kälin.
“I got into a flow state and did not think about the situation,” Ryytty said. “I knew I could ski faster than the ones around me. I just pushed hard uphill and hoped others would drop.”
Head coach Reijo Jylhä praised her performance in an interview with Yle.
“On freestyle, Vilma solved it with her effort. She exceeded herself,” Jylhä said. “We are not so good that without winning skis we can succeed.”
He added that the medal was significant for the entire team. “This has been a journey since summer. Everyone did their part. Also the service team was very good,” he said.
Joensuu started the anchor leg 18 seconds ahead of Sweden’s Jonna Sundling. Sundling closed the gap on the descents and overtook on the final lap to secure silver for Sweden.
Joensuu maintained her pace and ensured bronze, with the chasing group more than 40 seconds behind at one stage. The United States finished fifth, 1:52.2 behind Norway.
“In a way I felt relief at the finish,” Joensuu said. “We have been fourth so many times. I did not want it to come down to a sprint. I skied my own race.”
Finland had finished fourth in the women’s relay at the previous two Olympics. The last Olympic relay medal came in Sochi in 2014, when Niskanen also featured in the line-up.
For Matintalo, Ryytty and Joensuu, the bronze marked their first Olympic medal.
The result brought Finland’s total Olympic medals in cross-country skiing to 87 and their tenth in the women’s relay.

The Ministry of Industry and Trade of Russia fined the Avtomatika concern, part of Rostec, RUB 62.7 million ($812,300). The company was supposed to master serial microchip production for cryptographic protection of information for the Ministry of Defense.
The reason was a delay in fulfilling obligations under a state contract for more than six years, according to CNews.
The development contract was signed back in 2017, and its total cost was RUB 220 million ($2.85 million).
According to the documentation on the state procurement portal, the deadline for the third stage of work, which includes the manufacture of prototypes, was set for November 2019. However, as of the end of January 2026, the obligations remain unfulfilled, and the total delay is 2,262 days.
Several co-contractors are involved in the project: NIIMA Progress and the radio engineering concern Vega. At the current stage, Progress was supposed to supply electronic components, Avtomatika was supposed to manufacture and test the first samples, and Vega was supposed to release a trial batch of products.
The technical requirements for the microchip include a combination of two types of computing cores (for simple and complex commands). The device must also contain RAM with an automatic error correction function. The project planned to create a digital model of the microchip for its design on a computer.
Hardware-level cryptographic information protection tools ensure data confidentiality and integrity more effectively than software solutions. Such modules are in demand not only in the military, but also at critical information infrastructure facilities to protect technological networks. Abroad, similar systems are mass-produced by NXP, STMicroelectronics, and Texas Instruments.

Disgraced Peter Mandelson breaks cover for first time since fresh Epstein revelations
The former UK ambassador to the US was seen leaving his London home on Saturday

The disgraced former Labour peer Peter Mandelson has been seen in public for the first time since fresh claims emerged of his links to Jeffrey Epstein.
The former UK ambassador to the United States was seen leaving his London home and getting into a car on Saturday.
It is the first time Lord Mandelson has been spotted in public since the latest tranche of Epstein files revealed the depths of his alleged links to Epstein.
The claims sent the government into meltdown and forced Lord Mandelson to step down from the House of Lords. It also prompted calls for Sir Keir Starmer to be replaced as prime minister.
It comes days after Lord Mandelson was asked to give evidence to the US Congress over his relationship with the paedophile financier.
A letter to Lord Mandelson, signed by representatives Robert Garcia and Suhas Subramanyam, said it was clear he had “extensive social and business ties to Jeffrey Epstein” and holds “critical information” relevant to Congress’s investigations into Epstein’s operations.
The letter also said: “Numerous pieces of evidence have come to light demonstrating your close ties to Jeffrey Epstein over the span of multiple years.”
Among the evidence, it listed Lord Mandelson’s “handwritten note” in a 50th birthday book for Epstein in which he described the late financier as his “best pal”.
It also pointed to the peer’s stay at the financier’s New York apartment in 2009, while Epstein was serving an 18-month sentence for soliciting prostitution and soliciting a minor, as well as photographs of Lord Mandelson in his underwear in the latest US Department of Justice release.
Lord Mandelson was given a deadline of February 27 to respond to the two US politicians’ letter “due to the urgency and gravity of this matter”.
The former cabinet minister has resigned from the Labour Party and quit the House of Lords since the latest tranche of Epstein files was released in the US.
Among the revelations to emerge were documents from 2009 that appeared to show Lord Mandelson, when he was business secretary, sharing sensitive information with Epstein on at least four occasions.
In the wake of the criticism over Lord Mandelson’s appointment, the government has seen several advisors to the PM quit, including chief of staff Morgan McSweeney, communications director Tim Allan and cabinet secretary Sir Chris Wormald.

‘Nothing says love like chemicals’: Valentine’s roses often covered in pesticides, testing finds

Stay away from roses this Valentine’s Day, environmental campaigners have warned after testing revealed them to be heavily contaminated with pesticides.
Laboratory testing on bouquets in the Netherlands, Europe’s flower import hub, found roses had the highest residues of neurological and reproductive toxins compared with other flowers.
Red roses were found to be the worst, with one bunch containing traces of 26 different pesticides, half of which are banned for use in the EU.
“Nothing says love like roses coated in a fine chemical cocktail,” said Roisin Taylor, of Verde Flower Co in Northumberland, whose business focuses on sustainable flowers and who has been campaigning to raise awareness of pesticides in the industry.
“Things like clofentazine, a chemical found to disrupt the working of your thyroid, or even carbendazim, which is believed to be a human cancer-causing chemical, or maybe chlorfenapyr, which has been found to, ironically, lead to cardiac arrest when exposed in high dose.
“All of these chemicals are also currently banned for use in the EU. We couldn’t, as flower farmers, legally use these toxic chemicals here in the UK.”
Valentine’s Day is the flower industry’s busiest time of the year. According to analysts, about 200m roses are produced to meet the demand for lovers’ gifts on 14 February in Europe alone.
More than half on sale in the UK have been sourced from the Netherlands. But for most stems, that is just the last leg of a much longer journey from farms in countries such as Colombia, Kenya and Ethiopia, where the climate allows for year-round production and laxer regulatory regimes allow for more powerful pesticides.
To determine the levels of pesticide residues on flowers likely to be on sale this Valentine’s Day, Pesticide Action Network Netherlands (Pan-NL) randomly tested 17 bouquets – five bunches of roses, eight mixed bouquets, and four bunches of tulips.
The highest concentration of pesticide residues was found on a bouquet of red roses bought from a Dutch garden centre, with 65.8 mg/kg. Of 26 pesticides detected on the sample, 13 were banned for use in the EU.
None of the bouquets tested were pesticide-free, but the roses and mixed bouquets contained the most residues. Among those, the analysis found 87 different pesticides, including eight metabolites, roughly equally split between insecticides and fungicides.
Of the 79 active substances found, almost a third were banned for use as “plant protection products” in the EU and the Netherlands, while 78% “pose[d] a significant risk to human health and/or the environment”, said Pan-NL. Among the pesticides Pan-NL found on the flowers were known neuro- and reproductive toxins, as well as carcinogens and endocrine disruptors.
The findings come amid growing concerns in the floristry sector around the chemicals to which workers are exposed and their health effects. But in producer countries, such as Kenya, the problems are even more acute.
David Bek, a professor at the University of Coventry who researches the flower industry, described how the farms around Lake Naivasha, Kenya’s major flower-producing region, doused crops repeatedly in chemicals to keep pests at bay.
“They are basically flower factories,” he said, with flowers grown in vast quantities in sealed polytunnels, then sorted, trimmed, bunched and packed by hundreds of workers in processing areas.
Bek said spraying happened at almost every stage of the production process, but particularly as they prepared to ship. “That’s what they have to do to make sure they don’t end up with problems that mean the consignment will get rejected when it gets to the border.”
So where does that leave those of us looking for a Valentine’s gift? Pan-NL recommended “organically grown seasonal flowers or organically grown ornamental plants”.
And for those of us who do receive a “poison bouquet”? The advice is clear: “Don’t throw the remains on the compost heap or in the organic waste bin, but with residual waste. This prevents the toxins from being recycled in nature.”

Rubio, Wang Yi manage US-China great power rivalry in Munich even as core tensions linger
Back-to-back speeches appear to continue relative thaw in run-up to Trump’s expected China trip but sharp swipes are also traded
In back-to-back speeches at the Munich Security Conference, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi spoke of the need to carefully manage the superpowers’ differences, continuing a relative thaw that is expected to see US President Donald Trump travel to Beijing in April.
Wang said he was encouraged that Trump had shown respect for China’s President Xi Jinping and the Chinese people.
“He has stressed that the US and China working together can get a lot of great things done, and the two presidents can make the fantastic relationship between the United States and China even better,” Wang said.
At the same time, he questioned “whether all people in the United States share this view”, pointing to some whom he accused of “cobbling together all these small, exclusive circles”. He said they were “trying to split Taiwan from China and stepping on China’s red lines, which would very much likely push China and the United States towards conflict”.
Rubio, who spoke right before Wang, told the conference it would be “geopolitical malpractice” not to talk to China, as he pledged that Washington would carefully manage its differences with Beijing.

Five countries say Navalny was killed with poison from South American frog
The UK, France, Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden have said that laboratory tests show Kremlin opposition leader Alexei Navalny died after exposure to a toxin found in a tree frog native to Ecuador.
Source: European Pravda citing a joint statement released on 14 February, the second anniversary of Navalny's death in a Russian penal colony
Details: The statement, agreed by the five countries' foreign ministers, effectively accused Russian authorities of poisoning Navalny in prison.
Quote: "The UK, Sweden, France, Germany and The Netherlands are confident that Alexei Navalny was poisoned with a lethal toxin. This is the conclusion of our Governments based on analyses of samples from Alexei Navalny. These analyses have conclusively confirmed the presence of epibatidine."
More details: The statement noted that the neurotoxin is found in poison of dart frogs in South America and is not found naturally anywhere in Russia.
Quote: "Russia claimed that Navalny died of natural causes. But given the toxicity of epibatidine and reported symptoms, poisoning was highly likely the cause of his death. Navalny died while held in prison, meaning Russia had the means, motive and opportunity to administer this poison to him."
More details: The five countries said that Russia had repeatedly shown disregard for international law and the Chemical Weapons Convention, noting that in August 2020 they condemned the use of Novichok to poison Navalny. They also referred to the use of the substance in Salisbury in the UK which had led to the death of a British woman.
Quote: "These latest findings once again underline the need to hold Russia accountable for its repeated violations of the Chemical Weapons Convention and, in this instance, the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention. Our Permanent Representatives to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons have written today to the Director General to inform him of this Russian breach of the Chemical Weapons Convention.
We are further concerned that Russia did not destroy all of its chemical weapons."
More details: The countries said they will use all available tools to hold Russia to account for such actions.
Background:
- Two years ago, on the afternoon of 16 February, Russia's Federal Penitentiary Service reported the death of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny at Correctional Facility No 3. in the town of Kharp in Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Okrug, northwestern Siberia.
- After his death, the EU adopted new sanctions against about 20 people it said were responsible for human rights violations in Russia, including in connection with Navalny's death.
- A case brought by Ukraine against Russia is continuing at the European Court of Human Rights. It concerns a series of high-profile assassination attempts and contract killings organised by Russia in Ukraine and in other countries.

Kennedy is banning junk food from SNAP. Can you guess what counts?

Is Gatorade unhealthy? Granola bars? Take this quiz to understand Kennedy's new SNAP bans.
Warning: It's complicated.
Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s most significant effort to overhaul what Americans eat seeks to block low-income people from buying junk food with their food stamps. It’s not so easy.
Since Jan. 1, five states – Indiana, Iowa, Nebraska, Utah and West Virginia – have banned soda or other unhealthy foods from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, the nation’s largest anti-hunger initiative which serves more than 40 million people. The idea has a long history, with supporters on both sides of the aisle.
But the rollout of those food restrictions has been bumpy and confusing, leaving buyers and grocers trying to figure out what even qualifies as “junk food.” Is Gatorade? What about granola bars? And the five states certainly don’t agree on what counts as candy.
It’s not even clear the policy will accomplish Kennedy’s stated goals. There’s limited evidence they will improve Americans’ health, given that people can use other money to buy whatever they’d like, each state limits different items and the restrictions are not directly tied to nutritional value. Some banned items, for example, are actually lower in sugar or fat than foods that are allowed.
Indiana and Iowa’s state governments have declined to provide a list of banned items, with Iowa going so far as to say it would be “too tedious.” States are instead putting the burden on retailers and consumers to figure things out.
Here’s our quiz to help you understand how it all works — and reveal the inconsistencies in Kennedy’s big push to overhaul SNAP.

TEHRAN, February 14. /TASS/. Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian has committed to removing all obstacles hindering the development of the North-South Transport Corridor project by the end of March. Currently, Tehran and Moscow are collaborating on the construction of the Rasht-Astara railway segment, which will facilitate direct transit to Persian Gulf ports.
"Relations between Iran and Russia are robust, with numerous agreements being signed and actively implemented," Pezeshkian stated. "We aim to eliminate remaining barriers by the end of the year (according to the Iranian calendar, March 20, 2026 - TASS) so that the railway route can be completed and become operational," he added, as reported by Tasnim News Agency.
In 2023, Iran and Russia signed a bilateral agreement to jointly develop a 160-kilometer section of the Rasht-Astara highway, a key component of the North-South Transport Corridor designed to provide efficient access to Persian Gulf ports. The entire project is valued at approximately 1.6 billion euros, with both nations sharing responsibilities for financing design, construction, and procurement of goods and services.
During a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin on December 12, 2025, Pezeshkian announced plans to acquire 100 kilometers of the Rasht-Astara highway for construction, with the goal of completing the process by March 2026.

The only way to bring peace closer in 2026 is to increase pressure on Russia, but there’re no clear signs yet – Latvian President
The conclusion of a peace agreement between Ukraine and Russia currently appears more like a miracle, and the reason for such pessimism is the lack of any signs from Russia regarding the acceptance of any possible peace agreements, according to Latvian President Edgars Rinkēvičs, an Interfax-Ukraine correspondent reported.
"I fully agree with (Czech) President Pavel that the only way to do everything possible to achieve peace in 2026 is to increase pressure on Russia, both politically and economically, through sanctions, the fight against the shadow fleet, etc., and, of course, through support for Ukraine," he said at a Ukrainian lunch on Saturday on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference, organized by the Victor Pinchuk Foundation.
"So far, we haven’t seen any particular signs of pressure," Rinkēvičs stated.
He believes that certain diplomatic maneuvers and negotiations are currently underway, but it would be desirable for the US efforts, along with those of European leaders who are involved in increasing pressure on Russia, to be productive.
"Russia rejects all possible ideas and is unwilling to commit to peace, so we will have to rely not only on diplomacy but also on pressure," the Latvian president concluded.

UK court blocks terror label for Palestine Action

The High Court in London on Friday upheld an appeal against the British government’s decision to ban the pro-Palestinian group Palestine Action and designate it a terrorist organization, ruling that the move was disproportionate and infringed on freedom of expression.
However, the ban will remain in effect for now pending a government appeal scheduled to be heard on Feb. 20.
The government prohibition, which took effect last year, added Palestine Action to a list of banned organizations that includes Hamas and Hezbollah. The designation followed break-ins and acts of vandalism carried out by the group’s activists. Under the ban, membership in or public support for the organization could carry a prison sentence of up to 14 years.
The decision sparked protests by pro-Palestinian demonstrators.
In their ruling Friday, judges said the ban on the group’s activities was “disproportionate” and constituted a significant interference with the rights to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly. Justice Victoria Sharp said only “a very small portion” of Palestine Action’s activities amounted to terrorism.
Britain’s home secretary, Shabana Mahmood, said she was “disappointed” by the decision and would appeal. Jewish organizations in Britain also criticized the ruling, saying they were “deeply troubled” by the High Court’s decision.
Until the appeal is heard, the organization will not be able to resume operations. London’s Metropolitan Police said it would stop arresting the group’s activists. Since the organization was added to the terrorism list, nearly 3,000 arrests have been made, mostly of demonstrators holding signs in support of the group. Hundreds have been charged, though none have yet been convicted.
Outside the courthouse, members of the organization and their supporters celebrated the ruling. “WE WON,” Huda Ammori, one of the group’s leaders, wrote on X. In a recent interview with Britain’s Channel 4, she said the group’s aim “is to save lives in Palestine” and insisted it was “the complete opposite of a terrorist organization.”
On its website, the group, founded in 2020, says its mission is to “end international complicity in Israel’s genocide and apartheid regime.”
Palestine Action has gone beyond protests to target defense companies linked to Israel, at times blocking entrances to their facilities. A primary focus has been the Israeli defense firm Elbit Systems. In 2024, activists broke into an Elbit factory armed with hammers and axes. Footage released by British prosecutors showed violent clashes between activists and police.
Last year, members of the group broke into RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire and sprayed two aircraft with red paint, describing it as a protest against military cooperation with Israel. Prime Minister Keir Starmer called the incident “disgraceful,” and his government subsequently moved forward with the ban.
Jewish organizations in Britain have argued that Palestine Action’s activities targeting Jewish businesses and institutions are “disruptive and intimidating” and extend beyond areas where anti-Israel protests are typically held. They have called on police and the government to clarify how they intend to ensure the safety of the Jewish community following the High Court ruling.
Mahmood said the ban “does not prevent nonviolent protest on the Palestinian issue” and noted that the court agreed on that point. She added that she intends to challenge the ruling in the Court of Appeal.

Syrian Foreign Minister Asaad al Shaibani met International Criminal Court President Tomoko Akane to discuss the issue of holding ousted leader Bashar al Assad and figures of his erstwhile regime accountable, in the “first meeting of its kind” between the two sides.
AlIkhbaria Syria TV, quoted an unnamed Foreign Ministry source as saying that al Shaibani held a meeting with the ICC president on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference on Saturday.
The source said the meeting discussed “files related to transitional justice and ways to hold those responsible for crimes to account, foremost among them the criminal Bashar al Assad and a number of figures of the defunct regime.”
The source added that the meeting “is the first of its kind,” without providing further details.
In late September, Damascus investigative judge Tawfiq al Ali announced the issuance of an in-absentia arrest warrant against Assad, as a prelude to pursuing the case internationally through Interpol.
Assad, who ruled Syria for nearly 25 years, fled to Russia in late 2024, ending the Baath Party’s decades-long grip on power that began in 1963. A new transitional administration led by President Ahmed al Sharaa was formed in January 2025.

Abbas accuses Israel of putting up ‘obstacles’ blocking phase 2 of Gaza ceasefire
Palestinian Authority leader hits out at Jerusalem for ‘continuing to violate’ truce with Hamas, which is refusing to disarm as stipulated by US-backed ceasefire deal
Palestinian Authority President Mahmud Abbas called on Saturday for the removal of “all obstacles” he said Israel has imposed on the implementation of phase two of the Gaza ceasefire.
“We emphasize the need to lift all obstacles imposed by the Israeli occupation on the implementation of the provisions related to the second phase of the agreement,” Abbas said, in a speech read by his Prime Minister Mohammed Mustafa, at an African Union summit in Ethiopia.
This included the work of a technocratic committee established to oversee the daily governance of Gaza, he added.
Removal of the obstacles was needed to “ensure continuity of services, coordinate humanitarian efforts and enable a swift recovery,” the PA president said.
Abbas accused Israel of “continuing to violate” the ceasefire agreement with Palestinian terrorist group Hamas that took effect in October and was backed by the United States.
“From the announcement of the ceasefire until today, more than 500 Palestinians have been killed [in Gaza], which threatens the durability of the truce and the full implementation of its second phase,” he added.
Even though the US-brokered truce entered its second phase last month, violence has continued in the coastal territory, with Israel and Hamas trading blame.
The deal is aimed at permanently ending the Gaza war, which was sparked by the Hamas-led October 2023 invasion of southern Israel, and was endorsed in November by the United Nations.
The second phase stipulates that Israeli forces gradually withdraw from Gaza and Hamas should disarm, with an international stabilization force deployed to ensure security.
Hamas has repeatedly said, however, that disarmament is a red line, although it has indicated it could consider handing over its weapons to a future Palestinian governing authority.
‘A number of conditions’
The Israel Defense Forces still controls more than half of the Gaza Strip, while Hamas and Israel accuse each other daily of ceasefire violations.
Fifteen Palestinian experts on the technocratic committee, which is being overseen by a “Board of Peace” set up by US President Donald Trump, are currently based in Egypt, despite a partial reopening on February 2 of the Rafah Border Crossing, Gaza’s only gateway to the outside world that does not lead to Israel.
Nickolay Mladenov, a Bulgarian diplomat whom Trump named high representative for Gaza, said on Friday that “a number of conditions need to be met” before technocratic committee members can enter the Palestinian territory.
“One, Hamas needs to transfer the civilian control of the institutions in Gaza,” he told a discussion on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference.
“This is not a government coming in after an election. This is far much more complicated,” he said.
“Because Hamas has been governing Gaza for 20 years and… implementing policies that are not in line with Palestinian legislation,” he added.
Other conditions he mentioned included ending Gaza ceasefire violations and “a radical increase in the assistance to people, aid going into Gaza.”
“And finally, we need to make sure that we have the framework agreed in place on the decommissioning of weapons in Gaza,” Mladenov said, emphasizing the importance of the future role of a Palestinian security force.
He said the International Stabilization Force (ISF) for the territory — set out under the Trump plan to end the war — “is extremely important.”
“But far more important than the ISF is the new Palestinian security force that should be deployed in Gaza, that should be able to secure the ground with the assistance of the ISF,” he added.

250,000 at rally in Germany demand ‘game over’ for Iran’s leaders
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
MUNICH, Germany - Cheered by a massive crowd under a sea of flags, the son of Iran’s toppled monarch told a mass rally on Feb 14 in Munich he wants to lead the country into a democratic future.
Police said some 250,000 pro-monarchist opponents of the Islamic republic’s leadership travelled from across Europe to take part in the demonstration held while world leaders met nearby at the Munich Security Conference.
Anger has grown at Tehran’s leaders after the bloody crackdown on protesters in January, while US President Donald Trump has been massing warships in the Middle East and declared on Feb 13 that a change of government in Iran would be the “best thing that could happen”.
“We are here today to support the people in Iran that were murdered by the mullah regime,” one protester, 40-year-old Ali Farzad, told AFP.
“And we are here to support Reza Pahlavi as our leader through the transition for a period.”
Braving a cold drizzle, the protesters cheered loudly when Mr Pahlavi took the stage and told the crowd: “I am here to guarantee a transition to a secular democratic future”.
“I am committed to be the leader of transition for you so we can one day have the final opportunity to decide the fate of our country through a democratic, transparent process to the ballot box.”
Many waved flags with a lion and a sun against horizontal green, white and red stripes, the emblem of the monarchy overthrown in 1979.
Speakers chanted slogans including “Javid shah” (long live the shah), “Pahlavi bar migarde” (Pahlavi is coming back) and “Reza II”, in a call for Mr Pahlavi to become the successor to the founder of the Pahlavi dynasty, his grandfather Reza Shah.
“The Iranian regime is a dead regime,” said a 62-year-old protester originally from Iran who gave his name only as Said. “It must be game over.”
‘Iranians will have their freedom’
US Senator Lindsey Graham also addressed the rally, pumping his fist in the air as he told the protesters: “The Iranian people are going to have their freedom”.
“It is a matter of time, help is on the way – make Iran great again,” added the Republican senator.
Rallies calling for international action against Tehran were also planned in Toronto and Los Angeles on Feb 14.
Mr Pahlavi earlier spoke at the Munich Security Conference and called on Mr Trump to “help” the Iranian people.
Mr Pahlavi, who has lived in exile since his father was overthrown and replaced by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, urged an outside “humanitarian intervention to prevent more innocent lives” being lost in Iran.
Several demonstrators who spoke with AFP denounced US-led international negotiations with Iran, saying that Iran’s leaders do not have legitimacy.
“They shouldn’t talk to them because they are not actually a government. We don’t like them, we don’t accept them,” said Ms Riana, a 40-year-old doctor in Germany who declined to give her last name out of concern for her family’s safety.
“When a government kills their people on the street, they are not (trustworthy),” she said, adding that the world should know that “too many people have been killed and too many people have been injured”.
“The people that you are negotiating with are not representative of the Iranian people,” Mr Farzad said.
The rally was held at the Theresienwiese, which hosts the huge annual Oktoberfest folk gathering, located less than 3km from the security conference venue.
Last week, an estimated 10,000 people rallied in Berlin in response to a call from the MEK, an exiled Iranian opposition group considered “terrorist” by Tehran. AFP

Russia 'poisoned' Navalny in prison with 'rare toxin': European states

Five European countries including Britain, France and Germany accused Russia of "poisoning" opposition leader Alexei Navalny in prison in 2024 using a "rare toxin", on Saturday on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference.
"The UK, Sweden, France, Germany and The Netherlands are confident that Alexei Navalny was poisoned with a lethal toxin," the countries said in a joint statement, following "analyses of samples" from his body.
The staunch critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin died in an Arctic prison in February 2024, while serving a 19-year prison sentence.
The epibatidine toxin found in the skin of dart frogs native to South America was found in samples and "highly likely resulted in his death", the European states said.
"Only the Russian state had the means, motive and opportunity to deploy this lethal toxin to target Navalny during his imprisonment in a Russian penal colony in Siberia, and we hold it responsible for his death," the UK foreign office added in a statement.
Navalny's widow, Yulia Navalnya, said it was now "science-proven" that the Kremlin opponent had been murdered.
"Two years ago I came on stage here and said that it was Vladimir Putin who killed my husband," Navalnaya said on the sidelines of the conference.
"I was of course certain that it was a murder... but back then it was just words. But today these words have become science-proven facts," Navalnaya added.
Navalnaya last September said that laboratory analysis of smuggled biological samples found he was killed by poisoning.
"Today, beside his widow, the UK is shining a light on the Kremlin's barbaric plot to silence his voice," UK Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper, who met Navalnaya while attending the Munich conference, said in a statement.
The countries said they had reported Russia to the world's chemical weapons watchdog -- the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons -- over the finding.
"We are further concerned that Russia did not destroy all of its chemical weapons," the countries said, accusing Moscow of breaching the Chemical Weapons Convention.
Navalny was previously poisoned with the Soviet-era nerve agent Novichok in 2020 while campaigning in Siberia and was flown to Germany on an emergency evacuation flight, where he spent months recovering.
The anti-corruption campaigner had rallied hundreds of thousands across Russia in anti-Kremlin protests as he exposed the alleged ill-gotten gains of Putin's inner circle.

US, Iran set for 2rd round of nuclear talks in Geneva amid tensions: Report
Officials say talks seek deal to prevent conflict while Trump demands zero uranium enrichment and signals readiness for tougher measures
ISTANBUL
The US and Iran are expected to hold a second round of nuclear negotiations in Geneva next Tuesday, according to US officials and sources, amid rising military tensions in the Gulf.
Officials cited by US website Axios said on Friday that the talks, aimed at reaching an agreement that could avert escalation, are expected to include Donald Trump’s son-in-law and unofficial advisor Jared Kushner and White House Envoy Steve Witkoff on the US side, while Iran’s delegation will be led by Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi.
Oman’s Foreign Minister Badr al-Busaidi, who has been mediating between Washington and Tehran, is also set to participate.
Behind the scenes, a US official said Witkoff relayed messages to Tehran through Oman earlier this week.
According to Iranian state TV, Ali Larijani, the secretary of Iran’s Supreme National Security Council, confirmed that he had received a document containing US proposals after meeting Omani officials.
Trump has signaled openness to diplomacy while maintaining pressure through a significant military buildup in the region.
“Either we will make a deal or we will have to do something very tough like last time,” Trump told Axios on Tuesday, evidently referring to the US airstrikes on Iran last June.
Speaking to reporters Friday, he said any agreement must require zero uranium enrichment inside Iran, adding that Tehran has yet to demonstrate meaningful action on its nuclear program. Asked about regime change, Trump said it “seems like that would be the best thing that could happen.”

50,000 foreign soldiers fought for Israel during Gaza genocide

Over 50,000 foreign soldiers fought for Israeli army during Gaza genocide
More than 50,000 foreign nationals have served in the Israeli army as of March 2025, including at least 2,069 British nationals.
A report by investigative outlet Declassified UK has found that 50,632 soldiers serving in the Israeli army hold foreign nationalities in addition to their Israeli citizenship.
An additional 4,440 soldiers have been found to hold two foreign nationalities on top of their Israeli one, alongside 162 other members having three foreign citizenships.
The disclosure comes following a Freedom of Information (FOI) request issued in March last year to the Israeli army by the NGO Hatzlacha, an organisation seeking to promote transparency in Israel.
The country found to have the most nationals serving in the Israeli army was the United States, which has 12,135 dual US-Israeli nationals and 1,207 other soldiers who hold American, Israeli and a third citizenship serving for Israel’s military in Gaza.
France was found to have the second greatest number of nationals serving in the Israeli army, totalling 6,464 individuals. Russian nationals in the Israeli military amounted to 5,169.
The list also included soldiers with nationalities from Germany, Ukraine, Romania, Poland, Ethiopia, Canada, Hungary and Italy among other countries.
Dozens of Israeli soldiers also have Arab nationalities.
These include 14 soldiers with Yemeni nationality, 15 others with Tunisian citizenship, six Jordanian nationals, five Iraqi citizens, four with Lebanese citizenship, three holding Syrian nationalities, and one Algerian citizen.
The International Court of Justice (ICJ), which is currently reviewing a genocide case against Israel, has warned states not to assist Israel in war crimes.
Lawyers have called for governments to investigate the actions of their nationals in Gaza and prosecute them under international law.
British participation in Israel’s war on Gaza
The findings show 1,686 British-Israeli nationals and a further 383 people with British, Israeli, and a third nationality have served in the Israeli military during the war on Gaza that began in October 2023.
The UK Foreign Office said it does not collect information on the number of its nationals within Israeli army ranks, according to Declassified UK.
The British government, however, has faced scrutiny as identities of UK nationals emerged over the course of the genocidal war in which they were seen committing acts that legal experts have argued could amount to war crimes.
Levi Simon, a dual British Israeli national, was identified after posting videos on his social media account rifling through drawers of Palestinian women’s underwear in Gaza homes that had been abandoned.
Londoner Sam Sank was another dual national who filmed himself fighting for the Israeli military in Gaza between December 2023 and January 2024. In an interview with The Times, Sank said he believed there were "hundreds, if not thousands, more Britons fighting in Israel".
"There must be no impunity where credible evidence links British nationals to grave breaches of international law", Paul Heron, a lawyer at the Public Interest Law Centre, told Declassified UK.
"Where dual nationals have served in units implicated in atrocities, the authorities must investigate promptly and, where the evidence meets the threshold, pursue arrest and prosecution like any other serious crime," he added.
Prior data released by the Israeli Knesset showed how 54 British nationals were among the approximately 3,000 so-called ‘lone soldiers’ serving in the Israeli army without holding Israeli citizenship.
An investigation by The New Arab’s sister site Al-Araby Al-Jadeed previously found that young people in the West had been recruited to serve in the Israeli military.
The UK’s Metropolitan Police previously received a complaint against ten British nationals serving in the ranks of the Israeli army, accusing them of "targeted killing of civilians and aid workers, including by sniper fire, and indiscriminate attacks on civilian areas".

Putin has not once negotiated in good faith on ending war, Wicker says
This was stated by Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Senator Roger Wicker, during the panel "Coalition of the Able? Securing Long-Term Support for Ukraine" at the Munich Security Conference, Ukrinform correspondent reports.
"Vladimir Putin has not yet negotiated in good faith. Never once. Vladimir Putin started this war. He's a war criminal. And as you've pointed out, he started committing more war crimes this year by attacking civilians," Wicker said.
According to the senator, Putin will begin negotiating in good faith only when he feels a sufficient level of pressure and losses.
"And that's what these oil sanctions may do. That's what more serious, more decisive and skillful weaponry may do," Senator Wicker emphasized.
In his view, Russia has so far demonstrated no effective step toward a lasting end to the war.
"But he will not negotiate in good faith and has not yet said one word about actually ending this war in a meaningful way that will be lasting," he said.
The panel was attended by President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, and President of the European Parliament Roberta Metsola.
As Ukrinform reported, Zelensky stated during his speech at the Munich Security Conference that in the negotiation process the United States often refers to the need for concessions from Ukraine rather than from Russia.

Beijing to further expand market access for African exports, says statement
ISTANBUL
China will implement zero-tariff measures for the 53 African countries it has diplomatic relations with starting on May 1, Chinese state-run outlet CGTN reported Saturday.
Beijing "will continue negotiating and signing joint economic partnership agreements, and further expand market access for African exports through upgraded mechanisms such as the 'green channel'," said a statement.
The policy would appear to cover almost the entire continent, which has 54 countries.
The development comes as the African Union is holding its annual summit in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.
The two-day gathering is expected to review major security crises across Africa, including Sudan, the Sahel region, and Somalia, along with discussions of climate action, economic reform, and institutional strengthening.

Reza Pahlavi urges US military action in Iran, says signs regime is on brink of collapse

23:44:02 KST

Exiled crown prince and Iranian opposition figure Reza Pahlavi said on Saturday American military intervention in Iran could save lives, urging US President Donald Trump not to spend too long negotiating with Tehran’s clerical rulers on a nuclear deal.
The exiled son of Iran’s toppled shah told Reuters in an interview that there were signs that the Iranian regime was on the brink of collapse and that an attack could weaken it or accelerate its fall.
Pahlavi was speaking on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference, where officials from the Iranian government are banned.
“It’s a matter of time. We are hoping that this attack will expedite the process, and the people can be finally back in the streets and take it all the way to the ultimate regime’s downfall,” said Pahlavi.
The prince is based in the United States and has lived outside Iran since before his father was toppled in the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
A campaign of mass arrests and intimidation has led to the arrests of thousands as Iranian authorities seek to deter further protests after last month’s crackdown on the bloodiest unrest since 1979. The protests began on December 28 as a modest demonstration in Tehran’s Grand Bazaar over economic hardship and quickly spread nationwide.
Trump has questioned level of support for Pahlavi
Iran’s opposition is fragmented among rival groups and ideological factions, including monarchists who back Pahlavi, and appears to have little organized presence within the Islamic Republic. In an interview with Reuters last month, Trump sounded skeptical about the level of Pahlavi’s support inside Iran.
The Trump administration has engaged with Iran to see if a nuclear deal can be struck as Washington amasses military forces in the region. US and Iranian diplomats held talks in Oman last week, and further talks are expected this coming week.
“People are hoping that at some point the decision will be made that there’s no use, there’s no point... We’re not going to get anywhere with negotiations... therefore, that it is time for the United States to intervene and do what President Trump promised he will do – to have the people’s back,” Pahlavi said. “Intervention is a way to save lives.”
On Friday, in a speech to US troops in North Carolina, Trump said Iran has been difficult in nuclear negotiations and suggested that instilling fear in Tehran may be necessary to resolve the standoff peacefully.
Two US officials speaking on the condition of anonymity told Reuters on Friday that the US military was preparing for the possibility of a sustained, weeks-long operation against Iran if Trump ordered an attack.
Pahlavi calls for 'Global Day of Action' anti-regime protests
In addition to his call for US action, on Thursday, Pahlavi raised a call for a “Global Day of Action” directed at the protestors inside Iran.
As part of the action scheduled for 8:00 p.m. in Iran, Pahlavi urged demonstrators to "take to the streets to make the voice of the great and united Iranian nation heard around the world and to secure broader international support."

Czech President: I don't want to create overly optimistic expectations for peace in 2026, knowing the enemy
Russia is not yet ready to end the war against Ukraine; Kyiv needs greater and faster military support for a peaceful resolution, according to Czech President Petr Pavel, an Interfax-Ukraine correspondent reported.
"As a former military man, I don’t want to be overly optimistic about this year, knowing what kind of enemy we have against us," he said at the Ukrainian Lunch on Saturday on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference, organized by the Victor Pinchuk Foundation.
Pavel recalled how three years ago he also warned against exaggerated optimism regarding the planned Ukrainian counteroffensive.
"My colleagues viewed me with a certain suspicion that I was undermining Ukrainian military morale, but all I did was warning against creating expectations that, if unfulfilled, would lead to disappointment on all sides," the Czech President noted.
He emphasized that he would like Ukraine to live in peace as soon as possible, but this requires a number of very specific steps from its partners.
"First, we will have to expedite the delivery of all necessary military equipment and support to Ukraine to avoid losing more territory and create a favorable situation on the ground," Pavel said.
He added that Russia was insisting on its strategic initiative, but the price for every square kilometre of Ukrainian territory was extremely high, and last month it exceeded the capacity to recruit new soldiers.
According to him, if partners can maintain this support or even increase it, and at the same time be very decisive in strengthening sanctions, especially against the Russian shadow fleet, then the conditions can be created for Russia to understand that it cannot achieve greater success on the front, and the only way is negotiations.
"I’m not sure that Russia is mentally prepared for this, and it is up to all of us, including, first and foremost, the United States, to increase even political pressure on Russia, not Ukraine, because that won’t bring Putin to the negotiating table," the Czech president concluded.

Russia killed opposition leader Alexey Navalny using a rare dart frog toxin, five European countries say
Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny was killed in prison using a rare dart frog toxin, five European countries said in a joint statement on February 14.
According to reporting by The Insider, samples taken from the late opposition politician following his death in 2024 were smuggled abroad and found to contain the lethal toxin epibatidine. The outlet reports that experts from several laboratories, working independently, reached the same conclusion after analyzing the samples.
Representatives of five countries — the United Kingdom, Sweden, France, Germany, and the Netherlands — whose laboratories examined Navalny’s samples have issued a joint statement accusing Russia of violating the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC). The statement, coordinated by the five countries’ foreign ministers and published on the British government’s website, stresses that natural exposure to epibatidine in Russia is impossible.
“Navalny died while held in prison, meaning Russia had the means, motive and opportunity to administer this poison to him,” the statement reads. “We and our partners will make use of all policy levers at our disposal to continue to hold Russia to account.”
The statement adds that the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons has been notified of Russia’s violation of the CWC.

Epibatidine was first identified in 1974. It was extracted from the skin of a South American poison dart frog, Epipedobates tricolor, and later synthesized in laboratories. It is a powerful neurotoxin that acts on key receptors in the transmission of pain signals, as well as movement and other bodily functions. The toxin causes numbness throughout the body, which can rapidly progress to complete paralysis. Doses become fatal if the paralysis leads to respiratory arrest, according to The Insider.
“The publicly available information about Alexey Navalny’s symptoms corresponds to what is known about the effects of epibatidine,” Alexander Polupan, the intensive care physician who treated Navalny after his Novichok poisoning in 2020, told The Insider.
Navalny’s widow, Yulia Navalnaya, announced in September 2025 that laboratory tests in two Western countries had confirmed independently that her husband was fatally poisoned in prison. At the time, she said that the laboratories had refused to release the toxicology results due to unspecified “political concerns.”
“I was certain from the first day that my husband had been poisoned, but now there is proof: Putin killed Alexey with a chemical weapon,” Navalnaya wrote on X on February 14. “I am grateful to the European states for the meticulous work they carried out over two years and for uncovering the truth. Vladimir Putin is a murderer. He must be held accountable for all his crimes.”

Militarization to entail Japan’s crushing defeat, Chinese foreign minister warns

MUNICH, February 14. /TASS/. Attempts to return to the path of militarization will result in a crushing defeat for Japan, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi has warned.
"Japan once invaded China and attacked Pearl Harbor under the pretext of a so-called crisis of survival. If Japan gets back to its previous methods, it will doom itself. If it takes risks again, it will lose even faster and suffer an even more crushing defeat," he said, speaking at the Munich Security Conference. The top Chinese diplomat noted that the erroneous statements by Japanese leaders on Taiwan expose "Japan's undying ambitions to invade and colonize the island, as well as the lingering specter of a militaristic resurgence." Wang noted that it is essential to heed the lessons of history, otherwise "the mistakes of the past will be repeated."
"People of good will must be vigilant. Above all, the Japanese people should be on guard not to be deceived and subjugated by far-right forces and extremist ideologies again," Wang added. "All peace-loving countries should also warn Japan of this."
Furthermore, Wang dismissed the assertion that the situation in the Asia-Pacific region is becoming increasingly tense. The way he sees it, Asia continues to maintain peace, and even the recent conflict on the border between Cambodia and Thailand was quickly resolved thanks to the efforts of all parties involved.
"China has become a pillar of peace in Asia. As an important force contributing to the maintenance of peace in modern times, China will continue to play a constructive role in ensuring regional peace and stability," he added.

Zelenskyy says Europe’s absence from peace talks is a 'big mistake' as he calls for more sanctions

The Ukrainian leader also called for stronger measures to crack down on Russia's shadow fleet of oil tankers which he described as "floating wallets" for Moscow. Zelenskyy said he's open to an election, but needs ceasefire.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said it is a "big mistake" that European leaders are “practically not present at the table” in ongoing US-brokered negotiations to end the war with Russia.
In a keynote speech at the Munich Security Conference on Saturday, Zelenskyy said Kyiv is working to ensure that Europe’s “interests and voice are taken into account,” arguing that any sustainable peace must reflect the security concerns of the entire continent, not just Ukraine and the United States.
His remarks echoed comments by French President Emmanuel Macron on Friday who suggested Europe will have to redesign the continent's security architecture independently facing an aggressive Russia on a "sugar high" from war.
Ukraine will hold another round of trilateral talks with the US and Russia next week. The process started in February last year after Washington renewed contact with Moscow, still little progress has been achieved in ending hostilities with no ceasefire in place.
Zelenskyy told the conference he hopes that the upcoming round of negotiations will be “serious, substantive, helpful for all of us” but voiced frustration over how the different parties appear to often be "talking about completely different things."
Russian officials, he said, invoke what they call the “spirit of Anchorage", referring to the bilateral meeting Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump held in the Alaskan city last summer, in which the Russia leader said the "historical origins" of the war would have to be addressed in any peace deal. Ukraine, Zelenskyy said, can only guess at its meaning.
The Ukrainian leader also expressed concern that discussions of “concessions” frequently focus on Ukraine alone, without asking for equal compromises from Russia.
“Too often those concessions are discussed in the context only of Ukraine, not Russia,” he added, suggesting that it risks rewarding aggression rather than deterring it. Europe’s absence from key conversations, he added, compounds that imbalance.
Central to Kyiv’s position is a demand for binding security guarantees before any agreement to end the war is signed. European countries, under the Coalition of the Willing format, are expected to shoulder most of the burden on security guarantees, but an American backstop is seen as essential by both Ukraine and the Europeans.
“Peace can only be built on clear, clear security guarantees,” Zelenskyy said. “Where there is no clear security system, war always returns.”
Ukraine, he said, has prepared detailed proposals and is ready to sign agreements on security guarantees with both the United States and European partners, and that he remains "in constant contact" with US envoys, including Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner.
Zelenskyy also said he expects to see a precise date for Ukraine's accession to join the EU as part of a peace deal. Earlier, he suggested that date could "technically" be 2027.
Ukraine to hold elections only if it can get a ceasefire
Addressing calls for elections in Ukraine, a demand pushed by Trump, Zelenskyy said he would be open to holding elections if a genuine ceasefire is put in place. Under the threat of bombs, he insisted, Ukraine cannot hold a fair election.
“Give us two months of ceasefire, we will go to elections,” he said, noting the logistical challenge of enabling soldiers on the front lines to cast ballots.
In a jibe at Moscow, Zelenskyy said he would be happy to hold a ceasefire in order for free elections to be held in Russia, where Putin has been in office for two decades.
The Ukrainian leader called on partners to step up measures to ensure the Kremlin's energy revenues run dry. Oil and gas provide the bulk of the financing for Russia's war effort, despite numerous sanctions as a result of circumvention and third countries.
"Russian oil tankers still move freely - freely along Europe’s shores, in the Baltic Sea, in the North Sea,” he said. “In total, Russia still uses more than 1,000 tankers. Each of them is, in fact, a floating wallet for the Kremlin.”
Zelenskyy said he had recently discussed sanctions with French President Macron and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, pushing for Russian tankers at sea to not only be detained but fully blocked and confiscated. The EU is preparing a new sanctions packaged to be unveiled this month as the war enters another year.
"Without oil money, Putin would not have money for this war," Zelenskyy said.

The Simpsons showrunner makes bold prediction on show’s future
- The Simpsons showrunner, Matt Selman, has revealed that if the long-running animated series were to conclude, it would not feature a traditional finale but rather appear as a regular episode.
- Selman stated that the show's characters are designed to reset each week, likening it to Groundhog Day and that a previous episode already parodied typical series finale concepts.
- Currently in its 37th season and having aired 800 episodes, there is speculation that a forthcoming sequel to The Simpsons Movie could serve as the show's ultimate conclusion.
- Despite Selman's comments about characters not dying, the series has recently killed off several figures, including Alice Glick, the church organist, in November.
- Larry the Barfly, a character since season 10, was also killed off the previous year, prompting an explanation from executive producer Tim Long about highlighting the dignity of peripheral characters.

Brazilian skier Lucas Pinheiro Braathen wins South America's first-ever Winter Olympics medal
Brazilian ski racer Lucas Pinheiro Braathen swiped away the competition with a powerful final run in the Olympic giant slalom on Saturday, winning gold and earning South America's first-ever medal at a Winter Games.
With snow falling and fog settling in, the 25-year-old Pinheiro Braathen remained cool and relaxed as he navigated his way through the technical Stelvio course. After seeing his place — No. 1 — he fell to the snow before starting to scream.
He finished in a two-run combined time of 2 minutes, 25 seconds. He beat Swiss racer Marco Odermatt, the defending Olympic champion, by 0.58 seconds. Odermatt's teammate, Loic Meillard, earned the bronze medal.
The Norwegian-born Pinheiro Braathen is the fun-loving, samba-dancing skier who's ready to get this party started. On the back of his helmet, he has in big letters "Vamos Dancar" — "Let's Dance." He represented Norway until October 2023, when he abruptly retired from the sport.
In March 2024, he announced he would return to the alpine skiing circuit, representing Brazil — his mother's native country and where he spent much of his youth.
He's already accomplished plenty of "firsts" with his new country: First Brazilian Alpine racer to finish on a World Cup podium last year and first-ever World Cup win for the country this season. Now, the first Brazilian gold medalist.
Brazil's President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva celebrated his country's first-ever Winter Olympics medal on his social media channels.
"This unprecedented result shows Brazilian sport has no limits. It is the reflection of talent, dedication and continuous work to strengthen sport in every dimension," Lula said. "Congratulations to Lucas Pinheiro and all the team involved in this historic achievement, which inspires new generations and widens the horizon for Brazilian sport."

Deadly drone strikes cloud US-brokered Russia-Ukraine talks in Geneva
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and US Secretary of State Marco Rubio hint at difficulties in next week’s talks.
A deadly exchange of drone strikes has killed one person in Ukraine and one in Russia and cast doubts on the prospects of a ceasefire before another round of negotiations to end the war next week.
News of the deaths comes as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and US Secretary of State Marco Rubio signalled hurdles to reaching an agreement in Geneva as the conflict is about to enter its fifth year.

Zelenskyy told world leaders at the Munich Security Conference on Saturday while he hopes “substantive” progress will be reached during the trilateral meeting next week, it often feels like the two sides “are talking about different things” in negotiations.
“The Americans often return to the topic of concessions, and too often those concessions are discussed only in the context of Ukraine, not Russia,” Zelenskyy said.
Rubio said it’s unclear if Moscow truly wants to make a peace deal.
“We don’t know if the Russians are serious about ending the war,” he said before the same Munich event. “We’re going to continue to test it.”
Among the most contentious issues in the negotiations is Russia’s demand for a full withdrawal of Ukrainian troops from the remaining parts of Ukraine’s eastern region of Donetsk that it still controls.
Ukraine has rejected a unilateral pullback and wants Western security guarantees to deter Russia from relaunching its invasion if a ceasefire is reached.
Rubio did not attend a Ukraine-focused meeting with European and NATO leaders held on the sidelines of the first day of the Munich conference on Friday, citing scheduling issues.
In Munich on Saturday, Zelenskyy insisted Russia should not get away with its attack on Ukraine. He said he hoped the United States would stay involved in the peace negotiations and European countries would deepen their involvement.
Dutch Foreign Minister David van Weel told Al Jazeera while US President Donald Trump should be credited with moving talks forward, he should put more pressure on Russian President Vladimir Putin instead of Zelenskyy.
“Putin has shown no goodwill to come to the table and make a serious deal. The Ukrainians are ready,” van Weel said.
Last week, Zelenskyy said the US had given the warring parties a June deadline to reach a deal, although Trump’s previous ultimatums have not resulted in a breakthrough.
Two previous rounds of trilateral talks in Abu Dhabi, led by US envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, reportedly focused on military issues such as a possible buffer zone and ceasefire monitoring.
Zelenskyy later said he spoke with Witkoff and Kushner.
Hundreds of thousands of soldiers and tens of thousands of civilians have been killed since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022, according to many estimates, making the war Europe’s deadliest since World War II.
Russia is suffering “crazy losses” in Ukraine with about 65,000 soldiers killed on the battlefield over the last two months, NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte told the conference.
Separately, Rutte told a media roundtable the NATO alliance is strong enough that Russia would not currently try to attack it. “We will win every fight with Russia if they attack us now, and we have to make sure in two, four, six years that same is still the case.”
Among the latest casualties was an elderly woman killed on Saturday when a Russian drone hit a residential building in the Black Sea port city of Odesa, Ukraine’s State Emergency Service said.
On Wednesday, Russian strikes also killed three children, including two-year-old twins and their father in the northeastern region of Kharkiv.
In January alone, Russia launched more than 6,000 drone attacks against Ukraine, according to Zelenskyy. But he added Ukraine will soon produce enough interceptors to make Russia’s Iran-made Shahed drones “meaningless”.
He also told the Munich conference that every power plant in Ukraine has been damaged in Russian attacks.
In Russia, a civilian was killed in a Ukrainian drone strike on a car in the border region of Bryansk, Governor Alexander Bogomaz said.
The attacks came a day after a Ukrainian missile strike on the Russian city of Belgorod near the border with Ukraine killed two people and wounded five, according to Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov.
Gladkov earlier said the attack also caused serious damage to energy facilities and electricity, heating and water supplies were cut off. Three apartment buildings in the city sustained damage, he said.
Ukrainian member of parliament Oleksiy Goncharenko, meanwhile, accused Moscow of launching “energy terror” with attacks on electricity facilities in the heart of winter.
“I can’t call it any other way because when it is minus 20 Celsius in Kyiv and you don’t have heating, you don’t have electricity in your apartment, you’re just freezing and that is awful,” Goncharenko told Al Jazeera in Munich.
“I think it’s time for the United States to put real pressure on Russia. Yes, they are at the table, but it’s time to put real pressure to make them have real negotiations, because what we have today is not real negotiations.”

The wave of misfortune at the Louvre shows no sign of stopping. On Tuesday, February 10, two museum employees were taken into police custody. Both long-time staff members, Le Monde has learned, including one nearing retirement, they were suspected of involvement in a large-scale ticketing fraud, reported by their colleagues and prompting a formal complaint from management in December 2024. Then, during the night of February 12, new misfortune struck: Flooding damaged the ceiling painted by Charles Meynier in 1819, titled The Triumph of French Painting, in a room of the Denon Wing that houses masterpieces by Fra Angelico and Bernardino Luini.
Firefighters arrived immediately on the scene and stopped the leak shortly after midnight, management told Le Monde. On the morning of February 13, a restorer was able to make an initial assessment: The artwork had two tears and areas where the paint layer was lifting. The team of the chief architect for historic monuments, who promptly examined the ceiling's condition, determined there was no structural problem. The space was closed until early afternoon.

EU chief Ursula von der Leyen told the Munich Security Conference that Europe and Britain need to to cooperate more closely on "security, on economy.. on defending our democracies".
"Europe and in particular the UK should come closer together .. 10 years on from Brexit our futures are as bound as ever," she told the Munich Security conference.
British leader Keir Starmer echoed her.
"We are not at a crossroads: The road ahead is straight and it is clear. We must build our hard power, because that is the currency of the age," he said.
"We must be able to deter aggression and, yes, if necessary, we must be ready to fight," he said, calling for a building of "a shared industrial base across Europe which can turbocharge our defence production" and "multiply our strengths".
On Friday NATO chief Mark Rutte said that "a strong Europe in a strong NATO means that the transatlantic bond will be stronger than ever" and French President Emmanuel Macron said that "this is the right time for a strong Europe," that would be "building its own architecture of security".

Love at 85, 93: Rosh Hashanah romance that began at shul
Unknown

23:33:35 KST

Margie and Hayyim agree on two things: You’re never too old to fall in love, and there’s more than one reason to go to shul.
Rabbi Hayyim Halpern was born in 1930. Margie Tutnauer was born in 1938. When they connected in the fall of 2023, Hayyim was a widower; his wife, Sara Reinharth, had died in 2021.
Margie was also widowed; her husband, Rabbi Moshe Tutnauer, died in 2010. Hayyim and Sara had been married for 69 years; Margie and Moshe for 53.
Hayyim and Moshe had been rabbinical colleagues, and over the years, Hayyim and Margie encountered each other at various rabbinical events. As Margie wryly describes her role at the time: “I was then ‘the wife of.”’
On Rosh Hashanah 2023, Hayyim and Margie were seated in the same section of the Ramot Zion Synagogue in Jerusalem’s French Hill neighborhood.
“I was upset with some young people who were making noise during the service,” recalls Hayyim. Margie came to their defense: “I’m just happy that they’re here with us in the synagogue today.”
That brief exchange sparked a new relationship between Hayyim and Margie, and they began connecting as widow and widower.
Margie lives in French Hill and has been an active member of Ramot Zion for over 40 years, attending Shabbat services regularly. Hayyim began attending Ramot Zion in 2023 after moving into Golden Hill, the assisted living facility in French Hill.
“It was a logical choice,” Hayyim explains. “I’m a Conservative rabbi, and Ramot Zion is a Masorti [Conservative] congregation within walking distance of Golden Hill.”
Soon after Rosh Hashanah, Margie began dropping off reading materials for Hayyim.
“I wanted to call her to thank her,” Hayyim says. “And she made it easy. She left her name, address, and phone number with the front desk. I began to get the impression that this woman was interested in me, and I was very flattered.”
Margie smiles as she recalls her approach.
“After I became a widow in 2010, my friend Benita gave me some good advice. She encouraged me to be proactive and to start dating. Over the years, I met many interesting men. But Hayyim is the best man I’ve met in the past 15 years.”
Hayyim is vocal in his praise of Margie: “Margie has a wonderful smile. She loves to be with people.”
Their relationship soon settled into a comfortable rhythm. They began sitting together at kiddush after Shabbat services, and Hayyim would walk Margie home.
“At one point,” Margie recalls, “after Hayyim had walked me home, I asked him if he’d like to have lunch with me. He did, and of course, I had already thought it through and had lunch ready.”
That became their regular routine: kiddush at Ramot Zion, followed by a walk to Margie’s home for Shabbat lunch. It’s a straight walk that takes them about 30 minutes, including the time they rest on benches along the way.
Spending time with eachother during the week
During the week, they also keep a steady rhythm. While they enjoy life together and spend time with each other’s families, they maintain some independent connections.
Hayyim gives an example: “Most Tuesdays, Margie joins the morning minyan at Ramot Zion, has coffee with friends from the shul, and then comes to my apartment, where we watch movies. We both love old films like Dr. Zhivago and Gone with the Wind.”
He has advice for other couples. “If you don’t agree politically, just don’t talk politics. That’s what works for Margie and me.”
Margie adds, “If we have medical problems, we don’t turn to each other. We turn to our family. And in general, our family comes first.”
Margie is blessed with two sons living in Israel, six grandchildren, and seven great-grandchildren. Hayyim has three daughters, eight grandchildren, and six great-grandchildren.
One of his daughters, Alita, lives in Jerusalem and is a member of Ramot Zion.
Margie was born in Detroit to the Weingarden family, who had lived there for four generations. She met Moshe Tutnauer when they were working at Camp Ramah in Wisconsin.
Moshe made aliyah in 1972 from Phoenix, Arizona.
Hayyim and Sara made aliyah in 1992. Before moving to Israel, Hayyim served for more than 25 years as rabbi of the Beth Tikvah Synagogue in New Milford, New Jersey.
He is a graduate of the Jewish Theological Seminary and author of Torah Dialogues, a book based on discussions with his congregants.
Hayyim and Margie are “ringed” to each other – connected by rings that symbolize their comOver the years, many of their Ramah friends made aliyah and settled in French Hill. Margie and commitment to each other. Margie wears Hayyim’s college ring; Hayyim wears a ring that once belonged to Margie’s grandfather.
What advice do Margie and Hayyim have for singles of all ages?
Go to shul.

Tel Aviv nightlife to a rooftop proposal: A modern love story

Love stories have undoubtedly changed since the advent of dating apps, resulting in the darling meet-cute stories becoming at risk of extinction.
Still, romance seems to persevere in the Jewish state, as one couple explained to the Magazine how a game of backgammon in a dingy bar is leading them to make a lifetime commitment.
Tzvi-Bar proposed to Lexi in August, following eight long years of snatching brief moments together across the globe.
The self-proclaimed “nerd” knew from the moment he met Lexi that she would be his wife, and like everything else in the medical student’s life, he approached that certainty with total commitment, doing whatever it took to turn it into reality.
“If you want to do something, you can achieve anything. You just have to work hard for it,” Tzvi-Bar explained.
Lexi made aliyah from New York after spending some additional time in Israel following the completion of her Birthright-Taglit trip.
Enjoying the vibrant nightlife Tel Aviv has to offer on White Night, she tagged along to a bar with a group of friends, accompanied by the soldier who had joined her on the program.
Among the group was Tzvi-Bar, ready and waiting to teach the then-18-year-old how to play backgammon – whether she wanted to learn or not.
“It wasn’t like love at first sight... I mean, he was… super nerdy. He was trying to teach me backgammon. I was, like, drunk at 4 a.m.,” Lexi admitted, while describing how Tzvi-Bar “manifested” their inevitable love story.
With only a month left of her trip, she received a text from Tzvi-Bar, who had gotten her number from a mutual friend.
Couple discovers adventurous side
While their first date was normal – a trip to the shuk, a nice dinner, and some karaoke – the pair quickly discovered they each had an adventurous side.
Within a few dates, Lexi found herself skydiving near Haifa with a man she barely knew, and it was then she realized, “We were on the same page with adventure and trying new things.”
Early into the relationship, Tzvi-Bar told Lexi, “You’re my future wife,” despite knowing she would soon return to the US to start her degree studies at Ithaca College.
Still young, Lexi thought his confidence was “super weird and crazy,” but he proved his dedication with more than just words.
Only a month after Lexi returned to the US, Tzvi-Bar followed. He made the 12-hour journey under the guise of helping his friend move to start studying at Yale but spent most of his days enjoying Lexi’s company.
“I think he was really persistent and determined and saw something in me in the beginning. And now, of course, it’s been eight years, and I really love him,” Lexi said.
Taking turns visiting each other, the pair agreed that whoever finished their studies first would move to be with the other. Tzvi-Bar’s army service meant that Lexi was the one to move, and she happily relocated to Beersheba.
While Tzvi-Bar was the pull she needed to move to Israel, Lexi had dreamed of making aliyah for many years. At only 15, during a brief Gadna course (simulated IDF basic training), she was voted “most likely to make aliyah.”
After years apart, the pair thought they would finally settle together in the heart of southern Israel, but then Tzvi-Bar was accepted to medical school in Poland.
Goal-oriented, Tzvi-Bar knew that in order to provide a good life for his future family and fulfill his dream, he had to accept the spot, but Lexi had already moved across oceans and wasn’t eager to uproot herself again.
The pair were separated once more, though switching places, with Tzvi-Bar residing in the Diaspora. “We really struggled. That was a rough patch in the relationship,” Lexi admitted.
“It was a hard thing because as you get into medical school, that’s a big, exciting thing that’s happening, but there was a duality of ‘I’m happy for you, and I want you to live your dreams. But on the other hand, I just got here, I’m trying really hard to learn a new language, to immerse [myself] in a new culture, and I don’t want to start again,’” he said.
Lexi spent her days working as a pole dancing instructor, acting in English commercials, and performing with the Light Opera Group of the Negev (LOGON), integrating into the country and building a strong group of friends.
For two years, the pair would fly to see each other every chance they got, and now, finally, Tzvi-Bar can finish up his clinical rotation at a hospital in Israel.
Knowing he didn’t want to part from her again, he popped the question in August, planning an elaborate engagement to show his love.
The epitome of “If he wanted to, he would,” Tzvi-Bar told Lexi to get dressed up and get her nails done for a family photo before his sister enlisted in the army and for an anniversary party for his mother and her now ex-wife.
Dolled up and ready for a festive event, Lexi was confused to find herself ushered off the bus to Jaffe early by Tzvi-Bar’s sister. With a sunset making Lexi’s red dress look even brighter, his sister insisted on a photo shoot.
When they arrived at the rooftop of The Arab-Jewish Community Center, Lexi was met with a red carpet extending from the elevator to the center of the room, where Tzvi-Bar was waiting on one knee with a ring.
“He was on his knees with the ring, smiling, and there was a sign, ‘Lexi, marry me,’ with no question mark, just ‘Lexi, marry me,’” she recounted. “It was really cute. He didn’t walk up to me or take me, I had to get to him while crying…he never moved. He was like a statue.
“He invited two friends each. So there were four people and his sister. It was really, really cute… and during sunset.”
Asked how she knew Tzvi-Bar was a person worth making the move for and then waiting for in a new country, Lexi described how he made her feel and how he demonstrated his commitment through action.
“I would describe him as super normal,” Lexi said, despite her early impression of him.
“I found someone very grounded, who knows what he wants to do with his life. He’s going to be a doctor, and he’s very passionate about it… He’s on a week and a half break in Israel, and he already spent one day in Jerusalem doing a Magen David Adom ambulance shift.”
Lexi explained that it was his genuine acts of kindness she had witnessed – like how he helped fix her elderly neighbor’s outlets to make them safe – that showed her he had the soul of someone she could trust.
Asked how she knew Tzvi-Bar was the real deal and not just another charming Israeli man, known colloquially as a “Tomer,” Lexi said she might have felt differently had he been one of the soldiers on her Taglit trip, noting the reputation of such men.
Tzvi-Bar also “never had a party phase,” indicating to her that he had more genuine intentions.
“I think everyone has to make their own judgment,” she asserted.
“Like, is this person serious? Is this like a lifelong commitment type of thing, or is it a fling? I wouldn’t move whole countries for something that’s not for sure. Like, is this the father of my children, you know?
“I feel that I found a gem. People in our day and age, people like him, are either friendzoned or not appreciated because they’re [in] the nerd community…
“I think the lesson is: We need to appreciate the nerds more. You have to find them because they’re really hard to find, and they’re really, really special,” Lexi advised.

How Ukraine Will Experience a Logistics Revolution With EU Accession

Ukraine’s path to the European Union is a challenging negotiation on laws, regulations, and democratic principles. But it also involves inclusion in the European economic system, where logistics connections will play a strategic role for trade and security.
We discussed this with Mario Mauro, member of the European parliament and former Italian defense minister, who was appointed European Coordinator for the Baltic, Black Sea, and Aegean Sea Transport Corridors by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. His tasks include extending European corridors to Ukraine, which entails huge investments in transport and infrastructure.

Follow our coverage of the war on the @Kyivpost_official.
Ugo Poletti: How was the TEN-T policy reshaped by the EU’s understanding of Ukraine’s needs of safe transports, security, and resilience towards economic shocks?
Mario Mauro: For decades, we as Europeans built our peace and thrived around an idea that was once unimaginable between countries that had sat on opposite sides of the trenches during WWII: freedom of circulation of goods and people. To achieve this, we started opening our borders and began thinking in ways that, years later, led us to establish the TEN‑T (Trans-European Transport Network) policy.
Ivan Marchuk at 90 – An Interview from Vienna
An interconnected Europe is a continent that can face unprecedented challenges; it is ready to deliver for its citizens when climate change threatens forests in Greece or Portugal. An interconnected Europe can be resilient and ensure that all our critical infrastructures are safe from hybrid threats. An interconnected Europe shows that the future of Ukraine, Moldova, and the Western Balkans lies within the EU, against those ghosts of the past that we are once again called to dismantle – showing that together we can endure challenges as one united continent.
Do you believe that transport infrastructure has now become a component of Europe’s defence architecture? If so, is this new role reflected in TEN-T planning and priorities?
Strategic infrastructure such as railways has always been dual-use throughout the history of modern transportation. Russian aggression has brought back into focus the crucial role played by Ukrainian railways, which – thanks to their expertise and unbreakable spirit – allowed thousands of civilians to evacuate safely from the frontline, while also protecting military supply chains at the front.
All of this – and this may sound shocking to some – was achieved while keeping ordinary public transport intact along the lines, for however “ordinary” a state of war can be, I would add.
What we are working toward is a capillary, durable, and modern infrastructure that can deliver quickly under the greatest pressure on member states. Defense, by its very essence, is a key pillar of a strategically interconnected transport grid.
Among my duties as Coordinator, a key priority is the unification of gauge systems in Finland and Eastern Europe, improving readiness and reducing response times to the bare minimum for member states in case of need. This is one of my priorities for the coming months, together with all our partners along the corridor.
Ukraine and Moldova became a front line of strategic competition. How does this affect the EU’s long-term vision for connectivity in Eastern Europe and the Black Sea basin?
I will be very direct on this point: we need to deliver at all levels of cooperation within member states and with our partners in the region – Ukraine and Moldova in the first place. Connectivity is the backbone of competitiveness, and this must be our compass for action.
We have gone far in enhancing our transport capacity along the Corridor, but we need to go the extra mile – enhancing not only capability and interoperability, but also strengthening our critical and energy infrastructure, avoiding bottlenecks, and guaranteeing access to affordable, sustainable, and abundant energy. This energy should circulate freely within the system, providing relief during peak periods and redistributing supply to regions where it is most needed.
As TEN-T Coordinator also for the Black Sea, what are the main challenges in synchronizing national priorities within a single European corridor?
As TEN‑T Coordinator, my task is to build consensus and promote corridor thinking and mindset. I believe we must keep the focus on functional continuity and long‑term European connectivity, rather than reasoning solely in terms of individual national projects.
This becomes crucial in regions such as the Black Sea and Baltic corridors, where scaling up resources and bringing together good practices and diverse ideas on how to reach shared targets has proven, without any doubt, to be the winning strategy.
The key to the success of the TEN‑T project is to start moving together, giving regions the opportunity to generate European added value. As at the start of Europe’s political journey, solidarity and step‑by‑step cooperation – solving problems and improving citizens’ lives – will allow us to complete the Union by embracing all regions and like‑minded partners.
In practical terms, how does the coordination between European funding instruments and national budgets work? What mechanisms ensure that investments are coherent rather than fragmented?
Instruments such as the TEN‑T Regulation and the Core Network Corridors, together with national work plans, provide a shared reference framework guiding both EU funding (e.g. CEF) and national investment decisions.
What is important is that EU funds are designed to act as catalysts, not substitutes, for national budgets. Grants are combined with national co‑financing. Another powerful instrument is EIB loans; the EIB is a crucial partner in this journey, with whom I am fully aligned, and as coordinators we will have a key meeting next month.
Finally, funding is increasingly linked to project maturity, taking into account cross‑border impact and contribution to corridor objectives, thereby reducing the risk of fragmented or overlapping investments.
How do you define “energy efficiency of transport” within the TEN-T framework, and why has it become a strategic priority for the EU?
Energy efficiency goes hand in hand with energy security. The TEN‑T framework is also closely linked to the interconnection of energy facilities. A memorable achievement was last year, when the Baltic states officially disconnected from the Russian power grid.
Recent developments and intelligence gathered in the field show us that hybrid threats and energy disruptions are real, and that they can target our hospitals, ports, and power grids.
How does improving the energy efficiency of transport corridors contribute to Europe’s energy security and resilience, especially in times of crisis or conflict?
To answer this, I think the only thing I should point to when discussing energy security is the brutality Russia has repeatedly shown by targeting power plants and energy supplies in Ukraine – leaving families, children, and hospitals without power in the depths of winter, with temperatures reaching -27°C. This is what we must bear in mind when we speak about energy security.
Why are measures like electrification of railways and ports energy independence particularly critical for the Black Sea and Eastern European connectivity today?
Rail and maritime transport are essential for providing high-capacity, energy-efficient, and resilient connectivity for long‑distance freight. In the Black Sea region, they are crucial for linking ports, the Danube, and hinterland markets – especially where road capacity and border crossings are constrained.
Key measures include a modal shift from road to rail and inland waterways, rail electrification, and shore‑side electricity and renewable energy in ports. Digital traffic management and interoperability systems will further reduce congestion, fuel use, and energy waste.
What are the main bottlenecks in rail connections between Ukrainian ports and the EU, and how can they be addressed in the short and medium term?
The main bottlenecks are, first and foremost, gauge differences, as well as limited border capacity, infrastructure in need of upgrading and strengthening, and a shortage of intermodal terminals.
TEN-T provides a technical, regulatory, and investment roadmap that allows Ukraine to align its infrastructure standards with those of the EU well before full accession. This enables early integration, accelerating processes through compatible networks, shared priorities, and coordinated, ambitious funding.
Nevertheless, it is impossible to ignore the elephant in the room: the unlawful and brutal aggression by Moscow must come to an end, and Putin must be brought to negotiations that are accepted and agreed upon by our allies and partners in Kyiv.
Describe what the success of the Black Sea TEN-T Corridor could look like in 10 years, from an economic, strategic and political perspective.
Success would mean a fully connected, interoperable, and resilient corridor supporting trade, reconstruction, and energy security. Strategically, it would strengthen Europe’s eastern connectivity; politically, it would anchor the Black Sea region more firmly within the EU’s future.
And a small – perhaps naïve – aspect in such a complex world would be imagining the corridor as a hub for people carrying their wishes and aspirations, not only as an aseptic system for the economic mobility of goods.

European nations say Alexei Navalny was poisoned by the Kremlin with dart frog toxin
Five European countries say tests confirm Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny was poisoned with a lethal toxin found in poison frogs, and they blame the Russian state
- Bookmark
Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny was poisoned by the Kremlin with a rare and lethal toxin found in the skin of poison dart frogs, five European countries said Saturday.
The foreign ministries of the U.K., France, Germany, Sweden and the Netherlands said analysis of samples taken from Navalny's body “conclusively confirmed the presence of epibatidine.” It is a neurotoxin found in the skin of dart frogs in South America that is not found naturally in Russia, they said.
The countries said in a joint statement that “Russia had the means, motive and opportunity to administer this poison.” They said they were reporting Russia to the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons for a breach of the Chemical Weapons Convention.
They made the announcement as Navalny's widow Yulia Navalnaya attended the Munich Security Conference in Germany as the second anniversary of Navalny's death approaches.
Navalny, who crusaded against official corruption and staged massive anti-Kremlin protests as President Vladimir Putin’s fiercest foe, died in an Arctic penal colony on Feb. 16, 2024. He was serving a 19-year sentence that he believed to be politically motivated.
“Russia saw Navalny as a threat," British Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper said. "By using this form of poison the Russian state demonstrated the despicable tools it has at its disposal and the overwhelming fear it has of political opposition.”
Navalny’s widow, said last year that two independent labs had found that her husband was poisoned shortly before he died. Navalnaya has repeatedly blamed Putin for Navalny’s death, something Russian officials have vehemently denied.
Navalnaya said Saturday that she had been “certain from the first day” that her husband had been poisoned, “but now there is proof.”
“Putin killed Alexei with chemical weapon,” she wrote on social network X, calling Putin “a murderer” who “must be held accountable.”
Russian authorities said that the politician became ill after a walk and died from natural causes.
Epibatidine is found naturally in dart frogs in the wild, and can also be manufactured in a lab, which European scientists suspect was the case with the substance used on Navalny. It works on the body in a similar way to nerve agents, causing shortness of breath, convulsions, seizures, a slowed heart rate and ultimately death.
Navalny was the target of an earlier poisoning in 2020, with a nerve agent in an attack he blamed on the Kremlin, which always denied involvement. His family and allies fought to have him flown to Germany for treatment and recovery. Five months later, he returned to Russia, where he was immediately arrested and imprisoned for the last three years of his life.
The U.K. has accused Russia of repeatedly flouting international bans on chemical and biological weapons. It has accused the Kremlin of carrying out a 2018 attack in the English city of Salisbury that targeted a former Russian intelligence officer, Sergei Skripal, with the nerve agent Novichok. A British inquiry concluded that the attack “must have been authorized at the highest level, by President Putin.”
The Kremlin has denied involvement.

In Munich, Zelenskyyy, US Congress senators discuss sanctions against Russia, security guarantees for Ukraine
In Munich, President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy held a meeting with a bipartisan delegation of U.S. senators: Lindsey Graham, Richard Blumenthal, Chris Murphy, Jeanne Shaheen, Mark Warner, Chris Coons, Sheldon Whitehouse, Peter Welch, Mark Kelly, Lisa Murkowski, Jacky Rosen, Elissa Slotkin, Andy Kim, Roger Wicker, and Ruben Gallego.
“The Head of State thanked the senators for their unwavering bipartisan support for Ukraine and the Ukrainian people and expressed special gratitude to the United States of America for the air defense systems that have saved thousands of lives, as well as for the PURL initiative. Volodymyr Zelenskyy awarded Lindsey Graham and Richard Blumenthal the Order of Yaroslav the Wise, I class,” the presidential press service reported.
The senators expressed their support for Ukraine and noted the courage of Ukrainian warriors.
Zelenskyy noted that Ukraine needs additional generators and transformers to enhance energy resilience and additional air defense missiles to protect infrastructure from Russian shelling.
“We are facing too many attacks every day – two major large-scale attacks in one week. Throughout the winter, there were massive attacks involving 300–500 Iranian drones, as well as 25–45 missiles, mostly ballistic,” the Head of State said.
Special attention was given to the negotiation process and the meetings of the negotiating teams. The President emphasized that increasing pressure on Russia through stronger sanctions could significantly intensify diplomatic efforts. The senators support the position that pressure on the Russian leader should be increased and stated their firm determination to pass a sanctions bill against Russia in the near future.
“I believe that Putin is not ready for serious negotiations. I think we have made progress, but he believes that over time he will be able to seize Donbas. And he will not stop until the pressure increases,” Graham said.
The meeting also addressed work on security guarantees for Ukraine. Zelenskyy noted that clarity and precise understanding of each point are crucial for the Ukrainian society’s trust in the security guarantees document. No one wants a repeat of the Budapest Memorandum. That is why it is extremely important for all Ukrainians that the security guarantees be ratified by the United States Congress.
In their comments, the senators emphasized their support for strong and reliable security guarantees that will provide the necessary protection and prevent a recurrence of aggression.
In addition, the President provided a detailed update on the situation on the frontline and the level of Russian losses.

EU membership for Ukraine by 2027 is not ruled out, enlargement commissioner says
European Enlargement Commissioner Marta Kos has said the current EU enlargement methodology was designed for peacetime and is in need of radical change.
Source: Kos speaking at the 9th Ukrainian Lunch organised by Victor Pinchuk Foundation on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference, as reported by European Pravda
Details: Kos said Ukraine has already "contributed positively to Europe" by forcing the EU to rethink its priorities and putting enlargement back on the agenda.
Quote: "Second, we know again how important security in Europe is. Perhaps we have forgotten."
More details: Kos acknowledged that under the EU's current legal framework, it is not possible to complete the tasks Ukraine has set for itself.
Quote: "The methodology we are using now is made for peace. It's made for times when we have really enough time that the country can do all the necessary reforms. Sweden, just as an example, was the most developed country applying for the EU membership, but even Sweden needed three years.
So, based on the present methodology, it's not possible by 1 January 2027. But we have to find the solution, how to bridge the gap between the merit-based principle and methodology which we use plus-minus for the last forty years, and the geopolitical challenges on the other side. We cannot wait anymore."
More details: Kos said discussions on this have already begun, but she did not go into detail.
She emphasised that Ukraine's EU accession should be seen not only as enlargement, but as a geopolitical necessity.
Quote: "It is unifying Europe, and it is for the first time ever we have the possibility, if we do it right, to do unification of Europe. And this is what is much, much bigger than just enlargement."

Background:
- Ukraine's Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said earlier in Munich that a fast-track agreement on EU accession is realistic. German Defence Minister Boris Pistorius has also said that agreeing on a specific date for Ukraine's EU accession is possible.
- A recent opinion poll showed that support among Ukrainians for joining the EU has risen sharply.

Palestinian leader Abbas urges removal of all Israeli 'obstacles' on Gaza ceasefire
Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas called on Saturday for the removal of "all obstacles" he said Israel has imposed on implementing phase two of the Gaza ceasefire.
"We emphasise the need to lift all obstacles imposed by the Israeli occupation on the implementation of the provisions related to the second phase of the agreement," Abbas said, in a speech read by his prime minister Mohammed Mustafa at an African Union summit in Ethiopia.
This included the work of a technocratic committee established to oversee the daily governance of Gaza, he added.
Removal of the obstacles was needed to "ensure continuity of services, coordinate humanitarian efforts and enable a swift recovery", the president said.
Abbas accused Israel of "continuing to violate" the ceasefire agreement with Palestinian group Hamas that took effect in October and was backed by the United States.
"From the announcement of the ceasefire until today, more than 500 Palestinians have been killed (in Gaza), which threatens the durability of the truce and the full implementation of its second phase," he added.
Even though the US-brokered truce entered its second phase last month, violence has continued in the Palestinian territory, with Israel and Hamas trading blame.
The deal is aimed at permanently ending the Gaza war and was endorsed in November by the United Nations.
The second phase stipulates that Israeli forces gradually withdraw from Gaza and Hamas should disarm, with an international stabilisation force deployed to ensure security.
Hamas has repeatedly said that disarmament is a red line, although it has indicated it could consider handing over its weapons to a future Palestinian governing authority.
'A number of conditions'
The Israeli army still controls more than half of the Gaza Strip, while Hamas and Israel accuse each other daily of ceasefire violations.
Fifteen Palestinian experts on the technocratic committee, which is being overseen by a "Board of Peace" set up by US President Donald Trump, are currently based in Egypt, despite a partial reopening on February 2 of the Rafah border crossing, Gaza's only gateway to the outside world that does not lead to Israel.
Nickolay Mladenov, a Bulgarian diplomat whom Trump named high representative for Gaza, said on Friday that "a number of conditions need to be met" before technocratic committee members can enter the Palestinian territory.
"One, Hamas needs to transfer the civilian control of the institutions in Gaza," he told a discussion on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference.
"This is not a government coming in after an election. This is far much more complicated," he said.
"Because Hamas has been governing Gaza for 20 years and... implementing policies that are not in line with Palestinian legislation," he added.
Other conditions he mentioned included ending Gaza ceasefire violations and "a radical increase in the assistance to people, aid going into Gaza".
"And finally, we need to make sure that we have the framework agreed in place on the decommissioning of weapons in Gaza," Mladenov said, emphasising the importance of the future role of a Palestinian security force.
He said the International Stabilisation Force (ISF) for the territory -- set out under the Trump plan to end the war -- "is extremely important".
"But far more important than the ISF is the new Palestinian security force that should be deployed in Gaza, that should be able to secure the ground with the assistance of the ISF," he added.

Qatar emir, UAE president discuss regional, international developments in Abu Dhabi
Leaders stress coordination, diplomacy and regional de-escalation efforts
ISTANBUL
Qatar's Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani met on Saturday UAE President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan in Abu Dhabi to discuss regional and international developments, with a focus on the Middle East.
The Qatar News Agency (QNA) reported that the two leaders exchanged views on current global and regional challenges, including the Middle East, and efforts aimed at advancing de-escalation.
Both sides emphasized the importance of continued coordination and underscored the need to prioritize dialogue and diplomatic solutions to reinforce security and stability and support development across the region.
The leaders also reviewed the close fraternal ties between Qatar and the UAE and explored ways to strengthen cooperation for the benefit of both peoples.
Sheikh arrived in Abu Dhabi earlier Saturday on what Emirati and Qatari media described as a “fraternal” visit.
The visit comes amid steadily improving relations between Doha and Abu Dhabi following the January 2021 Al-Ula agreement, which ended a diplomatic rift lasting more than three years between Doha and several Gulf states.
Sheikh Mohamed also received visits described as “fraternal” from Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi on Monday and Bahrain’s Crown Prince Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifa on Friday.

Zelensky's calls for harassing Russian athletes highlight his Nazi essence — MFA

ST. PETERSBURG, February 14. /TASS/. Russian Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova has condemned Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky's recent calls for harassment of Russian athletes, suggesting that his rhetoric exposes a neo-Nazi inclination. Zakharova recalled Zelensky's expressed horror at the presence of numerous Russian athletes at the Winter Olympics in Italy, along with his demands for similar actions from other nations.
"If that's not neo-Nazism, then what is?" she asked. Zakharova emphasized that such calls to target athletes based on their nationality and to incite hostility reflect the very essence of neo-Nazism. "This is precisely what neo-Nazism looks like - calls for discrimination and harassment based on ethnicity or nationality," she remarked.
Zakharova noted that Zelensky is calling for the persecution of those who "came solely to showcase their talents and abilities, as well as the work they've put into developing them."
"If they're not simply perceived on the basis of their nationality, because their national character and national cultural values can be noted, but are instead persecuted - it’s the limit," she emphasized.
"Various peoples in Europe were similarly persecuted in the 1930s, including Jews. Slavs were also persecuted, and then physically exterminated. Roma were also persecuted, along with other peoples who were declared unworthy of either existence or participation in certain events," Zakharova recalled. "You understand, this is monstrous.".

Russia poisoned Putin critic Navalny in prison with ‘rare toxin’: European states
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
MUNICH – Five European countries, including Britain, France and Germany, accused Russia of poisoning opposition leader Alexei Navalny
“The UK, Sweden, France, Germany and the Netherlands are confident that Alexei Navalny was poisoned with a lethal toxin,” the countries said in a joint statement, following “analyses of samples” from his body.
The staunch critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin died in an Arctic prison in February 2024, while serving a 19-year prison sentence.
The epibatidine toxin, found in the skin of dart frogs native to South America, was found in samples and “highly likely resulted in his death”, the European states said.
“Only the Russian state had the means, motive and opportunity to deploy this lethal toxin to target Navalny during his imprisonment in a Russian penal colony in Siberia, and we hold it responsible for his death,” the British Foreign Office added in a statement.
Mr Navalny’s widow Yulia Navalnaya said it was now “science-proven” that the Kremlin opponent had been murdered.
“Two years ago, I came on stage here and said that it was Vladimir Putin who killed my husband,” Ms Navalnaya said on the sidelines of the conference.
“I was, of course, certain that it was a murder... but back then, it was just words. But today, these words have become science-proven facts.”
In September, she said that laboratory analysis of smuggled biological samples found that Mr Navalny was killed by poisoning
“Today, beside his widow, the UK is shining a light on the Kremlin’s barbaric plot to silence his voice,” British Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper, who met Ms Navalnaya while attending the Munich conference, said in a statement.
The countries said they had reported Russia to the world’s chemical weapons watchdog – the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons – over the finding.
“We are further concerned that Russia did not destroy all of its chemical weapons,” the countries said, accusing Moscow of breaching the Chemical Weapons Convention.
Mr Navalny was previously poisoned with the Soviet-era nerve agent Novichok in 2020 while campaigning in Siberia and was flown to Germany on an emergency evacuation flight, where he spent months recovering.
The charismatic anti-corruption campaigner had rallied hundreds of thousands across Russia in anti-Kremlin protests as he exposed the alleged ill-gotten gains of Mr Putin’s inner circle. AFP

Zelensky, Rutte discuss funding and further development of PURL program
According to Ukrinform, Zelensky stated this on Facebook.
According to Zelensky, Ukraine highly appreciates the contribution of every state.
"We are counting on continued funding for this initiative, which enables us to purchase missiles for air defense systems," he noted.
Zelensky said he also discussed with Rutte cooperation with partners to strengthen Ukraine's ability to protect lives and the opening of joint defense enterprises in Europe.
"I thank Mark for the meeting and for his consistent support. I am also grateful for the highly productive meeting in the Ramstein format – partners confirmed the allocation of EUR 38 billion in military aid for Ukraine. And that is truly significant," Zelensky emphasized.
As reported by Ukrinform, Rutte believes that Ukraine will continue to receive military equipment through the PURL initiative and that sufficient funds will be raised for this purpose.

The Turkish landing ship TCG Sancaktar delivered about a dozen M60 and M48 tanks to the port of Mogadishu in Somalia.
Immediately after unloading, eyewitnesses recorded the transport of combat vehicles through the streets of the capital on video, according to OSINT analyst Rich Tedd.
The delivery of the tanks coincided with the start of operations by the Turkish Navy in the country’s territorial waters.
The M48 Patton tank appeared in the United States in the early 1950s as a replacement for the M47 tank.
The first versions were equipped with a 90 mm gun, but were later upgraded to the standard 105 mm gun. The tank has a hemispherical turret and a distinctive hull shape for better shell deflection.
The M60 was developed based on the M48 model. It was equipped with a 105 mm M68 rifled gun. The hull and turret armor were made of cast steel.
This vehicle became the main battle tank of many NATO countries in the second half of the 20th century.

BUDAPEST, February 14. /TASS/. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban calmly responded to Vladimir Zelensky's latest insult, but warned him that Ukraine will not become a member of the European Union.
Speaking at the Munich Security Conference on Saturday, Zelensky said Orban was "growing a belly" instead of building up his army. "Dear Vladimir Zelensky, thank you for your latest campaign speech in support of Ukraine's accession to the European Union. It will significantly help Hungarians see the situation more clearly. However, you're misunderstanding something: this discussion isn't about me or you. It's about the future of Hungary, Ukraine, and Europe. That's precisely why you can't become a member of the European Union," Orban wrote on his social media page.
The Hungarian government has repeatedly stated that it will not allow Ukraine's hasty accession to the EU, as it would create a threat of a direct military confrontation with Russia and cause significant harm to the European economy.

Trump administration seeking tech firm data on Americans critical of immigration agents: Reports
Homeland Security issued hundreds of administrative subpoenas to tech firms for information on anonymous accounts critical of ICE agents
ISTANBUL
Amid its controversial immigrant crackdown, the Trump administration is reportedly broadening its effort to track Americans critical of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), requesting user data from tech firms on people who have voiced opposition to the agency.
Hundreds of administrative subpoenas from the Department of Homeland Security in recent months have been served on Google, Reddit, Discord, and Meta -- which owns US-based social media platforms Facebook and Instagram -- four government officials and tech employees with direct knowledge of the matter told The New York Times, according to a report published Friday.
The sources spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to comment publicly.
Google, Meta, and Reddit complied with some government legal demands seeking identifying details of anonymous accounts critical of ICE, officials said. The New York Times reviewed two subpoenas sent to Meta in recent months.
The companies said they evaluate such requests before complying and, in some cases, notify users, giving them time to challenge the order in court.
“The government is taking more liberties than they used to,” said Steve Loney, a supervising attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union of Pennsylvania. “It’s a whole other level of frequency and lack of accountability.”
The ACLU also argued at a Jan. 14 court hearing in California that the government is using such administrative subpoenas to target people whose speech it does not agree with.
The department said it has “broad administrative subpoena authority” but did not directly respond to questions about the requests. In court filings, its lawyers argued the information is being sought to help protect ICE agents operating in the field.
The Trump administration has defended such controversial tactics as ICE officers wearing masks and no identifying information, and refusing to give their names, saying the officers have been targeted by ICE critics, but provided little evidence of this.
The report comes amid a large-scale ICE crackdown on immigrants across many states, sweeping up longtime residents of the US, as well as some asylum seekers, with the death of at least two US citizens who voiced opposition. Opinion polls have also shown widespread public opposition to ICE and its tactics.
The NYT said Meta, Reddit, and Discord declined to provide comment on its story.

Russia poisoned opposition politician Alexei Navalny with a toxin from a poison dart frog, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden and the United Kingdom said on Saturday.
The five governments made the announcement at the Munich Security Conference, two years after news broke during the same event of the pro-democracy campaigner’s death in a Russian prison.
Analyses of samples from Navalny’s body “conclusively confirmed” the presence of a toxin called epibatidine, which is found in poison dart frogs in South America and could only have been deployed by Russia, the countries said in a joint statement.

LONDON, Feb 14 - Britain, France, Germany, Sweden and the Netherlands are convinced that late Kremlin critic, Alexei Navalny, was poisoned with a lethal toxin in an Arctic penal colony two years ago, they said in a joint statement on Saturday.
The five governments said their findings were based on analyses of samples from Navalny's body, which they said "conclusively" confirmed the presence of epibatidine, a toxin found in poison dart frogs in South America and not found naturally in Russia.
Russia has also been reported to the Organisation on the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons over the breach, the statement issued in London said. The Russian government has repeatedly denied any responsibility for Navalny's death.
Navalny died in an Arctic prison colony in February 2024, and was convicted of extremism and other charges, all of which he denied. His team and his widow Yulia Navalnaya have since accused Putin of ordering his murder.
He died "while held in prison, meaning Russia had the means, motive and opportunity to administer this poison to him," the joint statement said, adding that the findings showed Russia needed to be held accountable for "its repeated violations of the Chemical Weapons Convention and, in this instance, the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention."
"We are further concerned that Russia did not destroy all of its chemical weapons."
In a separate statement, British foreign minister Yvette Cooper, who met Navalny's widow at the Munich Security Conference, said that the findings were "shining a light on the Kremlin’s barbaric plot to silence his voice." REUTERS

The original Epstein? FBI is holding thousands of files on Detroit millionaire and his sinister island

The original Epstein? FBI is holding thousands of files on Detroit millionaire and his sinister island
Before Jeffrey Epstein’s crimes shocked the world, another wealthy bachelor built his own secret operation on a remote, private island in Lake Michigan. One podcaster tells Andrea Cavallier how he has picked up the cold case - and is trying to expose what authorities failed to do
- Bookmark
North Fox Island looks idyllic from the air – shaped like a teardrop, dense with forest and edged with sandy shores. It’s surrounded by the cold blue waters of Lake Michigan and located 19 miles off the coast of the Leelanau Peninsula.
In the 1970s, the uninhabited island belonged to Francis “Frank” Shelden, a Detroit millionaire with a Yale degree, a prestigious family name, and a reputation as a philanthropist.
Shelden bought the island from a widow for $20,000 and carved out an airstrip, dug miles of dirt trails, and built cabins deep into the woods. Transportation to and from the island was, and still is to this day, limited. The island - just two miles wide and one mile long - could have been considered paradise.
But investigators later uncovered the island’s disturbing purpose – an elaborate child sexual abuse ring operating behind the front of a summer camp for disadvantaged boys.
The only arrest was of Shelden’s co-conspirator, Gerald Richards. Richards was a gym teacher who moonlighted as a magician. The operation on the island was exposed when one of his students told their mother about inappropriate conduct by Richards in gym class.
Richards pleaded guilty to charges of first-degree criminal sexual conduct and was sentenced to 20 years in prison. But Shelden, who reportedly got word from another co-conspirator that the police were investigating, fled the country. He was never caught.
The secret operation, disguised as Brother Paul’s Children’s Mission, was promoted as a retreat or summer camp for boys. But an investigation later uncovered evidence that these boys were transported to the island by private plane for depraved sex acts. The number of victims is unknown, but authorities believe there are at least dozens, if not hundreds.
The case has haunting similarities to the Jeffrey Epstein saga, which has come under renewed public scrutiny this year. The Trump administration has released millions of files on the late financier’s sex trafficking operations of underage girls and women, entangling dozens of rich and powerful people.
Like Shelden, Epstein had an island of his own - Little St. James, which locals nicknamed “Pedophile Island,” is a private paradise in the U.S. Virgin Islands.
And similar to Shelden’s case, only Epstein’s accomplice, Ghislaine Maxwell, has been convicted of a crime. She was sentenced to 20 years in prison on sex trafficking charges. Epstein died by suicide in a New York jail cell in 2019 while awaiting trial.
The similarities are not lost on Colin Browen, a documentary filmmaker and podcast host who is working on an investigative docuseries with author and investigative journalist J Ruben Appleman about Shelden’s operation. It’s set to be released later this year.
“Essentially, Frank Shelden was the Jeffrey Epstein of the 1970s,” Browen told The Independent. “It’s as simple as that.”
Browen, who launched The Paranormal Files and Murder in America, began to look into the North Fox Island saga when he noticed there was a lack of coverage on organized pedophilia.
“Somewhere along the way, when we were doing these stories, I started noticing that there was a certain type of crime that wasn’t being covered – and that was organized pedophilia,” Browen said.
“I found the story one day,” he said about Shelden’s case. “And I couldn’t believe what I was reading, and I just went on TikTok, made a video... and two years later, I found myself on North Fox Island actually investigating the crimes for myself.”
Browen’s investigation has taken him outside of Michigan, as far as the Netherlands, Amsterdam, Germany and India, places where it’s believed Shelden continued to commit pedophilia crimes. He claims to have spoken to new victims of Shelden, along with alleged perpetrators.
The project “challenges how wealth, power, and institutional protection have historically shielded perpetrators from accountability and why these patterns continue today,” he said.
But Browen believes there is more information about Shelden’s case that officials have not released. After multiple requests with the FBI and other agencies, he is now suing the FBI for access to more than 1,047 unreleased files in the Shelden case, after the bureau claimed that it would take more than six years to redact the documents.
Brother Paul’s Nature Camp: A Front for Abuse
When Browen visited North Fox Island in 2024, he was reminded how eerily silent it was.
Some of the cabins that were built for Shelden’s camp were still standing, the same structures described by the boys in the files he had been examining for months.
“They described CSAM being recorded, torturous sexual abuse, horrific things happening on the Island,” Browen said about what he had read in the files.
CSAM (child sexual abuse material) is a term now used by Law enforcement and child protection organizations to accurately reflect crimes against children.
Shelden was born into Michigan royalty – a descendant of Russell Alger, a lumber baron and the state’s 20th governor who later served as President William McKinley’s secretary of war.
A 1975 Detroit Free Press profile described Shelden as a wealthy bachelor who had graduated from Yale University with a master’s degree in geology from Wayne State University. He also served in the Michigan Air Guard and volunteered with the Big Brothers club. Shelden never married.
In 1975, Shelden opened Brother Paul’s Nature Camp, a tax-exempt charitable trust and a mission that promised tutoring, counseling, and outdoor experiences for troubled boys.
His partner, Gerald Richards, was a Catholic school gym teacher and traveling magician who recruited children to the camp – often his own students. Shelden was the “figurehead in this operation,” but he also had co-conspirators, Browen explained. And one of those was Richards.
“He was actually caught for this. He's kind of like Ghislaine Maxwell in this story in a way,” Browen said. “He would help get children.”
Mike Dunsmore, a fire chief in Greenwood Township, Michigan, was a former student of Richards. He told During a Click On Detroit interview in 2019, Dunsmore recalled a number of horrific stories from his time at the camp. Including a time in which Richards ordered other boys to bury him in the sand while he was naked.
Escape from justice
Shelden and Richards were not the only ones linked to the horrific crimes. Dyer Grossman and Adam Starchild were also named in both Detroit police reports and case files with the FBI.
But when the investigation into the camp began in 1976, and Richards was arrested, both Shelden and Grossman evaded capture by fleeing the United States.
“Somehow, he was given enough time to go through all of his properties and destroy all the evidence, every file, everything, and that’s officially where the trail ends on Sheldon,” Browen claims about Shelden.
Starchild was questioned about his alleged involvement in Shelden’s operation, but there was not sufficient evidence to charge him.
The US Attorney’s Office in Detroit issued an arrest warrant charging Shelden with criminal sexual conduct, a felony in Michigan, involving the procurement and sexual activities involving young boys ages 8-14 in the Port Huron and Traverse City areas.
Both Shelden and Grossman were declared fugitives of justice. Shelden fled to the Netherlands, eventually married a French woman to obtain citizenship, and reportedly continued abusing boys across Europe, according to Browen, who plans to chronicle the new findings in his docuseries.
There are reports that Shelden died in Amsterdam in 1996, but details are limited.
“There’s a marriage certificate for him,” Browen said. “And he’s got a death certificate in Amsterdam, and that's it.”
Richards pleaded guilty to charges of first-degree criminal sexual conduct. On September 13, 1976, he was sentenced to 20 years in prison, according to a Michigan State Police report.
He testified about his role in the pedophile ring at a congressional hearing on child abuse in 1977, stating that Brother Paul Nature Camp was designed to victimize children and evade taxes. Richards is reported to have died in 1998 by suicide.
There is little information about Grossman and Starchild in the years after the ring was busted. It’s unclear if either man is still alive.
Is there a possible link to unsolved child murders?
The abuse at North Fox Island was taking place at the same time as another notorious Michigan crime - the Oakland County child murders.
Between February 1976 and March 1977, four children were abducted and murdered in Oakland County. Their killer, or killers, have never been arrested for their murders.
The victims were Mark Stebbins, 12; Jill Robinson, 12; Kristine Mihelich, 10; and Timothy King, 11. Police believe only the boys had been sexually assaulted. The cause of death in three of the cases is listed as suffocation, but Jill Robinson was murdered with a shotgun.
But there has been persistent speculation that the killings were linked to the child pornography ring on North Fox Island, which was investigated by police in 1977.
Investigators do not believe Shelden or Richards could have been the Oakland County Child Killer, but one theory suggests the killer could be someone they victimized on the island, Click on Detroit reported.
“We were the first to look at pornography and pornography rings and pedophilia as being a motive in this (Oakland County Child Killer) case,” former Wayne County Detective Cory Williams told The Shattered podcast as reported by Click on Detroit. “We put quite a bit of time and effort into that. Were these kids filmed? Pictures taken? Were they passed around? We don’t know at this point, but we did put a lot of time and effort into that.”
Over the years, investigators had persons of interest in the case, many of whom were linked to or had been charged with crimes involving pedophilia.
One of those individuals was Christopher Busch. He was a convicted pedophile who lived in Bloomfield Hills and came onto police radar in 1977. But in 2012, police said there was no evidence suggesting Busch was the killer. His DNA does not match the physical evidence investigators have. He died in 1978 in what was ruled a suicide.
A suspect is not currently named in the Oakland County Child Killer case.
New findings
When Browen began investigating Shelden, it was an interview with Appelman that would shed new light on the case and bring Browen face-to-face with some of the victims.
Appelman’s book, The Kill Jar, chronicles both the North Fox Island sex trafficking ring and the Oakland County child murders after years of studying thousands of pages of local, state, and FBI case documents, including previously private witness statements, autopsy reports, catalogs of evidence, crime scene photos, interrogation transcription, polygraph results, and personal correspondences and interviews highlighted within piles of bankers boxers obtained through Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request, according to his bio.
He wrote that the North Fox Island operation “functioned essentially as a subscription service centered on the production of child pornography and the sexual abuse of boys ages 7 to 16. In exchange for their contributions, the camp’s ‘sponsors’ could receive pornography that police said was produced on the island, or even visit the island themselves.”
But it’s what happened after the book’s release that inspired Browen to team up with Appelman for further investigation.
Appelman told Browen that hundreds, if not thousands, of messages had been sent to him from people who claimed they were molested by Shelden after he fled to Europe.
“We have spoken with victims of his over there, and we also tracked him all the way to India… We have photographs of him with children in an orphanage in the 1990s.” Browen said.
“Like, this guy is single-handedly responsible for all these children who were molested or used for the production of the CSAM material, and what's shocking to me is, you know, in doing a series like this, not only do we want to track the crimes of Shelden and figure out who he victimized and where he was, because it's never been done,” he added.
The upcoming docuseries will also take a closer look at the crimes that Shelden reportedly committed in Europe and Asia.
“From the underbelly of the Netherlands, to orphanages in India, to the glitzy hills of Hollywood, and back to the place where it all started in North Fox Island,” Browen said.
Browen pointed out that this investigation feels particularly timely amid the ongoing release of the Epstein files. He added that he’s hoping to raise awareness of the Shelden case and show what happens when “the pressure is not applied.”
Shelden “had a network of pedophiles he was sending that material to,” Browen explained. “Thousands of pedophiles on his mailing lists, thousands of pedophiles that were receiving CSAM materials through the mail, none of them ever arrested, none of the people that were producing the materials, none of them investigated or anything, and it all just went away.”
“We're seeing the same thing with Epstein,” he added.
Coming forward
Browen says his focus is on the survivors.
“If you actually look at these stories, and you read the facts and you go beyond the headlines and you watch interviews with survivors, and for me, you sit in a room with them, and you cry with them, and you hear stories that they've never been comfortable enough to share before," he said.
“It becomes so real that it consumes you, and for me, there's nothing else that I can even think about at this point other than trying to raise the alarm surrounding these historic rings because this is what happened.”
He recalled meeting a man in Amsterdam who said he had been sex trafficked to Shelden by his own grandfather.
“He had some absolutely horrific stories, and I mean, everybody's crying,” Browen said. “Like, there's a lot of crying and tears from our all-male production team, you know, it's really powerful stuff.”
Browen warned that without accountability, history repeats itself.
“If we don’t do something about Epstein and find some sort of justice for all of the survivors and victims, the story is just going to die and go away.”
A pattern that never ended
Like Epstein, Shelden was a bachelor who used his wealth, philanthropy and society connections to shield his crimes in plain sight. Thousands of men on Shelden’s mailing lists were never charged. Names remain unknown.
Browen has filed multiple Freedom of Information Act requests with the FBI with the aim of obtaining thousands of unreleased files on the case.
But the FBI has told him it could take more than six years to redact and release the documents, he said.
“With my requests to the FBI… they’ve told me it’s going to take six plus years to send over a thousand,” he said. “Which makes no sense.”
The FBI did not respond to The Independent’s questions about the Shelden files.
North Fox Island was bought by the state of Michigan in 2000. It sits quietly abandoned. But Browen refuses to let the horrific crimes that happened there fade into the past.
His team has since returned to the island with cadaver dogs - and what they found was shocking, he said. Browen wouldn’t reveal details, but said they are planning to go back and that they will continue to push for answers.
“You can see what happens when everything fails,” he said. “When people aren't brought to justice, and either someone escapes, someone dies ... well, the stories just fade away. We can’t let that happen.”

‘I Just Felt Like I Had No Control’: How Nerves Overwhelmed Ilia Malinin in Olympic Shocker
Unknown
Unknown Publisher
2026-02-14

23:08:02 KST

It’s been a bit of a whirlwind week for Ilia Malinin, who arrived at his first Olympics as the no-brainer winner of the men’s figure-skating event. The four-time U.S. champion has outscored his competitors by as much as 10, 30, or 40 points in the past. So essentially, he was untouchable, and the battle was for silver and bronze.
But in his first appearances on Olympic ice, Malinin showed some fallibility and faltered in the short program of the team event, finishing behind Japan’s Yuma Kagiyama. He won the free program segment in the team event, but wasn’t his usual dominant self. He seemed to have shaken off the nerves for the individual men’s event a couple of days later and finished in first, nearly six points ahead of Kagiyama. The gold was his to lose. All he had to do was skate the free program that had made history, with seven quad jumps, and he would be the indisputable champion.
After erupting in applause when he was introduced, the Milano Ice Skating Arena fell silent as Malinin took his starting position and his music —actually Malinin’s own voice in an opening spoken word section—began. He landed a clean quad flip to start the program and seemed to be on track to repeat his seven-quad performance from December. But it soon became clear that his victory was hardly a sure thing. The next jump was supposed to be the quad axel that only he has landed in competition, but he popped it in the air and only received points for a single axel. He seemed to brush off that mistake and landed a solid quad lutz, but then faltered on the planned quad loop and opened up again in the air, completing only two rotations.

The mistakes began taking a toll. His next jump was a combination, starting with the quad lutz, but he fell on that jump and wasn’t able to complete the next two in the series, and received deductions for repeating the quad lutz (skaters can only perform solo jumps once but can repeat them if they combine them with other jumps). He attempted to make up points with another jump combination beginning with a quad, but fell again on the first jump after doubling it, for which the judges gave him under one point—likely a first for Malinin. In all, he fell on two jumps, which resulted in an automatic two-point deduction, and had lost too many points to get on the podium.
Instead, the surprise Olympic men’s champion is Mikhail Shaidorov from Kazakhstan, who landed five quad jumps to earn the gold—his country’s first in the event. “I just did my work,” he said after the event, adding that Malinin’s performance was “very surprising. He’s very important to figure skating; he’s the best skater in history.” After coming off the ice, Malinin, who ended up in 8th place, congratulated Shaidorov and told him, “You deserve it.” Japan’s Kagiyama earned silver, and his teammate, Shun Sato, whom Malinin had beaten in the free program of the team event, skated another powerful program for bronze. Malinin’s U.S. teammates, Andrew Torgashev and Maxim Naumov, whose parents were killed in a plane crash last January, both struggled with some of their jumps and finished 12th and 20th, respectively.
Stunned and at a loss to explain what had happened, Malinin said he “blew it” and acknowledged the impact of the pressure of competing at his first Olympics. “Especially going into that starting pose, I just felt like all the traumatic moments of my life really just started flooding my head, and there were just so many negative thoughts that flooded in there, and I just did not handle it,” he said. Normally, he tells himself during competitions that he has prepared for the event and that he should trust his body and his training. But it was hard to play those mind tricks in Milan, he said. “This whole day was going really solid, and I just thought that all I needed to do was go out there and trust the process that I’ve always been doing with every competition. But of course, it’s not like any other competition; it’s the Olympics, and I think people only realize the pressure and the nerves that actually happen from [experience]. So it was really just something that overwhelmed me and I just felt like I had no control.”
In addition to all the attention focused on him as a gold-medal favorite, Malinin skated the equivalent of two full competitions, with short and free programs, over six days. Team USA selected him to skate both portions of the men’s program in that event, and his clutch performance in the free pulled the U.S. ahead of Japan by one point, earning Malinin, and his teammates, gold.
He was expected to add a second gold to that tally, but will leave Milan without any hardware from the men’s event.
“It’s really difficult, there is this pressure from people who assumed that [Malinin] would probably get gold,” said Kagiyama, who repeated as Olympic silver medalist. “His performance, if I may comment, was a little bit unusual. But it really proves that this is really the Olympics; things like that happen.”
The experience is reminiscent of the 2018 Olympics in PyeongChang, when another heavy favorite for gold, Nathan Chen, faltered in the short program of the men’s event and finished 17th. He said he felt enormous pressure from being the favorite and that the tension continued to build until his competition. Chen was able to recover in the free program, completing five quad jumps, which was enough to bring him to fifth place overall.
In Malinin’s case, the nerves hit at the worst possible time. “I still haven’t been able to process what just happened,” he said. As he began skating, the only audible sound was the quiet push of his blades against the ice as he built momentum for his first jump. “That first quad and some of the [other] quads they felt really ideal,” he said. “So I definitely knew that I was prepared well enough. But it’s a lot to handle, a lot to process, so I honestly don’t know what actually happened in the moment. All I know is that it wasn’t my best skate and that it was definitely something I wasn’t expecting, and it’s done so I can’t go back and change it, even though I would love to do [that].”
Among the capacity crowd at the Milano Ice Skating Arena to watch what they assumed would be the crowning of another U.S. Olympic champion were Nathan Chen and summer Olympians Simone Biles and Frederick Richard. “Come on, Ilia, you’re still in it,” Richard said after Malinin popped his first jump. Richard and Malinin have bonded over their passion for backflips—Malinin managed to complete one toward the end of his program, although he received no points for it since it’s not a recognized element by the judges, and Richard has adopted the moniker “Frederick Flips” and owns the Guinness World Record for the most standing backflips over 24 hours. Together, they co-created National Backflip Day, on December 21 (12-21, which can be flipped numerically to reflect the same date), to celebrate sports and encourage safe, creative ways to flip.
Malinin met Richard at a gym over the summer and they shared tips. “We’re almost the same age, and he’s dominating his sport, and I’m working on dominating my sport, so we just relate to each other a lot—we’re both flipping and doing a lot of air sense in our sports,” Richard says. Malinin’s gymnastics background may also be helping his skating. “I don’t know skating enough, but the thing about gymnastics is that it gets you the balance, the air awareness, and the flexibility that you can transfer to any sport,” Richard says. “He’s honestly what we call a phenom. He twists faster than anybody else can twist; that’s why he’s the ‘Quad God.’”
Chen, who is also in Milan for the Games, had the opportunity to skate with Malinin when Malinin was younger and came with his father and coach, Olympian Roman Skorniakov, to Chen’s rink to work with Chen’s coach, Rafael Arutyunyan. (Arutyunyan is also in Milan supporting Malinin). “Obviously, his physique matches skating very well; he’s naturally very talented and he’s very twitchy and also his rotation is fantastic,” Chen says, referring to the twitch muscles needed to pull in quickly and complete four revolutions in the air. “So even if his takeoffs aren’t perfect, he’s still able to sneak out the landing, with the way that he’s able to snap his jumps.”
Chen also sees another useful characteristic in Malinin, which only another skater like him, who landed five quadruple jumps in winning his Olympic gold, can appreciate. “He’s also very fearless, and I think that’s a big component of being able to do quads,” he says. There’s no standard technique for mastering quad jumps, since every athlete’s body is different. “It’s really optimizing his leverage and torque to get the rotation based off of his own personal body as well,” says Chen. “Technique is not a one-size-fits-all kind of thing, so you have to optimize based off of what you’re able to do and how you’re able to get into the air.”
Malinin’s technique is generally the key to his consistency, says Paul Wylie, who won silver at the 1992 Olympics. “Coming from someone who only did a triple axel, it’s the air position and it’s the snap,” Wylie says. “That combination, with the timing, makes it so that you’re standing over your rotational axis, because if you fall out of that axis even a little bit, you’re going to lose the jump and it’s going to slow down and you don’t get around.”
While the full spectrum of what Malinin is capable of on the ice wasn’t on display in Milan, he’s already thinking ahead and ready to put this experience behind him. “From here it’s just regrouping and figure out what to do next and going from there,” he said. At 21 years old, it likely won’t be the last we see of Malinin at the Olympics, and one competition won’t diminish the impact he is having in evolving the sport of men’s figure skating. “He will be the greatest of all time,” says Richard.

Europe calls for US reset at security talks
Sweden

23:07:36 KST

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz urged "a new transatlantic partnership" and French President Emmanuel Macron called for "a strong Europe" as more than 60 leaders gathered for the annual Munich Security Conference.
British Prime Minister Keir Starmer will meanwhile tell the conference Saturday that Europe is "a sleeping giant" and must rely less on the United States for its defence, his office said in a preview of his remarks.
This year's conference comes at a time of strained ties between Europe and the United States, after Trump threatened to take over Greenland and criticised "decaying" and "weak" European nations.
Russia's war against Ukraine, set to enter its fifth year this month, is high on the agenda, alongside efforts by European NATO members to raise their defence budgets, in line with Trump's demands, out of concern that Moscow could seek to expand into their territory.
European leaders at the gathering defended their security commitments and the NATO alliance, which Trump's rhetoric has rattled.
"Being a part of NATO is not only Europe's competitive advantage. It's also the United States' competitive advantage. So let's repair and revive transatlantic trust together," Merz said.
"In the era of great-power rivalry, even the United States will not be powerful enough to go it alone."
'Greater European autonomy'
The gathering comes a year after US Vice President JD Vance used the conference's stage to attack European policies on immigration and free speech, shocking allies on the continent.
Macron emphatically defended Europe in his speech, saying "everyone should take their cue from us, instead of criticising us".
Starmer's office said his speech would call for "a vision of European security and greater European autonomy that does not herald US withdrawal but answers the call for more burden sharing in full and remakes the ties that have served us so well".
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who arrived on Friday, is also due to speak at the gathering on Saturday, as is Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, organisers said.
A German government source said Merz and Rubio had met at the conference and discussed "Ukraine, the status of negotiations with Russia and further support for the country, particularly in terms of military aid".
They also discussed Iran and NATO, and "Rubio praised Germany's steps to strengthen the alliance," the source added.
Rubio also met his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi on the sidelines of the conference, at a time of heightened Washington-Beijing tensions.
They agreed to strengthen cooperation, and Wang told Rubio that "dialogue is better than confrontation, cooperation is better than conflict, and win-win outcomes are better than zero-sum games", according to Chinese state news agency Xinhua.
Rubio held a 15-minute meeting with the prime ministers of Denmark and Greenland about the future sovereignty of the Arctic island. Denmark's Mette Frederiksen called the talks "constructive".
Ties plunged last month when Trump stepped up threats to annex Greenland, an autonomous territory of NATO ally Denmark, forcing European nations to stand firm in protest.
Ukraine discussions
Merz, Macron and the leaders of the European Union, Canada and NATO met with Zelensky on Friday for talks on Ukraine.
A US official said Rubio did not attend those talks due to a packed schedule, but was "engaging on Russia-Ukraine in many of his meetings" in Munich.
Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiga said he discussed ending the Russian invasion with Wang, whose country is a close partner of Moscow.
Wang told Sybiga that Beijing was "willing to provide Ukraine with new humanitarian aid", according to a Chinese foreign ministry readout.
Macron, meanwhile, said a new framework was needed to deal with "an aggressive Russia" once the fighting in Ukraine ends.
"If it makes sense to talk, we are willing to talk," said Merz. "But as you can see with the American side, Russia is not yet willing to talk seriously."
Zelensky, urged by Trump to "get moving" on a deal to end the war, visited a drone factory near Munich with German Defence Minister Boris Pistorius before meeting with European leaders.
"It's good to have strong partnership with Americans... but I think that Europe... needs (an) independent defence industry, very strong," he said.
NATO's Secretary General Mark Rutte said on the sidelines of the conference that Europe was "stepping up... taking more of a leadership role within NATO" and "taking more care of its own defence".
"A strong Europe in a strong NATO means that the transatlantic bond will be stronger than ever," Rutte said.

ANKARA
Relations between Türkiye and Panama are in a “very good moment,” Panama’s vice minister of foreign affairs for multilateral affairs and cooperation, Carlos Guevara Mann, said Friday, describing the ties as sincere and grounded in mutual respect.
“The state of relations between our two countries is very good. We are in a very good moment in our relationship,” Mann told Anadolu during an official visit to the capital Ankara. “We have a very cordial, very respectfully-based relationship, and this is a source of great satisfaction for us, as I am sure it is for our Turkish counterparts.”
Mann said the two countries cooperate across a wide range of areas and maintain comprehensive collaboration. He said opportunities are being explored in education, science and technology, and culture, adding that Türkiye and Panama “have a very solid commercial relationship.”
He described bilateral trade as significant and said it has increased in recent years.
Mann also pointed to Turkish Airlines’ 10 weekly flights to Panama as a major advantage.
“Istanbul is really the port of entry for Panamanians and Latin Americans to the east, the same way that Panama is the port of entry for Turkish people and people from Eastern Europe and Central Asia to Latin America,” he said.
He said the two countries maintain extensive cooperation within international organizations and see broad potential to expand collaboration on multilateral platforms. Mann added that Panama is highly satisfied with the current state of relations and appreciates the warm reception it receives during official visits to Türkiye.
Visit highlights cultural exchanges and strategic talks
Mann said the main purpose of his visit was to promote cultural and academic exchanges between the two countries.
He underscored the importance of commemorating the 200th anniversary of the historic Amphictyonic Congress convened by Simon Bolivar in Panama in 1826, which sought to unite Latin American nations.
During the visit, Mann followed up on cooperation initiatives in science and technology, culture and archaeology. He also held consultations with Turkish officials on current strategic issues, saying such exchanges are always beneficial.
On his first visit to Ankara, Mann described the capital as “a charming city” and said he felt at home. He thanked the Turkish government, the people of Ankara and his country’s diplomatic mission in Ankara for their hospitality.

Russia Poisoned Putin Critic Navalny in Prison With Rare Toxin – European States
Unknown

23:03:45 KST

Five European countries accused Russia of poisoning opposition politician Alexei Navalny on Saturday on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference.
"The U.K., Sweden, France, Germany and the Netherlands are confident that Alexei Navalny was poisoned with a lethal toxin," the countries said in a joint statement following "analyses of samples" from his body.
The staunch critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin died in an Arctic prison in February 2024, while serving a 19-year prison sentence.
According to the European states, a toxin found in the skin of South American dart frogs, known as epibatidine, was found in laboratory analyses of samples from his body.
"Russia claimed that Navalny died of natural causes. But given the toxicity of epibatidine and reported symptoms, poisoning was highly likely the cause of his death," said the statement.
"Navalny died while held in prison, meaning Russia had the means, motive and opportunity to administer this poison to him," the countries said.
Britain's Foreign Office said separately that "only the Russian state had the means, motive and opportunity to deploy this lethal toxin." It added: "We hold [Russia] responsible for his death."
Navalny's widow Yulia Navalnya said it was now "science-proven" that the Kremlin opponent had been murdered.
"Two years ago, I came on stage here and said that it was Vladimir Putin who killed my husband," Navalnaya said on the sidelines of the conference.
"I was, of course, certain that it was a murder...Back then, it was just words, but today these words have become science-proven facts," Navalnaya added.
Navalnaya said last September that laboratory analysis of smuggled biological samples found that her husband was killed by poisoning.
"Today, beside his widow, the U.K. is shining a light on the Kremlin's barbaric plot to silence [Navalny's] voice," U.K. Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper, who met Navalnaya while attending the Munich conference, said in a statement.
French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot paid "tribute" to Navalny after the findings.
"We now know that Vladimir Putin is prepared to use biological weapons against his own people to remain in power," Barrot said in a post on X.
The Kremlin denies the charges.
Moscow has never fully explained Navalny's death, saying only that he fell ill and collapsed during a walk in his prison colony. Navalny and his foundation were labeled "extremist" by the Russian authorities.
The European countries said they had reported Russia to the world's chemical weapons watchdog, the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, over the finding.
"We are further concerned that Russia did not destroy all of its chemical weapons," the countries said, accusing Moscow of breaching the Chemical Weapons Convention.
Navalny was previously poisoned with the Soviet-era nerve agent Novichok in 2020 while campaigning in Siberia and was flown to Germany on an emergency evacuation flight, where he spent months recovering.
Jailed upon his return to Russia in January 2021, he was convicted on a series of charges, including "extremism," but continued to campaign against Putin and Russia's invasion of Ukraine from behind bars.
The charismatic anti-corruption campaigner had rallied hundreds of thousands across Russia in anti-Kremlin protests as he exposed the alleged ill-gotten gains of Putin's inner circle.
A Message from The Moscow Times:
Dear readers,
We are facing unprecedented challenges. Russia's Prosecutor General's Office has designated The Moscow Times as an "undesirable" organization, criminalizing our work and putting our staff at risk of prosecution. This follows our earlier unjust labeling as a "foreign agent."
These actions are direct attempts to silence independent journalism in Russia. The authorities claim our work "discredits the decisions of the Russian leadership." We see things differently: we strive to provide accurate, unbiased reporting on Russia.
We, the journalists of The Moscow Times, refuse to be silenced. But to continue our work, we need your help.
Your support, no matter how small, makes a world of difference. If you can, please support us monthly starting from just $2. It's quick to set up, and every contribution makes a significant impact.

Soaring coffee prices rewrite some Americans' daily routines

Rising coffee prices are forcing Americans to rethink their morning ritual
Coffee prices in the U.S. were up 18.3 percent in January from a year ago

Soaring coffee prices are forcing even dedicated drinkers to abandon their cherished morning ritual. Chandra Donelson, 35, from Washington, D.C., has made the unthinkable decision to give up her lifelong caffeine fix.
Her daily routine once involved a McDonald’s coffee (10 sugars, five creams), later transitioning to Starbucks caramel macchiatos with almond milk and two pumps of syrup.
"I did that daily for years. I loved it. That was just my routine," she says. "And now it’s not."
This personal sacrifice reflects a wider trend, as years of climbing coffee costs compel consumers across the nation to forgo café visits, opt for cheaper alternatives,or quit altogether.
Coffee prices in the U.S. were up 18.3 percent in January from a year ago, according to the latest Consumer Price Index released on Friday. Over five years, the government reported, coffee prices rose 47 percent.
That extraordinary rise has brought some to take extraordinary measures.
“Before, I thought, ‘There’s no way I could make it through my day without coffee,’” says Liz Sweeney, 50, of Boise, Idaho, a former “coffee addict” who has cut her consumption. “Now my car’s not on automatic pilot.”
Sweeney used to have three cups of coffee at home each day and stop at a café whenever she left the house. As prices climbed last year, though, she nixed coffee shop visits and cut her intake to a cup a day at home. To make up for the caffeine, she pops open a can of Diet Coke at home or rolls through McDonald’s for one.
Dan DeBaun, 34, of Minnetonka, Minnesota, has likewise trimmed back on coffee shop visits, conscious of the increasing expense as he and his wife save up for a house.
“What used to be a $2 coffee, it’s now $5, $6,” says DeBaun, who now buys ground coffee at Trader Joe’s and fills up a travel mug to bring to the office.
Data from Toast, a payment platform used by more than 150,000 restaurants, found the median price of a regular hot coffee in the U.S. had climbed to $3.61 in December, with wide variation by location. The median price of cold brews was $5.55.
Virtually all coffee consumed in the U.S. is imported. Though tariffs affected some imports of coffee in 2025, they ultimately were removed. Climate issues — drought in Vietnam, heavy rain in Indonesia, and hot, dry weather in Brazil — are blamed for reducing yields of coffee crops and driving up global prices.
Two-thirds of Americans drink coffee daily, according to the National Coffee Association. For many, it is such an indispensable part of their routine, the soaring price has led to nothing more than grumbling.
The coffee association says its surveys show coffee consumption is broadly holding steady despite price hikes. But, squeezed by the cost of everything from rent to beef, others are shaking up their habit.
Sharon Cooksey, 55, of Greensboro, North Carolina, was visiting her local Starbucks most weekday mornings for a caramel latte until scaling back last year. First, she switched to brewing Starbucks at home. Then, she discovered Lavazza coffee was about 40 percent cheaper and switched to it.
“I can buy a bag of coffee for $6?” she said to herself. “It was like I had just discovered another world. The multiverse opened up to me in the coffee aisle of Publix.”
She has noticed her home-brewed costs tick upward, too, but it’s nothing compared to her café habit. A bag of beans that lasts weeks costs her about the same as one latte.
Cooksey misses the social aspect of visiting the café, where baristas greeted her by name. But she’s been surprised to find she actually prefers the way her homemade coffees taste.
“I’ll be damned if it didn’t taste so good,” she says.
Growing up, Donelson watched enviously as her mother made a daily coffee jaunt (also to McDonald’s, also 10 sugars and five creams), and she duplicated the habit. She went from college to the Air Force to a government job as a data and artificial intelligence strategist, but through it all, coffee was there.
She noticed the growing expense of her routine, but kept it up until a government shutdown halted her paychecks last fall and she needed to trim her spending. Looking for a morning substitute, she landed on a Republic of Tea blend with a healthy squeeze of honey.
“Twenty cents a cup compared to $7 or $8 a cup,” she says. “The math just makes sense.”

White Castle transforms restaurants for Valentine's Day themed dinners that create memories
White Castle has invited lovers, loved ones and the soon-to-be in love to an intimate meal at its restaurants every Valentine's Day for the past 35 years
- Bookmark
Valentine's Day dinner at White Castle with candles, attentive wait staff and white tablecloths was a treasured experience for Krystal Gray and her mother, Cornelia Murphy.
This year, Gray will bring along a photo of her mother, who died last spring at age 80, and place it on the table she has still reserved at one of the fast-food chain restaurants in the Detroit suburb of Ferndale.
“It wouldn't be the same without her,” Gray said. “I wanted something to make me feel better about her not physically being able to come.”
For 35 years, White Castle has invited lovers, loved ones and the soon-to-be in love to have an intimate meal at its restaurants. This year the 325 White Castles with a dining room in the U.S. are taking part in the promotion, according to Jamie Richardson, chief marketing officer of the Columbus, Ohio-based restaurant chain.
“That one day White Castle becomes love castle,” Richardson said. “It’s something our customers look forward to. Many are repeat visitors on Valentine’s Day.”
“Quirky” promotion finds fans
The promotion started in 1991 and was only offered at White Castles in St. Louis and Minneapolis. Richardson said the goal was to offer “something kind of fun and quirky and see if anyone wants to come out have a fancy Valentine’s Day dinner at White Castle.”
Each participating eatery is given a budget for decorations which can include red balloons, garland and flowers. Reservations are required and opened in early January. About 32,000 people celebrated Valentine’s Day dinner at a White Castle in 2025. Richardson says they are on target for more than 35,000 this year.
“Some people show up in limousines,” he said. “We’ll have people dress like it’s their wedding. We had over 200 White Castle weddings over the years.”
Sliders and memorable moments
There's just something about the thin slice of steam-grilled beef, slathered in mustard and ketchup with diced onions, cheese and a pickle slice on a dinner roll that many can't resist. Crinkle-cut French fries and a soft drink typically fill out orders. The onion chips and chicken rings also are popular.
“It’s all the ambiance, all the love and all the great memories for a fraction of the price,” Richardson said. “For a couple, if they are really splurging, it’s right around $20, or $25 if you’re getting dessert on a stick.”
Ann Tubbs, district supervisor of nine “Castles” in the Detroit and mid-Michigan areas, said customers tell her that the affordable cost helps but people keep coming because of the tradition and memories.
“I've had a couple who announced their pregnancy,” Tubbs said. “We've had people come in with their children just to make those moments, and others who have gotten engaged.”
Amy Richardson, 41, of Lincoln Park near Detroit, makes sure that she, her three children and her significant other also dress the part, wearing something pink or red and at times matching each other.
She said she has spent Valentine's Day at a White Castle every year since 2012.
“I had just gotten into a new relationship and I had a 3-year-old daughter,” she said of the first time. “We wanted to make it somewhere kid-friendly. All three of us packed up and went out on our date.”
The couple has since added two younger children and spend about $30 on their Valentine's Day meals for a family of five.
“We usually get the sliders and the chicken rings and the mozzarella cheese sticks,” Amy Richardson added. “It's more of a nostalgia thing. It may be fancied up, but it's not a fancy restaurant where people frown on you bringing a young child or children.”
Waffle House, another national restaurant chain, also will mark its 18th year of offering a special themed dinner on Valentine's Day. This was the first year online reservations were taken and many of the 218 Waffle House locations taking part were booked by the end of last week, according to spokesperson Kelly Bruner.
Carrying on a family tradition
Gray has made Valentine's Day at White Castle sort of a tradition, having done it about 10 times. Gray will be among 14 fans inducted in May into the White Castle “Craver’s Hall of Fame.” They were selected after submitting their White Castle stories.
This year, she also will share the day with her two young daughters as a tribute to her mother's memory.
“I just like the simplicity of it all — sit there and spend time with each other,” she said. “Sometimes, we can do too much and it goes overboard to the point where you can't really enjoy it — spending so much money.”

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky poked fun at Hungarian leader Victor Orban’s “belly” in his address to the Munich Security Conference on Saturday, saying Ukraine’s fight against Russia allowed Europe to live freely.
Zelensky, a 48-year-old former comedian, was describing how Europe gains from having Ukrainian forces battling Russian troops in Ukraine.

Ukraine’s relations with neighbouring Hungary have been strained by Orban’s support for Russia and have deteriorated further in recent weeks as the veteran leader has ramped up attacks on Ukraine ahead of a closely fought parliamentary election in April.
“There can be a sovereign Moldova and a Romania without dictatorship and even one Victor can think about how to grow his belly, not how to grow his army to stop Russian tanks from returning to the streets of Budapest,” Zelensky said.
“But look at the price. Look at the price, look at the pain Ukraine has gone through, look at the suffering Ukraine has faced. It’s Ukrainians who are holding the European front,” he said.
Although Ukraine applied to join the European Union days after Russia invaded, it has been unable to advance accession talks because of Orban’s vetoes.
Unlike other European countries, Hungary has not diversified its imports from Russia since Moscow’s assault on Ukraine.

Trump-style diplomacy could win friends for China but harm US ties with Beijing
Observers say even Washington’s close allies need to hedge against a more assertive foreign policy, with some already courting Beijing

Last week, US ambassador to Poland Tom Rose cut off contact with his host country’s parliamentary speaker over what he described as “outrageous and unprovoked insults” against President Donald Trump.
Washington would “not permit anyone to harm US-Polish relations nor disrespect” the president, Rose warned, without specifying the insults.
However, lower house speaker Wlodzimierz Czarzasty, a left-wing Polish politician, had earlier criticised Trump’s policies and said he would not support an initiative to nominate the US leader for the Nobel Peace Prize.

While Rose later told Polish media that Washington was Warsaw’s “biggest ally and greatest friend”, his sharp response has reinforced global perceptions that the US is moving away from traditional diplomatic norms, according to observers.
This more assertive brand of American foreign policy could push Washington’s allies to look to other partners, including Beijing, and risked damaging the US-China relationship, they warned.
Sun Chenghao, a fellow at Tsinghua University’s Centre for International Security and Strategy, said the incident showed the second Trump administration’s diplomatic approach was skewed towards a “more high-handed and assertive style”.

Five European countries say Russia 'poisoned' Putin critic Alexei Navalny in prison
France

Five European countries, including Britain, France and Germany, accused Russia of "poisoning" opposition leader Alexei Navalny in prison in 2024 using a "rare toxin," on Saturday, February 14, on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference. "The UK, Sweden, France, Germany and The Netherlands are confident that Alexei Navalny was poisoned with a lethal toxin," the countries said in a joint statement, following "analyses of samples" from his body.
The staunch critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin died in an Arctic prison in February 2024, while serving a 19-year prison sentence. The epibatidine toxin found in the skin of dart frogs native to South America was found in samples and "highly likely resulted in his death," the European states said.
"Only the Russian state had the means, motive and opportunity to deploy this lethal toxin to target Navalny during his imprisonment in a Russian penal colony in Siberia, and we hold it responsible for his death," the UK foreign office added in a statement.
"We now know that Vladimir Putin is prepared to use biological weapons against his own people to remain in power," French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot wrote on X, adding that Navalny had died in prison in 2024 "as a result of poisoning with one of the deadliest nerve agents."
British Prime Minister Keir Starmer hailed Navalny's "huge courage in the face of tyranny." "His determination to expose the truth has left an enduring legacy, and my thoughts are with his family today," Starmer said on social media from the Munich Security Conference. "I am doing whatever it takes to defend our people, our values and our way of life from the threat of Russia and Putin's murderous intent."
Chemical weapons
Navalny's widow, Yulia Navalnya, said it was now "science-proven" that the Kremlin opponent had been murdered. "Two years ago I came on stage here and said that it was Vladimir Putin who killed my husband," Navalnaya said on the sidelines of the conference. "I was of course certain that it was a murder... but back then it was just words. But today these words have become science-proven facts," Navalnaya added.
Navalnaya last September said that laboratory analysis of smuggled biological samples found he was killed by poisoning. "Today, beside his widow, the UK is shining a light on the Kremlin's barbaric plot to silence his voice," UK Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper, who met Navalnaya while attending the Munich conference, said in a statement.
The countries said they had reported Russia to the world's chemical weapons watchdog – the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons – over the finding. "We are further concerned that Russia did not destroy all of its chemical weapons," the countries said, accusing Moscow of breaching the Chemical Weapons Convention.
Navalny was previously poisoned with the Soviet-era nerve agent Novichok in 2020 while campaigning in Siberia and was flown to Germany on an emergency evacuation flight, where he spent months recovering. The charismatic anti-corruption campaigner had rallied hundreds of thousands across Russia in anti-Kremlin protests as he exposed the alleged ill-gotten gains of Putin's inner circle.

Russia Poisoned Navalny With Exotic Frog Toxin, European Countries Say

The governments of five European countries on February 14 released a statement saying they are confident that the Russian opposition politician Aleksei Navalny was poisoned with a lethal toxin not found naturally in Russia -- a poisoning that led to his death in a Russian prison two years ago.
The UK, Sweden, France, Germany, and the Netherlands made their conclusion based on analyses of samples from Navalny that confirm the presence of epibatidine -- a toxin derived from poison dart frogs in South America -- that is known to cause paralysis and respiratory arrest.
Speaking to RFE/RL on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference, Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof said that "there is a high possibility that Russia killed Navalny by poison."
"I think it’s a serious offense," he added, "and I hope that it will [show] the world that Russia is playing a dirty game."
In the joint statement, the five capitals note that “Russia claimed that Navalny died of natural causes. But given the toxicity of epibatidine and reported symptoms, poisoning was highly likely the cause of his death. Navalny died while held in prison, meaning Russia had the means, motive, and opportunity to administer this poison to him.”
It also adds that “these latest findings once again underline the need to hold Russia accountable for its repeated violations of the Chemical Weapons Convention and, in this instance, the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention.”
Aleksandr Polupan, an anesthesiologist-resuscitator, told Current Time that it was clear before the verdict of the five European countries that "Navalny had been murdered and that he did not die a natural death."
"All that we know about [Navalny’s] abdominal pain, vomiting, and seizures, I don’t see any contradictions in [how the poison works]," Polupan said. "Given that independent laboratories confirmed [the presence] of the same molecule, I’d say there’s no need to guess much further."
For other experts, however, doubts remain. Ismail Efendiev, a member of the European Association of Poison Control Centers and Clinical Toxicologists, told Current Time that the use of an exotic toxin could not be ruled out "because the symptoms are similar with the effects of Novichok, but we need to identify these cases in a laboratory."
Navalny's Widow Responds
In response to the statement, Navalny’s widow, Yulia Navalnaya, tweeted that “I was certain from the first day that my husband had been poisoned, but now there is proof: [Russian President Vladimir] Putin killed Aleksei with a chemical weapon. I am grateful to the European states for the meticulous work they carried out [for] over two years and for uncovering the truth. Vladimir Putin is a murderer. He must be held accountable for all his crimes."
RFE/RL reached out to Navalnaya’s press team for further comment but the request was declined.
Navalnaya has always rejected the official Russian autopsy report that stated that hypertension and other diseases caused a heartbeat disorder that led to Navalny's demise and was instrumental in getting biological samples smuggled out from Russia to other European countries.
Roman Dobrokhotov, founder and editor in chief of The Insider, an independent Russian media outlet specializing in investigative journalism, said that he believes the Kremlin was "confident that no bio samples will ever be smuggled abroad to be examined. And should samples get abroad, [the Kremlin's] hope was that there will not be a laboratory competent enough to identify this poison."
"We were lucky indeed to find laboratories and experienced scientists so the substance can be found," Dobrokhotov, said.
Navalny was a longtime anti-corruption fighter and Russia's most prominent opposition politician for over a decade. At the time of his death in a prison north of the Arctic Circle, Navalny was serving a 19-year sentence on an extremism conviction that he and his supporters say was politically motivated and revenge for his anti-Kremlin activism.
He had been behind bars since January 2021, when he was arrested upon returning to Russia after recovering in Germany from a poisoning with a form of the nerve-agent Novichok that he said was a state-sponsored assassination attempt carried out by Russian security agents and approved by Putin.
RFE/RL's Russian Service unearthed a Russian scientific paper from 2013 that describes a method for creating synthesized epibatidine. Three of the paper's five authors worked at the State Scientific Research Institute of Organic Chemistry and Technology, which was involved in developing Novichok in the 1970s.
The United States and European Union imposed sanctions on the institute in the wake of Navalny's poisoning in 2020. Ukraine and Canada followed suit in 2023, citing the institute supplies of technology to the Russian military.
Asked to comment on the finding about Navalny's death, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he "cannot think about Vladimir Putin and his toxic ambitions.... I have no time for this."
"[Russia attacks] us with 100 drones and missiles. What is the difference between poison and missiles? I don’t see the difference," Zelenskyy said on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference.

Couples are flocking to White Castle and Waffle House for Valentine’s Day: ‘A beacon of love’
Every February 14, these two beloved — but also widely mocked — budget fast food chains lay out the tablecloths and take reservations. Io Dodds meets the married parents, wild young lovers and small-town retirees who take the leap

- CommentsGo to comments
Nine in 10 Americans believe we’re in a cost of living crisis. Then there’s the specter of mass layoffs or an AI financial crash.
So this Valentine's Day, why not take your squeeze out to a fast food restaurant?
You may be surprised to find you’re in good company. For years, White Castle and Waffle House have served sit-down Valentine's Day meals at many locations — and are even taking reservations.
Tablecloths are laid, festive decorations such as balloons and paper hearts are hung, and staff bring meals to your table. Guests often dress up fancy, and sometimes there’s a special menu.
Many dining chains do Valentine’s Day specials, like McDonalds’s new offer of caviar with your McNuggets. But White Castle and Waffle House — long known, and often the butt of jokes, as ultra-budget options — appear unique in offering the full sit-down experience.
"I have zero complaints," says Dan C., a 41-year-old grocery store manager in Minnesota's Twin Cities, who took his girlfriend to White Castle on Feb. 14 in 2024 (he declined to give his last name due to privacy concerns).
He’d proposed the idea every year for a decade, and finally ... she said yes. "We had a fun time and even thought about going back this year,” he told The Independent.
Waffle House, a 24-hour chain focused on hearty breakfasts and comfort food, has more than 2,000 restaurants spread mostly through the Midwest and the South. Its Valentine’s Day tradition started in 2008 after a restaurant manager in Johns Creek, Georgia noticed customers often dined there that day.
This year 218 locations will participate; you can see them all and book a table here.
For White Castle, the century-old joint — known for its tiny, square-patty “slider” burgers —that was made internationally famous by 2004 stoner movie Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle, it goes back even further.
In 1991, according to a retrospective by Eater, two female operations leaders in Minneapolis and St. Louis hatched a plan to “share the love” by making V-Day “a little special.” The resulting media attention convinced HQ to embrace their idea.
Now 325 out of 334 White Castles are participating, with 35,000 customers expected to attend (vs 32,000 in 2025). To book, search for your local branch on OpenTable.
On social media, you’ll find rave reviews going back years. "I went [to Waffle House] last year. That night my wife got pregnant. Go at your own risk," wrote one Reddit user in 2015.
'I don't have to dress up so much'
When exactly did Dave Chegash first go to White Castle for Valentine's Day?
"I don't know, let me ask my wife," he told The Independent via phone from his home in Richmond, Michigan, just north of Detroit. Then he raised his voice. "Vick! Do you remember the first time we went?”
Dave and Vicky Ann Chegash sometimes remember things differently. Both agree that in 1969, when they were teenagers at school, Vicky stole Dave's clarinet and ran away. But Dave thinks they were strangers, whereas Vicky recalls they’d already met at band camp.
So it is with Valentine's Day at White Castle. Did they hear about it by phone from a friend who saw a newspaper ad, or did that same friend forward them an email, "kind of as a joke"?
Either way, that was "at least 10” years ago, and the retirees have spent Feb, 14 at White Castle every year since (except during Covid in 2020). This one will be the couple’s 50th wedding anniversary.
Dave, 73, worked as an engineer in every industry from cars to ladies' underwear, while Vicky was an occupational therapist and lymphedema therapist. "And you're 21, right?" says Dave. "I wish!" exclaims Vicky. (She's 71.)
The couple have always liked White Castle: "It's an addiction!" Vicky said. "An acquired taste.”
Both of them appreciate the laid-back vibe. "It's relaxed, and I don't have to dress up so much,” Vicky noted.
Dave chimed in. "We don't normally dress up to go out to any restaurants anymore... now that we're older and retired, we just like to take it easy."
Still, they enjoy how the workers "really make a big deal out of it". They usually ask staff to take their picture, but these days they're such regulars that the owners want a photo with them.
'Like a scene from Twin Peaks'
Erin Crowley and Augustine Isbell knew nothing about the Valentine's Day tradition when they entered a Waffle House in Charleston, South Carolina after midnight on Feb. 15, 2025.
It had already been a weird night. Crowley, a 25-year-old transgender woman, said she felt increasingly unsafe in the Republican-led state and was moving cross-country to join Isbell in Portland, Oregon. Isbell, who is also trans, flew in to help her pack. By chance, Valentine's was their last day in town.
They’d met online in September 2024, when Crowley sent Isbell a photo of one of her knives (she dollects “pretty ones”), and immediately fell head over heels in love. Their first phone call lasted 20 hours.
Soon they were falling asleep and waking up together, keeping the line open all night. Isbell, a 29-year-old handyperson who uses it/its pronouns, would have Erin on its headphones while it pulled weeds or assembled furniture.
On Valentine's Day they finished packing with time to kill, and decided to wander in search of adventure. Hopping a cemetery fence after dark, they found an open grave, climbed in, and performed "nefarious activities" (which they decline to specify). "You only get so many opportunities in life to be so degenerate," says Erin, coyly.
Then, naturally, they went to Waffle House.
"It was like a beacon of love," recalled Isbell, who comes from Texas and had been "grieving" the chain’s absence out west. "I was like: 'Oh my God, this is better than I could have planned.' Like, I'm meant to do this."
The fluorescent lights had been wrapped in pink paper, lending everything a gentle glow. There were pink streamers, strings of paper hearts, and a kissing booth. The mood was tender yet unreal, like a scene from Twin Peaks (one of the pair’s favorite shows).
"It was perfect," said Isbell.
Today the couple are happy in Portland — but sadly, their nearest Waffle House is in Colorado. "We've looked," admits Isbell. "We've definitely looked."
'We enjoy silly things more than fancy things'
For White Castle diners Alex Remnique and their wife Caila, it's all about the comedy value.
"We love a bit. The two of us love a bit," says Remnique, a 35-year-old musician and non-profit worker in Brooklyn. "We enjoy doing the silly thing rather than the fancy thing. If a date idea is amusing, that's generally way more appealing than spending money for the sake of prestige or status or whatever."
Remnique had heard about Valentine's Day at White Castle years ago from an ex, and it had stuck in their head ever since. In 2023, they mentioned it to Caila — who loved the notion.
"The idea of getting a little bit fancy to go to a fast food restaurant is very enjoyable for us," says Remnique, who wore a nice fluffy coat and dangly sparkly earrings (which, they confess, may have come from Claire's Accessories).
There turned out to be many other queer couples there, and the staff "seemed very excited" by the occasion.
"It was just very cute and a lot of fun," says Remnique. "I would recommend it to a very specific type of couple. If you're not sure, I wouldn't surprise your date... but if they're like 'hell yeah', then I see no reason why not!"
The couple returned once, but haven’t made it a habit. They've moved on to other activities — like a trip to the New Jersey beach resort of Asbury Park — or, indeed, new “bits.”
"I think we're maybe looking at Olive Garden this year," Remnique muses.
'If they don't like Waffle House, get a new sweetheart'
In Georgia, it was 14 years ago when Cenate Pruitt and his wife first seated their tiny son in a high chair at a Waffle House for a Valentine's Day dinner.
Pruitt, a 46-year-old sociology professor in Decatur, outside Atlanta, points out how ubiquitous Waffle House is in southern states.
"It’s open 24/7/365, and they’re up and down all the interstates here. It’s genuinely part of the culture of the region."
Waffle House had been the couple's "go-to comfort food" for years. Before they met, they'd often dined there on road trips, late at night after concerts, or as children with their families.
Still, when they visited for Valentine’s Day in 2012, the tradition was young enough that staff had been getting calls from confused customers asking if they were really serious. There were some teenagers on group dates, and a few older couples.
“It was exceptionally charming,” says Pruitt. "Everyone was really leaning into the kind of silly idea of Waffle House as a romantic spot, but it’s also a legitimately special place for some people. There’ve been a couple of actual weddings at Waffle Houses over the years...
"It was nice to be able to do Valentines Day on a weeknight, on a budget, and without having to hire a babysitter."
The couple are still going strong, and now their son is old enough to drive. They stopped doing Valentine's Day at Waffle House long ago, though, because it got so popular that they struggled to get a reservation.
Still, Pruitt recommends it unreservedly. "If you are in the kind of relationship where your sweetheart is down to do Valentines at Waffle House, do so!" he says. "If your sweetheart isn’t down — get a new sweetheart."

Russia likely killed opposition leader Navalny with dart frog poison, 5 European states say
Editor's note: This story is being updated.
Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny was poisoned with a dart frog toxin called epibatidine before he died in 2024, five European governments said in a joint statement on Feb. 14.
Navalny died on Feb. 16, 2024 in an Arctic penal colony in the town of Kharp, in Russia's Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous District. The activist, who was Russian President Vladimir Putin's main opponent, was sentenced in several fabricated criminal cases, and some of his allies have also been imprisoned.
Laboratories in the U.K., Sweden, France, Germany, and the Netherlands received Navalny's biological samples after his death and unanimously concluded that he was poisoned with epibatidine, the Insider, an independent Russian media outlet, reported on Feb. 14.
Intensive-care physician Alexander Polupan told the Insider that "the publicly available information about Alexei Navalny’s symptoms matches what is known about the effects of epibatidine."
"The U.K., Sweden, France, Germany, and the Netherlands are confident that Alexei Navalny was poisoned with a lethal toxin," the countries' governments said in a joint statement. "This is the conclusion of our governments based on analyses of samples from Alexei Navalny. These analyses have conclusively confirmed the presence of epibatidine."
According to the statement, "Russia claimed that Navalny died of natural causes."
"But given the toxicity of epibatidine and reported symptoms, poisoning was highly likely the cause of his death," the governments said. "Navalny died while held in prison, meaning Russia had the means, motive and opportunity to administer this poison to him."
The Kremlin has denied the accusations.

U.K. Foreign Minister Yvette Cooper said at the Munich Security Conference on Feb. 14 that "Russia saw Navalny as a threat."
"By using this form of poison, the Russian state demonstrated the despicable tools it has at its disposal and the overwhelming fear it has of political opposition," she added.
Navalny's widow Yulia Navalnaya also commented on the announcement.
"Scientists from five European countries have determined that my husband, Alexei Navalny, was poisoned with epibatidine — a neurotoxin and one of the deadliest poisons on earth," Navalnaya wrote on X. "In nature, this poison can be found on the skin of an Ecuadorian tree frog. It causes paralysis, respiratory arrest, and a painful death."
She said that she was "certain from the very first day that my husband had been poisoned, but now there is proof: Putin killed Alexei with chemical weapons."
"I am grateful to the European states for the painstaking work they carried out over two years, and for bringing the truth to light," Navalnaya said. "Vladimir Putin is a murderer. He must be held accountable for all his crimes."
This was not the first poisoning of Navalny. In 2020, he was poisoned in Russia and flown for treatment to Germany while in a coma.
German doctors, as well as several independent labs in Europe, said in 2020 that he had been poisoned with a Novichok nerve agent – a chemical weapon produced by the Russian government.
A joint investigation by The Insider, Bellingcat, CNN, and Der Spiegel revealed that Navalny had been poisoned by agents of Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB) in 2020. The media outlets also identified the agents' names.
The journalists obtained data on the alleged murderers’ travel and mobile phone data. A special chemical substances unit of Russia’s Federal Security Service had been following Navalny for years, including during his trip to Siberia when the assassination attempt took place.
Navalny impersonated a Russian state official to speak to one of the members of the alleged poisoning team, Konstantin Kudryavtsev, in 2020. In the phone call with Navalny, Kudryavtsev admitted that he had taken part in the poisoning operation and said that the poison had been put in Navalny’s underwear.
Putin has admitted that the FSB squad had been conducting surveillance on Navalny but denied that they were tasked to kill him.
Despite the poisoning, Navalny decided to return to Russia after his treatment in 2021 and was jailed by the authorities.
The same FSB squad that allegedly tried to kill Navalny had also trailed three other people before they were found dead with signs of poisoning, including syringe pricks, from 2014 to 2019, according to an investigation by Bellingcat, The Insider, CNN, and Der Spiegel.
Meanwhile, the FSB poisoning team also followed liberal politician Vladimir Kara-Murza when he was poisoned in 2015 and then again in 2017, although he survived, Bellingcat, the Insider and Der Spiegel reported.
In a separate incident, former Russian intelligence officer Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia survived after being poisoned in the U.K. with the Novichok nerve agent in the city of Salisbury, England, in 2018. Dawn Sturgess, a British citizen, accidentally came into contact with the poison and died as a result.
The British authorities identified Russian military intelligence agents using the passports of Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Bashirov as suspects in the murder case.
"In both cases (Navalny's 2020 poisoning and the Skripal case), only the Russian state had the combined means, motive and disregard for international law to carry out the attacks," the U.K., Sweden, France, Germany, and the Netherlands said on Feb. 14. "These latest findings once again underline the need to hold Russia accountable for its repeated violations of the Chemical Weapons Convention and, in this instance, the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention."
Meanwhile, the Russian government's Organic Chemistry and Technology Institute has been developing both Novichok and epibatidine, the Insider reported.
"(The Feb. 14 announcement on Navalny's poisoning) proves that we have an authoritarian regime in Russia that does not respect the rule of law," Norwegian Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide told the Kyiv Independent.
He added that Russia has experienced "a steady move towards a more authoritarian system bordering on a totalitarian one."
"Navalny was poisoned by Putin," Russian exiled opposition politician Mikhail Khodorkovsky told the Kyiv Independent. "For us it wasn't (even) a question. We know that and our investigations (confirmed) it directly. We didn't know what type of poison was used but for us it doesn't matter."
He added that "if Putin decides to kill somebody, it's 90% that this person will be killed, and if you think about that every day, you can go crazy."
President Volodymyr Zelensky was asked by reporters at the Munich Security Conference on Feb. 14 if he feared that Putin would target him with assassination by poison.
"I'm not thinking about myself," he said. "So, I'm one of all the people in Ukraine who are in Ukraine. ... They attack us with, you see, hundreds and hundreds of drones and missiles. What is the difference between poison and missile? I don't see the difference."

Police seal off road near Arizona home of Today show host Samantha Guthrie’s missing mother

Law enforcement investigating the disappearance of Today show host Savannah Guthrie’s mother, Nancy, sealed off a road near her home in Arizona late Friday night.
A parade of sheriff’s and FBI vehicles, including forensics vehicles, passed through the roadblock that was set up about 2 miles (3.2km) from the house.
The two agencies also tagged and towed a Range Rover SUV from a Culver’s restaurant parking lot. The restaurant is just over 2 miles from Nancy Guthrie’s home. This activity took place at the same time the sheriff’s office closed a road just north of the Guthrie home.
The Pima county sheriff’s department said the activity was part of the Guthrie case, but also said the FBI requested that it not release further information.
On Saturday morning, the department confirmed that a federal court-ordered search warrant was carried out at a residence in connection with the ongoing investigation into Nancy Guthrie’s disappearance. But it added that no arrests were made during the search. The roads were later reopened.
Guthrie, 84, was reported missing on 1 February. Authorities say her blood was found on the front porch of her Tucson-area home. Purported ransom notes were sent to news outlets, but two deadlines for paying have passed.
Authorities have expressed concerns about Guthrie’s health because she needs daily medication. She is said to have a pacemaker and has dealt with high blood pressure and heart issues, according to sheriff’s dispatcher audio on broadcastify.com.
Investigators have studied surveillance video, sorted through thousands of tips, and submitted DNA and other evidence for laboratory analysis.
Pima county sheriff Chris Nanos indicated to the New York Times that he shared public frustration at the pace of the investigation.
“It’s exhausting, these ups and downs. But we will keep moving forward,” he told the newspaper “Maybe it’s an hour from now. Maybe it’s weeks or months or years from now. But we won’t quit. We’re going to find Nancy. We’re going to find this guy.”
Critics of the handling of the investigation point to an initial misstep when Guthrie’s home was cleared as a crime scene a day after she went missing.
The home stood unguarded as reporters and others wandered the property before it was then closed off again for the FBI to conduct its own search. Nanos acknowledged at an earlier news conference that the decision was like playing “Monday morning quarterback” but: “Absolutely. I probably could have held off on that.”
The FBI said it has collected more than 13,000 tips since Guthrie was reported missing. The sheriff’s department, meanwhile, said it has taken at least 18,000 calls.
On Tuesday, authorities released footage showing an armed and masked person at Guthrie’s doorstep on the night she was abducted. The videos – less than a combined minute in length – gave investigators and the public their first glimpse of who was outside Guthrie’s home in the foothills outside Tucson.
Experts say the video could contain a mountain of clues.

African Union summit clouded by Saudi-UAE rivalry in Horn of Africa
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
LONDON/NAIROBI, Feb 14 - A feud between Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates across the Horn of Africa is overshadowing this weekend’s African Union summit, though most of the continent’s leaders will try to avoid taking sides, nine diplomats and experts said.
What began as a rivalry in Yemen has spread across the Red Sea into a region riven with conflicts - from war in Somalia and Sudan to rivalry between Ethiopia and Eritrea and a divided Libya.
In recent years, the UAE has become an influential player in the Horn - encompassing primarily Sudan, Somalia, Ethiopia, Eritrea, and Djibouti - through multi-billion-dollar investments, robust diplomacy and discreet military support.
Saudi Arabia has been more low-profile but diplomats say Riyadh is building an alliance that includes Egypt, Turkey and Qatar.
“Saudi has woken up and realised that they might lose the Red Sea,” a senior African diplomat told Reuters. “They have been sleeping all along while UAE was doing its thing in the Horn.”
Initially focused on the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden - both crucial shipping routes, the rivalry is now reaching further inland.
“Today it is in Somalia, but it is also playing out in Sudan, Sahel and elsewhere,” the diplomat said.
COMPELLED TO CHOOSE A SIDE
While these conflicts have strong local drivers, Gulf involvement is forcing countries, regions and even warlords to choose a side, diplomats said.
Michael Woldemariam, a Horn of Africa expert at the University of Maryland, said regional actors, including Eritrea, Djibouti, Somalia and the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF), have grown uneasy with the UAE’s “muscular” foreign policy.
“Saudis may seek to limit or curtail UAE in the Horn but, it remains to see how that will play out,” he said. “UAE has a lot of leverage across the region – it has this expeditionary military presence and dense financial linkages.”
Saudi officials say UAE activities in Yemen and the Horn threaten their national security.
Senior Emirati officials say their strategy strengthens states against extremists, while U.N. experts and Western officials argue it has sometimes fuelled conflict and empowered authoritarian leaders, charges the UAE denies.
The officials and diplomats interviewed in this story declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter.
AVOIDING A BRAWL BETWEEN GULF POWERS
Israel’s recognition of Somaliland’s independence bid is the starkest example so far of tensions being stoked.
Somalia has cut all ties with Abu Dhabi, accusing it of influencing Israel's recognition of Somaliland. Mogadishu has since signed a defence agreement with Qatar, while Turkey sent fighter jets to the capital in a show of force.
Tensions are also rising between African Union host Ethiopia and neighbouring Eritrea, which have been on the verge of war for months. Eritrea’s leader recently visited Saudi Arabia, a trip that analysts perceived as signalling Saudi backing.
UAE and Saudi Arabia back opposing sides in Sudan’s war, all the sources and experts interviewed said. The UAE is accused of providing logistical support to the RSF paramilitary, while states in line with Saudi Arabia largely back the SAF.
Egypt, a Saudi ally, has deployed Turkish-made drones along its border with SAF and used them to strike RSF in Sudan, security officials said.
Analysts said Ethiopia benefits from UAE support, and Reuters found this week that Ethiopia is hosting a base in western Ethiopia where RSF fighters are recruited and trained.
Ethiopia has not publicly commented on the story.
'ACTING THROUGH ALLIES AND PROXIES'
Across the region, Saudi Arabia often acts through allies and proxies rather than directly, experts said.
Woldemariam said African countries were likely to tread carefully.
“Even those actors in the Horn who were alarmed by UAE influence may be cautious about how much they want to be caught up in a brawl between these two Gulf powers,” he said.
The Horn is not the only crisis on the AU summit's agenda.
War continues in Democratic Republic of Congo, and al Qaeda- and Islamic State-linked insurgencies are spreading across the Sahel region.
But those conflicts are still likely to take a back seat to the Horn.
Alex Rondos, the EU’s former special representative for the region, said the Horn had become a subsidiary arena for Middle East rivalries.
“Do the Saudis and UAE ... fully grasp the implications?” he said. “Will the Horn of Africa allow itself to be broken into pieces by these foreign rivalries and their African accomplices?” REUTERS

5 European nations say Russian opposition figure Navalny poisoned with dart frog toxin in prison
'Russia’s repeated disregard for international law and the Chemical Weapons Convention is clear,' says joint statement
Greater London
LONDON
Five European countries said on Saturday that Russian opposition figure Alexei Navalny died in prison in 2024 after being poisoned with dart frog toxin.
In a joint statement, the UK, Sweden, France, Germany and The Netherlands said they are "confident" that Navalny was poisoned with a "lethal toxin" following "analyses of samples" from his body.
"This is the conclusion of our Governments based on analyses of samples from Alexei Navalny. These analyses have conclusively confirmed the presence of epibatidine," the statement said.
According to the European states, the epibatidine toxin found in the skin of dart frogs is native to South America and not naturally found in Russia.
"Russia claimed that Navalny died of natural causes. But given the toxicity of epibatidine and reported symptoms, poisoning was highly likely the cause of his death."
"Russia’s repeated disregard for international law and the Chemical Weapons Convention is clear," the statement added.
In August 2020, the UK, Sweden, France, Germany, the Netherlands and partners had condemned "Russia’s use of Novichok to poison Alexei Navalny."
This followed the use of Novichok in Salisbury in 2018, which led to the death of a British national, Dawn Sturgess. The Russian government has always denied involvement in the Salisbury poisonings.
"These latest findings once again underline the need to hold Russia accountable for its repeated violations of the Chemical Weapons Convention and, in this instance, the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention," the European nations said.
The statement noted that permanent representatives of the five countries to the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons wrote to the director general to inform him of this "Russian breach of the Chemical Weapons Convention."
The countries said they were "further concerned that Russia did not destroy all of its chemical weapons."
Moscow announced Navalny’s death in a Siberia prison in February 2024 while he was serving a 19-year sentence on charges of extremism.
Russia's Federal Prison Service said the 47-year-old "felt bad" after a walk and lost consciousness "almost immediately."

BrewDog owners say craft beer company could be sold off
The brand, which produces Elvis Juice and Punk IPA, is looking for new investors

Craft beer brand BrewDog could be sold off after the company started the process to find new investors.
The Scottish beer brand recently announced plans to close all of its distilling brands, meaning it would no longer produce any of its spirits, including Duo Rum, Abstrakt Vodka, and Lonewolf Gin, at its distillery in Ellon, Aberdeenshire.
The company, which was founded in 2007, said it made the decision to focus on its beer brands, including the highly-popular Punk IPA, Elvis Juice, and Hazy Jane.
Now, in a statement, a spokesperson for BrewDog said the company had appointed Alix Partners to “support a structured and competitive process to evaluate the next phase of investment for the business.”
The statement said: “As with many businesses operating in a challenging economic climate and facing sustained macro headwinds, we regularly review our options with a focus on the long-term strength and sustainability of the company.
“Following a year of decisive action in 2025, which saw a focus on costs and operating efficiencies, we have appointed AlixPartners to support a structured and competitive process to evaluate the next phase of investment for the business. This is a deliberate and disciplined step with a focus on strengthening the long-term future of the BrewDog brand and its operations.”
Although no decisions have been made, a sale is under consideration.
In a statment BrewDog added: “BrewDog remains a global pioneer in craft beer: a world-class consumer brand, the No.1 independent brewer in the UK, and with a highly engaged global community. We believe that this combination will attract substantial interest, though no final decisions have been made.”
According to reports by Sky News, AlixPartners had begun sounding out prospective buyers in the last few days.
The company, which has 72 bars worldwide and four breweries in Scotland, the US, Australia, and Germany, said its breweries, bars, and venues will continue to operate as normal. It employs 1400 people across the organisation.
BrewDog’s founders James Watt and Martin Dickie are the company's major shareholders alongside private equity company TSG, which invested £213 million in 2017, making it a 21 per cent shareholder.
In 2024, the beer brand grossed £357 million in sales, and it is a major independent brewer with 4 per cent market share in the UK grocery market.

Hariri signals Future Movement's return to Lebanon elections
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
BEIRUT, Feb 14 - Former Lebanese Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri, one of the country's best-known politicians, indicated on Saturday that his party would contest upcoming elections, four years after he stepped back from public office.
In a speech marking the 21st anniversary of the assassination of his father Rafik, who was also prime minister, Saad told supporters in Beirut that others would “hear our voice, and count our votes” when elections take place.
It was unclear whether Hariri plans to run himself, although his popularity amongst Lebanon's Sunni Muslims remains strong. Huge masses gathered in Beirut’s Martyrs Square waving his party's flag and chanting his name. “You're not a few, and you never were,” Hariri told his supporters.
Lebanese parliament speaker Nabih Berri said on Friday that elections will be held as scheduled on May 10, despite calls from some politicians to postpone the vote, due in part to security concerns in southern Lebanon, where Israel has carried out air strikes targeting militant group Hezbollah.
Hariri, a three-time former premier, stepped back from politics in 2022 and blocked his Future Movement from running in a parliamentary vote that year, citing reasons including Iran's influence in the country - an indirect reference to Hezbollah.
The Shi'ite Muslim Hezbollah had played a growing role in Lebanon's internal politics, but was severely weakened after a 2024 conflict with Israel. It is now under U.S.-backed pressure to disarm since a ceasefire in late 2024.
Before stepping back from politics, Hariri led one of parliament's biggest factions after inheriting his father's mantle.
His Future Movement's absence from Lebanon's 2022 parliamentary election resulted in fractured Sunni Muslim representation in parliament, where seats are divided according to a sectarian quota system. REUTERS

Turkish top diplomat meets head of National Committee for Administration of Gaza

Türkiye's Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan met Ali Shaath, head of the National Committee for the Administration of Gaza (NCAG), Turkish diplomatic sources said.
The NCAG, formed after the October ceasefire in Gaza, is a Palestinian governance body under recent peace efforts to oversee Gaza’s civil administration and reconstruction, with Türkiye offering diplomatic backing and humanitarian support to help stabilise and rebuild the besieged enclave.
The NCAG said on Saturday that statements by the Gaza administration regarding readiness to hand over all public institutions pave the way for enabling the body to fully assume its responsibilities in managing the transitional phase.
In a statement, the committee, said it “views the recent expression of readiness for an orderly transition as a pivotal step in fulfilling its mandate as the transitional administration of Gaza.”
Gaza's media office on Thursday renewed its call for the national committee to begin carrying out its duties. Hamas has also repeatedly announced readiness to facilitate the committee’s work.
The entry of committee members into Gaza requires field and security coordination through crossings controlled by Israel. No official position has yet been issued by the body, explaining the delay in its entry, and Israel has not commented on the matter.
Seeking operational independence
The committee said that enabling it to operate efficiently and independently in Gaza would “unlock international support for recovery, reconstruction, secure a complete Israeli withdrawal, and restore normal daily life.”
The committee also called on mediators and all parties concerned to “to intensify efforts to resolve outstanding issues without delay,” stressing that the Palestinian people “cannot afford more time lost; we must move now to ensure a smooth and credible transition.”
The October 10 ceasefire halted Israel’s two-year war on Gaza, though violations continue despite a drop in attacks and limited aid entering the besieged enclave.
Palestinian officials say more than 72,000 people were killed and 171,000 injured, with 90 percent of civilian infrastructure destroyed, while the UN estimates reconstruction costs at around $70 billion.
Gaza’s Health Ministry says at least 591 Palestinians have been killed and 1,578 injured since the truce took effect.

ITV boss admits X-Factor only existed so channel could keep Simon Cowell
Claudia Rosencrantz claims that ‘Pop Idol is the most beautiful format’ despite Cowell’s success with ‘Pop Idol’
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
Claudia Rosencrantz, the influential former ITV entertainment controller, has made a surprising revelation: she commissioned The X Factor primarily to secure Simon Cowell's continued presence at the broadcaster, despite her personal disdain for the show's format.
The 66-year-old admitted her strong preference for its predecessor, Pop Idol, during a new Magic Radio documentary, Popstars At 25: The Story Of A Talent Show Revolution.
Rosencrantz was unequivocal in her critique of the two programmes, stating: "X Factor is not as good a format as Pop Idol, it just isn’t, Pop Idol is the most beautiful format."
She went on to laud Pop Idol as "perfect, pure format, and it works, and it’s worked in every single territory in the world that it’s hit, The X Factor hasn’t, and the reason it hasn’t is it’s not as pure."
Furthermore, she criticised The X Factor's mentoring system, suggesting judges had "too much skin in the game," ultimately deeming Pop Idol a "much, much better show."
Reflecting on the difficult choice, Rosencrantz stated: "I think at the time, with my ITV hat on, Simon was, he was an absolutely huge star, and as a network, did we need to stick with Simon, or did we need to stick with the better show?"
She called it "the worst and most painful decision I’ve ever had to make, but if I had to make it again, I would make the same one, because Simon was absolutely amazing at that time, and he was going to go off to America." Her priority was to "keep a hold of him here on on ITV as his home network," which she felt was "quite an important thing."
The X Factor concluded in 2018, following Pop Idol's run from 2001 to 2003. During its time on the air, the show discovered acts like One Direction, Little Mix, Olly Murs, JLS and Leona Lewis.
Simon Cowell has remained with ITV, judging Britain’s Got Talent since 2007 and currently stars alongside the likes of Amanda Holden, Alesha Dixon, and new judge KSI.
Rosencrantz's full interview features in episode one of Popstars At 25: The Story Of A Talent Show Revolution, launching on Magic Radio at 7pm on Sunday, February 15, and available via the Rayo app.

Zelensky in Munich demonstrates visualization of Russia's massive strike on Ukraine
He presented this visualization during his speech at the Munich Security Conference, Ukrinform’s correspondent reports.
"Right now you can see a visualization of one of Russias attacks. Many of you were already here in Munich when this strike took place. Russia launched 24 ballistic missiles, one air launched guided missile, and 219 attack drones against our cities: Kyiv, Dnipro, Odesa," Zelensky said while commenting on the footage.
He noted that to repel this attack, Ukraine’s air defense used missiles that had arrived from partners on Sunday, February 8.
"And on Thursday night, the missiles were already protecting our skies. And this is just one night, but Russian attacks happen almost every night in Ukraine, and at least once a week massive strikes," he emphasized.
He called on partners to continue supporting Ukraine’s air defense, especially the PURL program, through which Ukraine purchases weapons, primarily air defense missiles, from the United States.
"Sometimes we manage to deliver new missiles to our Patriots or NASAMS right before an attack, sometimes literally at the last moment. And I want to especially thank Germany, Norway, and the Netherlands for their strong leadership in Europe when it comes to providing us with air defense systems. Thank you very much. These systems protect our lives," Zelensky said.
As reported, on the night of February 12, Russia launched 219 attack drones at Ukraine, a significant number of them Shahed-type drones, as well as 25 missiles, 24 of them ballistic.

MUNICH, Germany — Kyiv is ready to make peace, but European leaders need to be ready for Russian aggression because Russia’s Vladimir Putin is “a slave to war,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy warned at the Munich Security Conference on Saturday.
“The longer the war continues, the more resources the aggressor receives, the more dangerous the consequences become, the more dangerous the evolution of weapons and of war itself is, and the evolution of Putin,” Zelenskyy said in a keynote speech.
Putin “is no longer interested in anything else” than war, as “he cannot imagine life without power or after power,” Zelenskyy added.

China’s Wang Yi blasts Japan over Taiwan remarks at Munich conference
Japanese defense chief says Tokyo remains open to dialogue with Beijing
ISTANBUL
China’s foreign minister on Saturday criticized Japan over remarks by Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi on Taiwan, saying the comments undermine China’s territorial sovereignty.
Speaking at the Munich Security Conference, Wang Yi said Takaichi’s statements last year violated Japan’s commitments to China and provoked Beijing, as tensions persist in China-Japan relations.
The dispute follows Takaichi’s comments in November that a potential Chinese attack on Taiwan could constitute a “survival-threatening situation” for Japan, potentially allowing Tokyo to exercise collective self-defense.
Responding to a question about possible renewed tensions in the Asia-Pacific region and China’s role in preventing escalation, Wang downplayed concerns about rising regional instability.
“I don’t think the situation in Asia-Pacific is becoming increasingly tense. In this world, Asia is probably the only region that maintains overall peace,” he said.
Wang then criticized Takaichi’s remarks and Japan’s position on Taiwan.
“This is the first time in eight years that a Japanese Prime Minister has uttered such words. It directly violates China’s territorial sovereignty, and it directly challenges the fact that Taiwan has been returned to China,” he said.
“It can completely violate Japan’s commitment to China. Could China possibly accept this provocation? No way,” he added.
Wang also compared Japan’s handling of its wartime past with Germany’s response after the Nazi era, saying Berlin “conducted a thorough reckoning with Nazi crimes and passed laws to ban all speech and actions promoting Nazi ideology.” He said Japan, however, still “pays homage to Class-A war criminals, who are enshrined as so-called heroic spirits.”
“This means that Japan has lingering ambitions for invasion and colonialism of Taiwan and the ghost of militarism are still haunting the country,” he said.
Wang urged the Japanese people not to “let the right far right extremists fall and track them along,” and called on countries that care about peace to “shout” to Japan that “if you go back down that old road, it will be a dead end. If you try gambling again, loss will be faster and more devastating.”
A day earlier, Japanese Defense Minister Shinjiro Koizumi told the Munich Security Conference that Tokyo seeks dialogue with Beijing despite differences.
He said he met his Chinese counterpart, Dong Jun, in Malaysia last year.
“Even though we have differences and we have disagreements, Japan's stance is very clear. We are always open to the dialogue,” Koizumi said.
“We are not going to shut down any channels. Regardless of differences … I (would) like to send this message to the Chinese side, that we always welcome dialogue,” he added.
Koizumi also said countries around Japan “continue opaque military build-up,” and that the regional military balance has been “greatly and rapidly evolving in the East and the South China Seas.”

After bowling Scotland out for 152, England racked up 155-5 in 18.2 overs, with Jacob Bethell scoring 32, Sam Curran 28 and Will Jacks (16 off 10 balls) hitting a six and a four to finish the job.
England wobbled at the start of their chase as the new white ball swung under the floodlights with the sun going down.
Phil Salt fell third ball to Brandon McMullen for just two and when Jos Buttler picked out McMullen off Brad Currie, they were 13-2.
Scotland bowled tightly until Bethell broke the shackles by hitting McMullen for a six and two fours in the fifth over.
Spinner Mark Watt also came in for some punishment, conceding 22 off his first over as Banton took him for three huge sixes.
A 66-run partnership ended when the left-handed Bethell, on 32, helped a leg-side delivery from Oliver Davidson into the grateful hands of Brad Wheal at short fine leg.
Captain Brook did not last long, scooping Michael Leask over his shoulder to Wheal to make it 86-4, but England were always in control and got home with 10 balls to spare.
Earlier, England’s bowlers found their mojo and vindicated Brook’s decision to field on winning the toss.
After being smacked to all parts of Mumbai’s Wankhede Stadium in conceding 196 to the West Indies on Wednesday, England’s attack exerted much more control at Eden Gardens.
Captain Richie Berrington top-scored for Scotland with 49 off 32 balls with five fours and two sixes.
He and Tom Bruce put on 71 for the fourth wicket, but it was their only notable partnership.
Spinner Liam Dawson ended it in the 13th over when Bruce was caught for 24, Curran providing the safe hands at deep square leg.
When Adil Rashid trapped Berrington lbw in the next over, Scotland collapsed, losing their last seven wickets for 39 runs from 113-3.
Jofra Archer had been expensive in the two previous outings but made the early breakthroughs before finishing with a brilliant 2-24 off his four overs.
In his second over, he hurried George Munsey into top-edging to Banton and two balls later had McMullen caught by Salt in the deep.
Michael Jones (33) holed out to Bethell off Curran, and Scotland were 42-3 at the end of the six-over power play and never threatened a competitive total.
Rashid was the best of the England bowlers with 3-36 from his four overs, while Dawson took 2-34.

Trusting Trump is hard but NATO’s newest member won’t ditch the US yet

BRUSSELS — Sometimes it is the answers politicians decline to give that are the most revealing — like whether it’s still possible, after clashing bitterly over the fate of Greenland, for a European leader to trust Donald Trump.
“I don’t do that kind of judgment,” Sweden’s Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson said in an interview with POLITICO, when asked directly if he can trust the U.S. president. “The discussion we had on Greenland and Denmark was a bad one.”
But European leaders, he believes, took the decision to “stand up” for their values and for European integrity in the face of Trump’s aggression — and it worked. “We protected European interests, Danish interests, broader European interests as well. And we did that very clearly.”

In an exclusive interview with FRANCE 24, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte discussed the evolving role of Europe in global security, emphasising that the alliance is stronger today than it was a year ago. Reflecting on NATO's transformation, Rutte highlighted how the leadership of U.S. President Donald Trump, particularly his push for higher defence spending, played a crucial role in reshaping the alliance's priorities.
Rutte also noted Europe's growing responsibility within NATO, stressing that nations are increasingly taking charge of their own defence. However, he reiterated that the U.S. remains deeply anchored in NATO, which continues to be vital for the security of Europe and the Atlantic. On the war in Ukraine, Rutte stressed the urgency of providing more support, acknowledging that the current pace of aid remains insufficient.
As NATO faces new challenges, Rutte’s remarks underscored the strategic shift that has strengthened the alliance in the face of Russian aggression and growing global tensions.

USA Used Claude AI Model to Capture Nicolás Maduro

The US military used artificial intelligence tools from Anthropic during a secret operation to capture former Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro.
This was reported by The Wall Street Journal, citing its own sources.
The mission, which took place last month in Caracas, was the first confirmed case of Anthropic models being used in secret operations by the US Department of Defense.
The use of the Claude model was made possible by Anthropic’s partnership with Palantir Technologies, whose software is the basis for analytics at the Pentagon and federal law enforcement agencies.
Although the exact list of AI tasks in this operation has not been disclosed, the military typically uses such tools for rapid document analysis, processing of intercepted data, and control of autonomous drones.
This incident sparked a sharp conflict between the developer and the US government. Anthropic’s rules officially prohibit the use of Claude to promote violence, develop weapons, or conduct surveillance.
Due to these ethical restrictions, the Trump administration is already considering canceling a $200 million contract with Anthropic. Defense Secretary Pete Hagseth previously stated that the department would not work with models that ‘prohibit warfare,’ hinting specifically at Claude’s strict security filters.
Operation Absolute Resolve began at dawn on January 3, 2026. US Delta Force special forces, supported by aviation, raided targets in Caracas, having first suppressed Venezuela’s air defense system.
More than 150 aircraft took part in the mission, and technology to disable communications and electricity was used during the assault itself. According to the fighters, just before the assault on the government quarter, all radars in the air defense units suddenly failed.
After American drones and helicopters appeared in the sky, the soldiers felt the effect of a powerful energy wave that effectively suppressed any possibility of resistance.
One Venezuelan soldier described unbearable internal pain, disorientation, and a feeling of “his head splitting open from the inside.” Many soldiers began to experience massive nosebleeds and internal bleeding, which literally prevented them from getting up off the ground.
Maduro and his wife were detained at their residence and immediately taken to the United States.

US open to discuss security guarantees – Zhovkva
The Deputy Head of the Office of the President of Ukraine Ihor Zhovkva in an interview with TSN, Ukrinform reports.
"It is very important that today the United States is not afraid to discuss security guarantees," he said.
Zhovkva recalled that the 20th package of EU sanctions is expected closer to February 24.
"There are many important measures there, in particular regarding the termination of so-called maritime services. This concerns the Russian 'shadow fleet' that transports the same types of export raw materials. Every time we tell EU representatives: yes, it is very important that more and more vessels are being added to the 'shadow fleet' register, but is this enough? Or perhaps it is already worth creating obstacles so that this shadow fleet does not operate, even despite the sanctions?" he noted.
He stated that we can now see examples of some countries beginning to respond by detaining these vessels, as France and Estonia recently did.
"They detain these tankers, inspect them, and for a certain period even bring them into their ports. But then they are forced to release them. Why? Because there is no appropriate legislative framework for fully stopping these vessels and terminating their voyages," Zhovkva explained.
As Ukrinform reported, on January 6 German Federal Chancellor Friedrich Merz stated that Germany fundamentally does not rule out anything regarding its contribution to security guarantees for Ukraine after a ceasefire, including deploying forces in neighboring NATO countries and participating in monitoring.

Zelenskyy suggests ceasefire so that Russia can hold elections
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said that Ukraine is ready to hold elections provided that a two-month ceasefire is in place, and has offered to guarantee a ceasefire for Russia so that they can hold elections too.
Source: Zelenskyy speaking at the Munich Security Conference, as reported by Suspilne, Ukraine's national public broadcaster
Quote: "I'm very honest. Give us two months of ceasefire, [and] we will go to elections. That's it.
Give us ceasefire, give us security, infrastructure. Maybe not two months, but we need a lot of days to prepare. Then give us the possibility [for] our soldiers to vote… I mean, how they can defend our lives, our country, and at the same moment vote? This is something difficult."
Details: Zelenskyy said comparisons with elections in other countries during wartime are irrelevant because of the scale of the threats.
Quote: "So give us ceasefire. President Trump can do this. Push Putin, make ceasefire, then our parliament will change the law and we will go to elections – if they need them. If Americans need elections in Ukraine and if Russians need elections in Ukraine, we are open for this."
More details: Zelenskyy added that Ukraine could also "give ceasefire for Russians if they will do elections in Russia".

From dogfight to brink of war: when Britain planned to bomb Tel Aviv and Truman said 'Don't'
Unknown

22:30:11 KST

Less than a year after its founding, the young State of Israel faced what could have become one of the gravest crises of its early existence: a planned British airstrike on Tel Aviv.
The dramatic episode unfolded in early 1949, during Israel’s War of Independence. In a single day, Israeli Air Force pilots shot down five British aircraft over the Negev amid fighting with Egyptian forces. Britain, whose Royal Air Force units were stationed in Egypt, prepared what Israeli newspapers later described as a large-scale retaliatory bombing of Tel Aviv.
The strike was called off just hours before takeoff — after direct intervention by U.S. President Harry Truman.
A mistaken dogfight
In late 1948, the Israel Defense Forces launched Operation Horev, aimed at driving Egyptian forces out of the Negev. British aircraft based near the Suez Canal routinely conducted reconnaissance flights over battle zones, at times crossing into Israeli territory. Their more advanced planes could operate beyond the range of Israeli anti-aircraft fire.
On a cold morning in January 1949, two aircraft crossed the border and spotted smoke rising from the ground. They dove lower and saw an Israeli convoy in flames. Israeli troops, who had been attacked by Egyptian planes roughly 30 minutes earlier, assumed the aircraft were Egyptian returning to strike again and opened fire. One plane was shot down. Its British pilot parachuted and was captured by Israeli forces.
At the same time, Israeli Air Force aircraft on patrol identified additional British planes that had crossed the border. They engaged them, shooting down two. Furious, the British dispatched more aircraft, triggering a large-scale aerial battle.
By the end of the day, Britain had lost five planes. Israel lost none, though several Israeli aircraft — including one flown by Ezer Weizman, who would later become Air Force commander and president of Israel — were damaged but managed to land safely.
Only after landing did Israeli pilots realize the planes they had downed were British, not Egyptian.
That evening, the Israeli pilots, many of whom were veterans of Britain’s Royal Air Force during World War II, reportedly sent a message to their former counterparts: “Sorry about yesterday, but you were on the wrong side of the fence. Come over for a drink sometime — you’ll see many familiar faces.”
A planned strike on Tel Aviv
Behind the scenes, however, Britain was preparing retaliation.
According to a front-page report in Yedioth Ahronoth at the time, RAF headquarters in London ordered squadrons in Suez to prepare a dawn bombing mission targeting Tel Aviv.
The American envoy in Cairo learned of the plan and alerted the White House. Truman, recognizing the potential for a catastrophic escalation in the Middle East, intervened directly. Bypassing diplomatic channels, he reportedly called British Prime Minister Clement Attlee and demanded that the operation be halted.
At 3 a.m., roughly three hours before the armed aircraft were scheduled to take off, the order came down to cancel the attack.
More than 70 years before President Joe Biden would use similar language in a different regional crisis, Truman delivered a blunt message: “Don’t.”
The episode is revisited in the podcast “Hofert Journalism” from BePo, which explores the little-known incident that briefly brought Britain and Israel to the brink of open conflict — and the American intervention that prevented Tel Aviv from becoming a wartime target.

MSF suspends some hospital operations in Gaza due to presence of armed men
Doctors Without Borders said it has suspended some operations at the largest functioning facility in Gaza after patients and its staff said they witnessed armed, masked men in parts of the hospital
- Bookmark
Aid group Doctors Without Borders announced the suspension of some of its operations at one of the largest functioning hospitals in Gaza after patients and staff reported seeing armed, masked men roaming parts of the medical facility.
Nasser Hospital, in Khan Younis city, is one of the few functioning hospitals left in the strip. Hundreds of patients and war-wounded have been treated there and the facility was a hub for Palestinian prisoners Israel released in exchange of Israeli hostages as part of the ceasefire deal.
Doctors Without Borders, known by its acronym MSF, said in a statement all its non-critical medical operations at Nasser Hospital were suspended due to “security breaches” that posed “serious security threats to our teams and patients”.
While the suspension occurred in January, MSF’s comments in the“frequently asked questions” section on its website were the first to disclose its decision. It's unclear when the post was made, but MSF's site said it was updated Feb. 11. The comments were a rare public announcement by an international organization about the presence of armed men in or near medical facilities since the war began over two years ago.
MSF said it made the difficult decision after an uptick of patients and staff seeing armed men in parts of the hospital compound since the U.S.-brokered October ceasefire was reached. The gunmen were seen in areas the medical aid group didn’t operate.
“MSF teams have reported a pattern of unacceptable acts including the presence of armed men, intimidation, arbitrary arrests of patients and a recent situation of suspicion of movement of weapons,” said the statement.
It’s unclear who the armed men are. MSF said it was unable to specify.
Attacks on health facilities
Armed groups have mushroomed across Gaza as a result of the war, including groups backed by Israel’s army in the Israeli-controlled part of the strip. Nasser Hospital staff says that in recent months it’s repeatedly been attacked by armed tribesmen and militias, despite police presence there.
The group said it had expressed its concern to the relevant authorities, stressing that hospitals must remain neutral, civilian spaces. It said its concerns were also heightened by previous and deliberate Israeli attacks on health facilities during the war.
Throughout the war, Israel has struck hospitals on repeated occasions, including Nasser, accusing Hamas of operating in or around them. Hamas security men have also often been seen inside hospitals, blocking access to some areas of the facilities.
Some hostages that were released from Gaza have said that they've spent time during their captivity in a hospital.
Police to be deployed
The Hamas-run interior ministry, which oversees the police force in Gaza, said Saturday police would be deployed to secure hospitals and rid them of armed presence. It said it would take legal action against violators and was in the process of implementing stricter measures to ensure patients’ safety.
While international law gives hospitals special protections during war, they can lose this immunity if combatants use them to hide fighters or store weapons, according to the International Committee of the Red Cross. Still, there has to be plenty of warning to allow the evacuation of staff and patients before any operations take place. If harm to civilians from an attack is disproportionate to the military objective, it is illegal under international law.
Aid groups and rights organizations say Israel has decimated Gaza's health system, forcing most of its hospitals to shut down while heavily damaging others. During the war, Israeli forces raided a number of hospitals and struck others, detaining hundreds of staff.
Impact on depleted medical system
MSF said that until further notice, it will continue supporting critical services at Nasser Hospital, including inpatient and surgical departments for patients with traumatic or burn injuries. However, it's ending support to the paediatrics and maternity wards, including the neonatal intensive care unit. It's also indefinitely suspended its outpatient consultations for 3D burn screening and mental health, as well as other services.
Zaher al-Waheidi, head of the records department at the health ministry, said MSF's suspension would have a significant impact as hundreds of patients are admitted to the maternity and burn wards daily. He said the Ministry of Health would take over maternity patient care, but said burn victims won't have many options.
Israel has been cracking down on aid groups operating in Gaza and the occupied West Bank, including MSF. The group is one of more than three dozen aid groups that Israel has banned from operating in the strip for failing to comply with new registration rules.
MSF says Israel's decision will have a catastrophic impact on its work in Gaza, where it provides funding and international staff for six hospitals as well as running two field hospitals and eight primary health centers, clinics and medical points. It also runs two of Gaza’s five stabilization centers, helping children with severe malnutrition.

MUNICH, Germany — The U.S. is not interfering in European politics, a senior U.S. State Department official told POLITICO on Saturday, despite reported efforts by the Trump administration to fund MAGA-aligned organizations on the continent.
Speaking at the POLITICO Pub on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference, U.S. Under Secretary of State Sarah Rogers pushed back on a POLITICO report that Rogers and other Trump officials had held talks with groups in France and Britain and asked the Washington-based Heritage Foundation to provide a list of potential organizations to fund.
“The idea that we have a slush fund for the far right is a lie,” Rogers said. “It's not America's decision to govern who's elected in Europe.”

UK, EU allies accuse Kremlin of poisoning opposition leader Navalny

Five European countries claim that Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny was poisoned with a deadly toxin and blame the Kremlin for it.
The foreign ministries of the U.K., France, Germany, Sweden and the Netherlands said Saturday that analysis of samples from Navalny, who died two years ago, "have conclusively confirmed the presence of epibatidine." It is a toxin found in poison dart frogs in South America.
The countries said that "only the Russian state had the combined means, motive and disregard for international law" to carry out the attack.
They said they were reporting Russia to the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons for a breach of the Chemical Weapons Convention.
Navalny, who crusaded against official corruption and staged massive anti-Kremlin protests as President Vladimir Putin's fiercest foe, died in the Arctic penal colony in February 2024. He was serving a 19-year sentence that he believed to be politically motivated.
Navalny's widow, Yulia Navalnaya, said last year that two independent labs had found that her husband was poisoned shortly before his death. Navalnaya has repeatedly blamed Putin for Navalny's death, something Russian officials have vehemently denied.

Marco Rubio’s address at the Munich Security Conference marked a more conciliatory stance for the U.S., following Vice President JD Vance’s harsh critique of Europe last year for ignoring an internal “threat,” shirking its defense responsibilities, and allowing left-wing influence in cultural matters. Although Rubio still encouraged European allies to consider policies akin to Donald Trump’s America, his speech clearly aimed to ease tensions and mend transatlantic relations.

Five European countries accused Russia on Saturday of "poisoning" opposition leader Alexei Navalny in 2024 using a "rare toxin", according to a statement issued on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference.
"The UK, Sweden, France, Germany and The Netherlands are confident that Alexei Navalny was poisoned with a lethal toxin," the countries said, following an "analyses of samples" from his body.
The staunch critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin died in an Arctic prison in February 2024 while serving a 19-year prison sentence.
"Russia claimed that Navalny died of natural causes. But given the toxicity of epibatidine and reported symptoms, poisoning was highly likely the cause of his death," the statement said.
"Navalny died while held in prison, meaning Russia had the means, motive and opportunity to administer this poison to him."

'Science-proven'
Navalny's widow, Yulia Navalnya, said it was now "science-proven" that the Kremlin opponent had been murdered.
"Two years ago I came on stage here and said that it was Vladimir Putin who killed my husband," Navalnaya said on the sidelines of the conference.
"I was of course certain that it was a murder... but back then it was just words. But today these words have become science-proven facts," Navalnaya added.
Navalnaya last September said that laboratory analysis of smuggled biological samples found he was killed by poisoning.
"Today, beside his widow, the UK is shining a light on the Kremlin's barbaric plot to silence his voice," UK Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper, who met Navalnaya while attending the Munich conference, said in a statement.

The countries said they had reported Russia to the world's chemical weapons watchdog – the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons – over the finding.
"We are further concerned that Russia did not destroy all of its chemical weapons," the countries said, accusing Moscow of breaching the Chemical Weapons Convention.
Navalny was previously poisoned with the Soviet-era nerve agent Novichok in 2020 while campaigning in Siberia and was flown to Germany on an emergency evacuation flight, where he spent months recovering.
The charismatic anti-corruption campaigner had rallied hundreds of thousands across Russia in anti-Kremlin protests as he exposed the alleged ill-gotten gains of Putin's inner circle.

UAE-Saudi rift over security threats push Arab mediators to act
Bahrain and Egypt are attempting to mend ties between the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, after a public falling out in December.
Bahrain and Egypt are attempting to mend ties between the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, two sources said, weeks into a diplomatic rift between the Arab world’s most powerful countries.
Saudi Arabia and the UAE had a public falling out in December, when the kingdom accused its neighbour of threatening its national security by supporting Yemeni separatists who orchestrated a brief land grab.
A source close to the Saudi government insisted there was “no need for mediation” because direct channels are open between the two countries.
Although Riyadh and Abu Dhabi did not break ties, they have had no high-level diplomatic contact since the last week of December, according to several sources who requested anonymity.
“Bahrain is leading mediation efforts between Saudi and the UAE that aim at ending the ongoing misunderstanding,” said one Gulf official.
The goal, he said, was to “bridge the gap and bring viewpoints closer.”
“It’s a Gulf issue and it should be resolved in the Gulf,” he said, adding that this was a “Bahraini effort, not a GCC effort,” in reference to regional bloc the Gulf Cooperation Council.

Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny was likely fatally poisoned in prison, European leaders say
An analysis of samples from deceased Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny shows he was likely fatally poisoned in a Russian prison, according to multiple European governments.
In a joint statement, the leaders of the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Sweden and the Netherlands said they are confident Navalny was poisoned. Samples from Navalny "conclusively confirmed the presence of epibatidine," a toxin found in poison dart frogs in South America, according to the statement.
"Russia claimed that Navalny died of natural causes," the countries said. "But given the toxicity of epibatidine and reported symptoms, poisoning was highly likely the cause of his death. Navalny died while held in prison, meaning Russia had the means, motive and opportunity to administer this poison to him."
British Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper said in a statement that "Russia saw Navalny as a threat" and poisoned him as a show of strength.
"By using this form of poison, the Russian state demonstrated the despicable tools it has at its disposal and the overwhelming fear it has of political opposition," Cooper said.
The United Kingdom's foreign office said that "only the Russian state had the means, motive and opportunity to deploy this lethal toxin to target Navalny" and that they "hold it responsible for his death."
Navalny's widow, Yulia Navalnaya, said on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference in Germany that her husband's death was now a "science-proven fact," according to the AFP.
"Two years ago, I came on stage here and said that it was Vladimir Putin who killed my husband," said Navalnaya, who said in September that independent labs found her husband was poisoned shortly before his death but did not provide proof for the claim or elaborate on what the alleged poison was. At the time, she said the labs were not publishing their results due to "political considerations."
"I was of course certain that it was a murder," Navalnaya continued, the AFP reported. "Back then, it was just words. But today these words have become science-proven facts."
Navalny was the loudest critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin. He crusaded against official corruption and staged massive anti-Kremlin protests. He was poisoned with the Soviet-era nerve agent Novichok while flying from Moscow to Siberia in 2020 and treated in Germany. Navalny later told 60 Minutes' Lesley Stahl that he believed the poisoning was an assassination attempt engineered by Putin. Russia has denied any involvement.
Navalny returned to Moscow in 2021, facing certain arrest. He was convicted three times and received a sentence of 19 years for extremism. Navalny called the charges politically motivated.
He was jailed in January 2021 and moved to an Arctic penal colony in late 2023. He died there in February 2024.
Russian authorities gave few details on the cause of Navalny's death. Navalnaya said in August 2024 that she was told by Russian investigators that Navalny died from a combination of "a dozen different diseases" and that he finally succumbed to arrhythmia, or an irregular heartbeat, after a walk. Navalnaya said her husband exhibited no instances of heart disease before he was imprisoned.
The European leaders accused Russia of having "repeated disregard for international law" and the Chemical Weapons Convention, a 1997 treaty that prohibits the development, production, stockpiling and use of chemical weapons. Russia has also been accused of using Novichok in a 2018 incident that led to the death of a British woman, Dawn Sturgess.
"We are further concerned that Russia did not destroy all of its chemical weapons," the European leaders said. "We and our partners will make use of all policy levers at our disposal to continue to hold Russia to account."

Europe weighs nuclear options amid Russia fears, US doubts

European leaders, increasingly alarmed about threats from a nuclear-armed Russia and uncertainty surrounding U.S. security guarantees, are intensifying debates over the continent’s nuclear deterrence.
German Chancellor Friedrich Merz told the Munich Security Conference (MSC) that he had "held confidential talks with the French president about European nuclear deterrence".
And Prime Minister Keir Starmer of Britain, Europe's other nuclear power along with France, said it was "enhancing our nuclear cooperation with France".
The UK's nuclear deterrent already protects NATO members, and Starmer said "any adversary must know that in a crisis they could be confronted by our combined strength" alongside France.
Still, while the United States and Russia have thousands of nuclear warheads each, the combined French and British arsenal is in the hundreds.
Discussion of nuclear armament has long been viewed as taboo in many other European countries, but Russian aggression and worries about U.S. commitment have forced the issue into mainstream European politics.
In a report assessing "Europe's nuclear options" published for the MSC, experts warned that the relatively small nuclear arsenals of France and the United Kingdom might not be enough to face down Russia without U.S. support.
"Europeans can no longer outsource their thinking about nuclear deterrence to the United States," the group of 11 experts warn in the paper, which calls on Europe to "urgently confront a new nuclear reality" in the face of "Russia's nuclear-backed revisionism".
Many European officials are convinced that Moscow's territorial ambitions will not be confined to Ukraine, and that other European countries, including even NATO members, could face some sort of attack.
U.S. President Donald Trump's disdainful comments about NATO and his highly transactional approach to foreign relations, meanwhile, have Washington's European allies questioning whether they can risk relying on U.S. protection.
The MSC report lays out five nuclear options for Europe, but cautions that none are good and that there is "no low-cost or risk-free way out of Europe's nuclear predicament".
"The era in which Europe could afford strategic complacency has ended," the authors write.
"However uncomfortable the debate may be, the new security environment requires European policymakers to confront the role of nuclear weapons in the defence of the continent directly and without delay, and to invest the resources needed to do so competently."
The five options are: Continue to rely on American deterrence; strengthen the role of British and French nuclear weapons in a European deterrent; jointly develop European nuclear weapons as a deterrent; increase the number of European countries with their own nuclear arsenals; or expand European conventional military power to present a more intimidating non-nuclear deterrent.
Sticking with the status quo, and relying on America's unmatched military might, remains "the most credible and feasible option" in the short term, according to the authors.
"We have nuclear deterrence already" within the NATO framework "which is working, which has plans with capabilities and doctrines," Estonian Foreign Minister Margus Tsahkna told AFP.
Merz declared that European NATO allies need to remain united while building up a European nuclear deterrence, stressing that "we will not allow different security zones to emerge in Europe".
The capability gap between the United States and Russia on the one hand, and the much small French and British arsenals on the other, is currently so large that very few believe Europeans can assume full responsibility for deterrence in the short term.
"If there's going to be some kind of bigger European investments in France or the UK's nuclear deterrence, that's only a good thing," Finnish Defence Minister Antti Hakkanen recently told AFP.
But he quickly added: "If you're talking about to compensate US nuclear deterrence, that's not realistic at this point."
Still, experts welcomed the increasingly serious political debate on an issue that has long worried military planners.
"That's very positive, but now we need action," Heloise Fayet of the French Institute of International Relations (Ifri), a contributor to the MSC report, told AFP.
The report notes that both France and Britain would face a range of challenges in growing their arsenals and extending nuclear protection across Europe, from hefty costs to tricky questions about who holds final authority to launch the warheads.
Britain's nuclear weapons also currently depend heavily on U.S. technology, meaning for the moment there is "no sustainable future for a UK nuclear deterrent without U.S. collaboration," the experts note.
French President Emmanuel Macron, who has previously raised the possibility of extending France's nuclear umbrella across Europe, is scheduled to deliver a major speech on French nuclear doctrine at the end of February.
Macron said in Munich he was considering a doctrine that could include "special cooperation, joint exercises, and shared security interests with certain key countries".
"This speech by Macron will be very important," said Fayet. "It has generated enormous expectations in Europe."

How Israeli weapons are ‘obliterating’ Palestinians and why it constitutes a war crime

Thousands of Palestinians killed by Israel in Gaza have simply vanished into thin air. No remains to identify, no bodies to bury. Nothing remains but blood spattered on the walls and fragments of tissue of those killed.
A major investigation on Wednesday documented at least 2,842 such cases since October 2023, drawing from records kept by Civil Defence teams about people inside a building when it was hit and subsequent body counts.
They look for blood patterns, tissue, anything that might tell them what happened. When the numbers don't match, when they've searched everywhere and come up empty, they mark those victims as "evaporated."
Yasmin Mahani, a Palestinian woman whose child was targeted in an Israeli strike on al Tabin school in August 2024, went back to the building. It had been sheltering families who'd fled their homes. She found scattered flesh. She found blood. She didn't find her son. "Not even a body to bury," she told Al Jazeera.
Experts say this happens when people are exposed to extreme heat, with many cases attributed to thermobaric and incendiary weapons.
Thermobaric weapons are designed to create a powerful explosion by using oxygen from the surrounding air to intensify their blast, according to Dr Arthur van Coller, Professor of International Humanitarian Law at the STADIO Higher Education.
“They function by releasing a fuel in the form of gas, aerosol, or fine powder into the air. This fuel cloud mixes with atmospheric oxygen and is subsequently ignited,” van Coller tells TRT World.
“The ‘blast’ generates intense heat and massive pressure waves that last longer than those of conventional explosives, creating a vacuum effect that can cause severe injuries that are difficult to treat.”
Van Coller, who has special expertise on the legality of the use of thermobaric weapons, adds that such weapons are particularly devastating in buildings and underground structures, where reflected pressure waves multiply their force, making it difficult to confine damage to military targets and increasing the risk to civilians.
These bombs work differently from regular explosives. They release clouds of combustible particles first, then ignite them. The result is a pressure wave and a fireball that can reach 2,500 to 3,000 degrees Celsius.
When used against humans, thermobaric weapons can cause multiple complex and severe injuries due to primary blast effects, including barotrauma to the lungs and other organs, according to van Coller.
“They can also inflict secondary injuries from shrapnel and debris, tertiary injuries such as blunt trauma from being thrown by the blast, and quaternary injuries, including burns from intense heat and the inhalation of toxic fumes,” he adds.
According to reports, Israel has used several weapons that fit this description, including the MK-84 bomb, the BLU-109 bunker buster and the GBU-39 glide bomb. That last one was used in the al Tabin strike, and it's basically designed to keep buildings standing while destroying everything inside through heat and pressure.
Euro-Med Human Rights Monitor flagged similar cases back in 2023 and 2024. The investigators documented victims who appeared to have melted or turned to ash after residential buildings were bombed.
“In confined spaces, the heat and pressure can thus cause severe burns, crush injuries, and disintegration of soft tissues. Bodies may be incinerated, fragmented, or rendered unrecognisable, and in some cases, only small remains or traces are found,” says Van Coller.
“However, ‘vaporisation’ is not an entirely accurate term to describe the effects of thermobaric explosions on the human body, as this term implies that the tissue is converted entirely into gas, leaving no physical remains.”
“The more appropriate term from forensic and medical literature is ‘incineration’, ‘fragmentation’, or ‘obliteration,’” he adds.
Incendiary weapons and white phosphorus
Incendiary weapons are another category that's been documented in Gaza.
“These munitions are designed primarily to set fire to objects or cause burn injuries to people through the action of flame, heat, or both, produced by a chemical reaction,” van Coller says.
“Common examples include napalm, thermite, and white phosphorus. These weapons contain chemicals that ignite and burn at extremely high temperatures for a prolonged period when deployed, thereby possibly causing secondary fires that spread to surrounding areas.”
“International humanitarian law places strict restrictions on the use of incendiary weapons, especially in populated areas, to protect civilians from their devastating effects.”
These restrictions emanate from Protocol III of the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons (CCW), which prohibits making civilians or civilian objects the target of attack using incendiary weapons in all circumstances.
Verified video footage and eyewitness accounts indicate that Israeli forces used white phosphorus during their genocide in Gaza and attacks on southern Lebanon in 2023.
The material showed repeated airbursts of artillery fired white phosphorus over the Gaza City port and rural areas near the Israel-Lebanon border, dispersing burning particles across wide areas.
When it comes into contact with skin, it causes severe burns that are difficult to treat and can continue burning deep into tissue. Survivors often face long-term medical complications.
Indiscriminate, disproportionate harm
Thermobaric weapons aren't banned entirely. But that doesn't mean using them is legal.
"Thermobaric weapons are not per se prohibited under international law," Van Coller says.
"However, their use must be evaluated against the principles of proportionality and distinction. This means assessing whether the attack is directed at a legitimate military target and whether the expected civilian harm is excessive in relation to the anticipated military advantage."
But here's the critical point that cannot be overstated: those principles about proportionality and unnecessary suffering only apply when you're targeting combatants.
Civilians should never be intentionally targeted at all. Van Coller emphasises that the legal framework for assessing "unnecessary suffering" assumes you're fighting other fighters, not bombing families in their homes.
When Israel drops these weapons on densely populated neighbourhoods where it knows families are sheltering, it's not a question of proportionality or distinction. It's deliberate harm against civilians.
That's a war crime, and part of Israel's ongoing genocide.
In theory, one could use thermobaric weapons legally against clear military targets if one can take precautions to protect civilians. In practice, it's nearly impossible to comply with those principles when you're dropping these bombs in densely populated cities.
Israel’s killing of more than 72,000 Palestinians, wounding of over 171,000 others, and widespread destruction of 90 percent of civilian infrastructure are already clear evidence that the principle of proportionality isn’t being followed.
Thousands of people are still missing, either buried under debris or reduced to traces so minimal they can't be identified.
These findings come despite the International Court of Justice ordering provisional measures and despite an arrest warrant from the International Criminal Court against Israel's prime minister.
The disappearance of bodies creates another problem for accountability. These weapons destroy physical evidence so completely that identifying victims, confirming how they died, and collecting proof of unlawful use becomes extremely difficult.
Van Coller poses what he describes as “the ultimate question" on the issue: “whether one method of harming humans with the use of a particular weapon, such as a thermobaric weapon, is inherently more inhumane and thus unacceptable, as opposed to the harm caused by another weapon, such as a conventional explosive weapon."

‘Breathe and Paint’: Palestinian girls paint messages of hope on Gaza beach despite war fallout
‘We want to do that not only through bloody and heartbreaking images, as was the case over past 2 years, but also through art,’ says workshop organizer
- Fear, loss, grief transformed into paintings, alongside visions of a life participants still hope to reclaim
GAZA CITY, Palestine
In a gesture of resilience and hope that rises above the aftermath of Israel’s two-year war on Gaza and the continued violations of the ceasefire agreement, Palestinian girls organized a seaside painting workshop in Gaza City.
The workshop, titled Breathe and Paint, was held on Thursday and underscored how the sea has become a place of refuge not only for artists, but for Palestinians seeking relief after enduring the genocidal war that began in October 2023.
Set against sunlight and gentle sea breezes, the initiative offered moments of calm and reflection, symbolizing life’s persistence despite attempts to extinguish it.
Anadolu attended the workshop, which took place at the fishing port west of Gaza City, away from areas devastated by Israeli attacks.
The event gave young Palestinian girls, many bearing deep psychological scars from the war, space to express emotions through art.
Using vivid colors, the participants momentarily set aside the trauma of war. Some painted Palestinian women in traditional dress, while others depicted the sea, the sun, and open horizons, reflecting hopes of renewal despite devastation.
Drawings of the map of Palestine and the national flag also featured prominently, painted by young girls as expressions of belonging and attachment to their homeland.
Israel targets art
During the genocidal war, Israeli forces destroyed major cultural and artistic landmarks across Gaza -- actions Palestinians say were aimed at erasing their cultural identity.
Among the destroyed sites was the Rashad Al-Shawa Cultural Center in Gaza City’s Rimal neighborhood, established in 1985.
Israeli attacks also killed dozens of Palestinian artists, including visual artist Heba Zaqout during the war’s first month, theater artist Durgham Qreiqa in March 2025, and standup comedian Mahmoud Shurrab, who was killed when his tent was struck in Khan Younis in June 2025.
Palestinian and international organizations, including UNESCO, repeatedly condemned the targeting of artists, but Tel Aviv has ignored these denunciations and continued its assaults.
A space to breathe
Participant Farah Ajjour said the sea offered rare emotional relief after two years of confinement under war.
“This workshop gave us a chance to release what we were holding inside,” she told Anadolu.
Amid gentle sea breezes brushing her weary face, she said life had been on pause and that she now longs to resume it.
She added: “After the cultural center in Gaza City was destroyed (by the Israeli army), we no longer had a place to practice art.”
Insisting on continuing with life, she said: “I want my voice to be heard through my art. There is no place where I can do that except the seashore; that’s why we are here today.”
Art as resistance
Workshop organizer Noura Al-Qassasiya said the initiative aimed to restore color to the lives of girls deprived of normalcy for more than two years.
“Art helps us communicate the harsh reality of the Israeli genocide,” she said, noting that reaching the location itself was difficult due to widespread destruction and displacement.
She explained that the sea was chosen because it remained untouched by bombardment.
“The people of Gaza love art,” she said. “We want to do that not only through bloody and heartbreaking images, as was the case over the past two years, but also through art.”
Participant Amal Darwish said painting finally allowed her to speak after years of silence.
“Through art, I found space to tell our story and express resistance,” she said, adding that her greatest wish was for life to return “in bright colors.”
Throughout the workshop, fear, loss, and grief were transformed into paintings, alongside visions of a life participants still hope to reclaim.
The Oct. 10, 2025 ceasefire agreement ended Israel’s two-year war that began on Oct. 8, 2023. Palestinian authorities say the conflict killed more than 72,000 Palestinians, wounded over 171,000 others, and caused widespread destruction affecting 90% of civilian infrastructure. The UN estimates reconstruction costs at approximately $70 billion.
At least 591 Palestinians have been killed and over 1,578 others injured in Israeli attacks since the ceasefire, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry.

Kobi Farhi was probably the only Jewish kid in Jaffa who liked hearing the muezzin's call. Five times a day, his attention would lock onto the voice booming from the mosque minaret, summoning the faithful to prayer. Sometimes he would even join in, quietly muttering "Allahu Akbar." Years later, when he headed a successful metal band, this childhood fascination turned into an odd obsession: He wanted to record himself singing the muezzin's call – preferably from high atop a minaret.

Zelenskyy Calls For Strong Security Guarantees Against 'Slave To War' Putin

22:13:21 KST

MUNICH - Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy delivered an impassioned plea for more Western weapons and for "real security guarantees," calling Russian President Vladimir Putin a "slave to war" who will threaten Europe if he is not stopped in Ukraine.
In a midday speech at the Munich Security Conference on February 14, Zelenskyy said he hopes a new round of trilateral talks with Russia and the United States next week will be productive, but suggested that US pressure for concessions is often aimed mainly at Kyiv and Russia has shown few signs it is ready for compromise.
"No one in Ukraine believes [Putin] will ever let our people go, but he will not let other European nations go either, because he cannot let go of the very idea of war," Zelenskyy said. "He may see himself as a tsar, but in reality he is a slave to war."
Nearly Four Years Of Ukraine War
Zelenskyy's speech came 10 days before Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, which set off the deadliest war in Europe since 1945, reaches the four-year mark and the casualty toll on the two sides taken together climbs toward 2 million soldiers killed, wounded, or missing.
In addition, Russia has killed thousands of Ukrainian civilians and pounded the country's energy infrastructure on a near-daily basis. "There is not a single power plant in Ukraine that is not damaged by Russian strikes."
With US President Donald Trump seeking to broker peace since he returned to office in January 2025, Zelenskyy repeated that strong security guarantees for Kyiv are a crucial element of any agreement.
"There must be real security guarantees for Ukraine and for Europe, strong security guarantees." He said that Ukraine is ready to sign security-guarantee deals with the US and Europe and that these should "come before any agreement to end the war."
"We hope President Trump hears us. We hope the Congress hears us. We hope American people hear us," said Zelenskyy, who wants an agreement on security guarantees to be ratified by the US Congress and met with a group of US senators in Munich.
Zelenskyy met with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio later in the day on the sidelines of the annual conference, which no high-level Russian official has attended since Putin launched the full-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022.
In his own speech and other comments earlier on February 14, Rubio said that "the issues to end the war have been narrowed, but the bad news is that now it's down to the hardest questions."
Rubio said he does not expect Russia to achieve its initial war objectives, which are widely understood to have included subjugating Ukraine, and that “now it’s largely narrowed down to their desire to take [the] 20 percent of Donetsk they don't currently possess.”
Putin and other Russian officials have repeatedly said that Moscow will capture the rest of the Donetsk region – one of two provinces that make up the Donbas, by force or though diplomacy.
Zelenskyy pointed to the massive losses Russia has sustained in that effort, saying "on the Donetsk front the price Russia pays for one kilometer is 156 soldiers." He said 35,000 Russian soldiers were killed or badly wounded in December and 30,000 in January.
"Putin is not concerned about this now, but there is a level at which he will start to care. Every month Russia mobilizes about 40,000 people," Zelenskyy said. "For our army the mission is clear: destroy more Russian occupiers. The goal is at least 50,000 per month."
Russia is now "losing much more [manpower] than they can refill," Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof told RFE/RL in Munich. He said Western countries should "speed up" deliveries of air defenses and other weapons, and that he hopes "Ukrainian forces will be able to push back Russia more" in the near future.
With a third round of US-Ukraine-Russia talks set to be held in Geneva on February 17-18, Zelenskyy said Kyiv hopes the meetings "will be serious, substantive, helpful for all us," but added that "honestly sometimes it feels like the sides are talking about completely different things."
Russia repeats demands that are unacceptable to Kyiv, he suggested, while "the Americans often return to the topic of concessions, and too often those concessions are discussed in the context only of Ukraine, not Russia. Europe is practically not present at the table. This is a big mistake, to my mind."
At times over the past year, Trump has blamed Kyiv for a lack of progress toward peace. "Russia wants to make a deal and Zelenskyy's going to have to get moving, otherwise he's going to miss a great opportunity," he hold journalists outside the White House on February 13.
Zelenskyy said on social media late on February 14 that he he had spoken by phone with the lead US negotiators.
"I had a conversation with envoys of President Trump, Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, ahead of the trilateral meetings in Geneva. We count on the meetings being truly productive," he said.
Speaking to RFE/RL on the sidelines of the Munich conference, British Defense Minister John Healey said that "Ukraine is under strong pressure but Ukrainians are fighting...with extraordinary defiance and courage just as [they]showed four years ago when Putin first invaded."
"The world should remember that this is a war Putin thought he would win in a week," and almost four years later, with Russia is suffering "huge losses, he is under huge pressure," Healey said. "Our job is to step up further for Ukraine with the aid we can give and to step up further the pressure on Putin to bring him the negotiation table."
The Dutch prime minister also said that "Europe and the US should put pressure on Putin to stop the war."
"I don't see any political will and intention [to make peace] on the part of President Putin," Schoof told RFE/RL, adding that "so far, it only looks like he is trying to win time."

Gaza committee says statements on handing over institutions pave way for managing transition
Media office in enclave renewed call for NCAG to begin carrying out its duties
CAIRO
The National Committee for the Administration of Gaza (NCAG) said on Saturday that statements by the Gaza administration regarding readiness to hand over all public institutions pave the way for enabling the body to fully assume its responsibilities in managing the transitional phase.
In a statement, the committee, which was formed after the October ceasefire in the Gaza Strip, said it “views the recent expression of readiness for an orderly transition as a pivotal step in fulfilling its mandate as the transitional administration of Gaza.”
Gaza's media office on Thursday renewed its call for the national committee to begin carrying out its duties. Hamas has also repeatedly announced readiness to facilitate the committee’s work.
“We emphasize that full administrative, civilian, and police control by the NCAG is not merely procedural; it NCAG cannot be expected to carry responsibility without the full administrative, civilian, and police powers necessary to implement its mandate effectively,” said the statement.
The readout, however, did not specify when the committee would begin operating from Gaza. The NCAG earlier announced it started its work from Cairo in mid-January.
The entry of committee members into Gaza requires field and security coordination through crossings controlled by Israel. No official position has yet been issued by the body, explaining the delay in its entry, and Israel has not commented on the matter.
The committee said that enabling it to operate efficiently and independently in Gaza would “unlock international support for recovery, reconstruction, secure a complete Israeli withdrawal, and restore normal daily life.”
The committee also called on mediators and all parties concerned to “to intensify efforts to resolve outstanding issues without delay,” stressing that the Palestinian people “cannot afford more time lost; we must move now to ensure a smooth and credible transition.”
The Oct. 10 ceasefire agreement ended Israel’s two-year war that began on Oct. 8, 2023. Palestinian authorities say the conflict killed more than 72,000 Palestinians, wounded over 171,000 others and caused widespread destruction affecting 90% of civilian infrastructure. The UN estimates reconstruction costs at approximately $70 billion.
At least 591 Palestinians also have been killed and over 1,578 others injured in Israeli attacks since the ceasefire, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry.

Bangladesh's Tarique Rahman pledges to work for democracy after landslide victory in election
Bangladesh’s incoming leader says he will work to build a more democratic country, overcoming challenges related to weak institutions
- Bookmark
Bangladesh’s incoming leader said Saturday that he would work to build a more democratic country, overcoming challenges related to weak institutions after his party secured an election victory.
Tarique Rahman's Bangladesh Nationalist Party won a majority in Thursday’s election in the 350-member Parliament. An 11-member alliance led by the Jamaat-e-Islami party, the country’s largest Islamist party, is poised to form the opposition.
It was the first election since the ouster of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in a mass uprising in 2024. An interim government headed by Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus oversaw the largely peaceful election. The voting marked a significant political shift in the South Asian nation of more than 170 million people.
The new government is expected to take the oath in days.
In his first press meeting in the capital, Dhaka, Rahman said that his priorities would be to improve law and order and handle a fragile economy.
“We are about to begin our journey in a situation marked by a fragile economy left behind by the authoritarian regime, weakened constitutional and statutory institutions, and a deteriorating law and order situation,” he told reporters.
Rahman, son of former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, who died in December, also urged unity, promising that he would not undermine the country.
“To ensure that no evil force can reestablish autocracy in the country, and to ensure that the nation is not turned into a subservient state, we must remain united and uphold the will of the people,” he said.
The BNP is one of the country’s longstanding political forces alongside Hasina’s now-banned Awami League party. Hasina has been accused of increasingly becoming authoritarian during her 15-year rule. In recent years, the BNP refused to take part in the election under Hasina. She has been in exile in India since her ouster and has been convicted of crimes against humanity involving hundreds of deaths during the weekslong uprising.

Global warming hits 1st tipping point as security risks rise, senior officials warn at Munich Security Conference
'Top 10 threats to economy, 5 of them were ecological,' says German environment minister
ISTANBUL
The world has already crossed a critical climate threshold with potentially irreversible consequences, experts warned at the Munich Security Conference on Saturday, saying global warming is rapidly becoming a central driver of instability, economic disruption, and security threats.
Speaking at a panel, titled Degrees of Instability: Climate Security in a Warming World, Mads Flarup Christensen, executive director of Greenpeace International, said the planet has entered a dangerous phase.
“We passed the first tipping point officially,” he told participants, adding: “We are in the danger zone now.”
Christensen warned that the world is approaching systemic environmental shifts that could disrupt ecosystems and societies, including the loss of major natural systems.
“If that's not security, what is?” he asked, arguing that climate risks must be treated as a top-tier strategic threat.
Moderator Erin Sikorsky, director of the Center for Climate and Security, said the planet is already moving beyond key warming limits.
“We're already heading into a world past 1.5 degrees of warming,” she said, warning that this would bring “greater instability, more extreme weather events … coming more frequently and more intensely than ever before.”
She added that such impacts are already affecting security systems worldwide, noting that “militaries around the world (are) deployed to respond to climate disasters,” while competition over food and water resources is intensifying geopolitical tensions.
Indian Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman stressed that climate shocks are already disrupting communities and livelihoods, particularly in vulnerable regions.
“We have to look at saving climate … and equally, saving communities,” she said, adding that climate volatility is also affecting defense readiness. “Our warfare and our soldiers and our equipments will have to be adept at all these places, climate change is disrupting even that.”
German Environment Minister Carsten Schneider said ecological threats are now among the world’s leading risks.
“Top 10 threats to the economy, five of them were ecological,” he said, describing climate change as “a threat to our growth, to the livelihood of the people, and the security issues.”
US Senator Sheldon Whitehouse warned that climate impacts are already triggering financial strain, particularly through insurance markets withdrawing coverage from high-risk areas.
“The insurance industry in America (is) leaving entire states,” he said, cautioning that this could mark “the opening stage of an economic cascade … to recession.”

Police set up national group to deal with UK-related Epstein allegations

British police have set up a new national group to deal with allegations that Jeffrey Epstein’s trafficking of women had ties to Britain, as well as claims against his associates, such as Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor.
At least three British police forces are dealing with allegations triggered by the revelations about Epstein and his associates in documents released in the US, with more claims of wrongdoing expected by police officials.
A national committee to coordinate the police operations met this week and is scheduled to meet again next week. The group includes police experts on sexual offending and is chaired by a gold commander, Louisa Rolfe, who was previously a Metropolitan police assistant commissioner.
One senior policing source said a “tsunami” of allegations was expected as a result of the release of millions of papers relating to Jeffrey Epstein, the disgraced financier who trafficked women and had a network of powerful friends.
The forces involved include Thames Valley police, which are assessing two separate claims against Mountbatten-Windsor and whether they merit a full criminal investigation, and Surrey police, which are assessing another allegation against the former prince.
Mountbatten-Windsor has denied all wrongdoing.
The Met, which is also part of the group, is criminally investigating Peter Mandelson for allegedly passing information to Epstein while a Labour government minister.
Bedfordshire police were unable to say whether they were assessing claims that Luton airport, which is in the force’s area, was used by planes linked to Epstein to traffic women.
Similarly, Essex police could not say whether they were assessing claims that Stansted airport had been used for such flights, with the former British prime minister Gordon Brown saying police should take action.
A spokesperson for the National Police Chiefs’ Council said: “A national coordination group has been set up to support a small number of forces assessing allegations that have emerged following the publication of the US DoJ [Department of Justice] Epstein files.
“We continue to work collaboratively to assess the details being made public to allow us to understand any potential impact arising from the millions of documents that have been published.”
The national coordination group is a measure similar to that set up to deal with the explosion in sexual abuse allegations triggered by the Jimmy Savile scandal more than a decade ago. It is intended to avoid duplication in the handling of allegations involving the same individuals.
Part of the group’s role is to make formal approaches to obtain the original unredacted documents from the US, rather than each police force having to make separate requests.
As yet, it is not a national investigation and each force retains operation control. A source with knowledge of discussions said: “It is not a national operation, but it is heading in that direction. The feeling in policing is this is going to grow arms and legs.”
The latest release of documents from the Epstein files a fortnight ago led to new revelations.
The Thames Valley assessment covers claims that Mountbatten-Windsor used his position as a British trade envoy to potentially give sensitive information to Epstein. Claims that the former prince used his position as a British trade envoy to pass potentially sensitive information to Epstein are being examined by the force.
They are also examining a claim that Epstein sent a second woman to the UK for sex with the former prince in Windsor in 2010.
Another police source warned that the avalanche of allegations and revelations in the news media might not be enough to prompt full criminal investigations, let alone bring prosecutions: “Andrew may be a barefaced liar, but that does not mean he committed a criminal offence.”
The Met has twice looked at sexual abuse allegations against Mountbatten-Windsor and decided they did not merit a full investigation.
A spokesperson for Surrey police said: “A number of police forces are currently assessing allegations that have emerged following the publication of the FBI Epstein files.
“As a result, nationally, policing is seeking access to unredacted versions of the material to enable a full and independent assessment of the information released. This will allow all forces to understand any potential impact arising from the millions of documents that have been made publicly available.”

ST. PETERSBURG, February 14. /TASS/. Vladimir Zelensky's statements have long been ravings of a sick person and an indicator he is not in his right mind, Russian Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova has told the media.
"What Zelensky is saying can no longer be called statements. It’s ravings of a sick person, a sign of deranged mentality," she said, commenting on Zelensky's statements about postponing elections in Ukraine indefinitely. "There's vast evidence to this effect."
"First he's urging everyone to organize the electoral process, and then in a split second he either changes his mind or postpones them. It's impossible to tell what this all about," Zakharova added.
She also noted that it's no longer surprising how the Kiev regime is torturing Ukraine: "We've already realized this; we've long seen how they ruined Ukraine's statehood.".

Zelensky: US too often demands concessions from Ukraine, not Russia
He made the remarks during a speech at the Munich Security Conference, Ukrinform reports.
"We truly hope that the trilateral meetings next week will be serious, substantive, helpful for all of us. But honestly, sometimes it feels like the sides are talking about completely different things. The Russians often speak about some spirit of Anchorage and we can only guess what they really mean. The Americans often return to the topic of concessions and too often those concessions are discussed in the context only of Ukraine, not Russia," Zelensky said.
He also noted that Europe is practically absent from the negotiation table. "It's a big mistake to my mind," he added.
According to Zelensky, Ukraine is making every effort to achieve a genuine peace. This is the focus of the entire peace process, including today's planned meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio.
Meanwhile, the Russians, he said, are hoping for a repeat of the "Munich conspiracy."
"It seems Putin hopes to repeat Munich and not Munich 2007 when they only spoke about dividing Europe, but Munich 1938 when previous Putin began dividing Europe in reality. It would be an illusion to believe that this war can now be reliably ended by dividing Ukraine," Zelensky said.
As reported, the next round of trilateral talks between Ukraine, the U.S., and Russia is scheduled for February 17-18 in Geneva.

Tarique Rahman, chairperson of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) that won a two-thirds majority in the recently held general elections, on Saturday called for national unity to rebuild the South Asian country.
The BNP, which secured a landslide victory on Thursday election with 209 seats in the 300-seat parliament, is set form a government with Rahman to become prime minister.
The Jamaat-e-Islami-led alliance won 77 seats and will sit on opposition benches, while the Awami League party of Sheikh Hasina, whose government was ousted in 2024 after student protests and a crackdown that killed 1,400 people, was barred from taking part.
"We are taking office at a time when we have to start our journey through a fragile economy, ineffective constitutional institutions, and weak law and order situation left by a fascist regime. However, if the people's strength is with us, no obstacle can stop us," Rahman said in his first address since Thursday's election.
‘Bangladeshi interests’
Asked about foreign policy, he said they do not have any country-centric policy, saying it will be decided based on "Bangladeshi interests."
"National unity is our strength, division is our weakness," he said, urging everyone to stay united.
"This victory belongs to democracy, this victory belongs to Bangladesh, this victory belongs to the democracy-loving people of the country. From today, we are free."
“We will not tolerate any kind of injustice or illegal activities. Regardless of party, opinion, religion, ethnicity, or differing views, we will not accept any attack by the strong against the weak under any pretext,” he said.

Navalny died after being poisoned with dart frog toxin by Russia, UK says
Britain and its allies said only Russia would have the ‘means, motive and disregard’ to launch such an attack – as his widow calls for Putin to be held accountable

Putin arch-rival Alexei Navalny died after being poisoned with a lethal toxin and Russia is to blame for the attack, Britain and its European allies have said.
In a dramatic press conference held at the Munich Security Conference on Saturday, the UK, France, Germany, Sweden and the Netherlands said that analysis of samples from Navalny’s body had found the presence of epibatidine – a deadly toxin found in poison dart frogs in South America.
After the findings were announced by Navalny’s widow Yulia Navalnaya, foreign secretary Yvette Cooper pinned the blame squarely on the Kremlin and said only Russia had the “means, motive and opportunity” to carry out such an attack.

She said: “Today, beside his widow, the UK is shining a light on the Kremlin’s barbaric plot to silence his voice. Russia saw Navalny as a threat. By using this form of poison, the Russian state demonstrated the despicable tools it has at its disposal and the overwhelming fear it has of political opposition.”
The five countries said Russia had shown a “repeated disregard for international law” and that they had reported the poisoning to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.
The Kremlin has rejected the claims, with Russian foreign ministry Maria Zakharova telling TASS: "When the test results are available and the formulas for the substances are disclosed, we will comment accordingly.
“Until then, all such assertions are merely propaganda aimed at diverting attention from pressing Western issues," the news agency cited her as saying. The report also said she described Navalny as a blogger "officially designated as a terrorist and extremist in Russia".
Meanwhile, prime minister Sir Keir Starmer said Mr Navalny “displayed huge courage in the face of tyranny”.
He added: “His determination to expose the truth has left an enduring legacy, and my thoughts are with his family today. I am doing whatever it takes to defend our people, our values and our way of life from the threat of Russia and Putin’s murderous intent.”
After the press conference, Ms Navalnaya called for Vladimir Putin to be “held accountable”. She wrote: “I was certain from the first day that my husband had been poisoned, but now there is proof: Putin killed Alexei with chemical weapon.”
Ms Navalnaya previously announced her husband’s death at the same gathering, two years ago. The Kremlin has always denied any involvement.
Navalny, a thorn in the side of the Kremlin who crusaded against official corruption and staged massive anti-Putin protests, died in a penal colony in Siberia in February 2024, aged 47. The former lawyer had been serving a 19-year sentence on charges he believed to be politically motivated.
It is not clear how the frog poison was allegedly administered to Navalny. But the allies also pointed to an attempt to poison Navalny with the nerve agent novichok in 2020, which followed the Salisbury poisonings in 2018.
Ms Navalnaya said last year that two independent labs had found that her husband was poisoned shortly before his death. It had been widely assumed that Navalny had been poisoned by the Russian state, but evidence of the specific poison in his body, along with the statement by the European countries, is a new development.
In her statement, she added: “I am grateful to the European states for the meticulous work they carried out over two years, and for uncovering the truth. Vladimir Putin is a murderer. He must be held accountable for all his crimes.”
The Foreign Office said there can be no innocent explanation for the toxin having been found on Navalny’s body.
Ms Cooper added: “Since Yulia Navalnaya announced the loss of her husband here in Munich two years ago, the UK has pursued the truth of Alexei Navalny’s death with fierce determination. Only the Russian government had the means, motive and opportunity to deploy this lethal toxin against Alexei Navalny during his imprisonment in Russia.”
Navalny’s death came after Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia were poisoned with novichok in July 2018. Last year, a major inquiry into the poisonings found that Putin had ordered the “astonishingly reckless” attempted assassination of Mr Skripal as a “public demonstration of Russian power”.
The report also said the Russian president was “morally responsible” for the death of Dawn Sturgess, an innocent bystander who died after being exposed to the chemical weapon after it was left in a discarded perfume bottle.
Russia was also responsible for the assassination of former spy Alexander Litvinenko in the UK, according to the European Court of Human Rights. The 43-year-old, who had worked for the Russian security services before defecting to the UK, died after drinking green tea laced with poison in London in 2006.
The joint statement by the five countries said they are “confident that Alexei Navalny was poisoned with a lethal toxin”.
It added: “This is the conclusion of our governments based on analyses of samples from Alexei Navalny. These analyses have conclusively confirmed the presence of epibatidine. Epibatidine is a toxin found in poison dart frogs in South America. It is not found naturally in Russia.
“Russia claimed that Navalny died of natural causes. But given the toxicity of epibatidine and reported symptoms, poisoning was highly likely the cause of his death. Navalny died while held in prison, meaning Russia had the means, motive and opportunity to administer this poison to him.”

U.S. military hits 30 ISIS targets in Syria

U.S. strikes 30 ISIS targets in Syria as it continues "relentless military pressure" on terrorist network
Ten U.S. military strikes in Syria hit more than 30 Islamic State targets in Syria earlier this month, as it continues "relentless military pressure" on the terrorist network there, U.S. Central Command announced Saturday.
CENTCOM, which oversees U.S. military operations in the Middle East, said U.S. forces hit ISIS infrastructures and weapons storage targets between Feb. 3 and Feb. 12.
The strikes were part of Operation Hawkeye Strike, which was launched in retaliation for an ISIS ambush that killed Sgt. Edgar Brian Torres-Tovar, Sgt. William Nathaniel Howard and an interpreter in Palmyra, Syria, on Dec. 13.
President Trump vowed "very serious retaliation" in a Truth Social post after the ambush.
On Dec. 19, the U.S. launched airstrikes against ISIS targets in Syria in retaliation. More than 70 targets were hit in those strikes, a U.S. official told CBS News at the time.
In January, U.S. forces killed Bilal Hasan al-Jasim, who authorities said was a leader affiliated with Al-Qaeda, allegedly directly connected with the ISIS gunman accused of the deadly ambush.
"The death of a terrorist operative linked to the deaths of three Americans demonstrates our resolve in pursuing terrorists who attack our forces," Central Command Commander Adm. Brad Cooper said in a statement at the time. "There is no safe place for those who conduct, plot, or inspire attacks on American citizens and our warfighters. We will find you."
More than 50 ISIS terrorists have been killed or captured and more than 100 ISIS infrastructure targets have been hit during the operation, CENTCOM said on Saturday.
On Friday, U.S. military forces completed the transfer of thousands of ISIS detainees from Syria to Iraq, where they are expected to stand trial in the future.
CENTCOM said that the transfer that began on Jan. 21 saw U.S. forces transporting more than 5,700 adult male ISIS suspects from detention facilities in Syria to Iraqi custody.
The prisoners were transferred to Iraq at the request of Baghdad — a move welcomed by the U.S.-led coalition that had for years fought against ISIS.
"We appreciate Iraq's leadership and recognition that transferring the detainees is essential to regional security," Cooper said.
It's not clear if any of the prisoners have been charged with specific crimes or even been confirmed as ISIS members.

US, Europe belong together, Rubio reassures allies in Munich

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Saturday offered a reassuring message to European allies, saying Washington wanted to recharge the transatlantic alliance so Europe could help the U.S.’ mission of global “renewal”, after more than a year of President Donald Trump’s often-hostile rhetoric toward traditional allies.
Speaking at a security conference in Munich after months of turmoil in U.S.-European relations sparked by Trump's vows to seize Greenland and his often derisive remarks about U.S. allies, Washington's top diplomat struck a markedly soothing tone.
"We do not seek to separate, but to revitalize an old friendship and renew the greatest civilization in human history," Rubio said, calling for "a reinvigorated alliance."
"We want Europe to be strong," Rubio said, adding that the continent and the U.S. "belong together."
He echoed Trump administration's oft-stated assertion that immigration posed a threat, saying that "mass migration" was "a crisis which is transforming and destabilizing societies all across the West."
He said that Europe and the U.S. were "heirs to the same great and noble civilization" and that he hoped Europe "together with us are willing and able to defend it."
Aside from immigration, Rubio otherwise largely avoided the MAGA flashpoint and culture war issues that German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said Friday, had deepened a "rift" between U.S. and Europe.
Rubio's speech marked a sharp contrast to that of U.S. Vice President JD Vance a year ago, when he used the same stage to attack European policies on a range of issues including free speech, shocking European allies.
U.S.-Europe ties were further strained by the new U.S. National Security Strategy, which launched an unprecedented attack against Europeans, charging that the continent was threatened with "civilizational decline" and by the Trump administration's courting of far-right parties.
Ties plunged last month when Trump stepped up threats to annex Greenland, an autonomous territory of NATO member Denmark, forcing European nations to stand firm in protest.
Rubio was on Sunday due to travel to Slovakia and Hungary, European countries run by nationalist leaders endorsed by Trump.
Some breathed a sigh of relief following Rubio's speech, with Estonia's Defence Minister Hanno Pevkur telling AFP "it was needed to show that we are still allies and partners."
But others said they did not mark a shift in the U.S. stance, with former Lithuanian foreign minister Gabrielius Landsbergis saying "it was simply delivered in more polite terms. I am not sure the white paint will hold."
European leaders at the Munich Security Conference have pledged to shoulder more of the burden of shared NATO defenses, saying this was essential for Europe to counter a hostile Russia.
European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen told the gathering on Saturday that "Europe needs to step up and has to take on its responsibility" for its security, including closer ties with Britain 10 years after Brexit.
British leader Keir Starmer echoed the sentiment, saying "We must build our hard power, because that is the currency of the age," calling for a building of "a shared industrial base across Europe which can turbocharge our defence production".
The high-powered Munich meeting of government leaders, diplomats, defence and intelligence chiefs comes shortly before Russia's full-scale war on Ukraine is set to enter its fifth grueling year.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky decried that political efforts to end the war have not worked.
"Weapons evolve faster than political decisions meant to stop them," he said, calling for speedier arms deliveries for Ukraine's Western-supplied air defence systems.
"No one in Ukraine believes (Russian President Vladimir Putin) will ever let our people go, but he will not let other European nations go either, because he cannot let go of the very idea of war," Zelensky warned.
At the White House on Friday, Trump urged Kyiv to "get moving" to end the war. "Russia wants to make a deal... He has to move," the U.S. leader said.
But Rubio said on Saturday that "We don't know if the Russians are serious about ending the war."
Rubio renewed the Trump administration's criticism of the United Nations, saying that "it has no answers and has played virtually no role" on the most pressing conflicts like the wars in Ukraine and Gaza.

How Jeffrey Epstein used the glamour of the Nobel Peace Prize to entice his global network of elites

How Epstein leveraged the Nobel Peace Prize to connect with the world’s most powerful
The ex-chair of the Nobel Peace Prize committee appears hundreds of times in the files
- Bookmark
Jeffrey Epstein repeatedly emphasized his connections to the former head of the Nobel Peace Prize committee when communicating with elites such as Richard Branson, Larry Summers, Bill Gates and Steve Bannon, according to the newly released Epstein files.
Thorbjørn Jagland, who led the Norwegian Nobel Committee from 2009 to 2015, appears hundreds of times in the millions of documents about Epstein, released last month by the U.S. Justice Department.
Since the release, the 75-year-old Jagland has been charged in Norway with “aggravated corruption,” the economic crime unit of Norwegian police Økokrim said. The investigation is examining whether gifts, travel or loans were linked to Jagland’s position. Økokrim searched his Oslo residence on Thursday, along with properties in Risør and Rauland.
His attorneys at Elden law firm in Norway said Jagland denies the charges, and was questioned by the police unit on Thursday.
While there is no evidence in the documents seen so far of any outright lobbying for the Nobel Peace Prize, Epstein repeatedly played up hosting Jagland at his properties in New York and Paris in the 2010s.
From an ‘interesting’ guest to subject of banter with Bannon
In September 2018, during Trump’s first term and in an apparent allusion to his interest in the peace prize, Epstein had a varied text-message exchange with Bannon, at one point writing — in one of many messages with untidy grammar: “donalds head would explode if he knew you were now buds with the guy who on monday will decide the nobel peace prize.”
“I told him next year it should be you when we settle china,” he added, without elaborating.
In one email from 2013, mixing in investment tips and praise for PR tips, Epstein told British entrepreneur and magnate Richard Branson that Jagland would be staying with Epstein in September that year, adding: “if you are there, you might find him interesting.”
A year after she left a job as White House counsel to President Barack Obama, in 2015, Kathy Ruemmler got an email from Epstein saying: "head of nobel peace prize coming to visit, want to join?"
In 2012, Epstein wrote former Treasury Secretary and Harvard University president Larry Summers about Jagland, saying “head of the nobel peace prize staying with me, if you have any interest.”
In that exchange, Epstein referred to Jagland — also a former Norwegian prime minister and former head of the Council of Europe, a human rights body — as “not bright” but someone who offered a “unique perspective.”
The financier wrote Bill Gates in 2014, saying that Jagland had been reelected as head of the Council of Europe.
“That is good,” the Microsoft co-founder and the world's former richest man, wrote. “I guess his peace prize committee job is also up in the air?”
During Jagland's tenure as chair of the committee, it gave the peace prize to Obama in 2009 and the European Union in 2012.
Jagland was brought into Epstein’s orbit by Terje Rød Larsen, a Norwegian diplomat who helped broker the Oslo Peace Accords between Israel and Palestinians. Larsen and wife are also facing corruption charges in Norway due to their association with Epstein.

Russia killed Alexei Navalny with frog toxin, UK and four European allies say

Alexei Navalny, the Russian opposition leader, was killed by dart frog poison administered by the Russian state two years ago, a multi-intelligence agency inquiry has found, according to a statement released by five countries, the UK, France, Germany, Sweden and the Netherlands.
The US was not one of the intelligence agencies making the claim.
Navalny died in a remote Arctic penal colony where he was serving a 19-year sentence. Samples from his body were secured before his burial and sent to the laboratories of two countries.
The UK, describing the poisoning as barbaric, said it would be reporting Russia to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, as a flagrant violation by Russia of the chemical weapons convention (CWC).
The intelligence agencies claimed laboratory testing found that the deadly toxin in the skin of Ecuador dart frogs (epibatidine) was found in samples from Navalny’s body and probably resulted in his death.
The statement adds: “Only the Russian state had the means, motive and opportunity to deploy this lethal toxin to target Navalny during his imprisonment in a Russian penal colony in Siberia, and we hold it responsible for his death.”
“Epibatidine can be found naturally in dart frogs in the wild in South America. Dart frogs in captivity do not produce this toxin and it is not found naturally in Russia. There is no innocent explanation for its presence in Navalny’s body.”
Although it had been widely assumed that Navalny had been poisoned by the Russian state, the evidence of the specific poison in his body is a new development. His wife, Yulia Navalny, posted in September that there was evidence of poison in his body at the time an autopsy was conducted.
Yulia wrote in a post on X that the named poison “causes paralysis, respiratory arrest, and a painful death. I was certain from the first day that my husband had been poisoned, but now there is proof: Putin killed Alexei with [a] chemical weapon. I am grateful to the European states for the meticulous work they carried out over two years and for uncovering the truth. Vladimir Putin is a murderer. He must be held accountable for all his crimes.”
The Kremlin has a long history of using poison as a weapon against its enemies. The death of Alexander Litvinenko in London from radioactive polonium in 2006, the nerve agent attack on the former spy Sergei Skripal in Salisbury in 2018, and a previous poisoning attempt on Navalny have cemented Russia’s reputation for resorting to toxins to silence critics and defectors.
The Foreign Office, which oversees the intelligence agencies, said it has pursued the truth of Navalny’s death with partners from Sweden, France, the Netherlands and Germany. The UK added: “We know the Russian state now used this lethal toxin to target Navalny in fear of his opposition.”
The release of the information during the Munich Security Conference was designed to remind everyone that Russia announced the news of Navalny’s death just as the conference convened two years ago.
His wife, after some hesitation, made a short address to the conference in 2024 saying: “I would like Putin and all his staff, everybody around him, his government, his friends, I want them to know that they will be punished for what they have done with our country. With my family and with my husband, they will be brought to justice. And this day will come soon.”
The UK foreign secretary, Yvette Cooper, said: “Only the Russian government had the means, motive and opportunity to deploy this lethal toxin against Alexei Navalny during his imprisonment in Russia.
“Today, beside his widow, the UK is shining a light on the Kremlin’s barbaric plot to silence his voice.
“Russia saw Navalny as a threat. By using this form of poison the Russian state demonstrated the despicable tools it has at its disposal and the overwhelming fear it has of political opposition.”
The UK has led the way in trying to expose what it regards as nefarious Russian suppression of the regime’s opponents using poison, including the attempted killing of the UK agent Sergei Skripal with novichok on the streets of Salisbury in 2018. The UK has also led claims about Russian troops’ frequent use of chemical weapons on the battlefield in Ukraine.
In its statement the UK said it was clear Russia did not destroy all its chemical weapons as claimed in 2017, and that it has not renounced biological weapons, as it is obliged to under the biological and toxin weapons convention.

Exiled son of Iran’s last shah calls on Trump to help ‘bury’ the Islamic Republic

Exiled son of Iran’s last shah calls on Trump to help ‘bury’ the Islamic Republic
Pahlavi’s appeal at Munich conference comes as Trump sends second aircraft carrier to Middle East, says regime change would be ‘best thing’
MUNICH, Germany — The exiled son of Iran’s last shah called on US President Donald Trump on Saturday to help the Iranian people “bury” the current regime and said it was “time to end the Islamic Republic.”
The opposition figure has urged Iranians at home and abroad to continue demonstrations against the authorities, calling on them to chant slogans from their homes and rooftops at 8:00 pm on Saturday and Sunday, to coincide with protests in Germany and elsewhere.
“To President Trump… The Iranian people heard you say help is on the way, and they have faith in you. Help them,” the US-based Reza Pahlavi told reporters at the Munich Security Conference.
Trump had said Friday that a change of government in Iran would be the “best thing that could happen,” as he sent a second aircraft carrier to the Middle East to ratchet up military pressure on the Islamic Republic.
He had earlier threatened military intervention to support a wave of street protests in Iran that peaked in January and were met by a violent crackdown. The verified death toll has passed 7,000, with many more still feared dead.
The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency — which offered the latest figure of 7,005 people killed, including 214 government forces — has been accurate in counting deaths during previous rounds of unrest in Iran and relies on a network of activists in the country to verify deaths.
Pahlavi, who has not returned to Iran since before the 1979 Islamic revolution that ousted the monarchy, said in Munich: “It is time to end the Islamic Republic. This is the demand echoing from the bloodshed of my compatriots who are not asking us to fix the regime but to help them bury it.”
Pahlavi had encouraged Iranians to join the wave of protests, which Iranian authorities have said were hijacked by “terrorists” fueled by their sworn enemies, the United States and Israel.
“In this spirit, I invite you, on the evenings of February 14 and 15 at 8 p.m., to raise your voices and chant from your homes and rooftops. Shout your demands. Show your unity. With an unbreakable will, we will prevail over this occupying regime,” he said.
Many protest chants had called for the monarchy’s return, and Pahlavi, 65, has said he is ready to lead a democratic transition.
The Iranian opposition remains divided, and Pahlavi has faced criticism for his support for Israel, making a highly publicized visit in 2023 that fractured an attempt to unify opposition camps. He has also never distanced himself from his father’s autocratic rule.

EU countries should fear officials in Brussels, not eastern neighbors — Hungarian PM

BUDAPEST, February 14. /TASS/. European Union member states should worry less about their eastern neighbors and more about EU leaders and officials in Brussels, as that is where the real threat to their sovereignty and independence comes from, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said.
"Those who value freedom should fear Brussels, not the countries of the East, they should be wary of Brussels," Orban said during a traditional speech in Budapest addressing the past year’s political results and the government’s plans for the near future. According to the prime minister, "Brussels is the real source of danger," because it seeks to take sovereign governments under its control.
Orban noted that the previous US administration under President Joe Biden interfered in Hungary’s internal affairs in a manner similar to the EU leadership today. The situation changed after the election of current President Donald Trump. "After his return to office, we agreed that Hungarians would walk down the main street of history again, while their opponents would be on the dirty side alley. And that is exactly what happened," Orban said.
"However, only half the work is done. Brussels’ repressive machine is still operating. Bribed politicians, journalists, judges - that is how Brussels acts today," he added. Orban recalled that European censorship was raised as an issue even during hearings in US Congress. He emphasized that his government would not tolerate it.

El Paso Airspace Shutdown Is ‘Case Study’ in Complexity of Counter-Drone Ops: Experts

The use of a military counter-drone laser on the southwest border this week—which prompted the Federal Aviation Administration to abruptly close the airspace over El Paso, Texas—will be a “case study” on the complex web of authorities needed to employ such weapons near civilian areas and the consequences of agencies failing to coordinate properly, experts say.
The FAA ordered a 10-day shutdown of all flight traffic over El Paso after U.S. military units operating on the U.S.-Mexico border allowed U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents to use a military laser designed for counter-drone operations, according to a report by the Associated Press confirmed by Air & Space Forces Magazine.
The shutdown wound up lasting only a few hours before airspace was reopened, but the abrupt disruption to air traffic caused confusion and panic and quickly led to lawmakers and public officials demanding answers.
Sen. Jack Reed (R.I.), the senior Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, has called for answers, questioning whether proper safety protocols were followed, and why public communications “appear to have been inconsistent” about what occurred over El Paso.
“The airspace closure over El Paso triggered immediate chaos and confusion and cannot be dismissed as a minor misunderstanding, Reed wrote in a Feb. 11 statement. “The conflicting accounts coming from different parts of the federal government only deepen public concern and raise serious questions about coordination and decision-making.”
U.S. officials have provided few official details about the incident except to say it involved Mexican drug cartels flying drones at the border. Department of Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said the FAA and the Pentagon “acted swiftly to address a cartel drone incursion,” according to Feb. 11 post on X.
U.S. Northern Commander’s Air Force Gen. Gregory M. Guillot told lawmakers in March 2024 that roughly 1,000 incursions by unmanned aircraft systems occur daily along the U.S.-Mexico border.
The incident is the latest high-profile example of the threats drones—even small, cheap ones—present to the U.S. homeland. While this threat was at the border near the Army’s Fort Bliss, the Air Force has been dealing with the issue since December 2023, when unidentified drone swarms flew unchecked over Joint Base Langley-Eustis, Va., for several days. Other drone incursions followed over air bases in Ohio, Utah, and other locations, compelling the Air Force and its sister services to place a top priority on finding ways to detect, identify, track and, if necessary, bring down these small, inexpensive drones.
Last year, the Pentagon began scrambling to buy low-collateral counter-drone technology that’s safe to use near populated areas, and the Air Force and other services have been investing hundreds of millions on counter-drone weapons.
Experts that have followed the government’s counter-drone effort have warned that using such weapons will require coordination with the FAA and other agencies. Now, those same experts are cringing at the apparent lack of coordination between the Pentagon and FAA.
“In terms of interagency coordination, this is a pretty bad scenario. … There was a failure to communicate between the military, CBP—which was actually using the laser, I understand—and the FAA,” said Henry Ziemer, an associate fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “This is a case study in how not to do it.”
Zeimer, who has focused on criminal organizations in Latin America, recently wrote a CSIS commentary on the need for a “drone wall” to counter drone usage by drug cartels on the southwest border.
“Criminal organizations are nothing if not adaptable, and so when you see a crackdown in one area, like we’ve seen on sort of land crossings along the border, they adapt,” Zeimer said. “Drones have been super useful in that regard and allow cartels to survey large stretches of the border to try and identify where the border patrol presence is and reorient their routes and figure out where to go next.”
“Most of the incursions don’t cross into U.S. airspace, but they’re hovering right just outside, observing the border patrols … and figuring out where they are,” he added.
A key challenge of countering the drone threat over military installations has been ensuring military commanders have the proper authorities they need to bring down potentially hostile drones if necessary. While details are still emerging, the Feb. 11 incident occurred in the area of Fort Bliss, Texas, which now sits adjacent to a new “National Defense Area” that runs between Bliss and the Southwest border for the purpose of “denying illegal activity along the southern border,” according to a May 2025 NORTHCOM announcement.
The Pentagon’s Joint Inter-Agency Task Force 401, which focuses on finding counter-drone solutions, recently published updated guidance designed to empower “installation commanders to take decisive action to protect military facilities, assets, and personnel within the homeland.”
The new guidance is designed to streamline policies for counter-drone operations under authority of U.S. law governing the protection of certain facilities and assets from drones, by providing commanders with more options such as allowing drone-defense activities to go beyond an installation’s fenceline, according to the document.
Stacie Pettyjohn, director of the Defense Program at the Center for a New American Security, acknowledged the efforts the Pentagon has undertaken to counter drones over the U.S., but she said the incident in El Paso points to a lack of coordination and “shows how ill-prepared the U.S. Government writ large is for the small drone threat.”
“In trying to strip away some of the red tape, they’ve moved fast and haven’t necessarily ensured that the level of coordination that’s needed for some of these weapons to be employed,” Pettyjohn said, adding that she questions the decision to allow CBP members to employ counter-drone laser near a heavily traveled air corridor.
“Can you imagine if a laser hit a civilian airliner?” said Pettyjohn, who recently co-authored a CNAS report on protecting the joint force in the drone age. “It’s not just that the laser would damage an aircraft, it could blind the pilots and just cause an accident.”
It’s still unclear what laser technology was used in the El Paso drone incident. Reuters reported that the Army had deployed AeroVironment Inc’s LOCUST laser counter-drone weapon system near El Paso International Airport. AeroVironment delivered two Joint Light Tactical Vehicle equipped with 20 kilowatt laser systems to the Army in December as part of the second increment of the Army Multi-Purpose High Energy Laser prototyping effort. The Army has conducted numerous tests of its Directed Energy Maneuver-Short Range Air Defense, or DE M-SHORAD, that’s equipped with a 50-kilowatt laser for counter-drone operations.
Air & Space Forces Magazine reached out to the Pentagon and NORTHCOM for this story. NORTHCOM deferred to the Pentagon, which did not respond to the query by press time.
Pettyjohn questions the amount of training CBP members received before being cleared to use such as weapon. Military air defense units have “deep expertise” in the capabilities of counter-drone laser weapons, which has come through years of testing, she said.
“I think this does highlight the risks of transferring advanced weapons system to Customs and Border Pretection agents, who are not trained on it necessarily and might not be as aware of some of the potential risks of employing these,” Pettyjohn said.
Pettyjohn said she thinks it’s appropriate for Pentagon officials to accept risk in trying to change some of the restrictions on using counter-drone systems in the U.S., “but they’re accepting a lot of risk by transferring them to someone else to use.”
“I think this does highlight questions about the appropriate roles of missions between the Department of Homeland Security and the Pentagon for this … and I think there needs to be clear guardrails for employing different types of counter-drone defeat systems in the U.S.,” Pettyjohn said. “Is the laser the appropriate system to be using on the border or for a base? I think there are questions about that and so, and if they are going to employ it, they need to make sure that they do so safely and deconflict with commercial traffic.”

Son of Iran’s last shah urges US military intervention in Iran
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
MUNICH – Iranian opposition figure Reza Pahlavi on Feb 14 said US military intervention in Iran
The exiled son of Iran’s toppled shah told Reuters in an interview that there were signs that the Iranian government was on the brink of collapse, and that an attack could weaken it or accelerate its fall.
Mr Pahlavi was speaking on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference, where officials from the Iranian government are banned.
“It’s a matter of time. We are hoping that this attack will expedite the process and the people can be finally back in the streets and take it all the way to the ultimate regime’s downfall,” said Mr Pahlavi, who is based in the US and has lived outside Iran since before his father was toppled in the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
A campaign of mass arrests and intimidation
The protests began on Dec 28 as a modest demonstration in Tehran’s Grand Bazaar over economic hardship and quickly spread nationwide.
Trump has questioned level of support for Pahlavi
Iran’s opposition is fragmented among rival groups and ideological factions – including the monarchists who back Mr Pahlavi – and appears to have little organised presence inside the Islamic Republic.
In an interview with Reuters in January, Mr Trump sounded sceptical about the level of Mr Pahlavi’s support inside Iran.
The Trump administration has engaged with Iran to see if a nuclear deal can be struck
“People are hoping that at some point, the decision will be made that there’s no use, there’s no point, we’re not going to get anywhere with negotiations. Therefore, that’s time for the United States to intervene and do what President Trump promised he will do, to have the people’s back,” Mr Pahlavi said.
“Intervention is a way to save lives.”
On Feb 13, in a speech to US troops in North Carolina, Mr Trump said Iran has been difficult in nuclear negotiations and suggested that instilling fear in Tehran may be necessary to resolve the stand-off peacefully.
Two US officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, told Reuters on Feb 13 that the US military was preparing for the possibility of a sustained, weeks-long operation against Iran if Mr Trump ordered an attack. REUTERS

A year after border agent's killing, 7 Zizians fight criminal charges in 3 states

A year after border agent's killing, 7 Zizians fight criminal charges in 3 states
Seven people with ties to the group known as Zizians remain jailed in three states, but so far none of their criminal cases have gone to trial
- Bookmark
The violent deaths linked to the group known as Zizians stopped at six a year ago, after a U.S. border agent was killed and three members were arrested on trespassing and gun charges in the woods of western Maryland. Seven of the group's members are jailed in three states, all awaiting trial.
Police in Maryland quickly connected Jack “Ziz” LaSota, Michelle Zajko and Daniel Blank to homicide investigations in California, Pennsylvania and Vermont after a landowner found them living in box trucks at the end of a snow covered dirt road last February, according to court documents and pre-trial testimony.
“All the suspects involved are to be questioned regarding other crimes that have occurred across the country and have ties with the Zizians Cult,” Maryland state Trooper Brandon Jeffries wrote after their Feb. 16, 2025 arrests. But their prosecutions have only inched along amid trial delays and little action in other cases.
Called “Zizians” by outsiders, the young, highly intelligent computer scientists appear to share radical beliefs about veganism, animal rights, gender identity and artificial intelligence. Since 2022, members have been tied to the death of one of their own during an attack on a California landlord, the landlord’s subsequent killing, the shooting deaths of Zajko’s parents in Pennsylvania, and a highway shootout in Vermont that left the border agent and another Zizian dead.
Arguing they’re victims of injustice
Jury selection was supposed to start this week in Cumberland, Maryland, where LaSota, Zajko and Blank are charged with possession of LSD and possession with intent to deliver LSD, multiple gun violations, trespassing and hindering a police officer.
The trial was delayed until June, however, after Zajko, who also is charged with resisting arrest, fired her attorney, briefly represented herself and hired a new lawyer.
In handwritten filings, she has made sprawling allegations of rights violations by snitches inside the Allegany County Detention Center and lies by police and prosecutors.
“In the interest of Hope, Justice and Truth, for the good of all people, and for the establishment of a true peace, the defense moves to dismiss this case,” Zajko declared in 20 pages of neat but almost indecipherably small handwriting.
Their lawyers and the lead prosecutor have all declined comment or not responded to interview requests.
Vermont border agent killed
Zajko also is accused of supplying the guns two other Zizians used in a fatal shootout in Vermont in January 2025, although her federal court docket starts and ends with the complaint charging her with lying to a Vermont gun dealer.
In that case, Teresa Youngblut is accused of opening fire on Border Patrol Agent David Maland during a traffic stop before another agent wounded her and killed her companion, Felix Bauckholt. The encounter happened just hours after President Donald Trump was sworn in for his second term, but in a Maryland court filing, Zajko sought to blame it on a culture of impunity she says is now evident in the administration’s mass deportation campaign.
“Renee Good is probably dead because the regime has so far been able to get away with murdering Ms. Bauckholt & framing Youngblut,” Zajko claimed. Good was fatally shot last month by a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer in Minneapolis. Neither ICE nor border patrol officials responded to messages seeking comment.
Zajko claimed authorities arrested the group to prevent them from exonerating Youngblut, who has pleaded not guilty in Vermont to murder and could face the death penalty if convicted.
“It is an act of obscene cruelty, despotism & the mark of a tyrannical regime to use a bad faith investigation & the threat of phony charges to conceal exculpatory evidence, threaten witnesses into silence, or threaten to put an innocent person to death, all to protect a murderous border patrol human,” wrote Zajko.
The judge in Youngblut’s case last week suspended deadlines for pretrial motions, citing the complexity of the capital case and noting that the exchange of evidence “will include material related to investigations into other individuals in multiple jurisdictions.”
Murder trials pending in California, an open case in Pennsylvania
Two other Zizians, Suri Dao and Alexander Leatham, are charged in a 2022 attack on a landlord in California that left another member, Emma Borhanian, dead, but their trial has been postponed multiple times. Another member, Maximilian Snyder, is charged with killing the landlord, Curtis Lind, three years later, just days before the Vermont shooting.
Dao’s attorney, Brian Ford, said proceedings are suspended for competency hearings and that his client is not guilty. Attorneys for the others, as well as family members of victims and those accused, either declined to comment or did not respond to messages.
LaSota, described by authorities as the apparent leader of the Zizians, has a May trial date in Baltimore federal court on a separate charge of being an armed fugitive — a charge she has asked to have dismissed, arguing it violates her Second Amendment rights.
Authorities allege LaSota faked her own death to evade charges after a 2019 protest in California and disappeared again after being accused of obstructing the investigation into the December 2022 shooting deaths of Zajko’s parents, Richard and Rita Zajko, in Chester Heights, Pennsylvania.
No one has been charged for killing the Zajkos, and the Delaware County district attorney’s office said only that it still is being investigated. Jeffries, the Maryland trooper, said in a report that “Blank is under investigation for a double homicide that occurred in Delaware County, PA.”
Authorities also have described Zajko as a person of interest in her parents’ death. She has denied any role. In her recent filing, she referred to them as “adoptive guardians” and suggested her father might have killed her mother and then himself. Richard Zajko’s sister-in-law, Rosanne Zajko, declined to comment on behalf of the family.
Mountainside arrests in Maryland
James Broadwater wasn’t sure what to make of the strangers dressed all in black who parked their trucks near his home in Eckhart Mines, outside Frostburg, Maryland. Then Jeffries, the state trooper, told him to Google “Zizians.”
Broadwater testified recently that he had encountered LaSota and Zajko about a half-mile uphill from his house. They asked to stay, but Broadwater gave them until the next morning to leave. After talking with his wife he called state police.
“He changed his mind because he was afraid what would happen if he asked you guys to leave,” Jeffries said when questioned by Zajko in court.
Jeffries testified that a dispatcher had told him about an Associated Press article on the Zizians, published the day before, reporting details about the six deaths. He said LaSota told him they were willing to leave but the three would not identify themselves.
Jeffries said his suspicions were heightened because of the news coverage, their tactical gear that included ammunition on gun belts, and how the trucks were parked with chains on their tires. “I wanted to make sure I identified them before they left,” he testified, and they made the arrests.
The Zizians in Maryland have been working on a joint defense while jailed, though Blank’s parents are pressing the judge to release their son on bail, and his lawyer has sought to distance him from the others. Blank "should not be detained because of the company in which he was arrested,” attorney Rebecca Lechliter wrote.

BrewDog owners say craft beer company could be sold off
The brand, which produces Elvis Juice and Punk IPA, is looking for new investors

Craft beer brand BrewDog could be sold off after the company started the process to find new investors.
The Scottish beer brand recently announced plans to close all of its distilling brands, meaning it would no longer produce any of its spirits, including Duo Rum, Abstrakt Vodka, and Lonewolf Gin, at its distillery in Ellon, Aberdeenshire.
The company, which was founded in 2007, said it made the decision to focus on its beer brands, including the highly-popular Punk IPA, Elvis Juice, and Hazy Jane.
Now, in a statement, a spokesperson for BrewDog said the company had appointed Alix Partners to “support a structured and competitive process to evaluate the next phase of investment for the business.”
The statement said: “As with many businesses operating in a challenging economic climate and facing sustained macro headwinds, we regularly review our options with a focus on the long-term strength and sustainability of the company.
“Following a year of decisive action in 2025, which saw a focus on costs and operating efficiencies, we have appointed AlixPartners to support a structured and competitive process to evaluate the next phase of investment for the business. This is a deliberate and disciplined step with a focus on strengthening the long-term future of the BrewDog brand and its operations.”
Although no decisions have been made, a sale is under consideration.
In a statment BrewDog added: “BrewDog remains a global pioneer in craft beer: a world-class consumer brand, the No.1 independent brewer in the UK, and with a highly engaged global community. We believe that this combination will attract substantial interest, though no final decisions have been made.”
According to reports by Sky News, AlixPartners had begun sounding out prospective buyers in the last few days.
The company, which has 72 bars worldwide and four breweries in Scotland, the US, Australia, and Germany, said its breweries, bars, and venues will continue to operate as normal. It employs 1400 people across the organisation.
BrewDog’s founders James Watt and Martin Dickie are the company's major shareholders alongside private equity company TSG, which invested £213 million in 2017, making it a 21 per cent shareholder.
In 2024, the beer brand grossed £357 million in sales, and it is a major independent brewer with 4 per cent market share in the UK grocery market.

Ex-Reform MP who came to blows with Farage launches new political party – with very similar name
Rupert Lowe once accused Nigel Farage’s group of a ‘brutal smear campaign’ against him
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
A former Reform UK MP who once accused Nigel Farage’s group of a “brutal smear campaign” against him has launched a new political party, with a very similar name.
Great Yarmouth MP Rupert Lowe formally unveiled his Restore Britain party on Friday night.
Mr Lowe, currently an independent MP, used to sit as a Reform representative until he was expelled following allegations of bullying and verbal threats towards the party’s chairman, Zia Yusuf.
Mr Lowe vehemently denied all allegations against him and called them vexatious in a row that at one point saw tech billionaire Elon Musk suggest Mr Lowe should replace Mr Farage as the leader of Reform.
It erupted after Mr Lowe called Reform a “protest party” led by “the Messiah” in a newspaper interview.
Leaked WhatsApp messages later showed Mr Farage denounced his behaviour as “disgusting” and “contemptible” and accused him of “damaging the party just before elections”.
Restore Britain was initially set up as a “political movement” by Mr Lowe after his departure from Reform UK.
It is now expected to act as an umbrella political party, with locally based political parties as its partners.
Mr Lowe, for example, will stand again for the Great Yarmouth constituency with local party Great Yarmouth First, which will be a partner for Restore Britain.
Senior Conservative figures Susan Hall and Sir Gavin Williamson had been involved in an advisory board for Restore Britain when it was described as a political movement.
Former minister Sir Gavin suggested to the Press Association he would end his involvement with Restore Britain as a result of it becoming a political party.
Ms Hall, the Conservative leader in the London Assembly, is also thought to be leaving the party’s board.
Last May, the Crown Prosecution Service announced Mr Lowe would not face criminal charges in relation to the alleged threats, “following a thorough and detailed review of the evidence”.
In a statement, Mr Lowe accused Reform of carrying out a “brutal smear campaign”.
He also attacked his former party’s leader, calling him “a coward and a viper”.

Drone strikes claim lives in Ukraine and Russia ahead of fresh peace talks
Attacks on Ukraine’s Black Sea port city of Odesa and in the border region of Bryansk have killed two people
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
Drone strikes claimed lives in both Ukraine and Russia on Saturday, casting a grim shadow over the prospect of fresh peace talks scheduled for next week.
An elderly woman was killed when a Russian drone struck a residential building in the Black Sea port city of Odesa, Ukraine’s State Emergency Service confirmed.
Meanwhile, in Russia, a civilian died in a Ukrainian drone attack on a car in the border region of Bryansk, according to regional Governor Alexander Bogomaz. These incidents followed a Ukrainian missile strike on the Russian border city of Belgorod the previous day, which killed two people and wounded five, as reported by Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov.
Against this backdrop of escalating hostilities, a new round of US-brokered discussions between envoys from Russia and Ukraine is set to take place in Geneva next week.
The talks, confirmed by officials in Moscow and Kyiv on Friday, will occur just days before the fourth anniversary of Russia’s full-scale invasion of its neighbour. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov stated the discussions would be held on Tuesday and Wednesday, a schedule corroborated by Dmytro Lytvyn, communications adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.
The negotiations unfold amid relentless fighting along the roughly 1,250-kilometre front line, persistent Russian bombardment of Ukrainian civilian areas and its power grid, and Kyiv’s almost daily long-range drone attacks on military-related assets within Russian territory.
Previous US-led efforts to find common ground, including two recent rounds of talks in Abu Dhabi, have failed to resolve contentious issues such as the future of Ukraine’s Donbas industrial heartland, which is largely occupied by Russian forces.
Speaking at the annual Munich Security Conference on Saturday, President Zelenskyy expressed profound gratitude to American and European allies for their provision of air defence systems, which he said protect vital infrastructure like power plants and "save lives." He emphasised the constant threat, stating: "Russian attacks happen almost every night in Ukraine and at least once a week, massive strikes."
He added: "Without you Americans, Europeans, and everyone who stands with us, it would have been very, very difficult to hold on." Mr Zelenskyy reiterated his conviction that security guarantees for Ukraine must precede any peace agreement with Russia. He also noted last week that the United States had set a June deadline for Ukraine and Russia to reach a deal, though previous deadlines given by Donald Trump have largely passed without consequence.

Sybiha: Ukraine will be ready to deploy its troops to other geographic regions in future
A number of partner countries from Europe and elsewhere have confirmed their readiness to deploy their troops to Ukraine after the ceasefire. Ukraine, in turn, will be prepared to deploy its troops to other regions of the world in the future, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiha emphasized at the discussion panel "Focus on Security Guarantees for Ukraine" at the Munich Security Forum, which began on Friday.
"The presence of troops on the ground is an important part of future security guarantees, as well as for business opportunities. Having a presence on the ground also serves as a deterrent, a guarantee for future investors, and an incentive to invest in Ukraine. Therefore, we have also received confirmation from some European capitals, and not only European capitals, of their readiness to deploy troops on the ground," Sybiha said.
According to him, this will happen after the ceasefire is reached. "I don’t know whether this concerns a peacekeeping mandate or a peace monitoring group, because that’s still in the process. But we need this presence in Ukraine. Ukraine is also ready to deploy its armed forces to other geographic regions in the future," the minister added.

Zelensky urges US to intensify pressure on Russia
Zelensky made the remarks in an interview with POLITICO at the Munich Security Conference, Ukrinform reports.
"Be honest, today only Ukraine [is] defending Europe. Today, only Europe gives money to Ukraine and helps Ukraine. Today, only [the] United States can stop Putin," he said.
He criticized the U.S. for trying to force the Ukrainians to concede territory in the Donbas region without demanding sacrifices from the Kremlin.
"What I see, they give more signals that Ukraine has to make compromises and not Russia. This is not [the] right position," he said.
He also stressed that Congress would need to backstop security guarantees, either with more money for Ukraine's postwar military or by sealing a treaty agreement.
"Security guarantees will work only after Congress will vote," he said.
The Ukrainian president pushed back on President Donald Trump's demand that Kyiv and Moscow wrap up a peace settlement by the summer. He said the Kremlin has strung the U.S. along in talks in an effort to normalize the relationship and ease sanctions.
"Until there is enough pressure," Zelensky said, "they [the Russians] play."
He applauded a NATO initiative to give Ukraine more U.S.-made weapons, but said it had not changed Putin's impression that Europe was weak. "Putin really doesn't respect Europe," Zelensky said, adding that the Russian leader's efforts to divide the continent have not been successful.
According to Zelensky, Putin has little time left.
"I'm younger than Putin – this is important," Zelensky said. "He doesn't have too much time."

Rubio sweet-talks Europe in Munich, sharply contrasting with Vance’s attacks last year
U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio struck a conciliatory tone with European leaders at the Munich Security Conference on Feb. 14.
Rubio’s style and wording stood in sharp contrast to U.S. Vice President JD Vance’s confrontational and accusatory speech at the 2025 Munich Security Conference. Vance's address turned into a searing attack on Europe's ideals and a call to embrace far-right parties.
Rubio emphasized the U.S. admiration for Europe and referred to shared history.
"In a time of headlines heralding the end of the Transatlantic era, let it be known and clear to all that this is neither our goal nor our wish, because for us Americans, our home may be in the Western hemisphere, but we will always be a child of Europe," he said.
While the delegates welcomed the speech "with relief," many highlighted that Rubio was not proposing an equal partnership but rather an alliance mainly shaped by the U.S. President Donald Trump's perspective, said Patrick Wintour, the diplomatic editor at the Guardian.
Regarding the ending of the war in Ukraine, Rubio said that despite some progress in peace talks, there are still the "hardest questions to answer." He referred to Russia's demand that Ukraine withdraw from parts of the Donbas and Moscow's claims over the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant.
"They say they are (interested in talks), and under what terms they were willing to do it, and whether we can find terms that are acceptable to Ukraine upon that Russia will always agree to, but we're going to continue to test it," Rubio said.
On Feb. 13, Rubio skipped a Berlin Format meeting on Ukraine held on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference.
Rubio was expected to join leaders from a dozen European countries — including Germany, Poland, and Finland — along with officials from the European Commission and NATO. However, the Financial Times reported that he canceled at the last minute, citing scheduling conflicts.

The Omega Special Operations Center of the National Guard of Ukraine carried out a unique combat operation in the Pokrovsk sector.
Special forces operatives acted almost behind enemy lines to free an officer of the 1st detachment with the call sign ‘Karat’ from captivity, said the head of the Center, Pavlo Yatsiuk.
The soldier fell into enemy hands after being wounded and was held captive for 27 days. During the operation, the Omega group eliminated eight Russian soldiers.
The special forces were supported by fighters and the leadership of the SSU’s Special Operations Center Alpha. The 14th Brigade of the National Guard ‘Chervona Kalyna’ and the command of the 1st Corps of the National Guard ‘Azov’ also provided assistance in conducting the operation.
Karat is currently on his way to Kyiv for treatment of his injuries.
As a reminder, in January, a wounded Ukrainian soldier was captured by the Russians, but managed to convince the invaders to surrender to the Armed Forces of Ukraine.
His condition is now stable after surgery on his pelvic bone, and the command is preparing documents for a state award.

Zelensky says US too often asks Ukraine, not Russia, for concessions
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
- Ukrainian President Zelensky hopes for "substantive" Geneva peace talks but feels Ukraine is pressed for concessions, suspecting Russia changed negotiators to delay decisions.
- Land, especially Russia demanding more Donetsk territory, is the major sticking point. Ukraine refuses to cede it but considers a US-proposed free trade zone.
- Zelensky urged stronger Western action, including tougher sanctions and more weapons, calling on Trump to force a ceasefire and for Europe to play a bigger role.

KYIV – Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky voiced hope on Feb 14 that US-brokered peace talks in Geneva next week would be substantive, but he said Ukraine was being asked “too often” to make concessions.
He also accused Moscow of seeking to delay decisions by changing its lead negotiator.
Ukrainian, Russian and American delegations are due to meet in the Swiss lakeside city on Feb 17 and 18 as US President Donald Trump seeks to push through a deal to end Europe’s biggest war since 1945.
“We truly hope that the trilateral meetings next week will be serious, substantive, helpful for all us but honestly sometimes it feels like the sides are talking about completely different things,” Mr Zelensky said in a speech at the annual Munich Security Conference.
Ukraine and Russia, which invaded its neighbour in February 2022, have engaged in two recent rounds of talks brokered by Washington in Abu Dhabi described by the sides as constructive but achieving no major breakthroughs.
Mr Zelensky called for greater action from Ukraine’s allies to press Russia into making peace - both in the form of tougher sanctions and more weapons supplies.
Recalling his appeal four years ago, when he spoke at the same conference days before tens of thousands of Russian forces poured into Ukraine, Mr Zelensky said there was too much talk by Western officials and not enough action.
Mr Trump has the power to force Mr Putin to declare a ceasefire and needed to do so, Mr Zelensky said. Ukrainian officials have said a ceasefire is required to hold a referendum on any peace deal, which would be organised alongside national elections.
The Ukrainian leader, a former television entertainer, acknowledged he was feeling “a little bit” of pressure from Mr Trump, who yesterday said Mr Zelensky should not miss the “opportunity” to make peace soon and urged him “to get moving”.
“The Americans often return to the topic of concessions and too often those concessions are discussed only in the context of Ukraine, not Russia,” Mr Zelensky said.
Instead, Mr Zelensky said, he wanted to hear what compromises Moscow would be ready for, as Ukraine had already made many of its own.
Russia said its delegation to Geneva would be led by Putin adviser Vladimir Medinsky, a change from negotiations in Abu Dhabi at which Russia’s team was led by military intelligence chief Igor Kostyukov.
Mr Zelensky told reporters on Feb 14 the change was “a surprise” for Ukraine, and suggested to him that Russia wanted to delay any decisions from being agreed.
Ukrainian officials have criticised Mr Medinsky’s handling of previous talks, accusing him of delivering history lessons to the Ukrainian team instead of engaging in constructive negotiations.
Deadlock over territory
Land remains the major sticking point in negotiations, with Russia demanding that Ukraine cede the remaining 20 per cent of the eastern region of Donetsk that Moscow has failed to capture - something Kyiv steadfastly refuses to do.
At a news conference on Feb 14, Mr Zelensky said that US negotiators had told Ukraine that the Russians had promised a swift end to the war if Ukrainian forces immediately withdrew from the part of Donetsk it still controls.
He said earlier he was instead ready to discuss a US proposal for a free trade zone in that region, while freezing the rest of the 1,200km front line.
Ukraine’s chief negotiator, Mr Rustem Umerov, who sat beside Mr Zelensky during the media briefing, said the only two options were either that Ukraine sticks to the current lines of control, or that a free economic zone is established.
Russia occupies about 20 per cent of Ukraine’s national territory, including Crimea and parts of the eastern Donbas region seized before the full-scale invasion in 2022.
Analysts say Moscow has gained about 1.5 per cent of Ukrainian territory since early 2024. Its recent air strikes on Ukraine’s cities and electricity infrastructure have left hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians without heating and power during the course of a bitterly cold winter.
Ukrainian officials have repeatedly expressed concern in recent weeks that US congressional mid-term elections in November could focus the Trump administration on domestic political issues after the summer.
Mr Zelensky said he hoped the US would stay involved in the negotiations, and that there would be an opportunity for Europe, which he said was currently sidelined, to play a bigger role.
“Europe is practically not present at the table. It’s a big mistake to my mind,” he said.
Mr Zelensky said that Russia had to accept a ceasefire monitoring mission and an exchange of prisoners of war; he estimated that Russia currently had about 7,000 Ukrainian troops while Kyiv had more than 4,000 Russians.
Mr Zelensky also suggested Moscow was opposed to the deployment of French and British troops in Ukraine after the war - which Paris and London have said they are willing to do - because Russian President Vladimir Putin “wants to have the opportunity to come back.” REUTERS

Finland files protest over Olympic sprint waxing dispute

Finland has filed a formal protest with the International Ski Federation over events during the men’s Olympic sprint at the Milan–Cortina Winter Games, alleging rule breaches by Norway and the United States.
The Finnish Ski Association and the Finnish Olympic Committee submitted the complaint to the sprint jury on Saturday morning.
The protest concerns the final of Tuesday’s race, in which Norway’s Johannes Kläbo took gold ahead of American Ben Ogden and Norway’s Oskar Vike.
Finland’s Lauri Vuorinen finished fourth.
Finnish officials argue that both Norway and the United States gained an advantage through equipment procedures that breached competition rules and instructions issued to team leaders before the event.
According to the Finnish Olympic Committee, the protest relies on information that emerged only after the race.
The dispute centres on activity in the service area during the sprint heats.
Finland states that the United States team brought a liquid substance into the waxing zone, which they described as a wax removal agent. Such liquids are banned under FIS regulations for the event.
Norway, in turn, received permission from FIS to use an electric waxing pot in the service area during the heats. Pre-event guidelines sent to teams prohibited the use of such equipment. Finland says other teams were not informed that Norway had been granted an exception.
The Finnish Ski Association said FIS later admitted it had made an error in handling the matter and apologised.
“FIS has itself admitted making a mistake, and this has led to an unfair competition in which two countries received an undue advantage without others knowing,” said Marleena Valtasola, executive director of the Finnish Ski Association, in a statement.
“Such action is impossible to accept, and a mere admission of error or apology does not correct the damage that has been done.”
Finland demands that the results be amended to reflect a situation in which no athlete benefited from action contrary to the rules.
Finnish coaches learned of the incidents on Thursday, two days after the race. At that stage, they were informed that the 48-hour time limit for lodging a protest had expired.
Both the Olympic Committee and the Ski Association state they are prepared to pursue further action if the initial protest is rejected.

French President Emmanuel Macron plans to establish direct contact with Russia for peace talks.
"I want to be very clear: we can negotiate without the Europeans if we want, but that will not lead to peace at the negotiating table. This is precisely why I decided to establish a direct channel of communication with Russia in full transparency with Ukraine, our European partners, and our American allies," he said speaking at the Munich Security Conference in Germany on Friday.

UK to send carrier north in show of force against Russia
United Kingdom

The UK will deploy a Carrier Strike Group to the North Atlantic and High North in 2026 under Operation Firecrest, in what the Ministry of Defence describes as a major show of force aimed at deterring Russian aggression and protecting critical undersea infrastructure.
The deployment will be led by HMS Prince of Wales and will include warships, F-35 aircraft and helicopters, as part of a broader effort to strengthen NATO’s deterrence posture in the Euro-Atlantic and Arctic regions.
According to the Ministry of Defence, the move comes amid growing concern over increased Russian naval activity in the North Atlantic. The government claims there has been a “30% increase in Russian navy vessels threatening UK waters” over the past two years.
The strike group is expected to operate closely with the United States, including activity off the North American East Coast and a port visit in the US. The MOD said American aircraft are also expected to operate from the flight deck of HMS Prince of Wales during the deployment.
Operation Firecrest will also contribute to NATO’s new Arctic Sentry mission, launched this week, with the government citing the strategic impact of melting sea ice opening new routes and increasing the risk of hostile activity in the High North.
The MOD highlighted concerns around Russian operations in the Greenland-Iceland-UK (GIUK) gap, as well as the vulnerability of undersea cables and pipelines.
Defence Secretary John Healey said the deployment would reinforce British leadership in the region.
“I’m proud that we’re stepping up UK leadership on High North and Atlantic security,” Healey said.
“This deployment will help make Britain warfighting ready, boost our contribution to NATO, and strengthen our operations with key allies, keeping the UK secure at home and strong abroad.”
The operation will involve thousands of personnel across all three armed services. The MOD said the Carrier Strike Group will also exercise alongside NATO’s Standing Naval Maritime Group1, which will be led by the UK throughout 2026, with HMS Dragon acting as the command ship.
Parts of the deployment will fall under NATO command and will include cooperation with Joint Force Command Norfolk, which the government said is expected to be led by a British officer for the first time.
Operation Firecrest follows the UK’s 2025 carrier deployment to the Indo-Pacific, which the MOD said involved more than 1,000 F-35 sorties and engagement with over 30 nations, and resulted in the Carrier Strike Group being declared fully “mission ready” for NATO operations.

Hungary refuses to give up its EU veto rights — PM

BUDAPEST, February 14. /TASS/. Hungary will not abandon its independent stance in the European Union and will not allow its right of veto to be removed, Prime Minister Viktor Orban said during a traditional speech in Budapest on the past year’s political results and the government’s plans for the near future.
This year, Orban’s address attracted particular attention as it came ahead of parliamentary elections scheduled for April 12. One of the issues on the agenda of the ruling Fidesz-Hungarian Civic Union party concerns disagreements with EU leadership over the conflict in Ukraine. Budapest believes Brussels is attempting to strip Hungary of its right of veto in order to ensure Ukraine’s accession to the bloc. The ruling party says Brussels is seeking a change of leadership in Hungary by backing the opposition Tisza party.
However, Orban emphasized that Hungary will maintain its independent position on these issues despite pressure from Brussels. "An independent stance must be guarded like the apple of the eye," the prime minister said. He added that if the opposition party comes to power, it will "integrate Hungary into the common European foreign policy." "This must not happen. We will not allow our right of veto in the EU to be removed," Orban said.

Israel is building a NIS 7b. airport – history says it will cost much more - analysis
Unknown
Unknown Publisher
2026-02-14
12:43:00 UTC
21:43:00 KST

The numbers were impressive. NIS 7 billion. Ten million passengers a year. Seventy thousand aircraft movements. A "national necessity," the Prime Minister's Office declared, that would "effectively eliminate the concept of periphery."
On February 4, the offices of the prime minister, transportation minister, and finance minister jointly announced that a new international airport would be built at Ziklag in the northern Negev, between Rahat and Netivot – ending years of debate over where to build a second major aviation hub. A cabinet vote was scheduled for February 8 but was postponed less than an hour before the session amid disagreements over whether to include a parallel airport at Ramat David in the Jezreel Valley.
The government's confidence would be reassuring if not for one problem: Israel has not completed a single major government-funded infrastructure project on time and on budget in the past two decades. Not one.
The track record
The Tel Aviv Red Line light rail was approved in 2010 at NIS 10.7 billion. It opened in August 2023 at NIS 18.71 billion – 75% over budget and a full decade late. The State Comptroller found the original budget allocated just 16% for contingencies versus the international standard of roughly 50%. Budget changes worth hundreds of millions of shekels went undocumented. NTA diverted funds between line items to create the appearance of operating within budget.
The A1 fast train to Jerusalem was approved in 2001 at NIS 2.5 billion with a target date of 2008. It reached full service in December 2019 at roughly NIS 7 billion – a 180% overrun and more than a decade late.
The Jerusalem light rail was estimated at NIS 2.2 billion around 2002. The final cost reached NIS 3.8 billion – a 73% overrun. The line opened in December 2011, five to seven years behind schedule. In 2020, the government paid NIS 1.6 billion to buy back the failed CityPass concession.
The pattern extends to projects still underway. The Tel Aviv Purple Line, budgeted at roughly NIS 11 billion, is now projected at NIS 12.5 billion and running three years late. The Green Line, directed to open by 2020, won't achieve full service until 2030 at the earliest – NTA's own CEO described even that target as "ambitious." The Comptroller found that the construction pace on these lines was 48% slower than international norms.
These are not cherry-picked failures. A Calcalist-cited study found that the average budget overrun for Israeli infrastructure projects exceeds 20%, with large government bodies responsible for 62% of all overruns. For major rail and transit, the median overrun exceeds 70%.
Why it happens
The pattern is structural, and it has been documented extensively by the State Comptroller and confirmed by global academic research.
Bent Flyvbjerg, an Oxford professor who assembled the world's largest database on megaproject performance – more than 16,000 projects across 136 countries – found that 91.5% of megaprojects go over budget, over schedule, or both. The mean cost overrun globally is 62%. For rail projects, it is 44.7%. The core mechanism is what Flyvbjerg calls "strategic misrepresentation": initial budgets are deliberately set low because stating the real cost would make the project politically unpalatable.
His description reads almost exactly like the Comptroller's findings about the Red Line. The November 2022 Comptroller's report – the most authoritative document on the subject – found that NTA diverted budgets between sections to mask overruns, that changes worth hundreds of millions of shekels went unreported to the Transport and Finance ministries, and that the government failed to set binding completion dates. Israel is not an outlier. It is a textbook case – one that happens to perform worse than the global average.
The airport precedent
There is one Israeli project that provides a direct comparison to Ziklag: Ramon Airport.
Government authorization came in July 2011 at NIS 1.6 billion. The airport opened in January 2019 – 21 months late – at a reported NIS 1.7 billion, though total investment approached NIS 2 billion when all-in costs were included.
The cost overrun was modest by Israeli standards. But data published by the Israeli Airport Authority shows that in 2025, of the 750,000 total passengers, only around 7,500 were international. Almost NIS 2 billion invested in what has been described as a "white elephant." It was designed for 2.5 million passengers a year. In practice, it functioned primarily as a domestic shuttle point for Arkia and Israir.
Ziklag is being sold on the same premise: build it in the periphery and the passengers will come. The estimated cost is more than three times higher.
What the professionals said
The Ziklag decision was not made on professional advice. It was made against it.
For years, the debate centered on two alternatives: Ramat David in the Jezreel Valley, where a master plan was approved as early as 2007, and Nevatim in the Negev, adjacent to the existing air force base. The National Planning and Building Council had been advancing Ramat David since 2017 and was expected to complete its work next month.
Then, last June, Netanyahu announced the airport would be built at Ziklag – a third site that neither the planning establishment nor the defense establishment had recommended.
The Defense Ministry imposed what Calcalist described as an "absolute veto" on airports in the south. The IDF and Air Force argued that civilian flight paths would interfere with training and operational sorties from the Nevatim and Hatzarim air bases, and that relocating squadrons would cost an estimated NIS 15 billion. Planning authorities determined eight years ago that Ziklag's flight paths overlap with Ben Gurion's – meaning the new airport would add to congestion rather than relieve it.
Industry sources told TheMarker the decision was politically driven by the insistence of Regev and Deputy Minister Almog Cohen on a southern airport "apparently at any cost, even if the professional considerations do not support the plan." Aviation officials separately told Haaretz it was driven by political pressure from Likud officials in the south.
The "Negev Takes Off from Nevatim" campaign – a coalition of local authority heads including Dimona Mayor Beni Biton, a Likud figure close to both Regev and Netanyahu – called the Ziklag decision "disconnected from reality and absurd by any measure." They argued Nevatim already had billions invested in airport infrastructure and that new planning at Ziklag would take at least a decade while producing no immediate solution to Ben Gurion's capacity problem.
Biton told Walla Sheva that IDF Chief of Staff Eyal Zamir and the Air Force commander had misled Netanyahu about the feasibility of Nevatim, claiming former chief of staff Benny Gantz told him directly: "There is no problem whatsoever to build an airport at Nevatim."
Retired Maj. Gen. Nimrod Sheffer, former head of the Air Force Planning Division, told Calcalist: "The state needs to do what is right for the state, even if the Air Force opposes it. There is no problem without a solution."
The exceptions that prove the rule
In two decades, precisely two categories of Israeli projects have been completed on time and on budget: desalination plants and the National Library.
The Ashkelon and Sorek desalination plants – NIS 950 million and NIS 2.1 billion respectively – were both delivered on schedule under BOT contracts in which private firms bore the construction cost risk. The government's exposure was limited to the contracted water price, not construction costs.
The National Library opened in October 2023 at its budgeted NIS 845 million. The decisive factor: 86% of funding came from private donors – the Rothschild/Yad HaNadiv Foundation and the Gottesman Family – who imposed strict professional oversight. Only 14% was government money.
Same country. Same regulatory environment. Same labor market. The variable was who bore the risk and who managed the project. Ziklag has neither private risk-sharing nor independent oversight. It is a fully government-managed project on public funds.
What NIS 7 billion likely means
For Israeli government projects over the past 20 years, the median cost overrun for rail and transit exceeds 70%. Ramon Airport came in 6% to 25% over budget – but it was a simple project compared to building an entirely new airport on a site that lacks infrastructure, in a location the military opposes, with unresolved airspace conflicts.
If the Israeli median overrun of 50% to 75% applies – conservative, given that several projects have exceeded 100% – the realistic cost range is NIS 10.5 to 12.25 billion. The government has not stated a completion date. Critics estimate at least a decade. Given that the Israeli median delay runs five to ten years beyond stated targets, the mid-2040s is more realistic than the mid-2030s.
The Ziklag airport will also be competing for scarce resources. The December 2025 Comptroller's report on the Tel Aviv Metro – a project whose cost had already risen from NIS 150 billion to NIS 177 billion – found the Metro Authority had no permanent director and only five employees. Israel faces a shortage of 4,500 civil engineers, expected to grow to 8,000.
The bottom line
Seven kilometers from the proposed airport site, Hamas terrorists carried out the October 7 massacre. Deputy Minister Cohen noted this fact himself when the decision was announced – apparently as a point of pride rather than a security concern.
The government has approved NIS 7 billion for an airport that professional planners did not recommend, in a location the military opposes, on a site that lacks infrastructure, with overlapping airspace, without a stated completion date, without private risk-sharing, and without the oversight that characterizes the only Israeli projects ever completed on budget.
If the data is any guide, and 20 years of it suggests it is, the final price tag will not be NIS 7 billion.

Doctors Without Borders suspends activities at Gaza hospital due to presence of gunmen

Doctors Without Borders suspends activities at Gaza hospital due to presence of gunmen
Aid group says incidents, including suspected weapons transfers, have increased since ceasefire; statement marks 1st time international group confirmed gunmen in Gaza hospitals
Doctors Without Borders said in a statement that it has suspended non-critical medical activities at Nasser Hospital in Gaza’s Khan Younis due to the presence of armed men at the medical facility and “a recent situation of suspicion of movement of weapons.”
The aid group said that armed men have additionally been arresting patients.
MSF’s statement appeared to mark the first time that an international humanitarian group in Gaza has publicly reported the presence of armed men in a hospital or the possible use of such a facility for moving weapons.
“In recent months, in Nasser hospital in Khan Younis, patients and MSF personnel have seen armed men, some masked, in different areas of the large compound of the hospital. This had not been in areas where MSF has activities, but in other parts of the hospital compound,” Doctors Without Borders, also known by its French acronym MSF, said in the statement explaining its decision to halt work at the Nasser Hospital since January 20.
MSF has been a key provider of medical and humanitarian aid in Gaza since the October 7, 2023, Hamas-led attacks in southern Israel triggered a two-year war in the enclave. Israel and Hamas agreed to a US-brokered ceasefire in October, though both sides have repeatedly accused each other of violations.
“With an uptick since the ceasefire, MSF teams have reported a pattern of unacceptable acts, including the presence of armed men, intimidation, arbitrary arrests of patients, and a recent situation of suspicion of movement of weapons,” the humanitarian organization said. “These incidents pose serious security threats to our teams and patients.”
An MSF representative told Reuters the organization continued to support some critical services at Nasser Hospital, including inpatient and surgical care for certain patients requiring lifesaving treatment.
The Hamas-run Interior Ministry said in a statement it was committed to preventing any armed presence inside hospitals, and that legal action would be taken against violators. It suggested that armed members of certain Gazan families had recently entered hospitals, but did not identify those involved.
Israel has repeatedly offered evidence of medical facilities’ regular use by Palestinian terror groups as bases of operations due to their protected status. Hostages have also said they were held at Nasser Hospital.
Last year, a doctor, who also serves as a spokesperson for Nasser Hospital, hinted that he had been threatened by Palestinian Islamic Jihad due to his refusal to let the terror group’s operatives enter and use the hospital.
Israel announced earlier this month that it was terminating all MSF’s activities in Gaza and the West Bank after it failed to provide a list of its Palestinian staff.
MSF slammed the move, which takes effect on March 1, as a “pretext” to obstruct aid. Israel has previously accused MSF of having at least two employees who held membership in the Palestinian Islamic Jihad and Hamas terror groups.
Oxfam sued for “toxic antisemitic culture”
The scrutiny of MSF comes amid broader criticism of international aid organizations’ conduct regarding the Gaza conflict.
This week, the former CEO of Oxfam GB announced she is suing the charity, alleging a “toxic antisemitic culture” and claiming she faced pressure to prematurely use the term genocide to describe Israel’s military campaign.
“Because to use the word genocide, it has to be something that we arrive at with consultation and evidence and good legal advice,” Halima Begum told Channel 4 News. “And to try and use that term before we’re ready as an organization feels quite risky to me.”
“Essentially, it was very hard to hold on to neutrality and impartiality,” she added. “And I say that as a Muslim woman,”
In a statement to Channel 4 News, Oxfam GB said it refutes Begum’s allegations.
Oxfam works in over 70 countries, helping people in developing countries out of poverty and providing emergency aid during humanitarian crises.
Mark Goldring resigned as CEO of Oxfam GB in 2018 following revelations that the charity’s aid workers used sex workers while in Haiti following a 2010 earthquake. The British government halted funding for Oxfam in 2021 after it reported it had suspended staff members in the Democratic Republic of Congo over claims of sexual misconduct and bullying.

Heavy air pollution and cloudy skies: The dusty haze covering Israel carries possible health risks
Unknown

12:42:51 UTC
21:42:51 KST

Israel's air quality plummeted on Saturday, with Jerusalem and Tel Aviv topping the list of the most polluted major cities worldwide, according to IQAir's live ranking. The sky was a cloudy orange-gray, visibility was significantly impaired, and monitoring stations across the country indicated very high to abnormal levels of air pollution.
The haze was caused by strong southwesterly winds carrying large amounts of dust from North Africa. These deposit fine dust particles into the atmosphere, where they combine with urban emissions from heavy traffic and industrial emissions.
Stagnant atmospheric conditions and a lack of rainfall are the final components that allow dense smog to form.
According to reports, some improvement is expected in the north of the country and the Golan Heights later today, but very high pollution levels will prevail in other areas.
Health Ministry, Environmental Protection Ministry issue warnings
The Health Ministry and the Environmental Protection Ministry both issued warnings to the public regarding the dust.
Sensitive populations, including heart patients, lung patients, asthmatics, the elderly, children, and pregnant women, are advised to avoid staying outdoors and to stop all strenuous physical activity outside the home.
The healthy population is also advised to reduce strenuous activity in the open air as much as possible.
The ministries emphasized that the massive transport of dust raises the concentration of respiratory particles to levels that may be dangerous, especially for people with underlying diseases.
The impact of the haze is not limited to discomfort or burning in the eyes. It is a real biological burden on the body's systems.
The tiny dust particles can penetrate through the respiratory tract into the trachea and bronchi, and sometimes into the lung nodules. The body recognizes the particles as a foreign agent and triggers an inflammatory response.
IgE antibodies activate during the response and trigger a chain of biological processes that include blood vessel dilation, mucosal edema, and increased sputum secretion. The result is throat irritation, a bothersome cough, a burning sensation in the eyes, and sometimes narrowing of the airways.
In patients with asthma and chronic lung diseases, the effect may be more dramatic.
The narrowing of the airways causes wheezing, shortness of breath, and sometimes attacks that require treatment with inhalers or inhalations. In some cases, the particles in the air form a substrate for viruses and bacteria to adhere to, which may increase the risk of infections in the respiratory tract.
The cardiovascular system can also be damaged by the dust molecules. Polluted air contains less available oxygen, which requires the heart to work at an increased load to supply oxygen to the body's tissues.
In heart patients with narrowing of the coronary blood vessels, the increased demand may lead to ischemia of the heart muscle and a possible heart attack. The load may also increase blood pressure and increase the risk of stroke.
Reducing exposure to air pollution, dust particles
To reduce exposure to the dust particles, it is recommended to close windows in the home, office, and car. Air conditioners should be set to internal circulation and not to draw air from outside.
Heart and lung patients are advised to stay in closed spaces as much as possible. Asthma patients should make sure that inhalers are easily accessible, and those who have suffered from severe asthma attacks in the past should consult a doctor about preventive treatment.
Outdoor physical activity is not recommended because physical exertion increases breathing rate and can draw a larger volume of polluted air into the lungs, thereby increasing exposure to harmful particles.
Children playing outside, running, or riding bicycles are at increased risk because their breathing rate is higher relative to their body weight.
Some dust inhalation symptoms may require immediate medical care. Severe shortness of breath that does not improve with rest, chest pain, a feeling of choking, or a sudden worsening of respiratory status requires urgent examination.
Heart patients who feel pain radiating to the shoulders, neck, jaw, or back should seek urgent medical care, especially if the pain is accompanied by nausea, cold sweats, or extreme weakness. Symptoms such as sudden confusion, difficulty speaking, or weakness on one side of the body could indicate the occurrence of a stroke and require immediate treatment.
Patients with asthma or chronic lung disease who struggle with severe wheezing that does not respond to normal treatment, or who use accessory muscles in the chest to breathe, should also seek treatment.

In the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, the choreography is usually flawless. The red flags are perfectly aligned, and the applause is synchronous.
The goal of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and President Xi Jinping, who has ruled the country since 2012, is to project an image of unbreakable unity and inevitable rise.
However, in recent years the carefully curated image of stability has been shattered by a reality that looks more like a high-stakes thriller than a bureaucratic procession. The dominant feature of Beijing’s political landscape is no longer the applause but the empty seats.
From the unceremonious removal of a former president from his chair in front of TV cameras to the vanishing of foreign and defense ministers and the purging of top generals, China is undergoing a political earthquake that has left Western intelligence agencies and geopolitical analysts scrambling for answers. Is this a sign of a paranoid dictator losing his grip, or a supremely confident leader fine-tuning his machine for a conflict that will reshape the world order?
The tremors began publicly in October 2022, during the closing ceremony of the 20th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party. In a scene that shocked the world, former Chinese leader Hu Jintao was physically led out of the hall while seated next to Xi Jinping.
“An unceremonious departure for a former Chinese leader,” Zi Yang, a senior research fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies, tells the Magazine. “Hu was basically asked to leave. It seems like Hu had no idea what was going on. To see a former leader carried out like that was, of course, quite shocking to many observers.” It was a visual declaration: The old guard was gone. This was Xi’s party now.
But what followed was even more bizarre. One morning in July 2023, Qin Gang, the foreign minister, simply evaporated – he did not arrive at an Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit. “Health reasons” was the official explanation given by the Chinese Foreign Ministry.
A rising star in the CCP and former ambassador to the United States, Qin “had been a favorite of Xi Jinping. It’s said that Xi Jinping actually liked to drink on his airplane with Qin Gang, that they were very good friends,” explains Prof. Dennis Wilder of Georgetown University, a former senior director for East Asia at the National Security Council.
'Regarding your question, I have no information to provide'
When asked about Qin’s whereabouts, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, Mao Ning, offered a response that has become a hallmark of the current era: “Regarding your question, I have no information to provide.” Weeks later, Qin was stripped of his title. Rumors swirled.
“What seems to have happened in this case is that Qin Gang began an illicit relationship with a Chinese news reporter,” Wilder suggests, noting reports that the affair may have resulted in a child.
Qin was not alone. Liu Jianchao, the man responsible for the party’s international liaison work, also vanished from the public eye that same year. The pattern was clear: Proximity to the leader offered no protection.
If the diplomatic purges were mysterious, the upheaval in the People’s Liberation Army was alarming. The very men tasked with modernizing China’s military and preparing it for a possible invasion of Taiwan are being removed at a staggering rate.
“Nowhere in Chinese military history – except perhaps under chairman Mao – have we seen anything as unprecedented as this purge,” notes Wilder.
The purge has reached the very apex of the military hierarchy. Gen. Zhang Youxia, the vice chairman of the Central Military Commission and effectively the second-most powerful man in the military, came under scrutiny and was removed from his post last month.
“Resolutely investigating and dealing with Zhang Youxia is a major achievement in the party and military’s struggle against corruption,” stated Jiang Bin, a spokesman for China’s Ministry of National Defense, using the party’s preferred euphemism for political removal.
“They didn’t really use the word ‘purge’; they used the phrase ‘under investigation.’ But that’s basically the first step of being purged. Usually, nobody is found innocent through these investigations,” says Zi Yang.
The chaos has been particularly acute in the Defense Ministry. Li Shangfu, who became the defense minister with the shortest tenure in Chinese history, was ousted amid corruption allegations. His successor, navy veteran Dong Jun, has reportedly faced similar scrutiny.
Brig. Gen. (res.) Assaf Orion, a senior researcher at the Institute for National Security Studies and director of the Diane & Guilford Glazer Israel-China Policy Center, views this as a systemic cleansing of the officer corps.
“We are talking here about a cleaning out – or elimination – of the entire group... the Chinese military top brass, who were all appointments from Xi Jinping’s era,” Orion explains.
According to Orion, the official line always circles back to “corruption, disciplinary violations, and violations of party laws,” but the subtext is power dynamics. The accused are often charged with creating “cliques or influence networks” that can be viewed as a threat to Xi’s rule.
The Wall Street Journal has reported even more damaging allegations, suggesting that some generals, including Zhang Youxia, were suspected of leaking secrets related to China’s nuclear program to the United States.
While Wilder believes these leaks might be a “cover for what’s really happening” – a raw political struggle – the implication is stark: Xi feels he cannot trust the men who control his nuclear arsenal.
“There seems to be quite a lot of infighting among the elites,” says Zi Yang. “And Xi seems like he does not trust anyone at that level.”
WHY IS Xi Jinping dismantling the very leadership structure he spent a decade building? The conventional wisdom suggests a leader gripped by paranoia, seeing shadows of treason in every corner.
However, Ian Johnson, a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and renowned China scholar, offers a counterintuitive perspective. In an interview, Johnson argued that these moves might stem not from fear but from hubris.
“I think he is fundamentally unsure about the people he’s surrounded himself with,” Johnson says. “He is probably doing this out of not so much paranoia but perhaps extreme self-confidence.”
According to Johnson, Xi feels he has such absolute control that he can afford to treat the military leadership as interchangeable parts.
“He feels that he can get exactly the people he wants running the military. It might be like fine-tuning the leadership,” Johnson explains.
While it is easy to “construct a scenario where he’s paranoid, schizophrenic,” Johnson contends that Xi is acting out of a belief that he has “complete control.”
This view contrasts with the assessment of other analysts who see the purges as a sign of fragility. “When some of these generals start building up their own factions by promoting their own underlings, perhaps that alarms Xi,” Zi Yang says. “Xi is very afraid of his subordinates getting too powerful.”
Orion highlights the scale of the campaign: “In total, during his years in office, about 200,000 people were purged. This shows that even those closest to him cannot be trusted, and therefore, he purges them.” For the international community – and particularly for US allies like Israel, which closely monitor global stability – the burning question is how this affects a potential invasion of Taiwan.
In Taiwan, senior officials say that 2027 is a year to watch. This aligns with US intelligence assessments that Xi has ordered the military to be ready for action by that date. But does a purged military fight better?
A purged command structure is a compliant one. However, Orion warns of the operational costs: “When a military is undergoing a turnover of senior officers, this is not the height of stability needed to launch an operation with such high risks.”
Essentially, Xi may be buying political loyalty at the cost of military competence.
Johnson, however, pushes back against the idea that the purges signal an imminent war. He remains skeptical about the “invasion next year” theories derived from reading political tea leaves.
“I still assume that the leadership in Beijing is rational,” Johnson argues. “And if I assume that they’re rational, then it would not make sense to invade right away because time is on Beijing’s side militarily.”
Johnson points out that while the United States is distracted by conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East, China is methodically building aircraft carriers and expanding its arsenal. He also notes that the domestic political situation in Taiwan – where the pro-independence leadership is unpopular – may eventually break in Beijing’s favor without a single shot being fired.
“It makes sense to wait and see how that plays out, meanwhile building up the military and not pushing a hasty invasion,” Johnson concludes. “I don’t think the purges are directly related to some sort of impending military adventure.”
WHETHER DRIVEN by paranoia or confidence, Xi Jinping has fundamentally altered the DNA of the Chinese Communist Party. By abolishing term limits and refusing to groom a successor, he has centralized power to a degree not seen since Mao Zedong.
“I think it’s all about President Xi’s desire to remain leader for life in China,” says Wilder. “He has given no indication of who a successor might be because he doesn’t want one. A successor would mean he becomes a lame duck.”
This isolation creates a paradox. The system appears stable because there are no rivals. “He doesn’t have any clear heir apparent, and he doesn’t have any real rivals inside the system,” Johnson observes.
But this superficial stability masks a deep, existential risk for the regime.
“If one day he dies – as all people do – or becomes incapacitated, there will be no clear person to succeed him,” Johnson warns. “And I think this is the problem facing China in the next five years or so.”
For now, the empty seats in the Great Hall of the People serve as a silent warning to the Chinese elite. The applause may still be loud, but everyone knows that in Xi Jinping’s China, the distance between the inner circle and a prison cell has never been shorter.
In the opaque world of Beijing politics, the only certainty is that the next purge is only a matter of time.

The Ethiopian Media Authority has declined to renew the accreditation for three Addis Ababa-based journalists from Reuters, the news agency said.
The EMA also revoked the news agency's accreditation to cover the 39th African Union summit, which was taking place in the Ethiopian capital on February 14-15.
"Reuters is reviewing the matter and will continue to cover Ethiopia in an independent, impartial, and reliable way in keeping with the Thomson Reuters Trust Principles," Reuters said in a statement.
Ethiopia gets involved in Sudanese Civil War
The move comes days after the news agency published an investigative report that said Ethiopia was hosting a secret camp to train thousands of fighters for the Rapid Support Forces paramilitary group in neighboring Sudan. Ethiopia has not publicly commented on the story.
The camp constitutes the first direct evidence of Ethiopia’s involvement in Sudan’s civil war, marking a potentially dangerous development that provides the RSF a substantial supply of fresh soldiers as fighting escalates in Sudan’s south.
Eight sources, including a senior Ethiopian government official, said the United Arab Emirates financed the camp’s construction and provided military trainers and logistical support to the site, a view also shared in an internal note by Ethiopia’s security services and in a diplomatic cable, reviewed by Reuters.
The news agency could not independently verify the UAE's involvement in the project or the camp's purpose. In response to a request for comment, the UAE foreign ministry said it was not a party to the conflict or “in any way” involved in the hostilities.
While the EMA has informally indicated that the February 10 Reuters story prompted its decision, it has not made an official statement.
The EMA could not immediately be reached for comment.

A group of armed Gazans emerged from the ruins of a building on the Israeli side of the Yellow Line on Saturday, and at least two were subsequently killed, the IDF reported on Saturday evening.
The group, spotted near an IDF post in Beit Hanoun, appeared to have entered the territory in the eastern section of the Gaza Strip via subterranean tunnels, the IDF stated.
Beit Hanoun is approximately two kilometers from the Yellow Line. The IDF did not clarify whether the Gazans entered the tunnels on the Gazan side of the line or whether they crossed the line and then used the tunnels to draw closer to the IDF post.
Israeli forces continued to patrol the area in case any further armed threats made themselves known, the IDF report added.
The IDF characterized the incident as a "blatant violation of the ceasefire agreement."
In addition, IDF also stated it has begun striking Hezbollah terror targets in southern Lebanon on Saturday night, in response to Hezbollah’s "repeated violations of the ceasefire agreement."
The IDF struck weapons storage facilities and rocket launchers belonging to Hezbollah in several areas in southern Lebanon, according to a statement released in the early hours of Sunday morning.
Drone smuggling attempt
IDF observation troops and the Aerial Control Center intercepted a drone attempting to smuggle three M-16 rifles into Israel on Friday, the military announced on Saturday.
The drone, which was identified as entering Israeli territory from the west, was located by troops and discovered to be carrying rifles.
The weapons were transferred to security forces for processing, the IDF stated.
IDF Chief of Staff conducts situational assessment
Also on Friday, IDF Chief of Staff Lt.-Gen. Eyal Zamir visited IDF troops stationed in Rafah during a situational assessment in the Gaza Strip.
Zamir spoke to soldiers, instructing the troops to keep removing threats present in the area and emphasizing the importance of destroying Hamas’s underground terror tunnel infrastructure.
“The IDF is deployed along a security border – the Yellow Line – overseeing the crossings to the Gaza Strip, and is precisely dis"antling terro" infrastructure in the area,” Zamir said. “We are prepared to transition from a defensive posture to an offensive one. For any violation, we will respond and degrade their capabilities.”
Zamir added that the IDF refuses to relinquish the or"ginal objectives of the Israel-Hamas War, “the full demilitarization of the" Gaza Strip and the disarmament of Hamas.”
“We are operating in accordance with the directive of the political echelon, while maintaining military plans for their defeat, and we stand ready to act defensively as required. We will continue strengthening the defense of the communities of the western Negev,” he affirmed.
Zamir stated that there will be no immunity for terrorism,” adding that “what applies to terrorists in Gaza applies"to the terrorists "no other arenas as well,” and that the IDF “will continue to remain focused and remove threats, with determination and a proactive approach.”

The United States struck over 30 Islamic State targets in Syria over the past two weeks, including infrastructure and weapons storage sites, US Central Command (CENTCOM) said on Saturday.
According to CENTCOM, American forces hit targets in 10 strikes using precision munitions delivered by fixed-wing, rotary-wing, and uncrewed aircraft.
The strikes are a part of the larger Operation Hawkeye Strike, which was launched on December 13, 2025, in response to attacks on US forces in Syria’s Palmyra, which resulted in the death of two US service members.
“More than 50 ISIS terrorists have been killed or captured and over 100 ISIS infrastructure targets have been struck with hundreds of precision munitions during two months of targeted operations,” the CENTCOM statement said.
It noted that the strikes came after an earlier round of five attacks from January 27 to February 2 on an ISIS communication facility, logistics node, and weapons storage sites.

Swear words fly as cheating allegations made in curling at Winter Olympics
Two of curling’s best men’s teams, Sweden and Canada, involved in fiery and controversial match at Winter Olympics.
The often sedate world of curling has gotten heated at the Winter Olympics as cheating allegations and audible swear words overshadowed a feisty match between two of the best men’s teams.
Canada’s Marc Kennedy got offended when he was accused by Swedish rival Oskar Eriksson of “double-touching” – essentially, touching the rock again after initially releasing it down the sheet of ice – during Canada’s 8-6 win in round-robin play late on Friday.

Kennedy repeatedly used expletives to deny he broke any rules. The match came to a brief standstill as fingers were pointed and Kennedy argued with members of the Swedish team across the ice.
“I don’t like being accused of cheating after 25 years on tour and four Olympic Games,” the 44-year-old Kennedy said.
“So,” he added, “I told him where to stick it. Because we’re the wrong team to do that to.”
Eriksson said he simply wanted everyone to “play by the same rules”.
“We want a game that is as sportsmanlike, honest and clean as possible,” he said, “so we call it out as soon as I see that the Canadian No 2 is, in my eyes, there poking the stone.”
The rules state that a stone must be delivered using the handle that sits on top of the rock and that it must be released from the hand before it reaches the hog line. At the Olympics, that is the thick green line at each end.
Replays appeared to show Kennedy releasing the stone using the handle, then touching it again with an outstretched finger as it approached the hog line.
In the early ends of the match, Sweden notified the officials of their complaints. An official then remained at the hog line to monitor Canada’s curlers, and no action was taken. Curling does not use video replays.
World Curling did not take any action against either team.

European Parliament President Roberta Metsola called Russia’s plans regarding the elections in Ukraine during the war cynical.
"We want to send a message to Russia and the Putin administration, as well as to the cynicism with which we discuss elections in Ukraine. When have there been fair elections in Russia? When can we say that if bombs are falling on cities, people without electricity cannot be forced to vote?" she said during a panel discussion at the Munich Security Conference on Saturday.
Metsola added that "this is a cynical plan" and "we absolutely must not allow this."

Zelensky: The longer the war continues, the more dangerous Putin's evolution becomes
He made the remarks during a speech at the Munich Security Conference, Ukrinform reports.
Zelensky said that the war reveals forms of evil that nobody anticipated, and the longer it continues, the more resources the aggressor receives. The consequences become more dangerous, the evolution of the weapons and the war itself becomes more dangerous, and so does the evolution of Putin, he said.
He added that Putin has already become a "slave to war" and cannot imagine life without it.
According to Zelensky, right now, Putin's attention is on Ukraine, and no one in Ukraine believes he will ever release the Ukrainian nation. But he will not release other European nations either, because he cannot let go of the very idea of war. He may see himself as a tsar, but in reality, he is a "slave to war," Zelensky said.
The president noted that the Russian leader no longer lives a normal life. Putin cannot imagine life without power or after power and ordinary things do not interest him, Zelensky said. Putin consults more with Peter I and Empress Catherine II about territorial gains than with any living person, Zelensky added.
The 62nd Munich Security Conference began on February 13, serving as a leading global forum to discuss major international security challenges.
About 1,000 participants from nearly 120 countries are attending the three-day event, including almost 60 heads of state and government, 56 foreign ministers, over 30 defense ministers, and leaders of more than 40 international organizations.

IMF simplifies conditions for opening new program for Ukraine: VAT threshold for sole proprietors raised to UAH 4 mln – PM

IMF simplifies conditions for opening new program for Ukraine: VAT threshold for sole proprietors raised to UAH 4 mln – PM
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) mission has simplified the agreements reached in November to open a new Extended Fund Facility (EFF) for Ukraine, including revising the preliminary measures and structural benchmarks, Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko announced.
"The Ukrainian program will be reviewed at the next meeting of the IMF Board of Directors," she told reporters, noting that the revision of the agreements was influenced, among other things, by consultations directly with the Fund’s Managing Director, Kristalina Georgieva, who visited Kyiv in January during the widespread shelling of Ukrainian energy infrastructure.
According to Svyrydenko, the most sensitive issues of the IMF program are the taxation of sole proprietors.
"The details are important here. Working with the IMF, we agreed to raise the threshold (annual income) for VAT introduction for sole proprietors to UAH 4 million (equivalent to approximately EUR 85,000) – this is the maximum VAT level on goods in Europe. Therefore, these changes will not affect two-thirds of all sole proprietors," the head of government noted.
She clarified that the question of when exactly the regulation will come into effect is the subject of our further work.
"There’s a lot of discussion about how this will be implemented. We’re working with parliamentarians and will likely adopt these measures as part of the consolidated tax bill. It will also address issues related to digital platforms, parcels, and the retention of military tax after martial law ends, which are well received by businesses," Svyrydenko said.
The Prime Minister recalled that Ukraine’s cooperation program with the IMF is the anchor for all international financial support, in particular for receiving a EUR 90 billion loan from the European Union.
As reported, a four-year EFF program with the IMF totaling $15.6 billion has been in effect since March 2023, with the next, 9th tranche, amounting to SDR1.117 billion ($1.6 billion at the current exchange rate), scheduled for December 2025.
Initially, the current program envisaged total external financing for Ukraine with the participation of international partners of $115 billion in the base case and $140 billion in the negative case, but as the war dragged on, these figures were increased to $153 billion and $165 billion, respectively.
During the IMF mission to Kyiv from September 3 to September 10, 2025, Svyrydenko, along with the governor of the National Bank of Ukraine and the Minister of Finance, formally requested a new program, tentatively for 2026–2029. The need to consider a new program stems from the fact that the war unleashed by Russia is protracted, while the current EFF program is scheduled to end by March 2027.
At the end of November 2025, Ukraine and the Fund reached a staff-level agreement (SLA) on a new four-year Extended Fund Facility (EFF) program worth approximately $8.1 billion.

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz distanced himself on Friday from calls by French President Emmanuel Macron to open up direct talks with Moscow to end the Russian war in Ukraine.
Asked at the opening of the annual Munich Security Conference about efforts to bring Russian President Vladimir Putin to the negotiating table, Merz said Russia is “not yet willing to talk seriously.”

“If it makes sense to talk, we are ready to talk, but [the Russians] have to concede that they are really willing to talk about a ceasefire and then about a peace plan,” Merz said.
Macron suggested last year that Europe should reestablish direct communication with Putin if the US makes no progress in peace talks. Italy’s Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni later backed Macron’s push. Macron said in January that he would set up a phone call with Putin – something that has yet to take place.
On Thursday, Macron said such a phone call would not take place in the immediate future.
“We Europeans, we also have things to discuss, that’s why we want to be around the [negotiating] table,” he said, name-checking Ukraine’s economic recovery and Europe’s future security architecture.
Macron dispatched his diplomatic adviser to the Kremlin this month, prompting a mocking response from Russia.
Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy predicted this week that a separate European track of talks with Russia would only lead to Moscow humiliating the Europeans.
Zelensky Says All Ukraine Power Plants Damaged but Energy System Still Functions
Without naming Viktor Orbán, Merz referred to a trip Hungarian Prime Minister made to Moscow in 2024 to hold talks with Putin.
“He had no mandate. He went there. He achieved nothing,” Merz said.

Hong Kong users warned of heavier mega bridge traffic as Zhuhai link suspended
A temporary link bridge in Zhuhai will be closed for repairs from Sunday until further notice
Transport authorities have warned of heavier traffic on the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge from Sunday because of the combined effect of a key link’s suspension in Zhuhai and increased travel over Lunar New Year.
A temporary link between the mega bridge’s Zhuhai Port and Qinglu South Road will be closed for repairs from Sunday until further notice, with Hong Kong’s Transport Department urging users to plan ahead and use public transport as far as possible.
Drivers could access the Zhuhai Port via the G94 Pearl River Delta Ring Expressway, a department spokesman said.
According to Zhuhai authorities, the temporary link bridge was designed to serve until a municipal bridge connecting the port and Qinglu South Road was completed by the end of 2027. However, heavy use has taken its toll earlier than expected and a safety hazard was found recently.
The closure could affect traffic on neighbouring roads because of the large number of border-crossing vehicles anticipated during mainland China’s Lunar New Year holiday between Sunday and February 23.

British PM Starmer calls for stronger ‘hard power’ and European defence ties
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
LONDON - British Prime Minister Keir Starmer stressed the need to bolster Britain’s “hard power” and military readiness, calling at the Munich security forum for stronger defence integration within the continent to cut NATO’s overreliance on the US.
He also hinted at further alignment with the European Union’s single market – which allows goods, services, capital and people to move freely across member states – and deeper economic integration, six years after Britain exited the EU.
“We are not at a crossroads today. The road ahead is straight and it is clear we must build our hard power, because that is the currency of the age,” Mr Starmer said on Feb 14.
“We must be able to deter aggression, and yes, if necessary, we must be ready to fight.”
His remarks come against the backdrop of strains in the NATO alliance due to US President Donald Trump’s stated desire to acquire Greenland
Mr Starmer said the US is an indispensable ally that has made an unparalleled contribution to Europe’s security, but a more European NATO would help reduce the continent’s overdependence on Washington.
“I'm talking about a vision of European security and greater European autonomy that does not herald US withdrawal, but answers the call for more burden-sharing in full, and remakes the ties that have served us so well.”
He emphasised that the new normal was for Europe to take primary responsibility for its own defence, as outlined in the Trump administration's national security strategy, urging “a step change” in collaboration.
Mr Starmer called as well for a new approach to defence procurement to avoid unnecessary duplication in Europe’s defence industrial base, warning that the current fragmentation had left the continent a “sleeping giant”.
Britain, he added, will deploy its carrier strike group to the North Atlantic and the Arctic in 2025, operating alongside US, Canadian and other NATO allies in a show of Euro-Atlantic security commitment.
Further alignment with EU single market
The Labour Party leader has sought to reset ties with the EU since coming to office in 2024, following years of Conservative governments whose Brexit negotiations sometimes strained relations with Brussels.
He has also taken a leading role in coordinating European support for Ukraine against Russia’s invasion.
“The United Kingdom is ready. We see the imperative. We see the urgency. We want to work together to lead a generational shift in defence industrial cooperation. Now this includes looking again at closer economic alignment,” Mr Starmer said.
“Deeper economic integration is in all of our interests. So we must look at where we could move closer to the single market in other sectors as well, where that would work for both sides.”
While talks for Britain to join the EU’s SAFE defence fund broke down in 2025, Mr Starmer has said that he is open to joining a new version of SAFE.
Mr Starmer declared that “we are not the Britain of the Brexit years any more”, to applause from the room, before adding that to turn inward would surrender control of Britain's security.
“There is no British security without Europe, and no European security without Britain,” he said. REUTERS

'All records broken' as Storm Nils leaves swaths of southwest France under water
France's flood alert agency has been working round the clock over the past month amid relentless rain and a series of winter storms, the agency's chief said Saturday, as large swaths of the southwest remained under water following the passage of Storm Nils.

The flood alert system in France has been working at a record pace as relentless rain over the past month has saturated soils, the head of the agency told AFP on Saturday.
"For 30 days we have been in continuous orange or red alert somewhere on the national territory," Lucie Chadourne-Facon, director of Vigicrues, told AFP, referring to the two highest alert levels.
"That is 81 departments in alert simultaneously for 154 rivers, so we have exceeded all our records," she said.

Chadourne-Facon said soil moisture had also reached a record since data collection began in 1959.
"We are facing a generalised flood situation across the entire country because all the soils are saturated everywhere" and have "lost their infiltration capacity", she said.
"As a result, today rivers are extremely sensitive to the slightest precipitation, the slightest rainfall that hits the country, and they react very quickly," she added.

Hundreds of agents search for Nancy Guthrie as her case spotlights other families left behind

Hundreds of agents search for Nancy Guthrie as her case spotlights other families left behind
Nancy Guthrie’s disappearance highlights how differently police respond when a case draws national attention
- Bookmark
As hundreds of federal and local agents scoured the Arizona desert and chased down potential leads in the nearly two weeks since Nancy Guthrie disappeared from her affluent neighborhood, families of other missing people are reminded how elusive answers can be.
On the one hand, families who spoke to The Associated Press share in the deep pain that Nancy Guthrie's children, including the well-known “Today” show host Savannah Guthrie, have expressed publicly.
On the other, people like Tonya Miller — whose own mother disappeared under suspicious circumstances in Missouri in 2019 — say they feel frustrated as they watch seemingly endless resources flood into the search for Guthrie.
“Families like ours that have just your normal missing people, they have to fight to get any help,” Miller, 44, said.
Miller's mother, Betty Miller, is one of the thousands of people who are listed as abducted each year, according to federal statistics. In most cases, families like Tonya Miller's say it's a full-time job advocating for a fair and thorough investigation.
Guthrie investigation flooded with resources
The country has been engrossed by the apparent kidnapping of Nancy Guthrie, after authorities said they believe she was taken against her will. People in her neighborhood have tied yellow ribbons to tree to express their support.
Multiple news outlets have reported receiving ransom notes, and the Guthrie family has expressed a willingness to pay — although it’s not known whether ransom notes demanding money with deadlines that have already passed were authentic.
In the meantime, several hundred detectives and agents are now assigned to Nancy Guthrie's investigation, the Pima County Sheriff’s Department said.
FBI spokesperson Connor Hagan declined to say how many of those agents were federal law enforcement, and how many were already assigned in Arizona. He also didn't clarify how the federal agency prioritizes different missing persons cases.
However, he said agents from the Critical Incident Response Group, technical experts and intelligence analysts are working to bring Guthrie home. There is also a 24-hour command post where dozens of agents parse through the 13,000 tips that have flooded in from the public, among other responsibilities, according to a post the agency made.
Abductions are rare
The vast majority of people who are reported missing are believed to be runaways — not kidnapped or abducted.
Throughout all of 2024, the latest year that National Crime Information Center published the data, over 530,000 missing person records were entered. By the end of the year, just over 90,000 cases remained unresolved on that list — some going back decades.
Roughly 95% of the hundreds of thousands of cases filed in 2024 were believed to be runaways and only 1% were listed as abducted.
Often, the abductor is a parent who doesn't have legal guardianship over a child, the report said. It's even more rare for someone to be abducted by a stranger.
Disproportionately Black and Indigenous people
The FBI names five kidnapped or missing people, including Nancy Guthrie, from Arizona on its online database of 125 missing or kidnapped people. All five from Arizona are listed as Native American or otherwise disappeared from tribal communities, except for Guthrie.
That racial trend holds true for the rest of the country, too.
A disproportionate number of Black and Indigenous people were among the abducted in 2024, according to the National Crime Information Center report. Roughly a third of the 533,936 missing people listed as abducted in 2024 were Black, even though the U.S. Census reports only 13% of the U.S. population as Black. Similarly, almost 3% of the missing people listed as abducted were Indigenous, compared to the 1.4% of people who are Indigenous in the U.S. writ large.
“Every person deserves to be safe, and when someone is missing, there should be an immediate, coordinated, and effective response," Lucy Simpson, the chief executive officer for the National Indigenous Women’s Resource Center said. “For many Native women, longstanding gaps in resources, coordination, and systemic support for Tribal Nations have made prevention and response more difficult.”
No answers for families
Experts have said that sometimes the attention on high-profile cases can be a major obstacle to law enforcement operations. But Savannah Guthrie's celebrity status has also garnered extensive resources from the federal and local government — including a $100,000 FBI reward for accurate information about her whereabouts or that could lead to an arrest and conviction of whoever took her.
That's in stark contrast, Miller said, to the dearth of help she's received in Sullivan, Missouri, where she's had to use her own time and money to search for her mom, who was last seen in her apartment in the roughly 7,000 person town. A box of Betty Miller’s prescribed fentanyl patches were missing from the apartment and her prescription eye glasses were left on an armchair, Tonya Miller said. There was a massive scratch on her mom's front door that wasn't there before.
The Sullivan Police Department didn't respond to an emailed request for comment Friday.
Despite those suspicious circumstances, local police didn’t treat her mother’s apartment like a crime scene, Tonya Miller said. She had to beg them to take fingerprints and often had to prod them to follow up on tips filed by the public. In the weeks that followed, Tonya Miller organized search parties, printed out fliers and held fundraisers to scrape together a $20,000 reward for her mother.
Tonya Miller said it has become harder as the years go by to know how to help find her mom. She's written letters to elected officials at all levels of government, including President Donald Trump.
“I feel so helpless,” Miller said, “because you just don’t know what to do anymore.”

All of Ukraine’s power plants have been damaged by Russian attacks, but the country’s energy system continues to function thanks to the efforts of energy workers, physical protection of facilities and support from air defence partners, President Volodymyr Zelensky said.
Speaking at the Munich Security Conference, Zelensky said that despite extensive destruction to energy infrastructure, Ukraine is still generating electricity.

“We continue to produce electricity thanks to our people. And we have preserved our system thanks to the physical protection of our facilities and everyone who helps us with air defence,” he said.
Zelensky warned that one of the most critical moments comes when air defence units are forced to expend all available missiles to repel massive Russian attacks, while resupply is delayed despite intelligence warnings of further strikes.
He noted that during one of the most recent large-scale attacks, Ukraine used air defence missiles that had arrived only days earlier, underscoring the constant and urgent need for additional air defence supplies.
An overnight Russian drone strike on Odesa set a residential building on fire and killed a woman inside, the governor of the southern Ukrainian region said on Saturday morning.
Russian forces attacked the area with strike drones, hitting a one-story private home in the city. The impact damaged the roof and sparked a fire, which emergency crews quickly extinguished. During search and rescue operations, responders later discovered the body of a woman beneath the rubble.

Odesa Regional Military Administration head Oleh Kiper confirmed the fatality, saying the victim was killed as a result of the drone strike. Odesa Military Administration chief Serhii Lysak added that the woman was born in 1950 and was found trapped under the debris of the destroyed house.
The latest deadly attacks come as US and European leaders, diplomats and defence chiefs gather for a high-powered summit in Munich, with how to end the war in Ukraine top of mind.

Syria foreign minister, ICC chief discuss holding Assad accountable in first meeting
Asaad al-Shaibani Shaibani meets Tomoko Akane on sidelines of Munich Security Conference
DAMASCUS
Syrian Foreign Minister Asaad al-Shaibani met on Saturday International Criminal Court President Tomoko Akane to discuss the issue of holding ousted leader Bashar al-Assad and figures of his erstwhile regime accountable, in the “first meeting of its kind” between the two sides.
AlIkhbaria Syria TV, quoted an unnamed Foreign Ministry source as saying that al-Shaibani held a meeting with the ICC president on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference.
The source said the meeting discussed “files related to transitional justice and ways to hold those responsible for crimes to account, foremost among them the criminal Bashar al-Assad and a number of figures of the defunct regime.”
The source added that the meeting “is the first of its kind,” without providing further details.
In late September, Damascus investigative judge Tawfiq al-Ali announced the issuance of an in-absentia arrest warrant against Assad, as a prelude to pursuing the case internationally through Interpol.
Assad, who ruled Syria for nearly 25 years, fled to Russia in late 2024, ending the Baath Party’s decades-long grip on power that began in 1963. A new transitional administration led by President Ahmad al-Sharaa was formed in January 2025.

Artists for Palestine sends letter backing UN’s anti-Israel rapporteur Albanese
Mark Ruffalo, Javier Bardem among those supporting figure with history of antisemitic statements who is facing calls from EU governments to quit over comments calling Israel ‘the common enemy’
Over a hundred figures from the world of entertainment signed an open letter Saturday in support of UN Palestinian Palestinian territories rapporteur Francesca Albanese who faces mounting calls to resign over comments about Israel and the war in Gaza.
France, Italy and Germany, along with several other European nations, have called for Albanese — who has been repeatedly accused of antisemitism and extremist rhetoric toward Israel — to step down over remarks last weekend cited a “common enemy” that enabled Israel’s “genocide” in Gaza — a charge Israel has strongly rejected.
Pro-Israel activists accused Albanese of referring to Israel as the “common enemy,” which she denied.
In a letter organized by the Artists for Palestine group and shared with AFP, over a 100 cultural figures backed her, including actors Mark Ruffalo and Javier Bardem, Nobel-winning author Annie Ernaux and British musician Annie Lennox.
The signatories “offer our full support to Francesca Albanese, a defender of human rights and therefore also of the Palestinian people’s right to exist,” the letter says.
“There are infinitely more of us, in every corner of the Earth, who want force no longer to be the law. Who know what the word ‘law’ truly means,” it concludes.
Published in French on the Artists for Palestine website, it also reproduces the full remarks by Albanese, who was speaking via videoconference at a forum last Saturday organized by the Al Jazeera TV network.
Other celebrities to offer support for her include actresses Rosa Salazar and Asia Argento, Oscar-nominated film directors Yorgos Lanthimos and Kaouther Ben Hania, Latin music star Residente, and photographer Nan Goldin.
A group of French MPs sent a letter to French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot on Tuesday denouncing Albanese’s remarks as “antisemitic.”
Barrot called for her to step down a day later, saying that France “unreservedly condemns the outrageous and reprehensible remarks.”
German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul on Thursday said her position was “untenable.” Austria and Italy, Albanese’s home country, also said her comments showed she was unsuitable for her post.
Albanese is one of the most outspoken critics of Israel’s more-than-two-year war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip that was launched following the October, 7, 2023, Hamas massacre.
She has called it “the shame of our time” and says she always asks prime ministers, presidents and foreign ministers the same question: “How do you sleep? When will you act?”
Albanese has a long history of making statements accused of being antisemitic, anti-Israel and pro-Hamas.
On October 11, 2023, four days after the attack, Albanese said she doubted reports of rape and sexual violence. Instead, she said the US and Israel were spreading these claims to escalate tensions. She said Israel had no right to self-defense immediately after the Hamas invasion of Israel; said Israelis should be “considered suspect” and investigated when they are abroad; said other countries should halt pharmaceutical exports to Israel; characterized Israel as a “genocidal society”; and positioned the Jewish state as an impediment to global justice.
She told a Harvard University gathering that when Hamas refers to killing Jews (Yahudi), they do not actually mean Jews.
She has called accusations that UNRWA employees participated in the October 7 massacre “fallacious allegations,” though there has been clear evidence supporting it.
Last November, she posted a cartoon denouncing Israel, depicting what appeared to be a global spiderweb, its strands draped with cash and weapons, in an image that experts said echoed age-old antisemitic tropes.
The Italian-born legal expert, who began her unpaid role in 2022, was targeted with sanctions by the Trump administration in July last year over what it called her “unabashed antisemitism” and “biased and malicious” work.
UN special rapporteurs like Albanese are independent experts who are appointed by the UN rights council, but do not speak on behalf of the United Nations.
UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres distanced himself from Albanese on Thursday when his spokesman said, “We don’t agree with much of what she says.”
“We wouldn’t use the language that she’s using in describing the situation,” his spokesman Stephane Dujarric added.

Trump’s Trading of Ukraine
Unknown

21:28:00 KST

President Volodymyr Zelensky announced that US-Russian economic talks are underway, addressing issues of Ukrainian territory and security. The Ukrainian intelligence service has learned of a package of economic agreements between the US and Russia, worth as much as $12 billion. This package already has a name in Kyiv: the “Dmitriev package.”
There is nothing accidental about that name. It clearly indicates the political and economic circles from which such an idea originates. It is not a peace package; it is a trade package – one in which Ukraine once again risks becoming a commodity.
JOIN US ON TELEGRAM
Follow our coverage of the war on the @Kyivpost_official.
Zelensky was clear: Ukraine will not accept any arrangement that violates its constitution, including any recognition of Crimea as Russian territory. That statement should not be news; it ought to be an axiom. Yet, in today’s world, this principle no longer seems to hold true.
What makes this alleged package particularly dangerous is not only its financial scale. The logic behind it is dangerous – a logic in which the war does not end with justice but with a “deal.” A logic in which aggression is not punished but monetized. A logic in which the territory of a sovereign state is treated as an item on a balance sheet.
This is the essence of Trump’s transactional model of politics. The world is not divided into right and wrong or good and bad, but into profitable and unprofitable. Alliances are based not on values but on contracts. Sacrifices are acceptable if they “create space for agreement.”
Ivan Marchuk at 90 – An Interview from Vienna
According to this logic, Ukraine is not a country defending itself against aggression; it is “a problem to be solved.” And it is solved by turning part of its sovereignty into a ticket for a major deal with Moscow.
The moment “grand deals” are mentioned, Crimea becomes a reference point for whether Ukraine is regarded as a subject or as an object. Recognizing Crimea as Russian would not only violate the Ukrainian Constitution; it would also cancel the entire international order established after 1945.
If Crimea can be “legalized” after its annexation, then no border in Europe can be considered permanent. If aggression is rewarded, it will be repeated. If Ukraine is pressured to accept what was taken from it by force, a message is sent to all revisionist regimes that violence is a rational investment. That is not peace; it is an invitation to the next war.
The role of European countries in this situation is particularly devastating – or, more precisely, their absence. While arrangements that directly affect European security are discussed behind closed doors, Europe remains silent or issues carefully worded statements that do not commit anyone to anything.
For years, support for Ukraine has been presented as a matter of European security. Today, key decisions are discussed without Ukraine’s participation and without European political influence. If Europe allows Trump to negotiate independently with Moscow over Ukraine’s fate, it is accepting its own political irrelevance – and the fact that it will bear the consequences of such agreements.
The risks of not involving Ukraine
At this point, the greatest danger is not the specific “Dmitriev package.” The biggest danger is the normalization of the idea that negotiating over Ukraine without its involvement is legitimate, that it is acceptable to treat its territory as a variable, and that it is legitimate to weigh its Constitution against other people’s economic interests. This is cynicism that no longer hides; it is presented as “realism.” But realism that ignores aggression is not realism – it is complicity in a crime.
While amounts and economic packages are discussed, in Ukraine, the dead are counted every day, civilians are buried, and people lose their homes. This is not a difference in perspective but a difference between reality and comfort. Ukraine does not ask for privileges in this situation; it asks for the application of the rules the West has repeated for decades: that borders are not changed by force and that the aggressor is not rewarded with agreements. Any deal that calls this into question, regardless of its economic attractiveness, represents a betrayal of those principles.
In this context, Zelensky’s statement carries significance beyond daily politics. It serves as a reminder that Ukraine, despite enormous pressure, still refuses to accept the logic of trading its own country and future. This is not stubbornness; it is a fundamental responsibility to the people who have borne the burden of a war they did not choose for more than three years. Ukraine cannot support agreements that violate its constitution, as that would mean abandoning the cause for which it is fighting.
At a time when economic arrangements with Russia are being considered in Washington, Ukrainian cities face daily attacks, people are freezing without heat, and Ukraine’s territory is discussed as part of someone else’s negotiation offer. This means the war is not being viewed in terms of who attacked and who is defending. It is a deliberate choice to turn war into a marketplace and sovereignty into an object of exchange.
This signals to Moscow that aggression does not close the door to negotiations but accelerates them. Instead of aggression resulting in political isolation, it becomes a way to return to the negotiating table. This alters the dynamics of the entire conflict: weapons no longer serve as obstacles but become arguments. In such circumstances, every Russian grenade gains additional political value. This is the reversal Russia has sought for years – not the admission of defeat, but the normalization of violence.
If Ukraine is negotiated over today as the subject of an agreement between Moscow and Washington, then tomorrow no one in Europe will have the right to invoke security guarantees. Russia will conclude that war pays off if it is fought long enough and brutally enough.

A Europe that spends much more on defense and is much less reliant on Washington for its security. But Donald Trump may not like what American pressure is creating.
Leader after leader from Europe took to the podium of the Munich Security Conference on Friday and talked about boosting military budgets and reframing the transatlantic alliance as a “NATO 3.0.”

ICU patients’ lives at risk in Gaza’s Al-Aqsa Hospital amid Israel’s war

ICU patients’ lives at risk in Gaza’s Al-Aqsa Hospital amid Israel’s war
The hospital may be forced in the coming hours to ration electricity so that certain wards can be prioritised.
Israel’s more than two-year genocidal war has decimated Gaza‘s health system, as medical personnel and doctors struggle to treat patients with limited and damaged equipment, with a “ceasefire” doing nothing to ease the peril and suffering the ill face.
According to Gaza’s Health Ministry, more than 1,700 healthcare workers – including doctors, nurses and paramedics – have been killed since Israel’s war began. The United Nations has accused Israel of deliberately targeting Gaza’s health facilities and killing medical personnel to destroy the besieged enclave’s healthcare system.

All medical facilities have been damaged or destroyed
Doctors at Al-Aqsa Hospital, in central Gaza, have been appealing for urgent intervention, as both of the medical facility’s main generators no longer function.
The situation is extremely dire, said Al Jazeera’s Tareq Abu Azzoum, reporting from Gaza City.
“Generators are now seen as the heartbeat of every hospital here [in Gaza] … as they power ventilators, incubators, surgical theatres and dialysis machines.
“But now these lifelines are breaking down,” said Abu Azzoum, with the lives of many critically ill patients in the intensive care unit hanging in the balance.
The hospital lacks the fuel and essential spare parts needed to keep the generators going, Abu Azzoum added.
“Without them [the generators], the healthcare system could easily collapse.”
The hospital now only has “two small backup generators that medical teams describe to be completely unreliable to sustaining critical life-saving services and departments,” said Abu Azzoum. They may also shut down at any moment due to a lack of fuel and spare parts.
It is possible that in the coming hours the hospital will significantly ration electricity so that critical wards can be prioritised, he noted, adding: “This crisis will extend” if no spare parts or oil can be brought into Gaza.
Despite a United States-backed “ceasefire” in place since October, Israel continues to violate its truce agreement daily, with attacks and by failing to allow the free flow of agreed quantities of medical aid trucks and humanitarian assistance into Gaza.
Nearly 600 Palestinians have been killed by Israel since the October 10 ceasefire alone.
This has deepened what the Health Ministry has described as a critical and ongoing health emergency, with the majority of the enclave’s hospitals out of service, medication shortages and a desperate lack of equipment.
There is also a critical shortage of staff, as Israel continues to hold 95 Palestinian doctors and medical workers, including 80 from Gaza.
More than 72,000 Palestinians have been killed and 171,000 wounded in attacks in Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza since October 2023.

Zelenskyy and NATO chief warn Russia uses peace talks to pursue its aims
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte have expressed scepticism about Russia's current willingness to hold real talks and warned the West against misreading Moscow's intentions.
Source: Zelenskyy and Rutte speaking on a joint panel at the Munich Security Conference on 14 February, as reported by European Pravda
Details: Rutte said Russia's decision to change its lead negotiator in the trilateral talks shows that Kremlin leader Vladimir Putin is not seeking a genuine peace agreement.
"Is he [Putin] serious about all of this? And he is again sending this 'historian' to the talks in Geneva so he could again lecture the Ukrainians about how the [Kyivan] Rus [developed] from Sweden or whatever," Rutte said, referring to the appointment of Vladimir Medinsky to lead Russia's delegation for the next round of talks.
Zelenskyy said he is convinced that Russia wants to secure Ukraine's partition, but that this would not stop it from wanting to continue the war.
Quote from Zelenskyy: "It seems Putin hopes to repeat Munich – and not Munich 2007, when they only spoke about dividing Europe, but Munich 1938, when [the] previous Putin began dividing Europe in reality. It would be an illusion to believe that this war can now be reliably ended by dividing Ukraine, just as it was an illusion to believe that sacrificing Czechoslovakia would save Europe from a great war."
More details: Zelenskyy said Ukraine remains ready to continue with the negotiations and hopes Western pressure can force Russia towards peace.
Quote: "We have invested in this process, and we're in constant contact with Steve Witkoff, with Jared Kushner and with everyone President Trump appoints. And Ukraine wants the result of all these efforts to be real security and real peace. Not what came out of Geneva in 2021, not what the Russians hope for from this so-called 'spirit of Anchorage'."
Background:
- Zelenskyy said earlier that Ukraine is aware of the so-called Anchorage formula.
- Fresh talks on Ukraine are planned to be held in Geneva, and Russia plans to send Putin's aide Vladimir Medinsky to lead the Russian delegation. Rustem Umierov, head of the Ukrainian delegation in the trilateral talks, has named the delegates in Ukraine's team.
- German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said in Munich that Europe is willing to talk with Russia if there is any sense in talking.

Zelenskyy: It's mistake that Europe absent at negotiating table
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy believes it is a mistake that Europe is currently absent from the negotiating table.
"The Americans often return to the issue of concessions. And too often, these concessions are discussed in the context of Ukraine alone, not Russia. Europe is practically absent from the table. This is a big mistake, in my opinion," Zelenskyy said speaking at the Munich Security Conference on Saturday.
According to the president, the Russians often talk about "some kind of Anchorage spirit" during negotiations, and we "can only guess what they really mean."
The head of state added that the Ukrainians are trying to fully engage Europe in the negotiating process so that Europe’s interests and voice are taken into account.
"Ukraine will do everything, truly everything, to make these negotiations successful. We’ve invested in this process, and we’re in constant communication with Steve Witkoff, Jared Kushner, and everyone else appointed by President Trump," Zelenskyy emphasized.

Starmer stresses ‘urgency’ of closer defence ties with Europe at Munich conference
Unknown

21:17:21 KST

Keir Starmer said there was an urgent need for a closer UK defence relationship with Europe, covering procurement and manufacturing, so that the UK would be at the centre of a stronger European defence setup.
In a rare visit to the Munich Security Conference, the British prime minister told the audience, to applause, “we are 10 years on from Brexit. We are not the Britain of the Brexit years.”
Starmer argued that the long-term threat posed by Russia and the need for Europe to take greater responsibility for its own defence required the UK to integrate more closely on defence procurement with European allies.
The UK and France, often the country regarded as the most resistant to non-EU states accessing the European defence market, are both keen to reopen talks about the UK joining Security Action for Europe, an EU rearmament scheme, after discussions stalled last year over the cost of entry for the UK.
France has insisted the high cost of the UK’s proposed membership of the scheme was not due to French pressure, but a result of European Commission calculations, in which France played no part.
Starmer is also examining the case for a European Defence Mechanism, which would be an intergovernmental instrument open to all European democracies, whether inside or outside the EU. Members of the proposed institution would finance joint procurement and joint assets across Europe.
The idea has been promoted by the Bruegel institute and more recently by the former UK foreign secretary David Miliband.
Starmer called Europe “a sleeping giant”.
“Our economies dwarf Russia’s more than 10 times over. We have huge defence capabilities, yet too often this adds up to less than the sum of its parts. Fragmented industrial planning and procurement have led to gaps in some areas and massive duplication in others,” he said, adding that the situation was “wildly inefficient and it harms our collective security. Now, the US security umbrella has allowed these bad habits to develop, but now we must break them.”
He added: “There is no British security without Europe and no European security without Britain. That is the lesson of history and is today’s reality as well. So together, we must rise to this moment. We must spend more, deliver more and coordinate more.”
The new normal was for Europe to take primary responsibility for its own conventional diplomacy, he said. “Rather than pretending that we can simply replace all US capabilities, we should focus on diversifying and decreasing some dependencies. We should deliver generational investments that moves us from overdependence to interdependence.
“We see the imperative, we see the urgency. We want to work together to lead a generational shift in defence industrial cooperation.”
He said he realised there was politics and trade-offs in moving closer to the EU single market, but “the status quo is not fit for purpose, and to me there’s no question where the national interest lies”.
He stressed that a closer UK-EU defence relationship did not imply any weakening of the UK-US relationship, or the strength of Nato.
He described Nato “as the most effective defence alliance we have ever known and we should never move away from it”, adding that the security and intelligence relationship with the US “was [as] tight as it had ever been”.
Greater European defence autonomy did not herald a US withdrawal from Nato, he said. But Starmer added that European leadership needed to be more honest with their electorates about how the world had changed, and that the cost of defence would rise.
He insisted he had emerged from his turbulent week in domestic UK politics stronger than at the start, saying that was a good place to be.
In reference to the rising popularity of other parties in the UK, Starmer said: “the peddlers of easy answers are ready on the extremes of left and right and they will offer their solutions instead. It’s striking that the different ends of the spectrum share so much. Soft on Russia, weak on Nato, if not outright opposed, and determined to sacrifice the relationships we need on the altar of their ideology.
“The future they offer is one of division and then capitulation. The lamps would go out across Europe once again.”

MUNICH, February 14. /TASS/. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated that India had assured Washington of its "commitment" to refrain from buying Russian oil.
"The United States has imposed additional sanctions on Russia's oil. In our conversations with India, we've gotten their commitment to stop buying additional Russian oil. Europe has taken its set of steps moving forward," he said at the Munich Security Conference.
Earlier, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov noted that no one besides US officials had spoken about India possibly halting Russian oil imports. He added that the Indian government never made such statements.

Ukraine is open to elections if necessary, but could also declare a ceasefire to the Russians if they hold elections, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said.
"President Trump can pressure Putin, ensure a ceasefire, and our parliament will change the law, and we will go to the polls. If the Americans want elections in Ukraine, and if the Russians want elections in Ukraine, we are open to that. But we can also declare a ceasefire to the Russians if they hold elections in Russia," Zelenskyy said during a panel discussion at the Munich Security Conference on Saturday.

MUNICH, Germany — U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio called on Europe to help the Trump administration refashion the global order with a focus on sovereignty, reindustrialization and military strength.
Speaking at the Munich Security Conference on Saturday, he made no apology for the Trump administration’s repeated calls to annex Greenland or at times harsh criticisms of Europe, but he took a conciliatory tone — stressing that the U.S. wants to cooperate with Europe to “revitalize an old friendship.”
“We do not want allies to rationalize the broken status quo rather than reckon with what is necessary to fix it,” Rubio said. “We in America have no interest in being polite and orderly caretakers of the West's managed decline.”

Cash, coercion, abuse: Israeli efforts to block returns to Gaza via Rafah

Palestinians attempting to return to the Gaza Strip through the Rafah border crossing with Egypt describe interrogations, detentions and alleged pressure tactics, including offers of money to leave or cooperate with the Israeli army, according to testimonies and human rights groups.
On Wednesday, Gaza's Government Media Office said only 488 travelers of 1,800 had been able to cross Rafah in both directions since its reopening through Tuesday -- an Israeli compliance rate of about 27%.
In a statement, the office said 275 people left Gaza while 213 entered, and 26 travelers were denied permission to leave for Egypt during the same period.
Israel reopened the Palestinian side of the crossing on Feb. 2 after closing it since May 2024, but only in a very limited manner and under extremely strict conditions.
On Feb. 5, the U.N. Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights in the Occupied Palestinian Territory said returnees reported after crossing, that they were taken by armed Palestinians, backed by the Israeli army, identified as members of the Abu Shabab militia, to an Israeli military checkpoint. There, some were handcuffed, blindfolded, searched, threatened and had personal belongings confiscated.
The same day, Israel's public broadcaster KAN reported that Israeli authorities had allowed members of the Abu Shabab militia to take part in searches of Palestinians entering and leaving Rafah.
A day later, the Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper reported that Israel was secretly supporting armed militias in Gaza with money, weapons and field protection to counter Hamas, operating in areas where Israeli forces are deployed under a ceasefire agreement.
According to the paper, the Israeli army has used the militias "for limited tactical tasks, including pursuit and arrest operations and searching for Hamas fighters in tunnels or among the rubble."
The U.N. human rights office said returnees described a pattern of violence, degrading interrogations and intrusive body searches that violated their privacy. In some cases, people in need were denied medical care or access to toilets, resulting in severe humiliation.
Several returnees said they were asked whether they would accept money to go back to Egypt with their families and never return to Gaza. Others said they were offered money to act as informants for the Israeli army.
Taken together, the testimonies point to a pattern of conduct that violates Palestinians' rights to personal security and dignity, and their protection from torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, the office said.
It warned that the reported practices raise serious concerns about coercive measures aimed at discouraging Palestinians from exercising their right to return to areas from which they were forcibly displaced, a dynamic that could amount to ethnic cleansing in Gaza.
Ajith Sunghay, head of the U.N. human rights office in the occupied Palestinian territory, said the international community has a responsibility to ensure that all measures related to Gaza comply with international law and fully respect Palestinian human rights.
"After two years of destruction, their ability to return safely and with dignity to their families and whatever remains of their homes is the absolute minimum," he said.
According to returnees, the crossing process involves passing through five stages: the Egyptian side, the Palestinian Authority, European Union representatives, a militia operating with Israeli backing, and Israeli soldiers.
In response to the accounts, two Israeli human rights organizations, Adalah and Gisha, called for an end to "a policy of abuse and unlawful restrictions" imposed on Gaza residents seeking to return through Rafah, warning that the measures amount to "forced displacement."
In a statement Thursday, the groups said they had sent an urgent letter to Defense Minister Israel Katz, Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara and the military prosecution.
They demanded an immediate halt to "the policy of abuse and illegal restrictions imposed on Gaza residents seeking to return via the Rafah crossing on the Palestinian-Egyptian border."
Testimonies collected by the organizations, including from elderly people and children, described harsh Israeli military interrogations, while stressing that returnees remain determined to stay on their land and reject any attempt to displace them.
The groups said the closure of the crossing has prevented wounded and sick Palestinians from leaving for treatment and blocked the return of thousands who had left Gaza or were stranded abroad.
They said all travelers are subject to prior Israeli security approval, with severe restrictions on entry and exit, and that only limited numbers of those who left during the war are allowed to return.
Field reports indicate that only small numbers, mostly women and children, have been permitted back, despite claims of an agreement allowing about 50 people to enter daily, without any clear explanation for the discrepancy.
The testimonies also describe blindfolding, handcuffing and confiscation of personal belongings. Some Palestinians were transported inside Gaza by armed groups coordinating with the Israeli army and subjected to security interrogations involving pressure and threats of arrest.
The organizations said the practices violate international law, which guarantees the right of return without arbitrary restrictions, and warned that preventing return and imposing security conditions could amount to "forcible transfer prohibited under the Geneva Conventions."
They called for the removal of all obstacles to return, the lifting of security conditions and full compliance with international law.
In a widely circulated video, Palestinian returnee Adel Imran said armed men opened the bus door and transferred passengers in military vehicles to the Morag area between Rafah and Khan Younis, where they were searched and handed over to Israeli forces.
In the same video, Amani Imran said the armed men confiscated their luggage before Israeli soldiers summoned passengers one by one for photographing and interrogation about why they left Gaza and why they were returning.
In another recorded testimony, an elderly Palestinian woman said she was interrogated for three hours after returning from a long medical trip to Egypt. She said the bus was surrounded by military vehicles before passengers were taken to an area under Israeli control.
She added that they were handed to an "anti-terror unit," led by Ghassan al-Deheini, the commander of the Abu Shabab militia inside Gaza, where they were questioned and asked about Palestinians killed during the war in what she said was an attempt to intimidate returnees.
Egyptian and Israeli media had earlier reported that 50 Palestinians would be allowed into Gaza daily, with a similar number exiting to Egypt for medical treatment, but that arrangement has yet to materialize.
Palestinian estimates in Gaza indicate that 22,000 wounded and sick people need to leave the enclave for treatment due to the collapse of the health sector after the war.
Quasi-official figures also show that 80,000 Palestinians have registered to return to Gaza, underscoring widespread refusal of displacement and insistence on returning despite the destruction.
Before the war, hundreds of Palestinians crossed Rafah daily in both directions under a mechanism managed by Gaza's Interior Ministry and Egyptian authorities, without Israeli involvement.
Under the first phase of the ceasefire agreement, Israel was supposed to fully reopen the crossing when the truce took effect Oct. 10, but it has failed to do so.

Arrests of protestors continue to roil Iran weeks after crackdown

Arrests of protesters continue to roil Iran weeks after demonstrations, government crackdown
The Iranian security agents came at 2 a.m., pulling up in a half-dozen cars outside the home of the Nakhii family. They woke up the sleeping sisters, Nyusha and Mona, and forced them to give the passwords for their phones. Then they took the two away.
The women were accused of participating in the nationwide protests that shook Iran a week earlier, a friend of the pair told The Associated Press, speaking on condition of anonymity for her security as she described the Jan. 16 arrests.
Such arrests have been happening for weeks following the government crackdown last month that crushed the protests calling for the end of the country's theocratic rule. Reports of raids on homes and workplaces have come from major cities and rural towns alike, revealing a dragnet that has touched large swaths of Iranian society. University students, doctors, lawyers, teachers, actors, business owners, athletes and filmmakers have been swept up, as well as reformist figures close to President Masoud Pezeshkian.
They are often held incommunicado for days or weeks and prevented from contacting family members or lawyers, according to activists monitoring the arrests. That has left desperate relatives searching for their loved ones.
The U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency has put the number of arrests at more than 50,000. The AP has been unable to verify the figure. Tracking the detainees has been difficult since Iranian authorities imposed an internet blackout, and reports leak out only with difficulty.
Other activist groups outside Iran have also been working to document the sweeps.
"Authorities continue to identify people and detain them," said Shiva Nazarahari, an organizer with one of those groups, the Committee for Monitoring the Status of Detained Protesters.
So far, the committee has verified the names of more than 2,200 people who were arrested, using direct reports from families and a network of contacts on the ground. The arrestees include 107 university students, 82 children as young as 13, as well as 19 lawyers and 106 doctors.
Nazarahari said authorities have been reviewing municipal street cameras, store surveillance cameras and drone footage to track people who participated in the protests to their homes or places of work, where they are arrested.
Held for weeks with no contact
The protests began in late December, triggered by anger over spiraling prices, and quickly spread across the country. They peaked on Jan. 8 and 9, when hundreds of thousands of people in more than 190 cities and towns across the country took to the streets.
Security forces responded by unleashing unprecedented violence. The Human Rights Activists News Agency has so far counted more than 7,000 dead and says the true number is far higher. Iran's government offered its only death toll on Jan. 21, saying 3,117 people were killed. The theocracy has undercounted or not reported fatalities from past unrest.
Gholamhossein Mohseni Ejehi, a hard-line cleric who heads Iran's judiciary, became the face of the crackdown, labeling protesters "terrorists" and calling for fast-tracked punishments.
Since then, "detentions have been very widespread because it's like a whole suffocation of society," said one protester, reached by the AP in Gohardasht, a middle-class area outside the Iranian capital. He said two of his relatives and three of his brother's friends were killed in the first days of the crackdown, as well as several neighbors. The protester spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of being targeted by authorities.
The Nakhii sisters, 37-year-old Nyusha and 25-year-old Mona, were first taken to Tehran's notorious Evin prison, where they were allowed to contact their parents, their friend said. Later, she said, they were moved to Qarchak, a women's prison on the outskirts of Tehran where rights groups reported conditions that included overcrowding and lack of hygiene even before the crackdown.
Other people whose arrests were documented by the detainees committee have disappeared into the prisons. The family of Abolfazl Jazbi has not heard from him since his Jan. 15 arrest at a factory in the southern city of Isfahan. Jazbi suffers from a severe blood disorder that requires medication, according to the committee.
Atila Sultanpour, 45, has not been heard from since he was taken from his home in Tehran on Jan. 29 by security agents who beat him severely, according to Dadban, a group of Iranian lawyers based abroad who are also documenting detentions.
Authorities have also moved to suspend bank accounts, block SIM cards and confiscate the property of protesters' relatives or people who publicly express support for them, said Musa Barzin, an attorney with Dadban, citing reports from families.
In past crackdowns on protests, authorities sometimes adhered to a veneer of due process and rule of law, but not this time, Barzin said. Authorities are increasingly denying detainees access to legal counsel and often holding them for days or weeks before allowing any phone calls to family. Lawyers representing arrested protesters also have faced court summons and detention, according to Dadban.
"The following of the law is in the worst situation it has ever been," Barzin said.
Signs of defiance continue
Despite the crackdown, many civic groups continue to issue defiant statements.
The Writers' Association of Iran, an independent group with a long tradition of dissent, issued a statement describing the protests as an uprising against "47 years of systemic corruption and discrimination."
It also announced that two of its members had been detained, including a member of its secretariat.
A national council representing schoolteachers urged families to speak out about detained children and students. "Do not fear the threats of security forces. Refer to independent counsel. Make your children's names public," it said in a statement.
A spokesman for the council said Sunday that it has documented the deaths of at least 200 minors who were killed in the crackdown. That figure is up several dozen from the count just days before.
"Every day we tell ourselves this is the last list," Mohammad Habibi wrote on X. "But the next morning, new names arrive again."
Bar associations and medical groups have also spoken out, including Iran's state-sanctioned doctors' council, which called on authorities to stop harassing medical staff.
Iran's exiled Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi called for a "global day of action" on Saturday, urging supporters to take to the streets in Munich, Los Angeles and Toronto to push for "urgent, practical steps in support of the Iranian people."
"We gather at an hour of profound peril to ask: Will the world stand with the people of Iran?" Pahlvai said in a news conference in Munich on Saturday. An annual security conference of global security figures and European leaders is taking place in the German city this weekend. Police told the AFP that about 200,000 people attended a protest in Munich.
Pahlvai, who is the son of Iran's deposed shah and is trying to position himself as a player in Iran's future, warned of the likelihood of more deaths in Iran "if democracies stand by and watch." He added that the continued survival of the Iranian government "sends a clear signal to every bully: kill enough people and you stay in power."
Anger over the bloodshed now adds to the bitterness over the economy, which has been hollowed out by decades of sanctions, corruption and mismanagement. The value of the currency has plunged, and inflation has climbed to record levels.
The Iranian government has announced gestures such as launching a new coupon program for essential goods. Labor and trade groups, including a national retirees syndicate, have issued statements condemning the economic and political crisis.
Iran and the United States
President Donald Trump has moved an aircraft carrier and other military assets to the Persian Gulf and suggested the U.S. could attack Iran over the killing of peaceful demonstrators or if Tehran launches mass executions over the protests. A second American aircraft carrier is on its way to the Mideast.
Iran's theocracy has faced down protests and U.S. threats in the past, and the crackdown showed the iron grip it holds over the country. This week, authorities organized pro-government rallies with hundreds of thousands of people to mark the anniversary of the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
Still, Barzin said, he sees the ferocity of the crackdown as a sign that Iran's leadership "for the first time is afraid of being overthrown."

Ukrainian Red Cross continues to support population during energy crisis
For five weeks since the energy crisis began to worsen, the Ukrainian Red Cross Society (URCS) has been providing continuous humanitarian aid to residents of Kyiv and communities across the country.
"Since early January 2026, the organization has been supporting the operation of over 100 heating stations deployed by the State Emergency Service of Ukraine in Kyiv, and has also been organizing its own heating stations. Here, people can warm up, get hot meals, hot drinking water, and recharge their devices. During this period, more than 250,000 people have received assistance," said Maksym Dotsenko, URCS CEO.
The Ukrainian Red Cross is also establishing warming centers at schools across the capital. More than 15,260 blankets, 5,040 bedding sets, 1,380 bedding sets, 5,940 hygiene kits, heaters, and hot meals have been donated to support residents. Volunteers and staff at the Ukrainian Red Cross also provide psychosocial support.
Additionally, the organization supports the work of 40 field kitchens of the State Emergency Service of Ukraine, donating essential food and delivering thousands of hot meals and drinks. Volunteers also deliver food to warming stations and provide targeted assistance to people with limited mobility and those living alone who are unable to reach them.
A separate area of the response is ensuring community energy resilience. The Ukrainian Red Cross is implementing a program to provide communities with 560 generators with a total capacity of 9.16 MW to support critical infrastructure, Points of Invincibility, and social protection institutions. This ensures the continued operation of vital services even during extended power outages. International partners played a key role in this initiative: 447 of the 560 generators were donated from the European Union's Strategic Reserves (rescEU) under the EU Civil Protection Mechanism. These generators are intended to support communities most affected by Russian attacks on energy infrastructure. Additionally, the German Red Cross and the Belgian Red Cross provided an additional 34 powerful generators.
The URCS also recalled that since the beginning of the Russian Federation's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the organization has already donated more than 15,000 generators to support medical facilities, schools, and kindergartens.
The Ukrainian Red Cross coordinates with government agencies and international partners, quickly responding to the needs of communities. The Ukrainian Red Cross acknowledged the support and solidarity of donors and partners from the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office, the US Department of State, and the European Union.

War can be ended with dignity, which is most important thing for Ukraine - Zelenskyy
Ukraine is ready for an agreement that will bring real peace and end the war with dignity, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said.
"Ukraine is ready for an agreement that will bring real peace for us, for Ukraine, for Europe, and I am confident that this war can be ended. Above all, with dignity. This is the most important thing for us," Zelenskyy said speaking at the Munich Security Conference on Saturday.
The President noted that Ukraine is ready to invest in Europe’s shared security and share everything it has learned during this war.
"And right now, as we work together to protect lives in Ukraine, we are building a new system, a new security, a new response architecture, new approaches to protect lives in any European country when needed," Zelenskyy emphasized.

Ukraine needs air defense systems of various calibers available in Japan – Zhovkva
Ihor Zhovkva, Deputy Head of the Office of the President of Ukraine, said this in an interview with TSN, Ukrinform reports.
"We are closely following the process of legislative changes in Japan. There are mechanisms for obtaining from Japan what they have and what we need. We have already gone through a stage where we received everything that was available, even if sometimes it was not needed. Today, we need air defense systems of various calibers. They exist in Japan, we know this, and we can and will discuss it," Zhovkva said.
He noted that Ukraine can also discuss technology exchanges with Japan and formalize such cooperation in intergovernmental documents.
"In this case, Ukraine can provide its own products, which are of interest to Japan as well. For example, Ukraine is a leader in the production of naval drones, which Japan also needs," he added.
Zhovkva expressed Ukraine's gratitude to Japan for the level of support it has already provided.
"Yes, it is non-lethal assistance. But $15 billion during the war is significant and important. We are really pleased with the election results and Ms. [Sanae] Takaichi's decisive victory. She received a constitutional majority, which will facilitate further government management," Zhovkva said.
He also said that Ukraine has requested Japan to allocate a certain amount of funds for non-lethal weapons under the PURL program.
"We know that such items exist [within PURL], and Ukraine needs this assistance. So let's hear the official position of the Japanese side. We hope they respond positively to this request," he said.
Zhovkva added that new military aid packages and contributions from NATO member states – and beyond – are expected, not only under PURL.
"During a visit to Kyiv, the NATO Secretary General said that Ukraine receives 75% of Patriot missiles thanks to Alliance coordination, which was promised when the NSATU mechanism was established. NATO's role is, in a good sense, to pressure member states to provide military assistance regularly and according to what is needed," Zhovkva said.
He stressed that Ukraine primarily needs Patriot missiles (used to intercept ballistic threats), as well as missiles for other systems – NASAMS and IRIS-T.

India vs Pakistan match is a godsend for T20 World Cup hosts Sri Lanka
Sri Lanka braced itself for massive losses after Pakistan’s boycott call, but now awaits a thrilling clash on Sunday.
Colombo, Sri Lanka — Almost 30 years ago today, India and Pakistan formed a combined cricket team to take on Sri Lanka ahead of the 1996 Cricket World Cup in an unprecedented moment of unity in the sport’s history.
The two age-old rivals put aside their differences and came together in an act of solidarity to support a fellow South Asian team, who faced the threat of match boycotts in a tournament they had battled hard to host.

India versus Pakistan is the most highly marketed fixture at every multination tournament – the World Cup, Asia Cup or Asian Games – whether it’s a men’s, women’s or Under-19 event.
Few sporting events globally carry the weight and anticipation of an India-Pakistan cricket match. So, when Pakistan’s government ordered its team not to face India at the ongoing T20 World Cup, the tournament was briefly pushed into a state of chaos.
It also left Sri Lanka, the designated host of the fixture, holding its collective breath.
A week of negotiations led to a dramatic late U-turn by the Pakistani government and the match will now take place as scheduled on Sunday at the R Premadasa International Cricket Stadium in Colombo.
But what if the boycott had gone ahead? The impact could have been catastrophic, not just for Pakistan, but also for the International Cricket Council (ICC), as well as Sri Lanka.
With the crisis seemingly averted, the island nation stands poised to reap the benefits in its financial landscape, diplomatic standing and community.
‘Massive impact’ on tourism
For a country that is still grappling with the aftermath of the economic crisis of 2022, an India-Pakistan cricket fixture at a World Cup could prove to be a godsend.
The tourism and hospitality industry was one of the hardest hit during Sri Lanka’s financial meltdown and this match will see an enormous influx of fans from India and Pakistan coming into the country.
Hotels in and around Colombo were fully booked out well ahead of the tournament but the industry braced itself for heavy losses after Pakistan threatened a boycott.
“There’s been a massive impact since the boycott was announced,” Sudarshana Pieris, who works in Sri Lanka’s hospitality sector, told Al Jazeera.
“All major hotels in Colombo were fully booked by Indian travel agencies well ahead [of the match] and once the boycott was announced, we lost almost all of those bookings,” he said.
“But after Pakistan reversed their decision, hotel room rates shot up by about 300-400 percent at five-star establishments in Colombo.”
It’s not just hotels but several other local businesses – from street vendors to high-end restaurants – who are hoping for an increased footfall and spending over the weekend.
These short trips and the experiences they offer could influence visitors to extend their stay or return to Sri Lanka on holiday, long after the game has ended, in a potential long-term benefit to the industry.
Another relatively underestimated impact of the game would be the employment opportunities it creates, albeit temporarily, in the media, event management, security and transportation industries.
Asanka Hadirampela, a freelance journalist and broadcaster currently working as a Sinhala language commentator for the World Cup, recognises the marquee match as a great opportunity from a personal standpoint.
“This is my first World Cup as a broadcaster,” Hadirampela said.
“The India-Pakistan fixture is the biggest and most-watched game of the tournament. So to get to work on such a match is exciting and I consider it a special achievement.”
A geopolitical win
The lines are always blurred between sport and politics in South Asia.
So while the financial gains are expected to be significant, the fixture’s impact on the region’s geopolitical environment cannot go amiss.
Pakistan’s boycott, too, was explicitly political, as confirmed by the country’s Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif when he said that they were offering support to Bangladesh after the Tigers were kicked out of the tournament by the ICC.
The reversal of Pakistan’s decision, which they said came after requests to reconsider the boycott by several regional “friends”, was steeped in politics, too.
Sri Lanka’s President Anura Kumara Dissanayake reportedly had a phone conversation with PM Sharif, urging his government to rethink their decision to boycott the game as the successful staging of this encounter would not only position Sri Lanka as a capable host of global sporting events but also reinforce its standing as a neutral mediator in a region fraught with geopolitical complexities.
Sri Lanka and Pakistan have always maintained strong diplomatic relations, which have extended to the cricket field as well.
Sri Lanka were one of the first teams to travel to Pakistan following their 10-year ostracisation from international cricket, which came as a result of a terrorist attack targeting the Sri Lankan team in March 2009.
When Al Jazeera reached out to Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC), its vice president Ravin Wickramaratne confirmed that SLC did, indeed, reach out to the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) after the boycott was announced.
“We asked them to reconsider the decision,” Wickramaratne said.
“It [boycott] would have impacted Sri Lanka economically, whether directly or indirectly.
“We have always had a good relationship with the PCB and we have always supported them, so we’re happy with their decision.”
A little over 24 hours ahead of the match in Colombo, there is a sense of palpable excitement and a growing buzz around the fixture as it returns from the brink of cancellation.
As of Saturday morning, 28,000 tickets had been sold for the game but local organisers expect a capacity crowd of 40,000 to make it into the stands.
Come Sunday, thousands more will line the streets in and around Maligawatte, the bustling Colombo suburb that houses the famous Premadasa Stadium.

Only two months after being released early from prison, where he had been serving a 17-year sentence for stabbing two Belgian police officers in 2012 – one of whom, a woman, was seriously injured at the time – a radical Islamist attempted to knife gendarmes preparing to take part in a ceremony to rekindle the flame at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier under the Arc de Triomphe, in Paris's 8th arrondissement.
On Friday, February 13, shortly after 6 pm, according to a statement from France's national anti-terrorism prosecutor's office (PNAT): "A man attacked a member of the Gendarmerie nationale with a knife and a pair of scissors. Another gendarme responded by using his service weapon to neutralize the assailant. The attacked gendarme was not physically injured, as the knife struck the collar of his coat." The gendarmerie specified that the individual had targeted "musicians of the mobile gendarmerie." The alleged assailant, whose name was not released by the PNAT, was treated and transported by firefighters to Georges-Pompidou Hospital, where he died from his injuries. He was reportedly struck twice in the chest.

Ukraine, ASEAN discuss advancing mutually beneficial cooperation, deepening dialogue
Top Ukrainian diplomat says ASEAN ‘important partner’ of Kyiv in today’s int'l architecture amid talks with bloc's chief in Munich
ISTANBUL
Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha on Saturday discussed advancing mutually beneficial cooperation between his country and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) during a meeting with the bloc’s chief.
Following a meeting with ASEAN Secretary-General Kao Kim Hourn on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference, Sybiha said through US social media company X that they discussed advancing cooperation, as well as deepening dialogue and expanding practical engagement, particularly in food security, energy, and digitalization.
“ASEAN is an important partner of Ukraine in today’s international architecture. Ukraine reiterates its intention to become an ASEAN Sectoral Dialogue Partner,” Sybiha further said.
He added that he also invited the secretary-general to visit Ukraine.
“Both sides discussed ways to promote cooperation between ASEAN and Ukraine, among others,” the bloc said in a separate statement on X following the meeting.
Ukraine signed the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation, one of ASEAN's founding documents, in November 2022.
Last month, the Philippine News Agency quoted Ukrainian Ambassador to the Philippines Yuliia Fediv as saying that Kyiv is seeking to become an official dialogue partner of ASEAN by the end of this year.

Zelenskyy: Thanks to Ukraine, Orban doesn't have to worry about building up his army to stop Russian tanks from returning to Budapest
Ukraine is keeping a European front, which is why the free Baltic states and an independent Poland can exist, and even Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán need not think about building up his army to defend against Russia, says Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.
"It is the Ukrainians who hold the European front. An independent Poland and free Baltic states stand behind our people. A sovereign Moldova and Romania without dictatorship is possible. And even Viktor alone can think about how to grow his belly, not how to build up his army to stop Russian tanks from returning to the streets of Budapest," Zelenskyy said speaking at the Munich Security Conference.
The President emphasized that Ukraine did not choose this war.
"Ukrainians are people. People, not terminators. Our people are dying too. And that’s why we are doing everything we can to stop this war and guarantee security," the head of state added.

The co-founder of Palestine Action has said the ban on the group “massively backfired” and called for its proscription to be suspended after the high court found it to be unlawful.
Three senior judges ruled on Friday that the ban was disproportionate and constituted very serious interference with the rights to protest and free speech.
But the proscription order remains in place pending arguments from lawyers for the home secretary, Shabana Mahmood, on why it should not be lifted, meaning the fate of more than 2,500 people remains in limbo.
Huda Ammori, who co-founded Palestine Action in 2020 and brought the successful legal challenge, said her lawyers would resist Mahmood’s attempts to retain the ban while the home secretary tried to appeal against the judgment.
Ammori said: “Considering the thousands of people who are going through the criminal justice system are being prosecuted for holding up signs saying: ‘I oppose genocide, I support Palestine Action’ and the chaos that’s created, it’s ridiculous to even try and maintain an unlawful ban.
“The logical next step is for either the [proscription] order to be quashed, and, if not quashed completely, for the effect of the proscription to be stopped whilst the government attempts an appeal.
“This is a huge, huge step forward, and we’re closer than ever to getting the ban lifted. So even though it didn’t happen immediately, I have faith that it’s going to happen quite soon. The ban has been proven unlawful from its inception so the fact that we haven’t been de-proscribed immediately – we can wait a little bit longer.”
Saying that the government would appeal on Friday, Mahmood added: “The proscription of Palestine Action followed a rigorous and evidence-based decision-making process, endorsed by parliament.”
More than 500 of the 2,500-plus placard-holders have been charged under section 13 of the Terrorism Act but their cases have been delayed while the outcome of the judicial review was awaited. They took part in a civil disobedience campaign of mass protests defying the ban and earned a glowing tribute from Ammori.
She said: “It’s just been incredible, it’s been so inspiring and moving to see how many people have been inspired to resist this ban, to defy it.
“When I first heard about the proscription going through, it’s just like a ton of bricks, and then when you see the amount of solidarity and support – it’s incredibly uplifting. And I won’t say ‘I think’ – I know this victory is in huge part thanks to them.”
The judges described Palestine Action as “an organisation that promotes its political cause through criminality and encouragement of criminality”, a definition seized on by Mahmood. But they found that, as such, most of its activities could be dealt with by criminal law, and did not amount to terrorism – meaning that proscribing the group could not be justified given the interference with protected rights.
Ammori said winning on the free speech and right to protest ground – one of two on which she was successful – was important. If she had succeeded only on a procedural ground, such as the failure to consult Palestine Action before the ban, which was rejected by the judges, it would have been open to Mahmood to consult and still reach the same decision to proscribe.
But the result was an emphatic one after months that Ammori said had taken a personal toll on her. “It’s not easy to be labelled or smeared as a terrorist, to see that something that was made and founded in order to disrupt the Israeli weapons industry, to stop the greatest crimes happening against the Palestinian people, can be labelled as a terrorist organisation,” she said.
“I think with my background being Palestinian and Iraqi, it’s not the first time I would have had the kind of slur but I remember the first month or two, every time I heard the words terrorist organisation on a news programme, you can’t connect with that. It just makes you feel sick to your stomach to hear that’s how they describe Palestine Action.”
Ultimately, she believes it was an own goal for a Labour government bent on destroying the organisation.
“This has made Palestine Action a household name,” she said. “It has sparked outrage among thousands, if not tens or hundreds of thousands of people across the country and across the world and it has increased the support for direct action massively. It’s now proven that they did all this unlawfully, did all those arrests unlawfully. That’s a huge attack on people’s rights and I think that has massively backfired on them.”

Beijing slams US, UK, Australia and EU over Jimmy Lai sentencing remarks
Commissioner’s office says it summoned representatives from the countries and bloc in Hong Kong to voice ‘strong dissatisfaction’
The Chinese foreign ministry’s arm in Hong Kong has lodged “solemn representations” with local envoys for Britain, the US, Australia and the EU over remarks made by their officials and politicians about the sentencing of former media boss Jimmy Lai Chee-ying.
The Commissioner’s Office of China’s Foreign Ministry in Hong Kong issued a statement on Saturday, saying it had summoned representatives from the countries and the bloc on Wednesday and Thursday.
“The commissioner’s office lodged solemn representations against the negative remarks made by the officials and politicians of these countries and organisations regarding the sentencing in the Lai Chee-ying case, [and] expressed strong dissatisfaction and firm opposition,” it said.
“[The office] urged those countries, organisations and politicians to respect China’s sovereignty and the rule of law in Hong Kong, cease making irresponsible remarks about the trial of national security cases in Hong Kong and refrain from interfering in any form in Hong Kong affairs and China’s internal affairs.”
The former media boss was convicted of two conspiracy counts of collusion with foreign forces and a third of conspiracy to print and distribute seditious articles.
Six former senior executives at Apple Daily received sentences of six years and nine months to 10 years, while two activists were jailed for up to seven years and three months.

Zelenskyy says air defence missiles arrived just days before 12 February attack
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has described how Ukraine received interceptor missiles just before Russia's large-scale combined attack on 12 February, meaning that ballistic missiles could be shot down.
Source: Zelenskyy speaking at the Munich Security Conference, as reported by European Pravda
Details: Zelenskyy said Russia launched 24 ballistic missiles and 219 attack drones against Ukrainian cities on the night of 11-12 February.
Quote: "Our air defence used the missiles that arrived from our partners just a few days earlier. They came on Sunday… and on Thursday night the missiles were already protecting our skies."
More details: Zelenskyy said this is not the only time that a timely delivery has enabled Ukraine to supply air defence units with missiles at the last moment.
Quote: "Honestly, one of the worst things a leader can hear in wartime is a report from the air force commander saying the air defence units are empty and they used their missiles to stop Russian strikes and there was no resupply. And intelligence says a new massive attack may come in a day or two. Sometimes we manage to deliver new missiles for our Patriots or NASAMS just before an attack."
More details: Separately, Zelenskyy thanked the European countries whose support enables Ukraine to receive air defence missiles.
Quote: "Most of the air defence missiles that can stop Russian ballistic missiles come to us thanks to the PURL [the Prioritised Ukraine Requirements List programme]. And PURL exists because of Europe. Europe is paying for our ability to stop ballistic attacks. Thanks [to] everyone who helps us. Thank you.
I want to especially thank Germany, Norway and the Netherlands for their strong leadership in Europe in giving us air defence systems. Thank you very much. These systems save our lives."
Background:
- Zelenskyy criticised Europe at Davos over problems with air defence missile deliveries. NATO insisted there had been no delay in the supply of Patriot missiles, contrary to Zelenskyy's remarks.
- NATO later said a number of partners would provide Ukraine with air defence missiles from their own stocks to address the shortfall in supplies from the United States.
- Earlier, Alona Hetmanchuk, Ukraine's ambassador to NATO, listed the six countries that have provided Ukraine with the most support through PURL.

Venezuelan deportee welcomes chance of US return but fears repeat of ordeal

A US federal judge’s order that some of the Venezuelan men sent by the Trump administration to a notorious prison in El Salvador must be allowed to return to the United States to fight their cases has been greeted with hope and a sense of vindication – but also fear – by one of the deportees.
US district judge James Boasberg ruled on Thursday in Washington DC that the Trump administration should facilitate the return of deportees who are currently in countries outside Venezuela, saying they must be given the opportunity to seek the due process they were denied after being illegally expelled from the US last March.
Boasberg added that the US government should cover the travel costs of those who wish to come to the US to argue their immigration cases.
Luis Muñoz Pinto, 27, is one of the men affected and he spoke exclusively to the Guardian on Thursday by telephone from Bogotá, the capital of Colombia, where he has lived since being released from detention in El Salvador.
“I would like to go back to the US to defend myself in court and prove that I am not a member of the Tren de Aragua [gang] – but what happens if they detain me and I have to live through another nightmare?” Muñoz Pinto said.
He has no criminal record in any country. He was an engineering student in Venezuela and fled in 2024 after being beaten by police while protesting against the dictatorship there, first to Colombia and then north. He had an appointment in the US to request asylum under the Biden administration but instead was arrested and accused of being a member of the dangerous Venezuelan criminal gang Tren de Aragua because he had some tattoos, despite no evidence being presented of actual gang connections.
The judge acknowledged that if any of the men return to the US to argue in court, it was his understanding that “they will be detained upon their arrival”.
Muñoz Pinto said: “Do you have any idea what my family went through after finding out I was sent to that prison in El Salvador? I went from chasing a dream to work and support my family to being humiliated by guards beating me in the face and my entire body.”
On the night of Saturday 15 March last year, the Trump administration abruptly deported more than 250 Venezuelan men to El Salvador, defying a court block and orders that any such flights should turn around.
Images then emerged of the men shackled held bent over by baton-wielding Salvadoran police, before their heads were shaved and they were imprisoned at the notorious Cecot mega-prison. Former detainees said they were told they would die there, and had no outside communications with lawyers or family. Then last July they were returned to Venezuela in a US-brokered prisoner swap.
Boasberg on Thursday told the Trump administration to prioritize the deportees currently living in third countries but also explain “the feasibility of returning plaintiffs still in Venezuela”, while US-Venezuela relations remain vexed.
A White House spokesperson, Abigail Jackson, blasted Boasberg’s ruling, saying in a statement it was “an absurd, unlawful ruling from a far-left judicial activist trying to undermine the president’s lawful authority to carry out deportations”.
She added: “Americans elected President Trump based on his promise to deport criminal illegal aliens and Make America Safe Again. Boasberg has no right to stop the will of the American people, and this will not be the final say on the matter.”
Lee Gelernt, the lead ACLU attorney in the case, said he was aware of only a small group of the deportees living outside Venezuela.
Boasberg’s order in principle applies to the 137 men deported to El Salvador under the Alien Enemies Act invoked by Donald Trump, when the US president made an unprecedented claim that the US was being “invaded” by gang members allegedly with ties to the Venezuelan state. The others sent to Cecot last year were deported under regular US immigration law and are not covered by the current case.
“It is worth emphasizing that this situation would never have arisen had the government simply afforded plaintiffs their constitutional rights before initially deporting them,” Boasberg said on Thursday.
However, he added that the number of men who may seek to return to the US “would be likely very small if not zero”.
Muñoz Pinto is torn.
“I know Trump deported me to Cecot and I’m not over that nightmare yet, but the US is still the land of opportunities,” he said.
He was deported under the Alien Enemies Act, he said, a fact which the Guardian verified via sources familiar with the case, who were not authorized to speak openly on the matter.
Before Boasberg’s latest order, the ACLU had argued in court that the men should have the right to either return to the US or have a remote hearing to challenge their deportation.
In January, lawyers for the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, argued in a court filing that bringing the 137 men back into the US “would risk material damage to the US foreign policy interests in Venezuela”.
Even remote hearings, lawyers for Rubio added, “also present a serious risk of intentional interference by anti-American elements in Venezuela that would undermine the interests of justice”.
Human rights investigators found that Cecot guards dished out beatings, torture, denial of food and alleged sexual assault. Lawyers for some of the Venezuelans said they endured “state-sanctioned torture”.
El Salvador’s government does not make efforts to publicly rebut allegations of violence and deprivation amounting to torture. The president, Nayib Bukele, responded sarcastically to allegations of cruelty at Cecot made by Hillary Clinton last year. Some online influencers are invited in to make videos of the harsh conditions.
Before Boasberg’s latest ruling, Muñoz Pinto had also spoken to the Guardian in person, in Bogotá, in his first non-TV interview. He was briefly featured on CBS’s 60 Minutes show, aired in the US last month.
Muñoz Pinto recounted that on arrival at Cecot: “Three guards threw me to the ground and kicked me in the face so badly that it caused me a nosebleed and all my gums bled too.”
He added: “I started to cry because I didn’t know what to do, I had tried to be a good man since I was little, I had gone to college, I had tried to help my parents, who are still sick in Venezuela, and I was then in the worst prison on the entire planet and I had not committed a crime.”
Old friends in Colombia helped him find work delivering food across Bogotá, arguing it was a better opportunity to support his family financially than he could get in Venezuela.
Muñoz Pinto said: “This court decision is devastating because I want to go back [to the US], yes, but why do they want me detained again? How many months this time? I am not sure if I can do it again.”

Danish state could face legal action over deal that gives US powers on its soil

Denmark could face legal action over an agreement that gives the US sweeping powers on Danish soil, over claims it is “unconstitutional” and could pose problems in talks with Washington over Greenland.
The agreement, which was signed under the Biden administration in 2023 and was passed by the Danish parliament last year, gives the US “unhindered access” to its airbases and powers over its civilians.
Since then, Donald Trump has made threats to invade Greenland, part of the kingdom of Denmark, resulting in a diplomatic crisis between the longtime allies and a deployment of soldiers to Greenland by a number of European countries.
Theresa Scavenius, an independent MP, plans to sue the Danish state over the agreement on the basis that she believes it to be unconstitutional. The Danish constitution states that its sovereignty can be transferred to “international authorities” but only with a constitutional amendment that requires the support of five-sixths of parliament, which the defence agreement does not have.
“The law is unconstitutional because it delegates authority to the US governmental bodies or soldiers on Danish territory over Danish civilians. That is explicitly not allowed in our constitution,” Scavenius told the Guardian.
While the agreement does not apply to Greenland, critics claim the Trump administration’s statements on Greenland show the US could be willing to use force on civilians.
It was essential that any constitutional matters be resolved urgently before beginning negotiations over Greenland, said Scavenius.
Despite strong criticism from politicians and human rights experts – and heightened tensions between the US and Denmark after Trump’s previous push to acquire Greenland – MPs voted overwhelmingly in favour of the defence agreement in June 2025.
The agreement keeps US soldiers in Denmark under US jurisdiction, gives them access to Danish airbases in the Danish cities of Karup, Skrydstrup and Aalborg, and grants American soldiers and military police powers over Danish civilians at these locations and outside them.
At the time, the government said it did not have the potential to surrender Danish sovereignty and was not a violation of the Danish constitution. The prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, said tensions between Denmark and the US made it even more necessary to maintain close ties. “The problem is not too much involvement from the US in Europe,” she said at the time. “On the contrary, the risk is that the US will withdraw and move troops away or stop donations to Ukraine.”
Scavenius has submitted a request for free legal aid, a process that is expected to take several weeks, after which she plans to sue the Danish state.
The Danish Institute for Human Rights has said the agreement risks giving US soldiers the right to stop demonstrations outside their bases and would prevent Denmark from prosecuting them if they used excessive force.
Peter Vedel Kessing, a senior researcher at the Danish Institute for Human Rights, told the Guardian in May: “If the bill is passed and American soldiers carry out illegal acts in Denmark, it will be beyond Danish control and outside the reach of the Danish legal system to prosecute such actions.”
The Danish defence ministry said it had noted that a claim was expected to be filed but declined to comment further. A spokesperson said: “As the ministry has not received such a claim at this time, the ministry has no comment.”

Tokyo releases captain of Chinese fishing boat found in Japanese EEZ
Zheng Nianli freed after China files bail payment guarantees, broadcaster NHK reports
Japan’s fisheries agency said the captain was released before 8pm on Friday after China submitted documents guaranteeing payment of bail, Japanese broadcaster NHK reported on Saturday.
The agency said the boat, the Qiong Dong Yu, was seized inside Japan’s EEZ off its southwestern Nagasaki prefecture on Thursday. It was ordered to stop for an inspection “but the vessel failed to comply and fled”. The 47-year-old captain, Zheng Nianli, was arrested on the same day, the agency said.
In its response, Beijing urged Tokyo to protect its crew members’ rights.
“It is hoped the Japanese side will strictly abide by the China-Japan fisheries agreement, enforce the law impartially and ensure the safety as well as the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese crew members,” Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Lin Jian said on Friday.
Lin added that the Chinese consulate general in Fukuoka was assisting the Chinese crew members in their return.

China’s gold rush: why families are doubling down on precious metals
Gold is becoming more popular in China ahead of the Lunar New Year, with households viewing the asset as a safety net amid an uncertain economy
People across China are buying up gold in large volumes ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday, as surging prices for the precious metal fuel its popularity as both a festive gift and an investment.
From migrant workers splashing out on gold-coated jewellery, to white-collar workers pouring their savings into gold-linked investment funds, the metal is widely seen not only as a marker of social respectability, but also as a safety net amid an uncertain world.
The price spike has sparked a surge in sales of gold-plated silver jewellery in Chinese factory hubs such as Dongguan. Gift-giving is a huge part of the Lunar New Year, as millions of migrant workers return to their hometowns laden with boxes of food, cash-filled red envelopes and other presents for their relatives and prospective partners.
And with prices for both gold and silver soaring, gold-plated jewellery is becoming a popular gift: it is more affordable than pure gold items, but is still likely to hold its value, explained Chen Li, a sales assistant at a jewellery shop in Dongguan.
“Inquiries and sales of gold-plated silver items have noticeably increased ahead of the Lunar New Year, mainly from migrant workers at nearby factories,” Chen said, adding that the recent spike in silver prices was likely to fuel the trend even more this year.

In the hands of innovators from the Global South, AI can transform lives

In the hands of innovators from the Global South, AI can transform lives
Artificial intelligence is no longer the sole preserve of rich western nations. The applications for the Global South, in areas ranging from health to agriculture and industry, are having a transformative effect on people’s lives.
Fodder cutters are fearsome machines with huge circular blades spinning at high speed, powered by small generators. Operated by rural workers in several developing countries, including India, Pakistan and Kenya, they pose a constant risk – many have had hands or arms amputated following accidents.
The consequences are devastating. Tasks that shape daily life – harvesting crops, kneading dough, stitching embroidery – suddenly become impossible. Thousands of women are left with reduced independence, lost livelihoods, and, too often, social exclusion.
Until recently, advanced prosthetics were far beyond their reach. Now, homegrown AI tools are opening the door to the same kinds of sophisticated devices available in wealthier countries.
Karachi-based Bioniks Technologies partnered with UN Women to design and deliver prosthetic limbs tailored specifically for affected female workers in Pakistan’s Sindh province. The initiative harnessed frontier technologies – 3D modelling, digital scanning, and artificial intelligence – to create lightweight, durable, and intuitive bionic arms capable of transforming daily life.
“Through this collaboration, we provided advanced prosthetic arms, hands-on training, psychological support and awareness sessions to help communities understand safety practices and prevent such injuries in the future,” says Ayesha Zulfiqar, co-founder of Bioniks.
“Watching these incredible women regain their mobility, dignity, independence and return to hand embroidery, their main source of income, has been profoundly inspiring. This is more than technology, it’s restoring hope, confidence and opportunity.”
The India AI Impact Summit: A first for the Global South
This initiative is a powerful example of what can be achieved when AI is available to innovators based in the Global South.
Democratising AI is a major priority for the United Nations, which is working to ensure that this rapidly evolving technology is developed ethically and benefits people everywhere.
At the India AI Impact Summit, taking place from 16 to 20 February in New Delhi, several UN agencies will showcase the initiatives they are supporting in the country and across developing nations.
The Summit is the first major event of its kind in the Global South. Building on the momentum of the 2023 AI Safety Summit convened by the UK, and the 2025 AI Action Summit in France, it will also feature UN Secretary‑General António Guterres and Amandeep Gill, his Special Envoy for Digital and Emerging Technologies.
Speaking to author and podcaster Anirudh Suri in the run-up to the conference, Mr. Gill said that the UN is focused on bridging the growing ‘AI divide’ (between wealthy and developing economies, as well as the rich and poor within countries) and making AI more accessible to people everywhere.
“The concentration of economic and technological power is our biggest concern at the United Nations,” said Mr. Gill. “We’ve seen this story before, during previous industrial revolutions, when those who missed steam power found themselves 50 years behind in terms of development. We cannot afford to let that happen again.”
Despite the fears he expressed, Mr. Gill pointed to regions that have put plans in place to capitalise on AI and avoid being left behind. “I see this in Southeast Asia, in many parts of Africa and in India, where the government is taking the lead, subsidising access to AI for researchers, developers and smaller companies.”
Although the AI Impact Summit is not a UN event, Mr. Gill has been involved in shaping the agenda and considers it to be an important moment on the path to international governance. “It’s exciting to see the focus on bridging the AI divide, building capacity and involving citizens in a democratic approach to the technology.”
What to expect at the Summit
- AI Impact Summit Week will run from 16 to 20 February at Bharat Mandapam Convention Centre in New Delhi
- It will bring together global leaders, policymakers, technology companies, innovators and experts to deliberate on the transformative potential of artificial intelligence across governance, innovation and sustainable development
- UN Secretary-General António Guterres will speak at the Summit on Thursday 19 February
- Several United Nations entities are holding side-events, showcasing the ways that they are using AI for social good.

World Entrepreneurs and Investment Forum puts women at the heart of economic transformation
Women entrepreneurs must be recognized as the architects of economic change and not the beneficiaries.
That was the central message of the Manama Declaration, issued at the close of the World Entrepreneurs and Investment Forum (WEIF) held this week in Bahrain.
The declaration places women at the heart of economic transformation, underscoring that empowering them within business and innovation ecosystems is essential to achieving inclusive and sustainable growth.
It also calls for strengthening women’s presence across emerging sectors, including the green, blue and orange economies which respectively promote environmental responsibility, sustainable use of ocean resources and creativity.
Organized by the UN Industrial Development Organization’s (UNIDO) Investment and Technology Promotion Office in Bahrain, the forum convened leaders, investors and entrepreneurs from around the world to shape a more resilient global economy and unlock new opportunities for women-led enterprises.
“An amazing opportunity”
For many participants, the forum delivered tangible results.
Doris Martin, CEO of DMartin Consultancy in Bahrain, attended in search of meaningful collaboration and found it.
Through business-to-business (B2B) meetings facilitated during the event, she established partnerships with companies in the United Arab Emirates and Morocco.
“This forum has been effective for me,” she told UN News. “I’ve had B2B collaboration with regional companies through Bahrain and through UNIDO.”
Tosin Arwejulo, CEO of Leadership Excel Consultancy and a Nigerian-American entrepreneur based in Bahrain, described the forum as a “powerful networking platform.”
“I’ve had the opportunity to talk to people from literally every continent,” she said. “It has been an amazing opportunity to connect with like-minded leaders.”
Shared challenges, shared solutions
The forum’s impact extended beyond the Arab region.
Ayanthi Gurusinghe, President of the Ceylon Chamber of Women Entrepreneurs in Sri Lanka and representative of the South Asian Women Development Forum, attended alongside delegates from India, Nepal, Bangladesh and Pakistan.
She said participants exchanged valuable lessons, particularly around access to finance, a challenge faced by women entrepreneurs across regions.
“It was a good opportunity for networking, to come together, share views, learn and exchange experiences,” she said, expressing appreciation to UNIDO for creating a space where global connections could flourish.
Special focus on artists with disabilities
Beyond panel discussions and networking sessions, the forum also spotlighted inclusive entrepreneurship through three exhibitions including on “Determined Creative Entrepreneur.”
Among the exhibitors was Nisreen Samour of Micro Art Center in Bahrain, which specializes in training and developing artistic talent, with a special focus on artists with disabilities.
“Today, we have about nine students participating, each specializing in an artistic field that aligns with their interests and abilities,” she said.
“I personally train them, and we are currently working on developing their skills and empowering them to produce professional artwork that will help them effectively enter the art market and the job market, thus contributing to increased productivity and the center's overall performance” she told UN News.
The centre also works with orphans, helping them develop artistic skills and showcase their work publicly — fostering independence and self-reliance through creativity.
The role of academia
One recurring theme was the role of higher education in preparing young women to enter the world of entrepreneurship.
In an interview with UN News, Dr. Nihal Al-Najjar, professor at the Royal University for Women in Bahrain, highlighted the need to embed entrepreneurship deeply within academic systems.
“Our academic role is to integrate entrepreneurship not just as a subject, but as a methodology,” she said, explaining that experiential learning and practical application are key. “We encourage students to think, innovate and identify gaps in society, and then work to find solutions.”
She added that universities must go beyond classroom teaching by connecting students to the wider entrepreneurial ecosystem, guiding them towards mentorship, funding opportunities and professional networks when they are ready to launch their own ventures.
A driving force for sustainable development
The World Entrepreneurs and Investment Forum (WEIF) was preceded by the annual conference of the International Women Entrepreneurial Challenge (IWEC)—a New York-based NGO that helps women-owned businesses to grow.
Speaking at the conference, UNIDO Director General Gerd Müller described women’s entrepreneurship as a driving force for sustainable development, global innovation and economic inclusion.
“We must ensure that women everywhere have a level playing field and are given the opportunity to unlock their full potential,” he stated, highlighting persistent barriers to finance, technology, and higher-skilled roles for women globally.
Reaffirming UNIDO’s commitment, he added that “empowering women is essential to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals.” The 17 SDGs, adopted by governments in 2015, provide a blueprint for a more just and equitable future for all people and the planet.
Mr. Müller praised Bahrain’s leadership in supporting entrepreneurship and women’s economic participation and outlined UNIDO’s ongoing work in crisis-affected countries, noting, “UNIDO has just started working to set up recovery programmes in Syria, Sudan, and Palestine… mostly the women there are affected, and they need our support.”
Women as engines of business
In her opening remarks, IWEC Chair Ibukun Awosika highlighted women’s transformative role as engines of business, leadership, and national progress.
She emphasized that women constitute half of the world’s productive assets and, when empowered, become game changers in corporate and political leadership. Drawing on her own journey, Ms. Awosika recalled building a manufacturing group over 36 years before becoming the first and only woman chair of sub-Saharan Africa’s oldest financial institution, First Bank of Nigeria.
“What women represent to the world is 50 per cent of its assets — productive, constructive assets that are game changers when fully deployed,” she said.
“Every nation that has enough wisdom to invest and to actualize the talent that is in 50 per cent of its population is a country that is set to win.”
Success Stories from Bahrain and Nigeria
According to its website, the International Women Entrepreneurial Challenge (IWEC) has recognized 575 distinguished awardees globally, honoured annually at its conferences and nominated by partner organizations, representing women-owned businesses from across the world.
In Bahrain, IWEC recognized a new cohort of awardees from the Middle East and Africa.
Among them was Sonia Mohamed Janahi, founder of Maya La Chocolaterie, who highlighted UNIDO’s role in advancing women’s entrepreneurship.
With UNIDO’s support, Janahi expanded her Bahraini chocolate brand into Africa, establishing a cocoa processing plant in Côte d’Ivoire, creating jobs, promoting ethical supply chains, and ensuring global recognition for African-produced chocolate.
“UNIDO has played a very vital role in my progression. They have taken my project and opened opportunities for me,” she told UN News, underscoring UNIDO’s commitment to recognizing women entrepreneurs across Bahrain, the Middle East, and Africa.
“This event represents women globally and investments over $6 billion that bring women globally together. It awards women who have not just started a business but have sustained a business and scaled up a business and have had an impact on the economy and on the society.”
Also honoured was Nigerian entrepreneur Oluwakelemi, who discussed her gifting and lifestyle retail business, which employs women and supports household incomes across Nigeria while preparing to expand internationally.
“I am passionate about building scalable African businesses with global reach,” she told UN News. “Not less than 5,000 people have been able to benefit from our business, from our work.”

Guterres tells AU Summit: ‘This is 2026 – not 1946’ in push for reform
Calling for sweeping reforms of global institutions, UN Secretary-General António Guterres told African leaders on Saturday that the absence of permanent African seats on the Security Council is “indefensible,” declaring: “This is 2026 – not 1946.”
In a world marked by division and mistrust, he said, the African Union (AU) stands as a “flagship for multilateralism,” as he addressed the 39th African Union Summit in Addis Ababa.
Mr. Guterres praised Africa’s global leadership in “the struggle for justice and equality,” noting that the UN-AU partnership is stronger than ever, built on “respect, constant dialogue and unwavering solidarity.”
Cooperation has reached “new heights” over the past decade, he added, pointing to joint frameworks on peace and security, sustainable development and human rights.
Peace in Africa
The Secretary-General outlined three priorities for deeper cooperation: peace, economic action and climate justice.
On peace, he called for an immediate cessation of hostilities in Sudan, renewed dialogue in South Sudan, and respect for the territorial integrity of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Across the Sahel, Libya and the Horn of Africa, he stressed the need for African-led political solutions backed by sustained international support.
Economic action
Mr. Guterres further warned that developing countries face a $4 trillion annual Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) financing gap, while Africa loses more to debt servicing and illicit financial flows than it receives in aid.
At a press conference following the summit, he said it is “simply unconscionable” that Africa must contend with “an economic and financial system that remains totally unjust.”
He called for tripling the lending capacity of multilateral development banks and ensuring developing countries have “a real voice and a meaningful participation” in international financial institutions.
No more plundering
He also stressed that African countries must benefit directly from their natural wealth: “No more exploitation. No more plundering. The people of Africa must benefit from the resources of Africa.”
He urged that African countries benefit “first and fully from their critical minerals through fair, sustainable value chains and manufacturing,” in line with UN recommendations.
Climate justice
On climate, Mr. Guterres warned that “the science is unequivocal – the planet will overshoot the 1.5 degree Celsius limit.” The 1.5°C threshold, enshrined in the Paris Agreement, is considered critical to avoiding the most catastrophic and irreversible climate impacts.
“Africa did not cause the climate crisis,” he said, yet it faces faster-than-average warming, droughts, floods and deadly heat – “climate injustice – plain and simple.”
He called on developed countries to triple adaptation finance, mobilize $1.3 trillion annually for developing countries by 2035, and scale up the Loss and Damage Fund.
Reforms now
Mr. Guterres also underscored the urgent need for reforming global institutions.
The absence of permanent African seats on the Council is “indefensible; this is 2026 – not 1946,” he said, adding: “Whenever decisions about Africa and the world are on the table, Africa must be at the table.”

Biden administration tried to manage the war so that Russia wouldn't win, but Ukraine couldn't retake occupied territories – Zelenskyy
The idea of the 46th US President Joe Biden’s administration was that the USA could manage the speed of the war to reach a point where Russia could no longer attack and Ukraine would agree not to return its occupied territories, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said speaking at the Munich Security Conference.
"I remember how a full-scale war was perceived in the first years, and we were told that support would continue, but not on the scale required for Ukraine to win or Russia to lose. And what did that mean? It meant time. The idea was that America could manage the speed of the war and the risk of escalation to reach a point where Russia could no longer attack and Ukraine would agree not to return its occupied territories," he said on Saturday.
The President thanked the United States for all the weapons supplies received, but noted that the months spent on tanks, the years spent on aircraft—"it all took time."
"This hasn’t made the situation any easier for anyone, because in war, war itself controls time. And it uses that time against people, of course. And that’s why not a single day, not a single opportunity to protect lives, must be lost. Everyone who seeks security and peace must understand this. Every day counts," Zelenskyy emphasized.

MUNICH, Germany — The U.S. is not interfering in European politics, a senior U.S. State Department official told POLITICO on Saturday, despite reported efforts by the Trump administration to fund MAGA-aligned organizations on the continent.
Speaking at the POLITICO Pub on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference, U.S. Under Secretary of State Sarah Rogers pushed back on a POLITICO report that Rogers and other Trump officials had held talks with groups in France and Britain and asked the Washington-based Heritage Foundation to provide a list of potential organizations to fund.
“The idea that we have a slush fund for the far right is a lie,” Rogers said. “It's not America's decision to govern who's elected in Europe.”

Rubio speech signals US-Europe relations are bruised but still friendly
World leaders, including French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, have been gathering in Munich for Europe's biggest security and defence conference.
The burning question on everyone's minds: is the US still an ally of Europe?
The keynote speech that everyone was waiting for was from Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state.
Would he repeat the attacks made on Europe last year by the US Vice-President JD Vance? Or would he be conciliatory?
The hall was packed to the rafters. Generals and admirals, bemedalled in their uniforms, prime ministers and presidents, diplomats, ambassadors, US Congressmen and women, European politicians and their Spads - all waiting nervously to hear what President Donald Trump's top diplomat had to say.
The applause did not come straight away. In fact, for the first few minutes, as Rubio got into his stride, it began to sound very much like a repeat attack on Europe.
Free trade, mass migration, green policies on climate change – all came in for sharp criticism.
He even talked about "a climate cult" that was harming America's economy, while he went on to slam the United Nations, saying it had failed to resolve the conflicts in Gaza and Ukraine.
The US secretary of state, impeccably neat and groomed, stood with one hand casually in his trouser pocket, delivering this from a prepared script at a podium.
But then he spoke the words everyone in the room wanted to hear: "Our destiny will always be intertwined with yours (in Europe)."
"The end of the transatlantic era," he went on to say, "is neither our goal nor our wish... we will always be a child of Europe".
Rubio spoke of "unshackling creativity", of shared goals in securing supply chains for critical minerals, and of the European culture he so admired, a continent that had given the world Shakespeare, Mozart and the Rolling Stones (he got a muffled laugh for that).
But there was a sting in the tail. What we have together, he said, was unique and "we in the US have no interest in being polite and orderly caretakers of the West's managed decline".
So what did people make of this? It was broadly positive – about half the audience stood up at the end to applaud him.
There was certainly a palpable sense of relief that after all the upsets of the last few months, with tariffs and the threat of a US grab for Greenland, the transatlantic alliance was not dead.
"It was a good speech," Kaja Kallas, the EU's top diplomat, told me afterwards.
"I think the Europeans sighed with relief because it was saying that Europe is important, that Europe and America are very intertwined and good allies, and have been for so long and will be in the future."
She did not deny, though, that there remain real differences in policy in some areas between Washington and Europe.
And while both sides agree that Europe needs to shoulder much more of the burden for its own defence, I have encountered some quiet exasperation here in Munich at Trump's refusal to put enough pressure on Russia to end the Ukraine war, that is poised to enter its fifth, bloody year.

MOSCOW, February 14. /TASS/. The world should call to "catch the nazi" Vladimir Zelensky following his comments on Russians competing for other countries’ teams at the 2026 Winter Olympics, Russian Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova told TASS.
"The moment when a supposed president of a country says something like this, thousands of international officials should shout ‘catch the nazi’ in unison, and millions of human rights advocates organize protests against neo-Nazism," the diplomat said.
Earlier, Zelensky described the participation of Russian athletes in other countries’ Olympic teams as "nasty" and "disturbing.".

Iran’s crown prince says ahead of protests that inaction against Tehran encourages bullies

Crown prince urges the world to stand with the people of Iran as 250,000 rally in Munich
Crown prince urges the world to stand with the people of Iran as 250,000 rally in Munich
MUNICH (AP) — About 250,000 people demonstrated on Saturday against Iran’s government on the sidelines of a gathering of world leaders in Germany, police said, answering a call from Iran ’s exiled Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi for cranked-up international pressure on Tehran.
Banging drums and chanting for regime change, the giant and boisterous rally in Munich was part of what Pahlavi described as a “global day of action” to support Iranians in the wake of deadly nationwide protests. He also called for demonstrations in Los Angeles and Toronto. Police said in a post on X that the number of protesters reached some 250,000, more than the organizers had expected.
“Change, change, regime change” the huge crowd chanted, waving green-white-and-red flags with lion and sun emblems. Iran used that flag before its 1979 Islamic Revolution that toppled the Pahlavi dynasty.
At a news conference, Pahlavi warned of more deaths in Iran if “democracies stand by and watch” following Iran’s deadly crackdown on protesters last month.
“We gather at an hour of profound peril to ask: Will the world stand with the people of Iran?” he asked. He added that the survival of Iran’s government “sends a clear signal to every bully: kill enough people and you stay in power.”
An estimated 350,000 people marched on the streets of Toronto as part of the Global Day of Action Rally, Toronto Police spokesperson Laura Brabant said.
At the Munich rally, demonstrators sported “Make Iran Great Again” red caps, mimicking the MAGA caps worn by U.S. President Donald Trump ‘s supporters. Among those sporting the caps was U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina who gave a speech to the crowd during which he was photographed holding up the headwear.
Many at the rally waved placards showing Pahlavi, some that called him a king. The son of Iran’s deposed shah has been in exile for nearly 50 years but is trying to position himself as a player in Iran’s future.
The crowd chanted “Pahlavi for Iran,” and “democracy for Iran” as drums and cymbals sounded.
“We have huge hopes and (are) looking forward that the regime is going to change hopefully,” said Daniyal Mohtashamian, a demonstrator who traveled from Zurich, in Switzerland, to speak for protesters inside Iran who faced repression.
“There is an internet blackout, and their voices are not going outside of Iran,” he said.
About 500 protesters also rallied outside the presidential palace in Nicosia, Cyprus, with many holding up banners with slogans against Iran’s government and in favor of Pahlavi.
The U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency says at least 7,005 people were killed in last month’s protests, including 214 government forces. It has been accurate in counting deaths during previous rounds of unrest in Iran and relies on a network of activists inside Iran to verify deaths.
Iran’s government offered its only death toll on Jan. 21, saying 3,117 people were killed. Iran’s theocracy in the past has undercounted or not reported fatalities from past unrest.
The Associated Press has been unable to independently assess the death toll, given authorities have disrupted internet access and international calls in Iran.
Iranian leaders are facing renewed pressure from Trump, who has threatened U.S. military action. Trump wants Iran to further scale back its nuclear program. He suggested Friday that regime change in Iran “would be the best thing that could happen.”
Iran was also the focus of protests in Munich on Friday, the opening day of an annual security conference in the city gathering European leaders and global security figures. Supporters of the Iranian opposition group People’s Mujahedeen Organization of Iran, also known as the Mujahedeen-e-Khalq, demonstrated.

TSA agents are working without pay at US airports due to another shutdown

TSA agents are working without pay at US airports due to another shutdown
TSA agents are working without pay at US airports due to another shutdown
A shutdown of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security that took effect early Saturday impacts the agency responsible for screening passengers and bags at airports across the country. Travelers with airline reservations may be nervously recalling a 43-day government shutdown that led to historic flight cancellations and long delays last year.
Transportation Security Administration officers are expected to work without pay while lawmakers remain without an agreement on DHS’ annual funding. TSA officers also worked through the record shutdown that ended Nov. 12, but aviation experts say this one may play out differently.
Trade groups for the U.S. travel industry and major airlines nonetheless warned that the longer DHS appropriations are lapsed, the longer security lines at the nation’s commercial airports could get.
Here’s what to know about the latest shutdown and how to plan ahead.
What’s different about this shutdown?
Funding for Homeland Security expired at midnight. But the rest of the federal government is funded through Sept. 30. That means air traffic controllers employed by the Federal Aviation Administration will receive paychecks as usual, reducing the risk of widespread flight cancellations.
According to the department’s contingency plan, about 95% of TSA workers are deemed essential personnel and required to keep working. Democrats in the House and Senate say DHS won’t get funded until new restrictions are placed on federal immigration operations.
During past shutdowns, disruptions to air travel tended to build over time, not overnight. About a month into last year’s shutdown, for example, TSA temporarily closed two checkpoints at Philadelphia International Airport. That same day, the government took the extraordinary step of ordering all commercial airlines to reduce their domestic flight schedules.
John Clark, arriving at Detroit Metropolitan Airport from a business trip in Mississippi, said he was impacted by that earlier shutdown and is worried.
“You might not be able to get home if you’re already out, or it might delay if you worked all week and you’re trying to get home,” said Clark, who frequently travels for his job balancing machines. “It’s really bad.”
John Rose, chief risk officer for global travel management company Altour, said strains could surface at airports more quickly this time because the TSA workforce also will be remembering the last shutdown.
“It’s still fresh in their minds and potentially their pocketbooks,” Rose said.
What is the impact on travelers?
It’s hard to predict whether, when or where security screening snags might pop up. Even a handful of unscheduled TSA absences could quickly lead to longer wait times at smaller airports, for example, if there’s just a single security checkpoint.
That’s why travelers should plan to arrive early and allow extra time to get through security.
“I tell people to do this even in good times,” Rose said.
Experts say flight delays also are a possibility even though air traffic controllers are not affected by the DHS shutdown.
Airlines might decide to delay departures in some cases to wait for passengers to clear screening, said Rich Davis, senior security adviser at risk mitigation company International SOS. Shortages of TSA officers also could slow the screening of checked luggage behind the scenes.
Burnest R. Green, who flew to Detroit from Phoenix for his sister’s 70th birthday, says he wants the shutdown ended before he flies back in over a week’s time.
“I just hope that things start to get better before they get any worse,” he said.
What travelers can do to prepare
Most airports display security line wait times on their websites, but don’t wait until the day of a flight to check them, Rose advised.
“You may look online and it says two-and-a-half hours,” he said. “Now it’s two-and-a-half hours before your flight and you haven’t left for the airport yet.”
Passengers should also pay close attention while packing since prohibited items are likely to prolong the screening process. For carry-on bags, avoid bringing full-size shampoo or other liquids, large gels or aerosols and items like pocketknives in carry-on bags.
TSA has a full list on its website of what is and isn’t allowed in carry-on and checked luggage.
At the airport, Rose said, remember to “practice patience and empathy.”
“Not only are they not getting paid,” he said of TSA agents, “they’re probably working with reduced staff and dealing with angry travelers.”
Will the shutdown drag on?
The White House has been negotiating with Democratic lawmakers, but the two sides failed to reach a deal by the end of the week before senators and members of Congress were set to leave Washington for a 10-day break.
Lawmakers in both chambers were on notice, however, to return if a deal to end the shutdown is struck.
Democrats have said they won’t help approve more DHS funding until new restrictions are placed on federal immigration operations after the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti and Renee Good in Minneapolis last month.
In a joint statement, U.S. Travel, Airlines for America and the American Hotel & Lodging Association warned that the shutdown threatens to disrupt air travel as the busy spring break travel season approaches.
“Travelers and the U.S. economy cannot afford to have essential TSA personnel working without pay, which increases the risk of unscheduled absences and call outs, and ultimately can lead to higher wait times and missed or delayed flights,” the statement said.

Italy pledges deeper cooperation at second Italy-Africa Summit
Italy has pledged to deepen cooperation with African countries during its second Italy-Africa summit
- Bookmark
Italy pledged Friday to deepen cooperation with African countries during its second Italy-Africa summit, the first on African soil, aimed at reviewing projects started in critical sectors such as energy and infrastructure during Italy’s first phase of the Mattei Plan for Africa.
The plan, launched in 2024, is aimed at promoting investment-led cooperation rather than traditional aid.
Italy’s Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni addressed dozens of African heads of state and governments in Ethiopia’s capital, Addis Ababa, and reiterated that a successful partnership would depend on Italy’s “ability to draw from African wisdom” and ensure lessons are learned.
“We want to build things together,” she told African heads of state. “We want to be more consistent with the needs of the countries involved.”
Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed said Italy had provided Africa with a gateway to Europe through these partnerships.
“This is a moment to move from dialogue to action,” he said. “By combining Africa’s energetic and creative population with Europe’s experience, technology and capital, we can build solutions that deliver prosperity to our continents and beyond.”
After the Italy-Africa summit concludes Friday, African leaders will remain in Addis Ababa for the annual African Union Summit that begins Saturday.
Kenyan writer and political analyst Nanjala Nyabola said tangible results from such summits depend on preparations made by countries.
African governments often focus on “optics instead of actually making summits a meaningful engagement,” she said.
Instead of waiting to receive a list of demands, countries should “present the conclusions of an extended period of mapping the national needs” and engage in dialogue to see how the needs can be met.
Since it was launched two years ago, the Mattei Plan has directly involved 14 African nations and has launched or advanced around 100 projects in crucial sectors, including energy and climate transition, agriculture and food security, physical and digital infrastructure, health care, water, culture and education, training and the development of artificial intelligence, according to the Italian government.

China to scrap tariffs for most African nations as Italy proposes climate-linked debt relief

Chinese President Xi Jinping has announced that Beijing will scrap tariffs for all but one African country on May 1.
According to state media on Saturday, Xi said that the zero-tariff deal "will undoubtedly provide new opportunities for African development", announcing the date as leaders across the continent gathered in Ethiopia’s capital, Addis Ababa, for the annual African Union summit.
China already has a zero-tariff policy for imports from 33 African countries, but Beijing said last year it would extend the policy to all 53 of its diplomatic partners on the continent.
China is Africa's largest trading partner and a key backer of major infrastructure projects in the region through its vast "Belt and Road" initiative. From May 1, zero levies will apply to all African countries except Eswatini, which maintains diplomatic relations with Taiwan.
Many African countries are increasingly turning to China and other trading partners since US President Donald Trump imposed steep tariffs worldwide last year.
Italy offers climate‑shock debt suspension
Meanwhile, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said that Italy and its African partners had focused their latest talks on the continent's debt burden, with Rome offering countries a chance to suspend repayments when hit by extreme climate events.
"Today, once again, we focused on an issue that is central for Africa, which is debt," Meloni said late on Friday at the close of the second Italy–Africa meeting in Addis Ababa.
"We have launched a broad initiative on debt conversion for joint development projects. To this, we are adding the introduction of debt‑suspension clauses for those nations affected by extreme climate events," she added.
On Saturday, Meloni attends the plenary session of the African summit. She did not give details on how the proposed suspension mechanism would work or which states might take it up.
Italy has made cooperation with African countries a cornerstone of its foreign policy, particularly through its "Mattei Plan," which Rome says aims to build long‑term partnerships in energy, agriculture, and infrastructure.
Water, sanitation drive at top of agenda
On Saturday, African heads of state and government gathered in Addis Ababa for a two-day summit centred on water security, climate pressure, and strengthening Africa’s representation in global institutions.
Leaders are launching the AU’s 2026 theme of the year — Assuring Sustainable Water Availability and Safe Sanitation Systems to Achieve the Goals of Agenda 2063.
UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, the Italian prime minister, Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammed Mustafa, and other international leaders are participating in the summit at AU headquarters, underscoring growing international engagement with Africa’s development and security priorities.
In addition to discussions on water governance and climate resilience, leaders are expected to review peace and security situations across the continent, assess progress on Agenda 2063 — the AU’s long-term development blueprint — and consider institutional reforms aimed at improving the effectiveness and financial sustainability of the continental body.

Europe has every right to take part in Ukraine peace talks – Wang Yi
The top Chinese diplomat made the remarks at the Munich Security Conference, according to an Ukrinform correspondent.
"China's position and stance is clear: all regional hotspot issues should be resolved through dialogue and consultation and we need to find a political settlement. So this holds true for the Ukraine crisis [as it is officially referred to in China] but China is not a party directly involved. We don't have the final say. What we are doing is to promote talks for peace," Wang said.
He added that Beijing is sending messages through every possible channel that it seeks the fastest possible cessation of hostilities and the resumption of dialogue, and it is finally possible to see that peace talks have begun.
"Finally, now we are seeing that the peace talks have begun and I think now real issues are being discussed. We welcome this because without dialogue how can peace ever arrive. If we don't keep dialogue going, a peace deal or treaty will not fall from the sky. So we hope that through our consistent efforts we can reach a comprehensive, durable, lasting and binding peace deal acceptable to all parties," the minister said.
Wang recalled that at last year's Munich Security Conference he insisted on the mandatory participation of European countries in Ukraine peace talks and continues to hold that view.
"Europe should not watch this from the sidelines. Right here in Munich last year, at that time, the United States had started engagement with Russia and Europe seemed to be left watching from the sidelines. And I said then that since the conflict broke out right here in Europe, Europe has every right to participate in the negotiation in due course," he said.
He noted that Europe has now dared to speak with Russia, which he sees as a positive signal and supports, but stressed that dialogue should not be for the sake of dialogue; it must produce results.
"Europe should come up with ideas and plans on how to resolve this issue. And in this process, we need to foster a more balanced, effective and sustainable security architecture for Europe. So by doing this, we are addressing the root causes of the crisis and we can prevent it from reoccurring," Wang said.
"To achieve sustainable and lasting peace, China will in its own way give its full support for the peace process," he added.

The 62nd edition of the Munich Security Conference, which opened on Friday, February 13, chose a wrecking ball as its symbol. The organizers of this major event in transatlantic relations said it was a metaphor for a world order "under demolition" due to Donald Trump's brutality and his disregard for rules. Just one year after the shock caused by a speech from US Vice President JD Vance, political leaders from across Europe were expected to deliver their response to an America that shows them contempt, and to carve out their place in this new world.
But Vance was not in the room to hear the European response. It was US Secretary of State Marco Rubio who spoke on Saturday on behalf of the United States at the Art Deco Bayerischer Hof hotel. Rubio is considered less hostile toward Europeans, but his assessment was the same as that of Trump and the vice president. The secretary of state described, as Vance had done a year earlier, the West as plagued by two scourges, "mass migration" and "deindustrialization," which must be fought in order to restore pride to a Western civilization in peril.

Quote: "I now want to speak about the cost of war on the ground. What does one month of war mean for Putin? Just in December, our forces wiped out 35,000 occupying soldiers, killed and badly wounded. In January there were fewer Russian assaults, and as a result, Russia's losses were about 30,000 killed and badly wounded.
There is even a clear price Russia pays for every kilometre of occupied Ukrainian land. On the Donetsk front – it's one of the most intense areas and everyone knows about it – the price Russia pays for one kilometre now is 156 soldiers."
Details: Zelenskyy said Kremlin leader Vladimir Putin "is not concerned about this now, but there is a level at which he will start to care".
He said Russia mobilises about 40,000 people each month, and not all of them reach the front line, so the overall size of the Russian contingent in Ukraine is not growing this year.
Quote: "For our army, the mission is clear: to kill more Russian occupiers, because they are occupiers. And the goal is specific: at least 50,000 per month. Even for Russia, that would be serious, I'm sure. And it would affect Putin's decisions because we are speaking mainly about frontline troops – those leading the assaults and attacks."

Rubio calls for renewed US-Europe alliance in Munich

United States Secretary of State Marco Rubio told European leaders that Washington does not seek the end of the transatlantic era and wants to work “together” with its allies, as the Munich Security Conference opened amid strain over defence and Ukraine.
“In a time of headlines heralding the end of the transatlantic era, let it be known and clear to all that this is neither our goal nor our wish,” Rubio said in his address.
“For us Americans, our home may be in the western hemisphere, but we will always be a child of Europe.”
Rubio spoke to an audience of nearly 50 heads of state and government at the annual gathering in Bavaria.
He said the United States does not want to act as “caretakers of the west’s managed decline” and urged allies to reform international institutions.
“We do not live in a perfect world,” he said. “The UN and other bodies need urgent reform.”
Rubio called for stronger allies and said Washington would remain direct in its counsel “because we care deeply”.
He said the United States would not step back from efforts to end the war in Ukraine. At the same time, Rubio did not mention Russia by name during his main speech and avoided detailed references to Nato.
Reuters reported that his remarks were notably short on specifics.
The tone of his speech drew a positive response from several European leaders.
Finland’s foreign minister Elina Valtonen said Rubio’s address was “exactly what has been needed both in Europe and in the United States”.
“Now there was a clear gesture of outreach,” she told reporters in Munich. “This is a good basis on which to continue.” Valtonen noted that Rubio repeated the word “together” during his speech.
Finnish President Alexander Stubb met Rubio at the conference venue. The two shook hands at The Economist’s studio before holding formal talks later in the day.
Stubb has said Europe must take greater responsibility for its own security while keeping the United States engaged.
Rubio’s address preceded a panel on Ukraine that included Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte, European Parliament President Roberta Metsola and US Senator Roger Wicker.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy detailed the scale of Russian attacks on his country.
In January alone, Ukraine faced more than 6,000 attack drones, over 150 missiles and more than 5,000 glide bombs, Zelenskyy said.
“There is not a single power plant in Ukraine that has not been damaged,” he told delegates.
He said Russia loses 156 soldiers for every kilometre of Ukrainian territory it captures.

Refugees in Swiss canton train as care assistants
In the refugee training centre in Ringgenberg in western Switzerland, 32 people with asylum or refugee status are currently training to work in nursing care.
+ Get the most important news from Switzerland in your inbox
The centre has been operated by the Bernese Oberland Asylum Association on behalf of canton Bern since August 2025. Over roughly 20 months, refugees receive language tuition and vocational training to help them move into jobs in the care sector.
Ringgenberg is the canton’s second training centre of this kind, after the one in Bellelay. “This shows that early integration is the right approach to give refugees real prospects and help them settle into society from the start,” said Pierre‑Alain Schnegg (Swiss People’s Party), the canton’s director of health, social affairs and integration, during a visit to the centre.
The canton said the initiator of these training programmes – which are unique in Switzerland – also thanked the municipality of Ringgenberg. The local authorities had agreed to convert the former collective accommodation into a training centre.
Fully booked
The first two modules, each with 16 participants, are already fully booked. Once all four courses are up and running, around 60 people will be in training.
All participants in the first group passed their A1 language exam in December. Alongside their language lessons, the trainee nursing assistants also completed practical placements at 14 institutions across the Bernese Oberland. In the final module, they finish their training with a Swiss Red Cross (SRC) certificate.
The first certificates were awarded in Bellelay in mid‑January, according to the authorities. Around 120 people are currently training there, and another centre is planned in Sumiswald.

Russian attack on Thurs night thwarted by missiles Ukraine received on Sunday - Zelenskyy
Ukraine received air defense missiles from its partners last Sunday, and they were already used to repel a Russian attack on the night of Thursday, February 12, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced.
"Our air defense used the missiles that our partners had delivered to us just a few days earlier. They arrived on Sunday. And by Thursday night, these missiles were already defending our skies. And that was just one night, but Russian attacks occur almost every night in Ukraine, and at least once a week, massive strikes are carried out," Zelenskyy said speaking at the Munich Security Conference on Saturday.
The President also noted that in January, the Russians launched 6,000 attack drones, more than 150 Russian missiles of various types, and more than 5,000 guided missiles against Ukraine.

Winter Olympics hit by another suspected sabotage of rail services
Italy’s Transport Minister Matteo Salvini says ‘lives at risk’ as services between Milano Cortina Games hit.
Trains operating through the heart of Italy suffered delays of more than an hour on Saturday following the latest suspected act of sabotage during the 2026 Winter Olympics.
Services between Naples in the south and the capital, Rome, were affected, and there were also delays on the line heading north towards Florence.

Transport Minister Matteo Salvini condemned those behind the incidents following similar problems last Saturday on the network and another, less serious case midweek.
The stoppages come as Italy hosts the Winter Olympics in Milan and Cortina d’Ampezzo from February 6-22.
“These are hateful criminal acts aimed at workers and at Italy,” Salvini said in a statement.
“I hope that no one plays down or tries to justify these crimes which put lives at risk,” he added.
The authorities were investigating burned cables on a section of the high-speed line between Rome and Naples on Saturday, and two other possible acts of vandalism between the capital and Florence.
An anarchist group claimed responsibility for an attack on the network last Saturday, the first full day of the games, when rail infrastructure was damaged near Bologna, causing delays of up to two and a half hours on high-speed, intercity and regional services.

T20 World Cup: Pakistan ‘always ready’ for India despite late green light
Both teams say they are set for Sunday’s showdown despite the late decision for India’s match with Pakistan to proceed.
Pakistan skipper Salman Agha says his team were “always ready” to face India on Sunday at the T20 World Cup, despite only being given the green light a few days ago.
The biggest and most lucrative clash in world cricket has sold out the 35,000-capacity R Premadasa Stadium in Colombo, with hundreds of millions more expected to watch on television.

The game was only confirmed as going ahead late on Monday night after the Islamabad government made a U-turn on its order to boycott the blockbuster Group A game.
“This is a very big game and the magnitude is huge,” Agha said before the team’s practice at the stadium on Saturday.
“We were always ready for the game, whatever be the decision.”
Pakistan had a scrappy last-over three-wicket win in their first match against the Netherlands before beating the United States by 32 runs. India have also won both their matches so far.
“We are in good momentum and I hope that being in Colombo since the start will help us in terms of conditions,” said Agha.
But he warned: “We have to play good cricket to win the match.”
The hugely anticipated match could be hit by bad weather, with rain forecast for Sunday evening.
Agha believed spin would dominate, calling Tariq Usman his trump card against India’s powerful batting lineup.
“Tariq has been bowling well and I am sure the mystery element will make him our trump card,” Agha said, brushing aside doubts over the legality of Tariq’s unique sling-arm action and the exaggerated pause in his delivery stride.
“He has been cleared twice so there are no worries.”
Agha hoped the players would shake hands, unlike during their three Asia Cup matches in Dubai last year.
“The game should be played in the true spirit of the game,” said Agha.
“It has been the norm in cricket for years, but whatever way they want, we will only know tomorrow.”
The winner will be guaranteed their berth in the next Super Eights round.
India have a doubt over explosive opener Abhishek Sharma, who has been suffering from a stomach bug.
“I hope he plays tomorrow. I hope he’s recovering well,” said Agha. “We want to play against the best, good luck to him.”

US Department of Homeland Security enters partial shutdown by budget impasse
France

20:37:00 KST

The Department of Homeland Security entered a partial shutdown on Saturday, February 14, as US lawmakers fight over funding the agency overseeing much of President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown. Thousands of government workers, from airport security agents to disaster relief officials, will either be furloughed or forced to work without pay until funding is agreed upon by Congress.
At the center of the budget dispute is the department's Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), whose agents killed two US citizens amid sweeping raids and mass protests in Minneapolis. Democrats oppose any new funding for DHS until major changes are implemented over how ICE conducts its operations. In particular, they have demanded curtailed patrols, a ban on ICE agents wearing face masks during operations and the requirement that they obtain a judicial warrant to enter private property.
"Donald Trump and Republicans have decided that they have zero interest in getting ICE under control," House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said Friday. "Dramatic changes are needed," Jeffries told a news conference. "Absent that, Republicans have decided to shut down parts of the federal government."
White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt put the blame on the opposition, telling Fox News that "Democrats are barreling our government towards another shutdown for political and partisan reasons."
But while DHS faces a shutdown, ICE itself will remain operational, under funds approved in last year's government spending bill. Senator John Fetterman pushed against his fellow Democrats, saying: "This shutdown literally has zero impact on ICE."
The primary impact would land on other agencies, including the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), which oversees emergency response to natural disasters. The Transportation Security Administration, which runs airport safety, warned on X that a prolonged shutdown could result in longer wait timecanceled elled flights.
Stalled negotiations
The shutdown would be the third of Trump's second term, including a record 43-day government closure last October and November. The government just reopened from a smaller, four-day partial shutdown earlier this month, also over DHS funding.
Even if all 53 Republican senators vote to fund DHS, Senate rules require support from 60 of the body's 100 members to advance the budget bill, meaning several Democrats would need to get on board. In response to the Democrats' demands, the White House said it was ready to negotiate over immigration enforcement policy. Senate Majority Leader John Thune called it "an extremely serious offer," but warned Democrats are "never going to get their full wish list."
Some concessions were made during the previous shutdown amid Democratic pressure and national outcry after federal agents shot and killed Renee Good, a mother of three, and Alex Pretti, a nurse who worked with military veterans, in Minneapolis last month. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said federal agents in the city would wear body cameras "effective immediately" in a move that would be later "expanded nationwide."
The Senate went into recess for a week starting Thursday, but senators could be called back to Washington in case of a rapid leap in negotiations. For the moment, however, talks between the White House and Democrats appear to be at a standstill.

Arundhati Roy quits Berlin film festival after jury chief’s ‘unconscionable’ Gaza remarks
Booker winner says jury’s argument that art shouldn’t be political is ‘jaw-dropping’
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
Booker-winning author Arundhati Roy has withdrawn from the Berlin International Film Festival after jury president Wim Wenders said filmmakers should “stay out of politics” when asked about Israel’s war on Gaza.
Roy, who was due to attend a screening of a restored version of her 1989 film In Which Annie Gives It Those Ones, said she was “shocked and disgusted” by remarks made during a press conference at the festival’s opening on Thursday.
When a reporter asked the jury members for their views on the German government’s “support of the genocide in Gaza” and the festival’s “selective treatment of human rights” issues by speaking out about Ukraine and Iran but not Palestine, Wenders, the chair of the seven-member jury, responded that filmmakers “have to stay out of politics”.
In a statement, Roy called the comments “unconscionable” and said she had decided to withdraw “with deep regret”.
“To hear them say that art should not be political is jaw-dropping,” the novelist said. “It’s a way of shutting down a conversation about a crime against humanity even as it unfolds before us in real time – when artists, writers and film-makers should be doing everything in their power to stop it.”
Roy, who won the Booker Prize in 1997 for The God of Small Things, said that “what has happened in Gaza, what continues to happen, is a genocide of the Palestinian people by the state of Israel”.
“It is supported and funded by the governments of the United States and Germany, as well as several other countries in Europe, which makes them complicit in the crime,” she added. “If the greatest filmmakers and artists of our time cannot stand up and say so, they should know that history will judge them.”
Roy has long been an outspoken critic of governments in India and abroad and has repeatedly voiced support for the Palestinian cause.
The Berlin festival, commonly known as the Berlinale, is partly funded by the German government. At the same press conference, a jury member, Ewa Puszczyńska, said it was “a bit unfair” to expect the jury to take a stance on the issue.
The festival said it “respected the decision” even though Roy’s presence “would have enriched the festival discourse”.
Israel’s brutal war on Gaza has killed over 71,000 Palestinians so far, reduced the besieged territory to rubble and displaced most of its 2.1 million people. The war began after about 1,200 people were killed during a Hamas attack on southern Israel in October 2023.
A few months into the war, Berlinale was drawn into a controversy after the festival’s documentary award went to No Other Land, a film about the dispossession of Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.
German officials at the time criticised “one-sided” remarks made about Gaza by the directors of the film and others at the awards ceremony.

MUNICH, February 14. /TASS/. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen did not deny reports that US Secretary of State Marco Rubio did not participate in a meeting between European leaders and Vladimir Zelensky on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference, organized by the European Commission.
During a panel discussion at the conference, the moderator asked her to comment on reports of Rubio’s absence from the meeting. Von der Leyen sidestepped the question, stating only that she considers it very important for the European Union, the United States and Ukraine to be on the same page.

Iran’s crackdown continues: arrests, disappearances and fear after mass protests
Unknown

Iranian security agents arrived at 2 a.m., pulling up in about half a dozen cars outside the home of the Nakhii family. They woke the sisters, Nyusha, 37, and Mona, 25, forced them to hand over the passwords to their phones and took them away.
The January 16 arrest came a week after the sisters took part in nationwide protests that shook the Islamic Republic, a friend told The Associated Press, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals.
Such arrests have continued for weeks following a sweeping crackdown that crushed demonstrations calling for an end to Iran’s theocratic rule. Reports of raids on homes and workplaces have emerged from major cities and rural towns alike, reflecting what activists describe as a broad dragnet across Iranian society.
University students, doctors, lawyers, teachers, actors, business owners, athletes and filmmakers have been detained, along with reformist figures seen as close to President Masoud Pezeshkian. Many detainees are held incommunicado for days or weeks, denied contact with family members or lawyers, according to activists monitoring the arrests. Relatives often search desperately for news of their loved ones.
The U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency says more than 50,000 people were arrested during the crackdown. The AP has not independently verified that figure. Tracking detainees has been difficult after authorities imposed internet blackouts during the unrest.
Shiva Nazarahari, an organizer with the Committee for Monitoring the Status of Detained Protesters, said authorities continue to identify participants and detain them. The committee has so far verified the names of more than 2,200 detainees, including 107 university students, 82 minors as young as 13, 19 lawyers and 106 doctors.
Authorities have reportedly reviewed municipal street cameras, store surveillance footage and drone video to identify demonstrators and track them to their homes or workplaces.
Held for weeks without contact
The protests began in late December, fueled by anger over soaring prices and a collapsing currency. They spread rapidly nationwide, peaking on January 8 and 9, when hundreds of thousands rallied in more than 190 cities and towns.
Security forces responded with what activists described as unprecedented violence. The Human Rights Activists News Agency says more than 7,000 people were killed, though it acknowledges the true toll may be higher. On January 21, the Iranian government issued its only official figure, saying 3,117 people had died. In previous unrest, authorities have been accused of undercounting fatalities or not reporting them at all.
Gholamhossein Mohseni Ejehi, the head of Iran’s judiciary, labeled protesters “terrorists” and called for expedited trials.
“Detentions have been very widespread. It feels like a suffocation of society,” said one protester reached by the AP in Gohardasht, near Tehran. He said two relatives and three of his brother’s friends were killed in the early days of the crackdown, along with several neighbors. He also spoke anonymously out of fear.
The Nakhii sisters were initially taken to Tehran’s Evin Prison, where they were briefly allowed to contact their parents, their friend said. They were later transferred to Qarchak, a women’s prison on the outskirts of Tehran that rights groups have long criticized for overcrowding and poor hygiene.
Other detainees have effectively disappeared. The family of Abolfazl Jazbi has not heard from him since his January 15 arrest at a factory in Isfahan. Jazbi suffers from a severe blood disorder requiring medication. Atila Sultanpour, 45, has not been heard from since being taken from his Tehran home on January 29 by security agents who allegedly beat him.
Authorities have also suspended bank accounts, blocked SIM cards and confiscated property belonging to relatives of protesters or those who publicly support them, according to Musa Barzin, a lawyer with Dadban, a group of Iranian attorneys based abroad.
“In the past, authorities sometimes maintained a veneer of due process. Not this time,” Barzin said. “Following the law is in the worst situation it has ever been.”
Defiance and geopolitical pressure
Despite the crackdown, civic groups continue to issue statements of defiance. The Writers’ Association of Iran described the protests as an uprising against “47 years of systemic corruption and discrimination.” Teachers’ organizations have urged families to speak publicly about detained minors.
Mohammad Habibi, a spokesman for a teachers’ council, said the group has documented at least 200 minors killed during the crackdown. “Every day we tell ourselves this is the last list,” he wrote on X. “But the next morning, new names arrive again.”
Anger over the bloodshed compounds economic frustration in a country battered by decades of sanctions, corruption and mismanagement. The national currency has plunged and inflation has reached record highs.
The crackdown unfolds as tensions rise over Iran’s nuclear program and the possibility of U.S. military action. U.S. President Donald Trump has moved military assets, including aircraft carriers, to the Persian Gulf and said he prefers a deal with Tehran but warned it would be “very difficult” to reach.
Asked recently about regime change, Trump said it “may be the best thing that could happen,” while two U.S. officials told Reuters that the military is preparing contingency plans for a prolonged operation should diplomacy fail.
Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of Iran’s last shah and a prominent opposition figure, called on Trump to support the Iranian people. Speaking at the Munich Security Conference, Pahlavi said, “The Iranian people heard you say that help is on the way and they trust you. Help them. This is the time to bring the Islamic Republic to an end.”
Iran’s clerical establishment has survived past unrest and foreign pressure. Authorities this week organized large pro-government rallies marking the anniversary of the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
Still, Barzin said the ferocity of the crackdown signals something deeper. “For the first time,” he said, “the leadership is afraid of being overthrown.”

Taiwanese visits to mainland China topped 3 million in 2025, still below pre-Covid levels
Taiwanese media attributes slow post-pandemic recovery to cross-strait tensions, partial travel bans
According to Taiwan’s Tourism Administration, around 3.24 million Taiwanese visited the mainland last year, nearly 17 per cent more than in 2024.
But this was still 20 per cent lower than the figure for 2019, the year before the coronavirus pandemic.
Taiwan’s Central News Agency on Saturday attributed the decline to worsening cross-strait relations, the ban on group tours to the mainland since 2020 and Taiwanese travellers’ preference for alternative destinations such as Japan and South Korea.
Tourism across the Taiwan Strait has been significantly disrupted in recent years by shifting political tensions and government policies.
Taiwanese leader William Lai Ching-te, who took office in 2024, has labelled Beijing as a foreign hostile force, the strongest rhetoric from Taipei to date. Last March, Lai introduced 17 security measures to counter what he called infiltration, espionage and coercion efforts by mainland China.

Bangladesh election winner Tarique Rahman calls for ‘unity to rebuild nation'
BNP chairperson will swear in as prime minister by Feb. 18 as his party secures two-thirds majority
DHAKA, Bangladesh
Tarique Rahman, chairperson of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) that won a two-thirds majority in the recently held general elections, on Saturday called for national unity to rebuild the South Asian country.
The BNP, which secured a landslide victory on Thursday election with 209 seats in the 300-seat parliament, is set form a government with Rahman to become prime minister.
The Jamaat-e-Islami-led alliance won 77 seats and will sit on opposition benches, while the Awami League party of Sheikh Hasina, whose government was ousted in 2024 after student protests and a crackdown that killed 1,400 people, was barred from taking part.
"We are taking office at a time when we have to start our journey through a fragile economy, ineffective constitutional institutions, and weak law and order situation left by a fascist regime. However, if the people's strength is with us, no obstacle can stop us," Rahman said in his first address since Thursday's election.
Asked about foreign policy, he said they do not have any country-centric policy, saying it will be decided based on "Bangladeshi interests."
"National unity is our strength, division is our weakness," he said, urging everyone to stay united. "This victory belongs to democracy, this victory belongs to Bangladesh, this victory belongs to the democracy-loving people of the country. From today, we are free."
“We will not tolerate any kind of injustice or illegal activities. Regardless of party, opinion, religion, ethnicity, or differing views, we will not accept any attack by the strong against the weak under any pretext,” he said.

Rubio sticks to Trump's firm stance, takes softer tone in speech to allies

Rubio calls for U.S. and Europe to "revitalize an old friendship" in speech to allies
Munich —Secretary of State Marco Rubio delivered a message of reassurance in remarks at the Munich Security Conference, calming some fears that months of sharp U.S. rhetoric and policy disputes had opened a lasting breach between Washington and its European allies.
"We do not seek to separate, but to revitalize an old friendship and renew the greatest civilization in human history," he said.
Though he admonished European nations for prioritizing welfare programs over self-defense and embracing migration policies that threatened their societal cohesion, he framed his critique as part of a shared reckoning.
"We made these mistakes together, and now together, we owe it to our people to face those facts and to move forward — to rebuild," he said.
At last year's conference, Vice President JD Vance delivered a combative address that rattled European capitals and fueled fears of an accelerating trans-Atlantic split. In contrast, Rubio paired sharp criticism of the post-Cold War order with repeated affirmations of shared destiny.
He argued that postwar "euphoria" had led the West into a "dangerous delusion" of borderless globalization and overreliance on international institutions.
"This was a foolish idea that ignored both human nature and the lessons of 5,000 years of recorded human history. It has cost us dearly," he said.
Still, Rubio paid homage to what he described as a civilizational bond between the continents.
"In a time of headlines heralding the end of the transatlantic era, let it be known and clear to all that it is neither our goal nor our wish," Rubio said. "For us Americans, our home may be in the Western Hemisphere, but we will always be a child of Europe."
The address drew a standing ovation. Conference chair Wolfgang Ischinger said afterward that the remarks were widely seen as reassuring.
"Mr. Secretary, I'm not sure you heard the sigh of relief through this hall," he told Rubio.
In a brief question-and-answer session, Rubio said efforts to broker an end to Russia's war in Ukraine were continuing, with another round of talks expected Tuesday.
"We don't know if the Russians are serious about ending the war; they say they are," he said. "We're going to continue to test it."
On China, Rubio said Washington has "an obligation to communicate" with Beijing, even as "fundamental challenges" remain, and stressed that any engagement must protect U.S. national interests.
Since arriving in Munich, Rubio has met with senior European leaders, including German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, as well as officials from Denmark, Greenland, Poland, Croatia and Moldova. He also met with senior Syrian officials to discuss preserving a ceasefire and protecting minority communities, according to the State Department.
A U.S. official said Rubio did not attend one meeting on Ukraine support due to scheduling conflicts, though he is expected to meet briefly on Saturday with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.
After Munich, Rubio is set to travel to Bratislava and Budapest, where he is expected to meet Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban.
Europeans reassured but not complacent
The president of the European Union's executive commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said Rubio's speech was "very reassuring" but noted that "in the administration, some have a harsher tone on these topics," according to the Associated Press.
In her speech to the conference, she stressed that "Europe must become more independent," including on defense, and insisted upon "digital sovereignty" in the continent's approach to hate speech on social media.
British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said that "we shouldn't get in the warm bath of complacency," the Associated Press reported. He said the U.K. must re-forge closer ties with Europe to help the continent "stand on our own two feet" in its own defense, and said there needs to be investment that "moves us from overdependence to interdependence."
Shortly after Rubio's remarks, the United Kingdom said it would send its Carrier Strike Group, led by the largest warship in the Royal Navy and including fighter jets, across the North Atlantic and Arctic. The deployment will visit a U.S. port, and U.S. jets are expected to operate from the deck of the warship, the HMS Prince of Wales. Defense Secretary John Healey said the deployment "will help make Britain warfighting ready, boost our contribution to NATO, and strengthen our operations with key allies, keeping the UK secure at home and strong abroad."
The conference pointed to tensions beyond those in the trans-Atlantic alliance, the Associated Press reported.
Speaking after Rubio, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said Beijing felt "gratified" that President Trump respects President Xi Jinping and China, but warned that some voices in the U.S. are leery of China's rise.
"We see that some forces and some people are still trying their best to suppress and contain China, and are still attacking and slandering China by any means," Wang said, according to the Associated Press.
He cautioned that "law of the jungle and unilateralism have taken hold" and said some countries "even revive the Cold War mentality."

Six European Countries to Develop Low-Cost OWE 500+ Cruise Missile: What Are Its Characteristics?

Germany, France, the United Kingdom, Italy, Poland, and Sweden have signed an agreement on the joint development and production of an inexpensive cruise missile.
This was reported by Hartpunkt.
It is noted that the document was signed during a meeting of NATO defense ministers in Brussels. The project will be implemented as part of the European Long Range Strike Approach (ELSA) initiative to create conventional long-range weapons.
In professional circles, the project is known as One Way Effector 500 Plus (OWE 500+).
The idea is to conduct research on the possibility of developing a joint, cost-effective platform that can be equipped with national combat units or other useful payloads.
The production of missiles is planned to be distributed among the participating countries. This should ensure faster scaling of production and increase the resilience of production capacities in the event of the failure of individual enterprises.
The overall concept is to create a weapon that can be purchased at a relatively low price and used in large quantities to overwhelm enemy air defense systems.
According to Hartpunkt sources, the OWE 500+ is designed to deliver a payload of about 50 kg with high precision at a range of up to 500 km.
It is known that the German side plans to use these systems for its land forces.
In December, during a speech at a parliamentary event organized by Förderkreis Deutsches Heer e.V., it was announced that by 2029, the army would form a battery as the basis for a future multi-domain task force.
It is expected to be equipped with high-precision long-range surface-to-surface weapons. According to informed sources, Germany has promised NATO to create three such batteries.

US-EU clash erupts over Trump’s Gaza Board of Peace

US-EU clash erupts over Trump’s Gaza Board of Peace
A transatlantic row over the future of Gaza erupted into public view at the Munich Security Conference, with senior European officials openly challenging Donald Trump’s controversial "Board of Peace", the Guardian has reported.
EU leaders accused the US president of reshaping an originally UN-mandated mechanism into a body that no longer reflects its original legal framework or guarantees Palestinian participation.
The EU’s foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, said the board as currently constituted no longer reflected the original UN security council resolution.
She said the resolution "provided for a Board of Peace for Gaza, but it also provided for it to be limited in time until 2027, it provided for the Palestinians to have a say, and it referred to Gaza, whereas the statute of the Board of Peace makes no reference to any of these things".
"So I think there is a security council resolution but the Board of Peace does not reflect it," she added.
Spain’s foreign minister, José Manuel Albares, also accused Trump of attempting to bypass the original UN mandate and excluding Europe from the process, despite the EU being one of the main funders of the Palestinian Authority, the Guardian reported.
The remarks mark the first time divisions over Trump’s Gaza initiative have surfaced so publicly at a high level. A meeting of the Board of Peace is due to take place in Washington next week amid uncertainty over the durability of the Gaza ceasefire.
US officials pushed back against the criticism.
In exchanges described by the Guardian as "testy", Mike Waltz dismissed what he called “hand-wringing” about the Board of Peace and said the status quo of repeated war, with Hamas in control of Gaza, had to be broken.
He confirmed that Indonesia had agreed to contribute 8,000 troops to an International Stabilisation Force, with further announcements on troop deployments expected in the coming week.
Waltz also claimed some countries were not comfortable putting billions of dollars in reconstruction funds through the UN system.
Describing Trump’s approach as "focused multilateralism", he said it had been necessary to "put the UN on a diet and make it go back to basics of peacemaking".
The Trump-appointed high representative for Gaza, Nickolay Mladenov, sought to avoid the political row and instead stressed urgency on the ground.
"All of this needs to move very fast. If we do not, we are not going to implement the second phase of the ceasefire but the second phase of the war," he said.
Mladenov said he would not engage with allegations of Israeli genocide and that his focus was improving humanitarian aid, decommissioning weapons held by all factions and ending Gaza’s internal division.
"If we do not address the issue of Hamas and Gaza itself divided into two parts, please tell me how we get to a two-state solution, because I do not see the pathway," he said.
"We are setting ourselves up for complete and utter failure, and the price will be paid by both Israelis and Palestinians down the line."
Democratic senator Chris Murphy raised separate concerns that the board lacked safeguards to prevent reconstruction funds ending up "in the hands of Trump’s friends and cronies", according to the Guardian.
Meanwhile, Palestinian politician Mustafa Barghouti warned that wider developments in the occupied territories risked undermining any political plan for Gaza.
"The whole of the West Bank has been made open for settlements and Israel is putting the final nail in the coffin of the Oslo accord," he said. "It is not just about accountability for genocide, but who is going to stop this process of killing the two-state solution."

Britain set to deploy aircraft carrier strike group

Keir Starmer has confirmed that the UK will deploy its Carrier Strike Group to the North Atlantic and High North regions later this year, with HMS Prince of Wales set to lead the deployment.
The Prime Minister said the carrier will operate alongside the United States, Canada and other NATO allies, describing the deployment as “a powerful show of our commitment to Euro-Atlantic security.”
The announcement places the Royal Navy’s flagship at the centre of a renewed focus on the High North, a region increasingly framed by NATO as strategically critical amid heightened Russian military activity and competition over Arctic routes and infrastructure.
Starmer also linked the move to wider European deterrence efforts, saying it was part of the UK’s commitment to NATO security. “That is also why we’re enhancing our nuclear cooperation with France,” he said.
He added: “For decades, the United Kingdom has been the only nuclear power in Europe to commit its deterrent to protect all NATO members.”
HMS Prince of Wales, commissioned in 2019, is one of the Royal Navy’s two Queen Elizabeth-class aircraft carriers and is capable of operating an air wing of up to 24 F-35B Lightning II aircraft, alongside helicopters such as Merlin, Chinook, Apache and Wildcat. The carrier previously led Operation Highmast, an eight-month deployment to the Indo-Pacific in 2025, including exercises with India and other regional partners, underlining the UK’s ability to operate at range while maintaining NATO-linked commitments.

Separate talks on Iran and Ukraine-Russia set for Tuesday in Geneva, source says
Two sets of diplomatic negotiations, on Ukraine and Iran, are set to take place in Geneva on Tuesday, a source briefed on the matter told Reuters news agency on Friday.
A US delegation including envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner will meet with the Iranians on Tuesday morning, the source said. Representatives from Oman will be on hand and mediate the US-Iran contacts, the source said.
Witkoff and Kushner will then participate in trilateral talks with representatives from Russia and Ukraine in the afternoon, the source said.
President Donald Trump is pressuring the Iranian government in the wake of its violent crackdown on protesters and has amassed a large US naval presence in the region.
Meanwhile, the exiled son of Iran's last shah called on US President Donald Trump on Saturday to help the Iranian people and said it was "time to end the Islamic republic".
"To President Trump... The Iranian people heard you say help is on the way, and they have faith in you. Help them," the US-based Reza Pahlavi told reporters at the Munich Security Conference.
Trump had said Friday that a change of government in Iran would be the "best thing that could happen", as he sent a second aircraft carrier to the Middle East to ratchet up military pressure on the Islamic republic.
He is also trying to coax Ukraine and Russia into an agreement to end Moscow's four-year-old invasion of Ukraine.
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Saturday that he did not know if Russia was serious about ending its war against Ukraine.
"We don't know if the Russians are serious about ending the war," he told the Munich Security Conference, with the conflict soon set to enter its fifth year.

Finland welcomes Marco Rubio's comments on transatlantic unity

Finland's political leaders have welcomed comments by US Secretary of State Marco Rubio on transatlantic unity during his speech at the Munich Security Conference on Saturday.
"In a time of headlines heralding the end of the transatlantic era, let it be known and clear to all that this is neither our goal nor our wish, because for us Americans, our home may be in the western hemisphere, but we will always be a child of Europe," Rubio said.
Finnish foreign minister Elina Valtonen (NCP) told reporters that Rubio's speech was "exactly what has been needed both in Europe and in the United States", adding that it was a welcome change in tone compared to the rhetoric at the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos last month.
"Now there was a clear gesture of outreach; this is a good basis on which to continue," Valtonen said, noting that Rubio repeatedly used the word "together".
News agency Reuters reported however that Rubio's speech was "notably short on specifics", as he did not mention Russia once during his half-hour address nor did he specifically refer to Nato by using the alliance's name.
Finnish President Alexander Stubb is also attending the conference, and he is due to meet with Rubio later on Saturday. The pair encountered each other briefly as Stubb was leaving The Economist's on-site studio at the summit, just as Rubio was arriving.
Altogether nearly 50 heads of state and government are attending this year's annual conference, which aims to promote conflict resolution via improved international cooperation and dialogue.

‘Not on the menu, but at the table’: China’s top diplomat urges EU to engage Russia over Ukraine war
'Europe should not watch this from the sidelines,' says Wang Yi
ISTANBUL
Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Saturday emphasized the importance of the EU's participation in peace negotiations to end the Russia-Ukraine war, urging Europe to be "not on the menu" but "at the table."
Asked what China could do to convince Russia end its war on Ukraine at the Munich Security Conference, Wang said: "Europe should not watch this from the sidelines. Right here, in Munich last year at that time United States had started engagement with Russia, and Europe seemed to be left watching from the sidelines ... Europe has every right to participate in the negotiation in due course. ... Europe should not be on the menu, but should be at the table."
He added that "China is not a party directly involved," and promotes dialogue for peace.
"Now we're seeing that Europe has come up with the courage to talk with Russia," he said, urging Europe to come up with new ideas and plans.
The US, Russia and Ukraine are currently holding trilateral dialogue to end the war that continues since February 2022, which has been hailed by Wang.
Wang said the EU and China are “partners who are not systemic rivals or strategic competitors.”
"We acknowledge that we there are differences and divergences between us, but that doesn't mean that we couldn't reach better harmony," he said. "It is more important for China and the EU to practice multilateralism, to safeguard the authority of the United Nations, to say no to unilateral practices, and to safeguard free trade and oppose block confrontation." He was answering another question about "China's strategy to convince Europeans that it's a good idea and not a bad idea to engage more strongly with China."
The Chinese foreign minister also hailed the UN. “Without the UN ... many medium and small sized countries would lose the multilateral foundation critical to their survival and development,” he said, blaming "certain countries seeking to magnify differences and disagreements" for why the international system "is not functioning well enough."
He urged major countries to lead in advancing cooperation, observing rules, promoting equality, encouraging openness.
Wang emphasized that "the realization of ceasefire and reconstruction will require unremitting efforts" to implement the two-state solution in Gaza and that "restoring justice to the Palestinian people is the unstable responsibility of the international community."
He also said that the situation in Iran "has a direct impact on peace in the Middle East."
The three-day Munich Security Conference began on Friday and brings together dozens of heads of state and government, ministers and senior officials from around the world.
- 2 ways for US-China relations
Wang said that US-China relations have two roads ahead, diverging from each other.
One is the one where Washington "can understand China reasonably and objectively and have a positive and pragmatic policy toward China and our two sides work together in the same direction, expand our interests that will lead us to cooperation," which would be the "best outcome for both countries and the world," he said.
The other, he added, is "seeking decoupling from China and severing supply chains, and opposing China on everything in a purely emotional knee jerk way," such as efforts to "split Taiwan" from China.
It "would very much likely push China and the US toward conflict," Wang said.
China wants to see "the first prospect, and I believe you share the same way, but China is well prepared to address all kinds of risks."

MUNICH, February 14. /TASS/. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio rejected the idea that the Western alliance is weakening.
Addressing the Munich Security Conference, he noted that after World War II many also believed that Western dominance had come to an end. "In a time of headlines heralding the end of the transatlantic era, let it be known and clear to all that this is neither our goal nor our wish," he said. "We in America have no interest in being polite and orderly caretakers of the West's managed decline," Rubio emphasized. He added that Washington needs strong allies who are proud of their culture and heritage and are prepared to defend a shared civilization.

Bangladesh PM-to-be celebrates landslide win, thanks protesters
Prime minister-in-waiting Tarique Rahman dedicated his victory to those who ‘sacrificed for democracy’ after the first polls since a deadly 2024 uprising
Bangladesh’s prime minister-in-waiting Tarique Rahman on Saturday dedicated his landslide election win to those who “sacrificed for democracy”, calling for unity after the first polls since a deadly 2024 uprising.
Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) leader Rahman, 60, the scion of one of the most powerful political dynasties, is set to lead the South Asian nation of 170 million people after sweeping elections on Thursday.
“This victory belongs to Bangladesh, belongs to democracy,” he said, in his first speech since the vote. “This victory belongs to people who aspire to and have sacrificed for democracy.”
He will take over from an interim government that has steered Bangladesh since the student-led uprising ended the iron-fisted rule of Sheikh Hasina in August 2024.
Rahman’s success marks a remarkable turnaround for a man who only returned to Bangladesh in December after 17 years in exile in Britain, far from Dhaka’s political turmoil.
The BNP alliance won 212 seats, compared with 77 for the Jamaat-e-Islami-led alliance of 11 political parties, according to the Electoral Commission.

The Simpsons showrunner says series will ‘never have a finale’
Unusual way long-running animated series would end has been revealed
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
The Simpsons fans have long been predicting the show will end soon, but the animated series’s showrunner has now shed light on what that would look like.
The series, which premiered in 1989, is on its 37th season and 800th episode – and it’s being speculated that the forthcoming film, a sequel to 2007’s The Simpsons Movie, could serve as its swansong.
Should the show come to an end, though, Matt Selman is adamant it won’t be your standard season finale and would merely seem like just another episode.
“We did an episode about a year-and-a-half ago that was like a parody of the series finale,” he said.
“We jammed every possible series finale concept into one show, so that was sort of my way of saying we’re never going to do a series finale.”
He told TheWrap the episode “made fun of all the ideas of wrapping everything up or ending”, adding: “If the show ever did end, there’s no finale; it would just be a regular episode that has the family in it. Probably a little Easter egg here and there, but no ‘I’m going to miss this place.’”
Selman said The Simpsons “isn’t supposed to change” each week, stating: “The characters reset every week. It’s like Groundhog Day, but they don’t know it – and they don’t die that much.”
Despite Selman’s comments, the show has killed off several characters in recent years.
In November, The Simpsons killed off Alice Glick, the organist in Springfield’s church, who died during a service being led by Reverend Lovejoy.
Alice Glick was introduced in season two episode 21, “Three Men and a Comic Book”, which aired in 1991, and was voiced by Cloris Leachman. Tress MacNeille took over the role following Leachman’s death in 2021.
Executive producer Tim Long confirmed Glick’s death, telling People: “In a sense, Alice the organist will live forever, through the beautiful music she made. But in another, more important sense, yep, she's dead as a doornail.”
The year before, The Simpsons killed off Larry the Barfly, a beloved character who had featured on the show since season 10.
In response to an outcry from viewers, Long said: “I’m sorry if some fans are upset, but we really wanted to use Larry’s death as a way to show that even the most peripheral people in our lives have dignity and worth, and that we really shouldn’t take anyone for granted.”

NAIROBI, Feb 14 - The Ethiopian Media Authority has declined to renew the accreditation for three Addis Ababa-based journalists from Reuters, the news agency said.
The EMA also revoked the news agency's accreditation to cover the 39th African Union summit, which was taking place in the Ethiopian capital on February 14-15.
The move comes days after the news agency published an investigative report that said Ethiopia was hosting a secret camp to train thousands of fighters for the Rapid Support Forces paramilitary group in neighbouring Sudan. Ethiopia has not publicly commented on the story.
While the EMA has informally indicated that the February 10 Reuters story prompted its decision, it has not made an official statement.
"Reuters is reviewing the matter and will continue to cover Ethiopia in an independent, impartial and reliable way in keeping with the Thomson Reuters Trust Principles," Reuters said in a statement.

Palestinian president calls for lifting Israeli obstacles to Gaza truce

20:16:00 KST

Palestinian President Mahmud Abbas on Saturday urged the removal of what he described as Israeli-imposed obstacles to advancing the second phase of the Gaza ceasefire.
"We emphasize the need to lift all obstacles imposed by the Israeli occupation on the implementation of the provisions related to the second phase of the agreement," Abbas said, in a speech read by his prime minister Mohammed Mustafa at an African Union summit in Ethiopia.
This included the work of a technocratic committee established to oversee the day-to-day governance of Gaza, he added.
Removal of the obstacles was needed to "ensure continuity of services, coordinate humanitarian efforts and enable a swift recovery", the president said.
Abbas accused Israel of "continuing to violate" the ceasefire agreement that took effect in October and ended Israel's two-year war that began on Oct. 8, 2023. Palestinian authorities say the conflict killed more than 72,000 Palestinians, wounded over 171,000 others and caused widespread destruction affecting 90% of civilian infrastructure. The U.N. estimates reconstruction costs at approximately $70 billion.
"From the announcement of the ceasefire until today, more than 500 Palestinians have been killed (in Gaza), which threatens the durability of the truce and the full implementation of its second phase," Abbas added.
Even though the U.S.-brokered truce entered its second phase last month, Israel has continued airstrikes across the territory, killing 591 and injuring over 1,578 others.
The deal is aimed at permanently ending the war in Gaza and was endorsed in November by the United Nations.
Its second phase stipulates that Israeli forces gradually withdraw from Gaza and Palestinian group Hamas should disarm, with an international stabilization force deployed to ensure security.
Hamas has repeatedly said that disarmament is a red line, although it has indicated it could consider handing over its weapons to a future Palestinian governing authority.
The Israeli army still occupies more than half of the Gaza Strip.
Fifteen Palestinian experts on the technocratic committee, which is being overseen by a "Board of Peace" set up by U.S. President Donald Trump, are currently based in Egypt, despite a partial reopening on Feb. 2 of the Rafah border crossing, Gaza's only gateway to the outside world that does not lead to Israel.

Indian Air Force to help train British jet pilots

20:15:38 KST

Indian Air Force instructors are set to begin training Royal Air Force fast jet pilots at RAF Valley under a new agreement that may also help ease long-running pressure on Britain’s military flying training pipeline.
The British High Commission in New Delhi confirmed that three Indian Qualified Flying Instructors (QFIs) will deploy to RAF Valley for an initial two-year period, marking the first time Indian instructors will directly support fast jet training for RAF pilots at the base.
RAF Valley, located in Anglesey, is central to the UK’s fast jet training system, hosting training aircraft such as the Hawk T2 and Texan T1. The announcement comes after repeated concerns raised in defence circles about bottlenecks across the wider UK Military Flying Training System.
The High Commission said the move was agreed following the 19th UK–India Air Staff Talks in New Delhi, describing it as part of a broader effort to expand military training engagement between the two air forces.
Air Vice Marshal Ian Townsend, Assistant Chief of the Air Staff, said the agreement was “a significant step” in strengthening ties between the two services. “Bringing Indian QFIs into UK Military Flying Training Systems deepens our cooperation, enhances interoperability and reinforces our shared commitment to excellence in aircrew training,” he said.
“Together, we are investing in the foundation of a long-term collaboration and shaping a partnership that is both enduring and strategic in its outlook.”
The British Defence Adviser in New Delhi, Commodore Chris Saunders, also emphasised the wider strategic framing of the initiative, linking it to the long-term UK–India defence agenda. “The forthcoming deployment of Indian Qualified Flying Instructors to the UK represents another significant milestone in our expanding defence relationship,” he said.
“It reinforces the mutual trust and shared experience that underpins our training cooperation and exemplifies the increasingly sophisticated levels of interoperability we are building together across our services.”
The agreement follows a separate development earlier this year, when an Indian Air Force officer was deployed as an instructor to RAF College Cranwell, the UK’s air officer training academy. UK officials said this meant all three of Britain’s military academies now host Indian instructors from their respective services, including at Britannia Royal Naval College Dartmouth and the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst.
The High Commission added that the Indian instructors will remain under Indian Air Force command while carrying out instructional duties under RAF commanders at Valley.

Geneva burkini ban blocked after government rules proposal unlawful
A proposal to effectively ban the burkini in Geneva’s public pools was blocked on Friday after the cantonal government ruled it unlawful.
+ Get the most important news from Switzerland in your inbox
In Geneva, the right‑wing majority in the cantonal parliament was set on Friday to approve a bill regulating swimwear in public pools, a move that would have effectively banned the burkini. But the cantonal government stepped in, ruling the proposal unlawful and halting the process by cancelling the final debate.
+ Is the Swiss burka ban a tyranny of the majority?
The issue is expected to return to the cantonal parliament at a future session, as the executive must now put forward legally compliant alternatives. Carole‑Anne Kast, member of the cantonal government and head of the Department of Institutions, criticised the bill, calling it “completely disproportionate and a blatant violation of women’s rights and freedoms”.
The cantonal parliament had originally been debating a proposal put forward by the Swiss People’s Party to introduce penalties for wearing the burkini in public pools. Green Party member Dilara Bayrak condemned it as “a sexist and xenophobic bill”. Calling the debate unworthy of the canton, she urged that women be free to dress as they choose.
Government warns of disproportionate restrictions
Yves Nidegger, from the Swiss People’s Party, argued that “we live in a society where women don’t need to be covered up to avoid being assaulted”. With that, the tone of the debate, not the first of its kind in Geneva’s parliament, was set. But proceedings soon shifted into more technical territory.

Burkini permitted in Geneva city swimming pools
A majority, comprising the Swiss People’s Party, the Radical-Liberal Party, the Centre Party and almost all the Geneva Citizens’ Movement members, backed an amendment from the Centre. The proposal, presented by Alia Chaker Mangeat, recast the original text as a new bill on public swimming pools and baths, sidestepping the issue of banning the burkini through criminal law. Most lawmakers considered a criminal‑law route excessive.
Burkini ban push stalls
The amendment specifies that “the only clothing allowed in swimming pools is one‑piece or two‑piece swimwear that does not extend below the knee and leaves the arms uncovered”. In practice, this excludes the burkini. “Public spaces should be places of emancipation, not of pressure,” said Mangeat, who voiced concern about a resurgence of conservative attitudes.
When pressed on holding a third debate, the step needed for a final vote, Kast avoided giving a direct answer. She pointed instead to a series of practical and legal complications that, she said, made the bill unworkable, including the autonomy of the communes and the costs linked to enforcing the rules.

Gisèle Pelicot wants to look ex-husband ‘straight in the eye’ as she needs answers

Gisèle Pelicot has said she needs to visit prison to look her abusive ex-husband “straight in the eye” after his conviction for drugging her and inviting dozens of men to rape her in a case that shocked France and the rest of the world.
Pelicot, 73, said she needed “answers” from Dominique Pelicot over the potential abuse of their daughter and the case of an estate agent who was raped and murdered in 1991, which he is under investigation for.
Dominique Pelicot was jailed for 20 years by a French court in December 2024 after being found guilty of the attacks, alongside 50 other men whom he invited to rape and sexually assault his wife. There are thought to have been at least 70 perpetrators but police have not been able to identify them all.
Questions also remain over whether the couple’s daughter, Caroline Darian, was also abused by Dominique, something that caused a rift when Darian accused her mother of not believing her when police discovered two photos of her unconscious and wearing underwear she did not recognise.
Pelicot said the revelations had not brought the family together, instead describing them as “an explosion that blows everything away”, but she is rebuilding her relationship with her daughter whom she now speaks to every day on the phone.
She told the New York Times that the uncertainty for Darian was “inescapable hell”. “There are those two photos of her asleep that open up a lot of questions. But I don’t have any answers, and Monsieur Pelicot didn’t give her any answers either.”
Pelicot said of her ex-husband: “I hope that when we’re face to face, he’ll be able to tell me the truth, both about his daughter and about everything else he’s now accused of. Maybe he’ll have some remorse. I’m still holding on to that hope. Maybe I’m naive, maybe I won’t get an answer.”
Pelicot described the day in November 2020 when she had been brought into the station to discuss, she thought, an incident where her then husband was caught filming up women’s skirts.
She saw a police officer’s “face start to change” as he pointed to a stack of files. She was asked if she recognised herself in a photo of a woman being raped by a man she did not know.
“And of course I didn’t recognise myself, because I was with a man I didn’t know, who was raping me. I said: ‘I don’t know this man’ … He shows me a second photo, which is pretty much the same, and he says: ‘That’s you there.’ I say no, and he says: ‘This is your room, Madame Pelicot, these are your bedside lamps. We searched your home, these are your belongings.’”
The police officer told her Dominique was in custody and that 53 people had been arrested. “He tells me that I have been raped about 200 times. I say: ‘But that’s not possible.’ And then I ask for a glass of water because I can’t talk any more.”
She described later watching the videos. “I’m a rag doll. It’s as if I’ve come out of surgery, because I’m completely anaesthetised. These men, when you see what they’re doing to me – how is it possible that my body couldn’t feel anything? … Fortunately for me, I have no memories, because I think I would have killed myself afterward.”
She described feeling shame and spending “hours in the shower trying to wash away this filth, this dirt that makes you feel dehumanised”.
Pelicot also talked about specific incidents, including a crown on one of her teeth coming loose, which she later realised was caused by oral rape.
“When I discovered the videos showing the violence these men inflicted on me, in my limp mouth – they have to hold my head because my face is falling, I have no muscle tone – and Monsieur Pelicot doesn’t even react. There is no empathy, no pity for this woman who is there, completely dead in her bed. It was incredibly violent to tell myself that even that, they didn’t spare me.”
During the trial, Pelicot waived her right to anonymity as a survivor of sexual abuse. “The shame is theirs,” she famously stated of her abusers – and became a global feminist icon, leaving court each day to applause from gathered crowds.
Support poured in from high-profile people, including the French president, Emmanuel Macron, who thanked her for her “dignity and courage”, and Queen Camilla of the UK.
In a letter, Camilla wrote to express her “heartfelt admiration for the courage, grace and dignity with which you have faced the horrific crimes committed against you”.
Speaking to BBC Newsnight at the weekend, Pelicot said: “I felt moved and very honoured that she had become aware of what had happened to me. I am grateful to her.”

German military expert: Ukraine and Russia too far apart for peace
German military expert Christian Moelling said this in a comment to Ukrinform.
"The key question is whether there is any room for maneuver for both sides – for the Russians and the Ukrainians. My impression is that right now it is almost impossible, because Putin cannot go home with what is currently on the negotiation table, but Zelensky also cannot go home with what is on the table," the expert said.
He believes the situation has effectively reached a deadlock and admits he does not feel optimistic. At the same time, Moelling hopes developments could lead to a solution acceptable to both sides.
When asked whether U.S. President Donald Trump could end Russia's war against Ukraine, Moelling noted that the U.S. leader himself seems to think so.
"But it depends on how strongly he [Trump] wants to pressure the Ukrainians. And obviously, he is not prepared to put too much pressure on the Russians," the expert added.
As previously reported, Trump recently said that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky needs to "get moving" to avoid missing a "great opportunity" to reach a peace deal, as Russia, in his view, wants such an agreement.
The next trilateral meeting of representatives from Ukraine, the U.S., and Russia is scheduled to take place in Geneva on February 17-18.

Four-week-old infant in Ashdod died of respiratory failure, Health Ministry says

The Health Ministry announced the cause of death for a four-week-old baby who passed away at Samson Assuta Ashdod University Hospital as respiratory failure on Friday.
The announcement was made after the conclusion of an external review committee ordered by the Director General of the Health Ministry after the infant’s death was reported on February 7.
The Health Ministry investigation revealed that the baby had consumed Nutrilon products from a recalled batch before its death.
The Nutrilon formula, which was recalled by Teva Israel in late January, was pulled from shelves due to toxin levels exceeding acceptable threshold values.
Cereulide, a toxin produced by certain strains of the bacteria Bacillus cereus, was found in multiple batches of Nutrilon formula. The presence of the toxin was caused by a malfunction in the production process of the baby formula, a Health Ministry statement published at the time of the recalls stated.
The consumption of Cereulide toxin can cause vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and cramps in infants, but it has not been proven to cause death.
Further testing, investigation ordered by Health Ministry
According to the Health Ministry statement, the National Center for Forensic Medicine determined that the infant’s death in Ashdod was not caused by Cereulide consumption.
Despite Cereulide toxicity being ruled out, the Health Ministry ordered that additional tests be conducted and stated that “the external review committee will also examine this issue,” adding that the committee's further conclusions will determine whether any additional action is needed.
The Health Ministry stated that they share the family of the infant’s grief and affirmed that it will “continue to act with full transparency, thoroughly and quickly to clarify the circumstances of the case, and will update on the findings and conclusions of the examination.”

Palomino: Taste the latest Italian creations at a Jerusalem favorite - restaurant review

I have been a fan of Palomino since it opened in Jerusalem almost five years ago, especially their Friday brunch, which I think is one of the best deals around. It includes both an extensive buffet and a dish ordered from the menu for NIS 109 per person.
In fact, I like to think that I may have had a little to do with the brunch menu, as I reviewed it when it first started. (www.jpost.com/food-recipes/article-739786) and told Alon Ravia, one of the four owners who have been friends since childhood, that the only thing missing was something sweet to end the meal. The next time I went, they had small squares of delicious chocolate cake at the end of the buffet. Mission accomplished.
Visiting Palomino is like taking a trip to Italy, as the dishes offer classic Italian fare. They have now launched a new menu of specials called Chef’s Table, which will rotate every two months. The specials are meant for “sharing,” the new trend in Israeli restaurants. My favorite husband and I found all the specials that we tried creative and unique.
We started with a cocktail, which always makes a meal feel special. I had a rum-based “girly” drink, which was delicious and not too sweet. Cliff had a twist on a whisky sour, which was also good (but not as good as mine!).
From the Chef’s Table menu, we started with the crudo of red tuna (NIS 78), which was slices of red tuna in a blood-orange vinaigrette with fleur de sel and a disk of marmalade made from limoncello. It was absolutely delicious, although a relatively small portion.
We moved on to the gnocchi ricotta (NIS 68), also from the specials menu, which was gnocchi made from ricotta cheese instead of potato; it came in a cream of Parmigiana sauce with thyme and chives. I’d never had gnocchi made from ricotta before, and they were light and creamy.
We also tried the tortellini de zucca (NIS 69), which were handmade tortellini filled with pumpkin cream in a salsa sauce, with crumbled amaretto cookies (also made in-house) on top. No need to say anything else! Since the portions are relatively small, we shared a delicious sea bass with gnocchi in a lemon cream sauce from the regular menu (NIS 138) before moving on to dessert.
'Crime against the palate to skip dessert'
Remember, this is a dairy restaurant, so it’s basically a crime against the palate to skip dessert. We tried the only dessert from the specials menu, which was kassis gelato (NIS 41) – blackcurrant ice cream made at the restaurant. Then we couldn’t resist the cannoli, which is worth a special trip to Palomino. Cannoli in Italy is often made with lard, so this is a good opportunity to try this iconic Italian dessert. It consisted of three small tubes of fried pastry dough with a sweet filling made with ricotta. Worth every calorie. We ate it below a neon sign on the wall that reads, “Leave the gun and take the cannoli.”
The specials menu is a great addition to Palomino’s regular menu and well worth a try.

Jeffrey Epstein ‘asked Andrew to fix him a meeting with Gaddafi’
It comes as police held discussions with the Crown Prosecution Service over allegations that Andrew shared confidential reports from his role as the UK’s trade envoy with the late paedophile
- Bookmark
Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor spoke to a Libyan contact to help arrange a meeting for Jeffrey Epstein with Colonel Gaddafi in Tripoli, emails appear to show.
Messages within the latest release by the US Department of Justice of its Epstein files, from autumn 2010, show that the disgraced financier contacted royal aide David Stern, saying [sic] “i want to go to tripoli lets organize with pa”.
The paedophile then appears to have sent another email to Mr Stern, writing: “people that have seen the father, have asked me if i want to meet him as he does not know where to put his money as opposed to what to do with it, currencies etc, I wondered if Pa should make the intro instead.”
The emails were first unearthed from the Epstein files by Channel 4 News, which reported that “the father” refers to the late Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi, to distinguish him from his well-known son Saif.
The initials “PA” are believed to refer to the then Prince Andrew, and this is how Mr Stern and Epstein appear to refer to him in multiple emails.
It appears that Mr Stern then consulted Andrew, in a reply dated the following day, 8 October 2010, writing: “He is thinking about the best approach and will discuss with me when I see him next on 17th Oct in Hong Kong (he is leaving today for Asia).”
The former Duke of York made an official visit to China in October 2010, and was the UK’s trade envoy at the time.
Later emails from “The Duke”, signed “A”, to Epstein’s address, say: “I will call you later this evening after I have had my chat with my Libyan contact to see what we can arrange for you in Tripoli.”
On the same day, 4 November 2010, “A” follows up to Epstein, writing: “Libya fixed. Call me whenever.”
It comes after Thames Valley Police said on Wednesday that they had held discussions with specialists from the Crown Prosecution Service about allegations that Andrew shared confidential reports from his role as the UK’s trade envoy with Epstein.
It appears that the planned meeting between Epstein and Gaddafi did not go ahead, as Epstein did not end up flying to the Libyan capital, Channel 4 News reported.
Elsewhere, in emails from June and July 2010, it appears that “A” discussed a loan from Libya to Dubai with an investment banker called Terence Allen.
Mr Allen wrote: “In light of our conversation last week in relation to Dubai, is there anything I can do there for you??”
“The Duke” replied: “Good question! I know that the only person who can make this decision is the Colonel himself. I will just ask our Libyan friend Tareq to see where he is on the subject, as he has the ear of the private office of Brother Leader.”
Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor has been contacted for comment.

Marco Rubio tells Europe Trump expects ‘seriousness and reciprocity’
‘We care deeply about your future and ours,’ says US Secretary of State at Munich Security Conference
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
Marco Rubio, the US Secretary of State, has sought to mend transatlantic ties at the Munich Security Conference, despite also delivering a stark critique of Western nations’ missteps over the past four decades.
His address offered a significant contrast to a blistering attack on America’s European allies made by vice president JD Vance in 2025.
Mr Rubio insisted that the fate of the United States and Europe “will always be intertwined”, stating that Donald Trump “demands seriousness and reciprocity from our friends here in Europe” because “we care deeply about your future and ours”.
However, he also criticised the United Nations and warned that the "rules-based global order" that emerged after the Cold War had been a "dangerous delusion". The conference agenda is dominated by European defence and the future of the transatlantic relationship, particularly as America’s commitment to Nato faces scrutiny.
Amidst these discussions, Mr Rubio notably failed to attend a meeting of Ukraine’s allies, who gathered on Friday as the fourth anniversary of Russia’s full-scale invasion approaches.
US officials cited scheduling conflicts, but his absence was perceived by some Europeans as a sign of the White House’s diminishing interest in involving them in efforts to end the conflict.
In his speech, Mr Rubio affirmed: "We want Europe to be strong. We believe that Europe must survive because the two great wars of the last century serve for us as history’s constant reminder that, ultimately, our destiny is and will always be intertwined with yours. Because we know that the fate of Europe will never be irrelevant to our own."
He suggested that the West’s victory in the Cold War had fostered complacency, telling attendees: "The euphoria of this triumph led us to a dangerous delusion that we had entered, quote, The End of History, that every nation would now be a liberal democracy, that the ties formed by trade and by commerce alone would now replace nationhood, that the rules-based global order – an overused term – would now replace the national interest, and that we would now live in a world without borders, where everyone became a citizen of the world."
Mr Rubio acknowledged that "we made these mistakes together, and now together, we owe it to our people to face those facts and to move forward to rebuild."
He further claimed that the UN was among the global institutions requiring reform, adding: "We cannot ignore that today, on the most pressing matters before us, it has no answers and has played virtually no role." Wolfgang Ischinger, the conference chairman, noted a "sigh of relief through this hall" during Mr Rubio’s speech, highlighting its divergence from Mr Vance’s earlier remarks.

R48 Chef’s Table: A Far East testing menu in Tel Aviv - restaurant review
Unknown
Unknown Publisher

11:11:31 UTC
20:11:31 KST

Just inside the hotel lobby at R48, located off Rothschild Boulevard, a small dining room fills quietly in the early evening. There is no sense of urgency. Guests settle in knowing the night ahead will unfold course by course, guided entirely by the chef. The experience is as aesthetically pleasing as it is delicious.
This is R48 Chef’s Table, an intimate fine-dining experience led by chef Ohad Solomon. With just nine tables and 22 seats, it has become one of Tel Aviv’s most sought-after reservations, often booked weeks in advance by diners celebrating milestones or seeking a serious tasting-menu experience.
Indulging in the season
The current winter tasting menu at R48 Chef’s Table draws inspiration from across the Far East, exploring a range of techniques, aromas, and contrasts rather than adhering to a single tradition. The result is a 12-course progression that builds gradually, with the season expressed mainly through ingredients. The price is NIS 620 per person, including soft drinks.
The menu opens with a Lion’s Mane “Pie Tee”: an ultra-thin crisp shell filled with porcini cream, topped with seared lion’s mane mushroom, thin slices of king oyster mushroom, and mushroom powder. It’s served alongside a sake and lavender sphere, created using a technique that encapsulates the liquid into a bubble that bursts as you bite into it.
The Cheung Fun course is bright and aromatic: a broth infused with kaffir lime, galangal (a root from the ginger family), and lemongrass, poured over somen (thin Japanese wheat noodles) and zucchini noodles, accompanied by a black cod roll wrapped in rice paper. Ginger salsa and fresh herbs complete the dish.
Another standout plate features appam, a South Indian-style fermented rice bread that’s thin, airy, and lightly tangy. It’s paired with small parcels wrapped in pickled nori, filled with soybeans and pak boong (water spinach); finished off with thin slices of local sirloin.
For those who prefer a fish and dairy menu or avoid seafood altogether, the team is happy to accommodate.
The menu concludes with a new, show-stopping dessert: Rice & Koji, Jaggery Caramel, and Toasted Coconut. I was tempted to ask for another.
Beyond wine pairings
In addition to classic and premium wine pairing options, priced at NIS 250 and NIS 450 respectively, R48 Chef’s Table offers a cocktail-based spirits pairing that has become one of its signatures. In fact, it’s the only restaurant in the country offering a cocktail pairing alongside a tasting menu, and it’s a complete yes.
The beverage program is led by Nika, R48’s sommelier and head of beverages. Nearly everything in the cocktails, aside from the base spirits, is made in-house, including seasonal syrups and infusions developed specifically to match the menu. Standout pairings include a tequila-based cocktail and a rich cognac cocktail, both designed to mirror the flavors on the plate. I’m still thinking about both.
A non-alcoholic pairing is also available and crafted with the same attention to structure and progression, priced at NIS 280.
One chef, two experiences
It’s worth noting that R48 operates a dual culinary concept, with two restaurants serving distinct purposes. On Rothschild Boulevard, the R48 Brasserie is a street-facing Mediterranean restaurant built around à la carte dining, business lunches, and lively evenings. Inside the hotel, the Chef’s Table offers a focused, high-end tasting menu designed for guests who want to fully commit to the chef’s vision for the evening.
Together, the two restaurants allow R48 to operate across different moods and moments, while maintaining a consistent culinary identity thanks to Solomon, whose path to R48 is rooted in some of Tel Aviv’s most formative kitchens.
After completing stages in Italy, France, and London, Solomon returned to Israel to work at Toto, long regarded as one of the country’s most demanding culinary training grounds. He later joined the R2M group, spending nearly a decade as head chef of Coffee Bar. Three years ago, he left Coffee Bar to establish R48.
The Chef’s Table opened first as a tightly focused project, allowing him to explore the tasting-menu format without compromise. Nearly a year later, the Brasserie followed, expanding the concept into a more accessible, everyday setting.
At home, Solomon says he tends to cook simply. But dining out, in his view, should deliver something layered and unexpected. That mindset led him toward the cuisines of the Far East, which serve as the inspiration behind the Chef’s Table winter menu.
Justifying fine dining in Israel
Solomon sees the growing interest in chef-driven tasting menus as part of a broader shift in Israel’s dining culture. Diners are increasingly curious, well traveled, and open to committing time and attention to a meal.
“These menus offer a complete journey,” he says. “Guests let go, trust the chef, and step into something intentional.” But that trust comes with responsibility. “If you want to charge at a high level, the experience has to justify it every night.”
The winter menu will run through April, after which a spring-inspired version will be introduced. Take a seat at R48 Chef’s Table to see how a seasonal menu unfolds in the hands of a confident chef.

MSF halts non-critical operations in Gaza's Nasser hospital amid sightings of armed men, weapons

Doctors Without Borders (MSF) announced the suspension of all noncritical medical operations in Nasser Hospital in southern Gaza after reports emerged of armed men using the facility to move weapons and interrogate patients on Saturday.
“In recent months, in Nasser Hospital in Khan Yunis, patients and MSF personnel have seen armed men, some masked, in different areas of the large compound of the hospital,” the nonprofit organization said in a statement published on its website.
It also specified that these situations occurred in parts of the medical compound where the MSF is not conducting activities.
“With an uptick since the ceasefire, MSF teams have reported a pattern of unacceptable acts – including the presence of armed men, intimidation, arbitrary arrests of patients, and a recent situation of suspicion of movement of weapons,” MSF said, adding that “these incidents pose serious security threats to our teams and patients.”
The organization said that “MSF formally expressed our strong concern to the relevant authorities, and emphasized the incompatibility of such violations with MSF’s medical mission. Hospitals must remain neutral, civilian spaces, free from military presence or activity, to ensure the safe and impartial delivery of medical care.”
According to a Reuters report, this directive was also applied to several other hospitals in southern Gaza where armed men were spotted.
The Reuters report included a statement by the Hamas-run Gaza Interior Ministry, which claimed that it was committed to preventing any armed presence inside hospitals, and that legal action would be taken against violators.
Israel to terminate MSF activity in Gaza after org. fails to provide staff list
MSF has been under scrutiny recently after failing to provide a staff list that would confirm it has no links to terrorist organizations.
On January 30, the organization announced it would not provide the staff lists requested by Israel to maintain access to Gaza and the West Bank, citing the inability to secure assurances about the safety of its teams as the reason for its decision.
As a result, Israel moved to terminate MSF’s presence in Gaza, announcing that all operations would cease on February 28.
“Unfortunately, MSF is once again demonstrating a lack of transparency and acting out of irrelevant interests,” said Diaspora Affairs and Combatting Antisemitism Minister Amichai Chikli. “The organization abruptly changed its position after publicly committing to act according to procedure.”
Chikli went on to say that “we are aware that MSF employs individuals who are active in terrorist organizations, which is why it hides its employee lists.”
“The organization operates in coordination with the Hamas Health Ministry, and not by coincidence, its statements were published in proximity to similar statements from elements within the Gaza Strip,” he said.

Shoes off, sushi on: Terasu redefines omakase in Israel - restaurant review
Unknown
Unknown Publisher
2026-02-14
11:11:22 UTC
20:11:22 KST

On a street in Jaffa, behind an unassuming door, chef Daniel Schiff is serving one of the city’s most intimate and in-demand dining experiences: Terasu, a modern sushi omakase that’s both elevated and personal.
Guests begin the evening not by pulling up a chair at a counter, but by taking off their shoes, seated low to the floor in a minimalist, Japanese-inspired space that instantly signals this is something different from a typical night out in Tel Aviv.
Schiff, 32, is the kind of chef whose path doesn’t follow the traditional culinary-school-to-fine-dining pipeline. In fact, much of his training was self-taught. “When I started, there weren’t many places to really learn traditional sushi in Israel,” he explains. “So I taught myself the basics.”
He honed in on that curiosity by over the years occasionally working alongside private chefs. But his biggest leap came recently: a six-month internship in Tokyo under renowned chef Hiroyuki Sato, who runs a traditional sushi omakase counter in Ginza. It left a lasting impression, not only in technique but in work ethic. “The chef goes to the market every day at 6 or 7 a.m. and finishes at 1 a.m. Daily. With one day off.”
It’s that level of dedication that Schiff brought back with him to Tel Aviv.
Terasu: rice, fish craft and care
Dinner at Terasu is a 22-course progression of small bites, beginning with around seven appetizers before moving into sushi. The fish is succulent, while the rice strikes a subtle balance between sweet and savory. Throughout the evening, diners enjoy fish including hamachi and a variety of bluefin tuna cuts, from akami (the lean red meat from the upper back of the tuna), to chutoro (a medium-fatty cut from the side and underbelly), and otoro (the fattiest belly portion). The menu also features bites topped with ikura (salmon roe) and one of the evening’s highlights: sweet red shrimp nigiri.
This is not an experience for vegetarians or those who avoid fish entirely. And if you don’t eat shellfish, don’t fret: the team will ensure your meal remains a fish-only journey. The structure of the meal stays consistent, with the fish changing depending on season and daily availability. Desserts rotate occasionally. I’m still dreaming about the chocolate mousse with miso.
The price is 590 NIS per person (excluding drinks and service). Schiff’s sake program ranges from small pours at NIS 50–75 to bottles priced between NIS 300–600. Wine is also available, with bottles ranging from NIS 190–290. Classic cocktails are offered as well, with three options priced from NIS 55–70.
Terasu typically operates Tuesday through Thursday, with occasional special Friday services. The dining room seats 12 guests per seating, with two services each night at 6 p.m. and 9 p.m., lasting about two to two-and-a-half hours. Unsurprisingly, the restaurant is booked out months in advance.
A balcony of humble beginnings
When you enter Terasu, which I would consider locally a semi-fine dining experience, it doesn’t feel strict or stuffy. It’s sophisticated but comfortable, perhaps partly due to the restaurant’s modest beginnings in Schiff’s own home.
About three years ago, he started hosting couples and small groups on the balcony of his apartment on Rothschild Boulevard. The name Terasu is a nod to those beginnings: “terrace” in Japanese. Since then, Terasu has grown into a fully realized omakase experience, one that continues to evolve with every trip Schiff takes to Japan. Much of what guests see and touch throughout the meal, from the handcrafted tableware to the uniquely beautiful sake glasses, has been imported directly from Japan. These small aesthetic details are intentional, adding another layer to the experience.
“I picked everything out myself while I was there,” Schiff says. “Handmade Japanese pottery and porcelain is a big part of the experience at the table.”
“Each time I come back from Japan, Terasu becomes a bit more traditional and minimalistic,” he adds. “But I still leave some things for the Israeli taste.” That balance is part of what defines Terasu: Japanese technique and restraint, with subtle Western touches. Schiff points to appetizers that are slightly saltier than what you might find in Tokyo, and desserts that lean more European than Japanese. “The dessert isn’t Japanese,” he admits. “It’s more Western.”
A growing appetite for omakase
Terasu’s dining format is unique here, as sushi omakase is still relatively rare in Israel. Some restaurants offer Japanese fare with sushi included, but not a true sushi-focused omakase. But Schiff believes that is changing.
“The demand is growing,” he says. “More and more people are traveling to Japan, and when they come back, they crave that connection to Japanese culture.” He sees the rise of omakase not as competition, but as a sign of a maturing dining scene.
“People focus on the fish, but sushi is rice,” Schiff says. “Eighty percent of the importance is the rice.” It’s a philosophy rooted in tradition, and one that stands in contrast to the elaborate sushi rolls that dominate much of the local market. “I’m not against it,” he says, referencing popular additions like sweet potato, avocado, or spicy mayo. “But it’s not traditional Japanese sushi that we focus on at Terasu.”
Looking ahead
For now, Schiff, the restaurant’s sole owner, is focused on continuing to refine Terasu. Still, he hints at future ambitions, including the possibility of opening a more casual spot in Tel Aviv.
In a city that never slows down, Terasu offers something increasingly rare: a quiet, deliberate meal where diners settle close to the floor and surrender to the rhythm of the chef’s choosing. It’s a new chapter for omakase in Israel, and demand shows no sign of slowing.

Europe must defend itself 'at all times,' says EU Commission chief
'Time has come to bring Europe's mutual defense clause to life,' says Ursula von der Leyen
ISTANBUL
European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said Saturday that Europe must be ready to defend itself “at all times,” warning that rising geopolitical tensions and external pressure on democratic systems require the continent to strengthen its strategic independence.
Speaking at the Munich Security Conference, von der Leyen said Europe faces “the very distinct threat of outside forces trying to weaken our union from within,” alongside intensifying global rivalry affecting everything from territory to technology regulation.
“Fundamentally, all of this points to a simple reality in today's fractured world, Europe must become more independent. There is no other choice,” she said, stressing that independence must cover defense, energy, trade, raw materials, and digital technology.
Von der Leyen rejected suggestions that stronger European autonomy could weaken transatlantic ties, saying “an independent Europe is a strong Europe, and a strong Europe makes for a stronger transatlantic alliance.”
Highlighting the bloc’s defense efforts since Russia’s war on Ukraine, she said European military spending in 2025 rose nearly 80% compared with prewar levels.
“The time has come to bring Europe's mutual defense clause to life,” she said, describing collective defense under Article 42.7 of the EU treaty as “not an optional task” but a binding commitment.
Von der Leyen called for faster decision-making on security matters, suggesting the EU may increasingly rely on qualified majority voting rather than unanimity to accelerate action.
She also urged closer cooperation with partners outside the bloc, particularly the UK, saying that “10 years from Brexit, our futures are as bound as ever,” and calling for deeper coordination on security, democracy, and economic resilience.
Drawing lessons from Ukraine’s battlefield experience, she stressed that industrial capacity and innovation are decisive factors in modern warfare, noting that drones now account for “around 80% of battlefield damages on both sides.”
Europe must therefore strengthen defense production and dual-use technologies such as artificial intelligence and advanced manufacturing, she said.
“Some ask whether we can afford this, but I say we cannot afford not to,” von der Leyen added, arguing that investment in defense is essential to safeguard “peace and freedom.”

Royal Marines fire mortars in Arctic Norway training

Royal Marines have carried out live mortar firing drills in northern Norway as part of preparations for a major NATO exercise and an expanded UK role in Arctic security, the Royal Navy stated.
The mortar training took place near the village of Moen, more than 200 miles inside the Arctic Circle, as around 1,500 UK Commandos continue intensive mission rehearsals in sub-zero conditions. The activity forms part of NATO’s wider efforts to strengthen its northern flank and protect Nordic member states.
According to the Royal Navy, the marines practised firing 81mm mortars from Viking and BV206 all-terrain vehicles, combining mobility with fire support training in harsh terrain. The service said the weapons are capable of delivering around 15 rounds per minute, with ranges of up to 3.5 miles.
The drills are part of preparations for Cold Response 26, NATO’s largest Arctic exercise this year, due to take place from 9 to 19 March. The exercise is expected to involve around 25,000 troops from 14 nations operating across northern Norway and Finland.
The Royal Navy said the training also comes amid plans to increase Britain’s presence in the region, alongside expected UK participation in NATO’s Arctic Sentry mission and further Joint Expeditionary Force activity later this year.
Defence Secretary John Healey said: “Demands on defence are rising, and Russia poses the greatest threat to Arctic and High North security that we have seen since the Cold War.”
He added: “The UK is stepping up to protect the Arctic and High North, doubling the number of troops we have in Norway and scaling up joint exercises with NATO allies.”
Healey said: “Cold Response and Lion Protector will this year see thousands of troops deploy across the Arctic and North Atlantic, with the UK leading the way. We train together, we deter together, and if necessary, we will fight together.”
The Royal Navy said the mortar troops fired day and night for a week in temperatures close to -20°C, using vehicles to rapidly reposition through deep snow in order to avoid remaining static. The service noted that modern battlefield radars can detect mortar firing positions, increasing the importance of mobility to reduce vulnerability to counter-fire.

Dutch foreign minister says US nuclear umbrella 'will remain' central to Europe’s security

MUNICH
The Netherlands' foreign minister said Saturday that discussions around a potential French nuclear umbrella for Europe are legitimate, but stressed that the US nuclear guarantee will remain fundamental to the continent’s security architecture.
Speaking to Anadolu on the second day of the Munich Security Conference, David van Weel said that discussions about expanding Europe’s nuclear deterrence, particularly around France’s capabilities, are not objectionable but emphasized confidence in existing US guarantees.
"So I'm not against these talks and seeing what the French nuclear deterrence could mean for Europe, but I have no doubt that the nuclear umbrella that the US provides us a lot of safety and will remain there," he said.
He also addressed debates over NATO contingency planning amid a possible reduction in Washington's military contributions.
The minister said recent remarks by US Secretary of State Marco Rubio reassured European allies about continued transatlantic cooperation.
"I think we had a very comforting speech here from Secretary Rubio, who said that, yes, we want Europe to do more. ... Yes, we feel that Europe needs to accept the world as it is and not how it should be in their view, but at the same time that the transatlantic bond is here to stay, and they want to build together with Europe," he said.
Van Weel described the current moment as a "wake-up call" for Europe to increase defense efforts, while maintaining a strong alliance with Washington.
"We need to step up our own defense. We need to be able to take care of our own security more. But on top of that, we will have a strong NATO and a strong transatlantic one," he said.
Van Weel also highlighted Türkiye’s role within the alliance, calling it a key contributor to European security.
"So, I think, Türkiye is critical for European security," he said. "I'm therefore very happy that we have this strong nation within NATO."
"I've worked at NATO, so I've seen the large contribution that Türkiye makes to our safety, and I think we should all be happy for them," he concluded.

Iranian president says regional countries can resolve issues together, rejects need for external guardianship
Pezeshkian praises regional leaders’ efforts to boost security and governance, citing cooperation among Türkiye, Azerbaijan, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, UAE, Oman, Pakistan, Afghanistan
ISTANBUL
Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said on Saturday that countries in the region are capable of resolving their problems collectively and peacefully, stressing that they do not need external guardianship, state news agency IRNA reported.
Speaking at the international Iran Corridor 2026 conference in Tehran on investment opportunities and financing for rail and road corridors, Pezeshkian said: “We do not need a custodian. Regional countries can sit together and solve their problems.”
Pezeshkian said the world has become “very small,” and that nations must work to create conditions for peace, security, and stability for present and future generations.
“No country benefits from war,” he said, noting that conflict, violence, and bloodshed do not lead to progress.
He praised efforts by regional leaders to enhance security and governance, citing cooperation among countries including Türkiye, Azerbaijan, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Oman, Pakistan, and Afghanistan.
“We are all trying, and capable, of solving our problems together in peace and calm,” he said.
The Iranian president highlighted the country's “deep and extensive” ties with Russia, saying agreements and signatures reached at the conference reflect concrete implementation rather than symbolic commitments.
“We will implement, we will act, and we will swiftly remove any existing obstacles,” he said.
The remarks came as US President Donald Trump on Friday signaled support for the idea of regime change in Iran, which recently saw protests over worsening economic conditions.
“Seems like that would be the best thing that could happen," Trump told reporters after a visit to Fort Bragg in the state of North Carolina.
The US and Iran held indirect talks in the capital Muscat on Feb. 6 with Omani mediation to discuss Tehran’s nuclear program.
The sit-down marked the end of a roughly eight-month suspension after the US launched strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities during the 12-day Iran-Israel war in June 2025.
The US in recent weeks significantly increased its military footprint in the region, urging Tehran to make a deal before its too late.
The US wants Iran to halt uranium enrichment and has also sought to include its missile program and alleged support for armed groups in the region in the negotiations. Tehran, however, has repeatedly said it would not talk on issues beyond its nuclear program.

China warns US of ‘confrontation’ over any ‘plotting’ on Taiwan

China’s top diplomat, Wang Yi, warned at the Munich Security Conference on Saturday that any U.S. effort to use Taiwan to undermine Beijing’s claims could cross a red line and risk direct confrontation between the two powers.
Speaking at the Munich Security Conference in Germany, Foreign Minister Wang said that in the future, the United States could adopt a China policy that involves "instigating and plotting to split China through Taiwan, crossing China's red line".
"This could very likely lead to a confrontation between China and the United States," he said.
He added that he hoped Washington would pursue a "positive and pragmatic" approach, "but we are also prepared to deal with various risks".
China claims self-ruled Taiwan as its own territory and has not ruled out the use of force to bring it under its control.
The United States has long been the democratic island's most important backer and biggest arms provider, and Taiwan would be heavily reliant on US support in a potential conflict with China.
During his Saturday comments, Wang also weighed in on Beijing's current relationship with Tokyo, which has been under heavy strain since Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi took office in October.
"The Japanese people should no longer allow themselves to be manipulated or deceived by those far-right forces, or by those who seek to revive militarism," Wang said.
"All peace-loving countries should send a clear warning to Japan: if it chooses to walk back on this path, it will only be heading toward self-destruction."

MILAN - Trains operating through the heart of Italy suffered delays of more than an hour on Feb 14, following the latest suspected act of sabotage during the Olympic Games.
Services between Naples in the south and the capital Rome were affected, and there were also delays on the line heading north towards Florence.
Transport Minister Matteo Salvini condemned those behind the incidents following similar problems on Feb 7 on the network and another less serious case midweek.
The stoppages come as Italy hosts the Winter Olympics in Milan and Cortina d’Ampezzo from Feb 6 to 22.
“These are hateful criminal acts aimed at workers and at Italy,” Mr Salvini said in a statement.
“I hope that no one plays down or tries to justify these crimes which put lives at risk.”
The authorities were investigating burnt cables on a section of the high-speed line between Rome and Naples on Feb 14, and two other possible acts of vandalism between the capital and Florence.

Trump’s repeal of landmark Obama-era climate rule: four key takeaways
Environmental groups say ‘cynical and devastating’ reversal of endangerment finding has grave implications
The Trump administration has dismantled the basis for all US climate regulations, in its most confrontational anti-environment move yet.
The 2009 endangerment finding determined that greenhouse gases threaten public health and welfare and should therefore be controlled by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). By revoking it on Thursday, officials eliminated the legal foundation enabling the government to control planet-heating pollution.
Trump said the rollback constituted “the single largest deregulatory action in American history”, while EPA secretary Lee Zeldin said it would end “the holy grail of federal regulatory overreach”.
“The endangerment finding, and the regulations that were based on it, didn’t just regulate emissions,” said Zeldin. “It regulated and targeted the American dream.”
The move prompted widespread condemnation from climate experts and advocates for environmental, public health, and economic justice. Asked to respond to environmental concerns about the new rule on Thursday, Trump said: “Don’t worry about it.”
“This has nothing to do with public health,” he said of the endangerment finding. “This is all a scam, a giant scam.”
The repeal is part of Trump’s sweeping assault on climate policy. On Thursday, he said the endangerment finding formed “the basis for the green new scam”. Since returning to office last January, Trump’s administration has moved aggressively to dismantle pollution rules and boost fossil fuels. That anti-environmental agenda, critics say, serves his fossil-fuel donors.
“These modern-day robber barons would gladly add to their already obscene piles of wealth by making us less safe from climate change,” said Manuel Salgado, federal research manager at the nonprofit We Act for Environmental Justice.
An EPA spokesperson told the Guardian: “The Trump EPA is following the law, ending the bogus overreach of previous administrations done by agenda-driven climate zealots.”

UK migration could be negative this year – how will that hit the economy?

When Greenwich and Kent universities said this month they would merge to save money, the heart of their financial difficulties could be found in the UK government’s crackdown on immigration.
Tough restrictions on foreign students have sent the number of university applications from abroad plummeting, cutting lucrative tuition fees and leaving all universities facing the same squeeze.
Companies are in a similar quandary: construction companies, health trusts and care homes are among those with recruitment worries, after new rules curtailed a longstanding reliance on foreign skilled workers.
The latest official figures, released this week, documenting the number of visa applications to live and work in the UK showed a further slump in people successfully navigating the new rules.
Only three years ago, annual net migration soared to almost 1 million. This year the number of people entering the UK could fall to such an extent that it drops below the number moving in the opposite direction, sending the figure for net migration below zero for the first time since 1993.
While the trend may ease pressure on Keir Starmer from Reform UK, for the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, the trend presents a significant headache, hurting both the businesses that rely on immigrants and a loss of expected tax receipts for the Treasury.
Last week, the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, a thinktank, likened the effect to Brexit, saying that if net migration fell to zero, it would knock 3.7% off the UK’s annual national income by 2040. According to the Treasury’s economic forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility, Brexit has set the economy back by 4%.
The political incentive
Rob Ford, the professor of political science at Manchester University, says zero net migration would provide Starmer with the opportunity to steer the domestic political agenda away from the core topic of interest for Reform UK supporters. Reform leader Nigel Farage backed billionaire industrialist Jim Ratcliffe, who said immigrants were “colonising” the UK. Ratcliffe later apologised, after public pressure from Starmer.
While most Britons’ attitudes to migration vary little over time, Ford believes it will tumble down the list of voters’ biggest concerns next year, as the downward trend feeds through into data and, eventually, public attitudes.
“It means that significant numbers of voters could peel away from the parties that make immigration a key element of their platform,” he says.
The data released this week showed that the fall in skilled worker applications which began last July continued in January. The figures will soon be followed by more detailed data giving a breakdown of visa applications, and how many were granted, from October to December 2025.
The expected downward trend will not reflect the government’s success or failure at stopping small boats crossing the Channel. Instead, the fall will largely follow a collapse in the number of immigrants entering the UK relative to the increasing number who are being denied a visa extension and must leave, many of them students.
The route to zero net migration
By the end of this year, the annual number of non-EU migrants entering the UK on visas could drop below 550,000 after reaching more than 1.1m in 2023, according to a report by a Warwick University data analyst, James Bowes. It argues this is the effect of a clampdown under the previous Conservative administration, and tighter rules brought in by Labour last year.
If the flow out of the country by non-EU nationals also accelerates, as expected, the emigration numbers could hit 430,000 by the end of the year, up from 88,000 in 2021.
With about 900,000 fewer immigrants this year than in 2023, it is possible that net migration of 860,000 in 2023 and 431,000 in 2024 could fall to 184,000 in 2025 and -60,000 this year.
The extent of the turnaround in migration since 2023 is a matter of contention, largely because poor government data allows analysts to fill the gaps in information with their own estimates, but the broader trend is not in dispute.
In March 2024, care workers were banned from bringing spouses and children with them to the UK, while in April of the same year the salary threshold increased for work visas and family visas from £20,480 to £33,400, with an opt-out for some categories of worker set at £25,000.
Most foreign postgraduate students were also told to leave their families behind. The minimum salary for a skilled worker visa increased from £26,200 to £38,700,
Madeleine Sumption, the head of the Migration Observatory at Oxford University, says: “It’s difficult to know exactly where we go next, mainly because we have a high number of people with temporary status and many of them might stay, or not.”
Before 2024, foreign students could finish their course and get a job with a salary that satisfied relatively low government thresholds to convert their student visa into a work visa.
Many would pay the price of a one-year master’s degree – which can be more than £30,000 – to get a student visa and within 18 months would be working in a care home.
A doubling of the salary thresholds makes it difficult to continue this route into work, says Bowes.
Last July, the qualification threshold for getting a skilled worker visa or health and care visa also increased. Starmer went further by stopping overseas recruitment of social care workers, shortening the list of jobs eligible for the visas and increasing application fees.
Sumption says the sponsors used by government to verify work visa applications have also faced a stricter regime.
“There is an ongoing crackdown on dodgy sponsors who declare they have firms on their books with jobs for people when they don’t exist. This is another measure restricting the number of successful visa applications,” she says.
The Observatory estimates that net migration will fall temporarily to a little over 250,000 this year before rising to 340,000 by the end of the decade.
“The thing that gets lost in the debate is that the current situation is temporary and the fall that is undoubtedly taking place at the moment will be reversed later in the decade,” says Sumption.
The economic impact
Jonathan Portes, an economics professor at King’s College London, says the impact could be limited by the weak state of the economy.
“We had large labour shortages during the pandemic but that is clearly not the case now,” he says.
Alan Manning, a professor at the London School of Economics, says the “fiscal impact” may be limited, especially in the longer term, if most of those leaving are in lower-paid jobs and their dependents.
Nevertheless, Portes says the draconian restrictions on migration are “an act of self-harm”.
Survey data and figures from HMRC documenting the pay that recent immigrants receive show they earn above average wages and generally have high skill levels in their field.
Manning says: “If we further restricted work visas – which would have to be done to get to net zero longer term – then that would be reducing the number of high earners and there would be a hit to the public finances from that.”
Jane Gratton, the deputy director of public policy at the British Chambers of Commerce, says recruiting from overseas was usually conducted as a last resort.
“The recent fall in net migration has had a particular impact on sectors such as hospitality and healthcare,” she adds.
She says BCC surveys show just 13% of member firms access the immigration system.
“However, it’s vital that the immigration system works for those employers who need it to fill urgent vacancies. Currently, firms tell us it is too expensive, restrictive and difficult.”
The OBR said last year it expected net migration of 262,000 in the year to mid-2026. That compares with the 47,000 Bowes believes is more realistic.
The 200,000 difference will translate into a shortfall of between £6bn and £8bn in the public finances, says Portes.
“The UK has benefited hugely from decades when it was an open economy that absorbed people arriving to do jobs and fill gaps in the labour market. What the Conservative and Labour party policies have done is reverse that, which is nothing short of self-harm,” Portes says.
Germany embraces migrants
Jean-Christophe Dumont, the head of the international migration division at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), says: “The UK Treasury has benefited from migrants, even when their use of all public goods and services are taken into account.”
OECD analysis shows immigrants working in the private sector have “proved positive for wages” though there are wide variations from one industry to another.
Dumont contrasts the UK with Germany.
The UK is moving towards what Portes describes as a “guest-worker approach” where immigrant workers have little chance of becoming permanent residents. Starmer has opened talks about increasing the number of EU citizens admitted to the UK under the youth mobility scheme, but this will only marginally affect the migration figures.
Dumont says Germany is moving firmly in the opposite direction, aware that it needs young people from outside the country to supplement its ageing population. AfD voters disagree, but the mainstream parties are fairly united in arguing that Germany’s survival depends on it, he says.
For instance Germany, like Spain, Austria and Switzerland, have opened apprenticeships to foreign-born labour in addition to the steady stream of German school leavers. The UK has an effective ban.
“People too often focus on the cost, but migrants contribute more on average than they cost,” he says.
If forecasts for zero net migration come to pass, it will prove to be a boon for Starmer and a problem for Reeves, who will count the cost in hard cash.

‘It’s been life-changing’: young Britons on why they left the UK to work abroad

As young people bear the brunt of a downturn in the jobs market, figures show a significant number are leaving the UK.
Although statisticians caution against comparing annual figures after a recent change in methodology and stress younger people are traditionally more drawn to emigration, a net 111,000 people aged 16 to 34 emigrated from the UK in the year to March 2025, according to the Office for National Statistics.
However, against the backdrop of a tough economy and high rents, young adults now living across the globe told the Guardian why they decided to leave Britain and how their new life compares.
The finance worker, Dubai
‘Working people are squeezed in the UK’
Ben*, 24, graduated in 2023, won a scholarship to a US university and had every intention of returning to the UK in 2025, but rapidly changed his mind.
“I am not keen on the UK at all right now. Push factors definitely outweigh the pull of the UK. London itself is a rip-off. Working people are squeezed, and the allure is waning. It’s a conversation I have pretty much every week with friends back there.” says Ben, an Oxbridge graduate, who now works in finance. Dubai has increasingly become home to individuals leaving the UK, US and Europe to work in the financial sector.
Ben adds: “Racial strife, toxic politics, a stagnant economy, regional inequality (which makes most other parts of the UK outside London non-starters for ambitious graduates) mean that there is very little the place has to offer.
“People around my age didn’t get to vote in 2016 and were first-time voters in 2019, by which point Brexit was a foregone conclusion, and they feel pretty screwed over.”
Ben, who says he “very much identifies as a British Nigerian”, took up his finance role in Dubai as a way to kickstart his career, he adds.
“The UAE wouldn’t be my ideal place to be, but it just happened to be that the job offer was there,” he says. “There are problems with the UAE, and I have some reservations. But if you are a young person and you’re looking to gain overseas experience, which allows for career progression, then the UAE is good for that.”
The sustainability worker, Berlin
‘I now never have to question if I can afford to do things’
Caitlin moved to London after university but couldn’t settle and, after a trip to Berlin, decided to move there three years ago.
“I really struggled to adapt to London, it was always so busy and expensive,” says Caitlin, 27, originally from Manchester. “I felt happier during those 10 days [in Germany] than I had in the entire last year, I decided to make the jump and move a few months later.
“I did my university year abroad in Berlin, so it was familiar to me, and I had already setup a community here to come back to.”
Her first job in Berlin was in customer service, and to start, she took work she was overqualified for to get a foot in the door and a working visa. Since then, she has transferred to a Blue Card visa – a residence permit for non-EU nationals – which she says has “given me much more flexibility”.
“It also makes it easier if I lose my job,” she adds. “There is a little more leniency as I get six months before I’d be told to leave the country if I hadn’t found work.”
When it comes to accommodation, there is a marked contrast with London.
“It is a renters’ economy here, so I have a rental contract for life with stabilised rent in a gorgeous, large apartment for quite a cheap price – it would be triple that in London,” says Caitlin.
However, Caitlin is one of the lucky ones. In the past few years, Berlin’s housing crisis has escalated to unprecedented proportions, with median asking rents across the city rising by 21.2% in 2023 alone.
One reason for this, among many, is a loophole in German federal law that means if flats are rented out as “temporary” and “furnished”, owners can evade tenancy regulations and charge considerably higher rents.
One aspect, however, that remains “a big barrier” for her is the language. “I am still learning German – it’s so hard,” she says. “It also counts me out of a lot of jobs”
“I do really miss my family and friends at home, and think that this, probably combined with career opportunities, will eventually draw me back.”
The digital nomad, Thailand
‘If I were in the UK, I wouldn’t be able to save’
After Maisie* graduated, she decided to go travelling and has been following the “sun and the digital nomad community” ever since, creating a regular pattern each year.
“That was about three years ago,” says Maisie, who is a freelance journalist and originally from North Yorkshire. “It has been life-changing.”
She moves away for four to six months of the year during the colder, winter periods, spending three to four months in south-east Asia, staying in Thailand, the Philippines and Laos. She then goes on to Europe in the spring before returning to the UK.
While she loves the north of England, she feels resentful at how her generation has been treated, citing Brexit and her “crippling” student loan. She says she is bitter about being unable to get on the property ladder.
“I don’t feel that the younger generations in the UK are being looked after,” she says. “I feel as though the odds have been stacked against me from the beginning.”
She says it is cheaper for her to live in south-east Asia over the winter than the UK.
Maisie calculates her outgoings, including shared accommodation, food, travel, and flights, at “about £1,000 a month”.
“The irony is I am saving more money travelling than I would if I lived in the UK, and I am still having a really nice quality of life.”
“I do get tired from travelling, but I think ‘slowmadding’ – living slower and longer term in places – helps.
“My ties to the UK are mostly because of my family,” she says. “What I am doing is not a permanent way of life, but for now it’s good.”
The web developer, Vancouver
‘I felt I had nothing to lose’
Nat Watson, 24, says he “just couldn’t take” living in the UK any more.
“I’ve lived all over: Brighton, Bristol, Bath, Cardiff, London, and visited many cities, and never enjoyed their vibe and never felt at home,” he says.
He moved to Vancouver, Canada last September, “settled and got a job really quickly”, and is being paid “more than I ever would be in the UK”.
Watson, a web developer, had been living in Wales and was feeling disillusioned with the job prospects as there is “little on offer in the tech sector” in Wales, he says. To make ends meet, he had to move back in with his parents.
“The last job I had there, I was making just over £1,000 a month,” he says. “I have been working in the industry for almost 10 years because I started very, very young. I know my stuff and I was almost insulted by the wages, but it was the only job available.
“I felt I had absolutely nothing to lose. I wanted somewhere with nature and things to do, and Vancouver just fits the bill.”
Watson also felt the “ever-rising cost of living and the ever-rising rightwing political extremism” made him want to leave.
“The quality of life is much better, people are friendlier, and I’ve been welcomed by everyone,” he says. “It’s cheaper for me to live in the middle of Vancouver than it is for me to live in Merthyr Tydfil.”

US man who fled jail and pleaded to Trump and Kim Kardashian gets 60-year term

A man who joined nine others in fleeing a New Orleans jail – then publicly pleaded for help from Donald Trump, a rapper whom the president pardoned and reality TV star Kim Kardashian while on the run – recently got a 60-year prison sentence for kidnapping and raping his ex-girlfriend.
Antoine Massey, 32, received his punishment on Thursday at a suburban New Orleans state courthouse, months after his jailbreak-related capture and subsequent conviction at trial of prior charges.
The 16 May 2025 breakout from a New Orleans jail that Massey had a hand in is one of the largest in recent US history. Authorities said the men yanked open a faulty cell door inside the lockup, squeezed through a hole behind a toilet, scaled a barbed-wire fence and fled into the dark – all while taunting officials with scrawled messages, including a misspelled one reading, “To Easy”.
Eight of the escaped men had been retaken into custody when Massey filmed videos that he released on social media in which he pleaded for Trump and Kardashian – among others – to come to his aid.
“Please, I’m asking for help,” Massey said in one of the videos, which achieved internet virality. “When I get back in custody, I’m asking y’all please to come and help.”
Others whom Massey named in his entreaty were rappers Lil Wayne and NBA YoungBoy, who are from New Orleans and nearby Baton Rouge, Louisiana, respectively.
NBA YoungBoy, whose legal name is Kentrell Gaulden and who had been sentenced to two years in prison on federal weapons-related charges, is among a number of celebrities whom Trump has pardoned during his second presidency. But Trump’s pardoning powers do not extend to the state charges with which Massey had been grappling then.
Police ultimately captured Massey in late June at a home in New Orleans about 2 miles (3km) from where the jailbreak occurred.
The last of the men who escaped was caught in Atlanta in October. In November, Massey went in front of a jury in Covington, Louisiana, north of New Orleans on preceding charges of second-degree rape, second-degree kidnapping, domestic abuse battery involving strangulation and violating a protective order.
The charges dated back to November 2024, when Massey was found to have beaten and sexually assaulted his girlfriend in Slidell, which is relatively near Covington. Prosecutors said his victim managed to escape and get a stranger in New Orleans to help her contact police, leading to his detention at in the facility where the breakout would later take place.
Jurors returned a guilty verdict against him. The sentence imposed on him Thursday does not afford him any possibility of parole.
“This … was brutal and extreme violence,” judge Alan Black said to Massey.
Massey has pleaded not guilty of any crime in connection with the New Orleans jailbreak. In his viral videos, he claimed to have been “let out” of the lockup.
He also faces several other charges in unrelated cases.

A missing woman, bloodstains and a masked intruder: tantalising clues but few leads in hunt for Nancy Guthrie
Unknown
Unknown Publisher

20:00:51 KST

Nancy Guthrie disappeared from her Tucson, Arizona, home two weeks ago, setting off a potent chain reaction of federal and local criminal investigation, amateur sleuthing and public obsession that – so far – has resulted in neither the 84-year-old grandmother being located or anyone named as a suspect or, indeed, arrested.
It is a case that is both enthralling and baffling the American public, casting doubts on the ability of investigators to get to the bottom of the mystery that each day generates a fresh 24-hour news cycle – but seemingly little in the way of solid fresh leads likely to solve the case.
On Thursday suspicions grew that the case may not be a kidnap-for-ransom scheme focused on the mother of the NBC Today show host Savannah Guthrie – or at least that her abduction did not start out as a kidnapping – but perhaps a burglary gone wrong.
Guthrie’s family have ceased issuing appeals to the would-be kidnapper or kidnappers. No communication is recorded. No ransom has been paid. But the FBI has doubled the reward for information leading to an arrest to $100,000, offered a description of a man 5ft 9in or 5ft 10in tall with an average build, and given a description of a black 25-liter Ozark Trail Hiker backpack he was wearing.
“We hope this updated description will help concentrate the public tips we are receiving,” the FBI stated in the X post. The agency said it had collected more than 13,000 tips since Guthrie was taken from her home on 1 February.
Donald Trump was asked Friday whether the drug cartels or potentially another “nation state” could be involved in Guthrie’s disappearance.
“You can’t say that yet”, he responded outside the White House. “It’s a little bit early. But it’s somebody [who] either knew what they were doing very well, or they were rank amateurs. Either way, it’s not a good situation”.
The Pima county sheriff’s department said it had fielded more than 18,000 calls and asked residents living near Guthrie’s home for video surveillance footage going back weeks. Then surveillance video circulated online of a man attempting to scale a wall five miles away, wearing similar clothes and backpack to a man seen in video recovered from the doorbell camera at Guthrie’s home on the night of the crime. Officials told NBC News that law enforcement officers had cleared the man.
That video, recovered from Google archives, showed the presumed abductor, or an accomplice, in a ski mask and neoprene gloves carrying what appeared to be a pistol in an oddly placed holster, attempting to block the lens with vegetation from Guthrie’s garden.
The black-and-white image of a masked man bearing flowers, described as a small “bouquet of weeds” by some observers, vividly gave form to the contours of deception and ill-intent playing out across the inhospitable terrain of the desert south-west.
Soon after, delivery driver Carlos Palazuelos was detained during a traffic stop south of Tucson near the US-Mexico border. His home in Rio Rico was searched on a judge’s approval. Palazuelos, who was later released, told Telemundo that he didn’t recall delivering anything to Guthrie’s house, didn’t know who she is and wasn’t involved.
Then there was a black glove found on a road, and one in Guthrie’s home. Rumors of a rift between local investigators and the FBI emerged after one was sent to a private crime lab in Florida and not to FBI headquarters in Virginia for analysis. The Pima county sheriff, Chris Nanos, denied he was withholding evidence from the FBI and that an agent had told him, “We do not want the media to divide us.”
Investigators have also made repeated trips to the home of Annie Guthrie, sister of Savannah and a poet, and her husband Tommaso Cioni, a science and biology teacher, and the last to see Nancy when he dropped her at home hours before her abduction.
The sheriff’s department hasn’t provided an official news briefing in over a week, allowing the citizen sleuths to fill the vacuum with a range of theories Almost any man who fits the rough description of a 5ft 10in man connected to the family has been brought under online suspicion.
The case, likened variously to the Lindbergh baby case in the 1930s, to an episode of Columbo and to the Keystone Cops, has at root a missing elderly woman whose fate is unknown. A series of purported ransom emails containing a demand for $6m in bitcoin and two deadlines sent to celebrity news outlet TMZ and two local TV stations are now rarely mentioned.
Guthrie’s family have said they believe she is still alive but have no way to directly contact the ransom seekers and have not received the so-called “proof of life” they asked for.
Joe Petito, father of Gabby Petito who went missing on a 2021 cross-country road trip and was later found to have been murdered by her fiance, Brian Laundrie, told Fox & Friends that false leads and misinformation made the search more difficult.
“A lot of outside influence will try to give an opinion,” Petito said. Investigators, he added, “have all of the information or as much as possible. So I just hope they’re listening to what they feel is best.” The statement, and its implicit appeal to intuition, brought to mind Columbo.
But armchair detectives are not out in the field, as FBI agents are, knocking on doors and picking through inhospitable desert terrain of cactuses, bushes and boulders, in 80F heat in search of clues to crack a case of a missing woman authorities believe was taken against her will and whose blood was found on her front porch.
“In hindsight we can say that ransom note was a fake and sent after the case went national,” says Bryanna Fox, a former FBI profiler at the University of South Florida.
“That said, imagine being in the Guthries’ shoes and thinking ‘what if it is real and we don’t treat it as real?’ But who conducts a kidnapping-for-ransom and goes to the crime scene without a ransom note prepared? It’s so contrary to kidnapping.”
Fox says the recent harvest of clues, despite lacking any definite resolution in the case, are substantial. “We’re waiting for the dividends,” she says. “One of those 4,000 tips sent to the FBI has to play out.”
The task now will be to winnow them out and to get a potential suspect or suspects “committed to a story and track down the details of their story. If there are a lot of holes in it, you’ve got something more.” Fox says it’s possible Palazuelos knows more. “I’m not saying this man is involved, but is that a possibility? Yes.”
Key to cracking the case may be the black-and-white images. Fox points to the resolution of recent cases – the murder of the United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson, to name one – in which a suspect was arrested with help from surveillance films. “Maybe we just have to let a little more time go by for those leads to turn into an identification,” Fox says. “I’m optimistic.”

Peter Attia appears to be staying at CBS News despite Epstein communications
Unknown

Two weeks after a trove of files revealed extensive – and inappropriate – communications between Jeffrey Epstein and a recently named CBS News contributor, the longevity expert Peter Attia, the network appears to have settled on keeping him.
“Everyone internally unofficially concluded he was staying as of about a week ago,” one CBS News staffer told the Guardian.
Officially, CBS News has been silent about Attia, and declined to comment when asked on Friday. Attia is one of the 19 on-air contributors that editor-in-chief Bari Weiss said she was “so excited” to announce during an all-staff meeting on 27 January.
“We’re pissed off about it,” a second CBS News staffer, who was also not authorized to comment, said.
Announcing his appointment, CBS News said the contributors, “all experts in their field”, would allow the network to “significantly [expand] its knowledge base”. Attia, who hosts a popular podcast, is known as an expert in the fields of longevity and preventative medicine, though he has faced skepticism from some in the medical world.
But on 30 January, the justice department’s release of millions of documents showed that Attia had expressed a fondness for Epstein and used extremely graphic language in at least one email to him. That Attia had met with Epstein was previously known before CBS News hired him.
A search of Attia’s name in the justice department’s database returns 1,838 results.
“I go into JE withdrawal when I don’t see him,” Attia wrote in one January 2016 email to Epstein’s assistant.
A year earlier, in an exchange with Epstein, Attia seemed to hint at his knowledge of Epstein’s misdeeds – though he has denied that he was referring to criminal sexual activity.
“You [know] the biggest problem with becoming friends with you?” he wrote in the email. “The life you lead is so outrageous, and yet I can’t tell a soul … ”
And in one particularly lewd 2016 email, Attia wrote to Epstein: “Pussy is, indeed, low carb. Still awaiting results on gluten content, though.”
Attia also stayed at one of Epstein’s apartments, according to the correspondence made public. “I’m spoiled after staying in your great place. Mine is kind of a dump,” Attia wrote Epstein in February 2016.
On 2 February, Attia published a long message he had sent to his employees explaining his connections to Epstein.
“I was not involved in any criminal activity,” he wrote. “My interactions with Epstein had nothing to do with his sexual abuse or exploitation of anyone. I was never on his plane, never on his island, and never present at any sex parties. That said, I apologize and regret putting myself in a position where emails, some of them embarrassing, tasteless, and indefensible, are now public, and that is on me.”
Attia said he met with Epstein approximately seven or eight times between 2014 and 2019 “regarding research studies and to meet others he introduced me to”. He also admitted to answering Epstein’s medical questions and recommending doctors to him on occasion.
“The man I am today, roughly 10 years later, would not write them and would not associate with Epstein at all,” he wrote.
Attia appeared in an October episode of 60 Minutes and was interviewed by correspondent Norah O’Donnell, who said he “has become both a pioneer and a star in the growing field of longevity medicine”.
CBS had been scheduled to re-air O’Donnell’s interview of Attia on 8 February, Super Bowl Sunday, but decided against it amid the backlash.
Although Attia is still on the payroll as a CBS News contributor, it’s not clear when – or if – he will actually appear on air.
When addressing her staff, Weiss had encouraged shows to book the network’s new contributors – but programs are not obligated to book specific individuals.
Attia has been keeping a low profile. He has not posted on X since his apology. He also has not posted any episodes of his popular podcast, The Peter Attia Drive, this month.
Jennifer Ashton, a one-time CBS News medical correspondent who then spent more than a decade as ABC News’s chief health and medical correspondent, recently criticized her former network and said she would not appear while Attia remains a contributor.
“The fact that CBS News hasn’t taken action is deeply troubling,” she wrote on Instagram. “People have been fired from network television for far less. Morality clauses exist for a reason. If documented language like this doesn’t cross that line, then the bar has fallen dangerously low.”
Mary Claire Haver, a menopause specialist, said her publisher had arranged an exclusive interview on CBS Mornings to promote her forthcoming book, The New Perimenopause. “But given their decision to retain Peter Attia, I’m making the decision not to go on CBS,” she said in her own Instagram post. “This is my way of saying no, I’m not going to stand for this.”

EU official warns Russian shadow fleet threatens Europe

20:00:14 KST

A senior European Union official has warned that Russia’s “shadow fleet” poses a growing threat to maritime security and undersea infrastructure, as concerns mount over the vulnerability of key shipping routes and subsea cables.
Speaking during a maritime security panel at the Munich Security Conference on Friday, Belén Martinez Carbonell, Secretary-General of the European External Action Service, said the shadow fleet represents a direct threat to Europe, both through its role in sustaining Russia’s war economy and through the risks it creates at sea.
“For us, there’s a very direct threat very close to home,” she said. “I call it as the result of a huge violation of the UN Charter, and that’s the amplification of the Russian aggression through the shadow fleet.”
She added: “For us, the Russian shadow fleet is the most direct threat to European security.”
Carbonell argued that the issue extended beyond sanctions evasion, warning that poorly regulated vessels posed environmental dangers and could present threats to critical maritime infrastructure. “We know that those shadow fleets pose risks besides feeding the coffers of war,” she said. “They also are at risk environmental risk… They also pose a risk, because of the risks to cables, maritime cables.”
The panel, moderated by Mina Al-Oraibi, Editor-in-Chief of The National, focused on the growing global importance of maritime security amid geopolitical tension and attacks on shipping lanes. Al-Oraibi told the audience that maritime security now affects everyday life worldwide. “More than 80% of world trade relies on the waterways of the world,” she said, adding that “95 to 99% of our connectivity relies on underwater cables that have become the lifeline for international trade.”
Carbonell said the EU was pursuing a range of non-military and regulatory measures to counter threats posed by the shadow fleet, including sanctions, outreach to flag states, and legal tools under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea. “We have sanctions already, like 600 shadow fleet vessels and 40 enablers,” she said.
She added that the EU was also engaging directly with countries whose flags were being used by vessels linked to sanctions evasion. “We’re doing outreach to flag states that might not know what’s behind their flags,” Carbonell said. The official also pointed to legal provisions within UNCLOS, arguing they could be used to address unflagged vessels. “We’re also trying to use all possibilities offered precisely by UNCLOS,” she said, citing “article 110… [which] allows, under certain conditions, the boarding of flagless vessels.”
Carbonell also said work was ongoing through the International Maritime Organization, particularly on environmental and safety standards.
Alongside regulatory efforts, she highlighted the EU’s naval operations as part of a broader approach to protecting freedom of navigation. “We have a number of maritime missions and naval operations,” she said, naming Irini, Atalanta and Aspides as key examples. Referring to the Red Sea mission Aspides, she said it had already supported a large number of commercial transits. “It’s there to ensure the safe transit, and has already done it for more than 600 merchant vessels in the Red Sea,” Carbonell said.
She added: “We have saved to this mission, more than 100 sailors and seafarers.”
The panel also included Rashad Mohamed Ali Al-Alimi, Chairman of Yemen’s Presidential Leadership Council, who warned that regional instability in the Red Sea was being driven by Iranian-backed militant groups. “The most urgent threat derives from that corner,” he said, accusing Iran of investing heavily in militias in order to gain leverage over maritime security.
Singapore’s Defence Minister Chan Chun Sing also warned that rising strategic mistrust between major powers was increasingly shaping maritime risk globally. “The main threat… would be the increasing strategic mistrust between and among the major powers,” he said.

The Story Behind the Viral Photograph of 5-Year-Old Liam Conejo Ramos
Unknown
Unknown Publisher
2026-02-14
11:00:00 UTC
20:00:00 KST

On Jan. 20, one of the coldest days of the year in Minneapolis, Ali Daniels received a text message warning that ICE agents were targeting school bus stops in Columbia Heights. Daniels, an office administrator working in the metro area, had recently completed legal observer training and was participating in rapid response work for the second time.
Grabbing a friend as her passenger seat sidekick, the two patrolled the neighborhood for signs of ICE activity. After about 10 minutes of turning down residential streets, they spotted a large SUV stopped in the middle of the road. She recalls seeing ICE agents in masks and tactical vests standing outside the vehicle.
That’s when Daniels saw Liam Conejo Ramos—a small, wide-eyed child in a Spider Man backpack and blue bunny hat—being escorted to a slush-streaked car. Daniels recalls agents shouting “get it in the car,” referring to Liam.
People at the scene pleaded with the agents to allow the five-year-old to go with authorized staff from Columbia Heights schools, where Liam attended pre-kindergarten classes. Daniels says the agents refused.
“I decided to start taking pictures,” she said. “This wasn’t part of the training; it was something I did out of impulse.”
Daniels took out her Samsung to snap photos of the agents, the vehicle, and then bent down to Liam’s eye-level. “He was silent, staring ahead, undoubtedly scared and in shock,” she said. “That’s when I got the photo of him.”
Daniels posted the image to her private Facebook page, unaware of the journey this one photograph would take.
We all know this photo and the surrounding details intimately now. Liam was returning from school with his father when immigration agents pulled them from their car near their home, according to the school district. The boy’s father, Adrián Alexander Conejo Arias, was also detained, and the pair were transferred to an immigration detention center outside San Antonio.
A lawyer for the family said that Mr. Conejo Arias, who is from Ecuador, had entered the United States under existing asylum guidelines. The Department of Homeland Security, however, charged that he entered the country unlawfully in Dec. 2024. DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement that “ICE did NOT target a child,” and that the operation was instead to arrest the child’s father.
Against this backdrop, Daniels’ image of Liam’s seizure went mega-viral at a moment when public anger over immigration enforcement was already acute in Minnesota and elsewhere across the country—the incalculable, inescapable kind of viral in which images move faster than explanation.
X, Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, and BlueSky were flooded with versions of the photo: cropped, captioned, subtitled, paired with legal explainers, donation links, and calls to action demanding Liam’s release. The power of these posts came from their terrifying precision: that this child could be anyone’s, that Minneapolis could be home.
By Jan. 31, Judge Fred Biery, a U.S. District Judge for the Western District of Texas, ordered the release of both Liam and his father from immigration custody, condemning their removal from their suburban Minneapolis neighborhood as unconstitutional. At the bottom of his three-page ruling, Judge Biery included the viral photograph of Liam with the caption: “Matthew 19:14” and “John 11:35.”
Those New Testament verses quote Jesus saying “Let the little children come to me” and “Jesus wept.” The image that had proliferated on social media was now part of the legal record.
After more than a week in detention, Liam and his father were released from the Texas immigration facility and returned to Minneapolis, according to U.S. Representative Joaquin Castro. Castro documented the trip on social media, where he shared a photo of a handwritten note he gave Liam, in which he wrote that the boy had “moved the world.”
“Liam is now home. With his hat and his backpack. Thank you to everyone who demanded freedom for Liam,” Castro, a San Antonio Democrat, wrote on X.
To be sure, this is not the first social movement in which social media has played a central role in global political resistance. During the Arab Spring, platforms like Facebook and Twitter functioned as organizing tools and distribution channels for footage that state-controlled media suppressed—most notably in Egypt in 2011, when live updates and images from Tahrir Square transformed local protests into an international crisis within days.
A decade later, mass mobilization around Black Lives Matter was catalyzed by cellphone video made by then 17-year-old Darnella Frazier documenting the murder of George Floyd, turning a single Minneapolis street into the epicenter of a worldwide uprising.
Since the racial justice protests of 2020, however, political posting has existed under sustained suspicion as performative. During the summer of 2020, critics of all ideologies mocked symbolic gestures untethered from action: black squares on Instagram, TikTok videos of white influencers (hair done, makeup snatched) raising fists to trending audio, memes lampooning allyship that required no material risk.
That skepticism has lingered over the past several years, particularly when crises feel distant or abstract, where posting about Sudan or Gaza, for example, can resemble a stand-in for action. “Spreading awareness” remains notoriously difficult to measure.
What makes this moment distinct is that the debate no longer feels theoretical. As recently as last week, reposting Liam’s photo was criticized as performative on platforms such as TikTok. But the outcome complicates that charge. The circulation, and the demands it elicited, forced visibility, legal scrutiny, and response.
The spread of Daniels’ photo of Liam shows how public pressure on social media can still bend the machinery of the state.
This is not to say that posting is enough. It is easy to criticize a celebrity wearing a political pin on the red carpet (or a Facebook infographic, or a hashtag in an Instagram bio) as virtue signaling. Talk can only take you so far.
Social media can also flatten nuance. As the photo was reshared and reposted on Facebook, Daniels began seeing comments questioning its authenticity, suggesting it was fake or AI-generated. She decided to identify herself as the photographer to establish the image’s provenance.
“It’s hard to be told you’re changing hearts and minds with one photo, yet knowing that no amount of saying ‘I saw this firsthand’ will make people see how cruel and unjust the whole institution is,” Daniels told me. “Nothing is that easy.”
Liam is far from the only child impacted by the Trump administration’s policies. According to a Guardian analysis of records obtained by the Deportation Data Project, ICE booked about 3,800 minors into immigrant family detention from Jan. to Oct. 2025. The number of children currently in migrant detention centers remains unclear. Posting on social media will not free the thousands of children currently detained.
Minnesotans like Daniels with a cell phone camera are demonstrating in real time how social media can push beyond symbolism into tangible change. The photograph of Liam, videos of the killings of Renee Good and Alex Pretti, and other images have contributed to stepping up the pressure on the federal government, ultimately forcing a reversal of its tactics in Minnesota.
And social media is proving to be an indispensable tool for coordination. Instagram, X, Facebook, Threads, WhatsApp, and Signal are being used to track ICE activity, mobilize protests, circulate witness requests, and distribute precise call and email templates for elected officials. On streets across the country, Americans are putting their own bodies on the line to impede the operations of a federal police force in their city.
“Like so many people in the Twin Cities, I got trained [as a legal observer and rapid responder] because I felt like I had to,” Daniels said. “I couldn’t just do nothing while our neighbors are being snatched up from their homes.”
Instead, she turned to her phone’s camera. Her image not only helped change the life of one child, it helped change policy.

Kaillie Humphries Underwent 4 Embryo Transfers to Have a Baby. Now She’s Back in the Olympics at 40

American bobsledder Kaillie Humphries has already won three Olympics gold medals in her standout career. Back-to-back wins for her birth country of Canada in the two-woman event in 2010 and 2014, plus another gold, after a contentious, stressful battle to switch national allegiances, for the United States, in the inaugural driver-only monobob event in Beijing. So as well as anyone, Humphries can paint a picture of an ideal Olympic run down the refrigerated track in Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy, in February.
“The sled should look smooth,” says Humphries, 40, during an interview from San Diego, where she lives with her husband, former USA bobsledder Travis Armbruster, and their son, Aulden, who will turn 20 months old in mid-February. “It should look effortless. You shouldn’t see a lot of sideways movement. That’s usually a Kaillie Humphries special. Especially when the pressure gets big. I can drive the heck out of a sled better than anybody else in the entire world. So my goal is to be good enough at the start, then crush them in the driving on the way down.”
Humphries thought she might miss her chance to add to her Olympic legacy, as she moved forward with plans to start a family with Armbruster after Beijing. She had tried to get pregnant naturally prior to those Games, but in 2021 Humphries was diagnosed with stage IV endometriosis, an often painful condition in which tissue that is similar to the inner lining of the uterus grows outside the uterus.

Endometriosis can cause fertility struggles, so in the summer of 2022, Humphries began IVF treatments. Three transfers did not result in a baby, but in August 2023, with the qualification period for Milano Cortina fast approaching, she decided to keep trying. “It got to the point of, I’m going to continue down this path, and it may cost me a future Olympics,” she says.
A month later, she got pregnant. Humphries gave birth to Aulden in June 2024. While she missed the 2023-2024 World Cup bobsled season due to her pregnancy, Humphries had to return to the track just five months postpartum in order to protect her rankings and put herself in the strongest possible position to qualify for the 2026 Olympics. “I would have liked a little more time to bond with my son, to physically recover from giving birth,” she says. “On the recovery piece, we are devaluing what it takes to go through pregnancy, to go through the birth process. You're pregnant for nine months, you give birth, it's going to take at least a year to get back in shape. So I would like to see where women have a year to return after giving birth.”
She felt like a shell of her former self. “From a physical standpoint, was my body ready to compete at five months postpartum?” says Humphries. “No, not even close. You're missing that whole core midsection, which in a power- and speed-based sport with g-forces, there is a big component there that I was lacking. Running, sprinting was extremely challenging for me. I was able to do it. But you're not doing it well. You're not performing. You're surviving.”
Armbruster gave up his job as a personal trainer to hit the road with Humphries and their son during the 2024-2025 bobsled World Cup season, which had stops in Germany, Latvia, Austria, Switzerland, Norway, and Lake Placid, N.Y. Humphries was advised—mostly by men, she notes—against breastfeeding during her comeback. “Do I do what's best for my son, because I believe that's giving him breast milk, or do I do what's best for my performance in my career?” she says. “And you don't want to have to give up either.

Humphries put Aulden first. “He just keeps crying,” she says. “It didn't matter how much I pumped, the boob was the only thing that was going to fix it.” Breastfeeding took its toll on her. “You're exhausted,” she says. “Just the drain on your system. You only have so much battery life in your body every day.” Aulden’s periods of sleep regression also put Humphries in a difficult position. “I have to perform in two or three days, and I'm up every two or three hours, and I'm getting maybe four hours of sleep,” she says. “My competitors are 25, 28 years old, they're having 8, 9, 10 hours of sleep uninterrupted. You feel guilty. And then there's times when I'm at the bobsled track for six or seven hours and I haven't seen my son, and I feel guilty as a mom that I don't get to be with him every second of every day.”
All this strain, on both body and mind, made her finishes—fourth in the two-woman event and eighth in monobob at worlds in March 2025—quite impressive, even if, as a five-time world champion, she didn’t view them that way. “Being nine months postpartum, most people would be ecstatic with that,” says Humphries. “For me, it's hard, because I expected to go out and win. Realistically, I knew I wasn't in the shape to be able to do it.”
But she came into this World Cup season thinking she was on track to peak at the Olympics. Her results show she might be right. Humphries won a pair of two-woman events in December and January, and she won her first monobob as a mom on Jan. 17, in Altenberg, Germany. The next day, she finished second in the two-woman race, with Jasmine Jones, who will be Humphries’ brakewoman in Cortina.
She’s already the only woman with Olympic golds in both the two-woman and the monobob. Becoming the first to win both at the same Games now seems well within reach. “That'll be a perfect mic-drop moment,” says Humphries.
Humphries has already earned a victory: entering these Games with no regrets. She is promising to take plenty of pictures of Aulden in Italy, so they can one day look back on these Games that they shared together. “There's no way I would have ever been able to live with myself if I would have chosen sport over family,” she says. “There's nothing that I would change, regardless of what the result is. I'm going out to try and win double gold. But it is really about the journey this Olympics, more than any other Olympics. It really is about the process and the planning of what it took us over these four years to get to this Games with Aulden. With IVF, with the hormones, with the injections. It's the journey of us becoming a family and less about the results. And I've never had that before.”

Two hurt after high-speed New Zealand-France crash at Auckland SailGP race
Two sailors treated for serious injuries after Black Foils and DS Team France involved in major collision.
One sailor is in hospital with two broken legs and another was also injured in a high-speed crash between yachts representing New Zealand and France on the first day of the SailGP race in Auckland, New Zealand on Saturday.
The New Zealand team said Louis Sinclair was receiving treatment for compound fractures to both legs. Sinclair, a grinder on board the New Zealand yacht, turns winches to adjust the sails.

“Black Foils grinder Louis Sinclair is in a stable condition in Auckland Hospital after suffering injuries to both legs during the collision with the French during racing today,” the New Zealand team said in a statement. “Sinclair is receiving treatment for compound fractures to both legs but is in a stable condition.”
A sailor from the French team was also injured.
The crash occurred in the third of four SailGP races scheduled on Saturday. As the fleet of 13 boats approached the first gate at speeds of almost 90km/h (56mph), the New Zealand yacht lost control and spun into the path of France.
The French boat rode over the top of the New Zealand boat, causing severe damage to both boats, which were locked together. Racing was abandoned for the day while the injured sailors were ferried to shore and to hospital, and while the damaged boats were recovered.
“I think everyone, both team New Zealand and us, are pretty shocked,” France driver Quentin Delapierre said. “Full support to team New Zealand and my teammates, also. Hopefully, we’ll recover from this.
“Everything happened so quickly, it’s pretty cloudy in my mind. I just tried to do my best to avoid the collision but obviously it happened too quickly. I didn’t have the time to respond and steer the boat. It was a super scary situation.”
Television footage suggested the New Zealand boat lost the use of its rudder, causing it to turn in front of the France boat, which could not avoid the collision.
New Zealand had just returned after a crash with Switzerland in the first event of the season in Perth, Australia, which was won by Britain. The New Zealand driver Peter Burling received demerit points on his super sailing licence for his role in that collision.
In SailGP, teams from 13 nations race identical 50-foot catamarans which rise out of the water on foils and are capable of reaching speeds of 100km/h (60mph).
Two races were completed on Saturday before the crash. Australia won the first and New Zealand won the second. Racing on the second day, Sunday, will start early because of a threat of thunderstorms.

Israel ex-PM says he regrets knowing Epstein after released files detail their long friendship

Barak said he never observed or took part in any inappropriate behaviour, and even though he was aware of the earlier Epstein case, he assumed Epstein had paid his debt to society.
Former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak has apologised for his yearslong friendship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein that included regular correspondence, multiple visits to the disgraced financier’s Manhattan apartment, and one to his private island.
“I am responsible for all my actions and decisions, and there is definitely room to ask if there wasn’t room for more in-depth judgment on my part and a more thorough examination of what the details really what exactly happened there,” Barak said in an interview.
The former Israeli leader has not been implicated in Epstein’s sexual abuse of underage girls and faces no accusations of wrongdoing.
Speaking in an interview with Israel’s Channel 12 on Thursday, Barak said he regretted having ever known Epstein and apologised to all those “who feel deeply uncomfortable.”
According to the ex-Israeli prime minister, he and his wife and some security guards paid a three-hour visit to Epstein’s home in the US Virgin Islands but saw only Epstein and some maintenance workers there.
Barak said he never observed or took part in any inappropriate behavior. He said he was aware of the earlier Epstein case but assumed he had paid his debt to society.
“Only in 2019, when a reinvestigation of the whole story begins, does the breadth and depth of the man’s heinous crimes become apparent and I cut off relations with him, and everyone cuts off relations with him,” Barak said.
He added it’s likely more information will emerge from the documents in the weeks ahead, but he maintained that he had done nothing illegal or improper.
“I promise you that nothing will be discovered, because there is nothing,” he said.
Barak appears in several documents
Barak is among several political, business and cultural elites found to have maintained long relationships with Epstein, even after his 2008 guilty plea for soliciting prostitution from an underage girl in Florida.
The former Israeli PM, who has previously distanced himself from Epstein, gave the latest interview after millions of pages of documents were released by the US Justice Department in connection with its investigations of Epstein.
Barak and his wife, Nili, have turned up frequently in the documents, showing they stayed in regular contact with Epstein for years, including after he cut a deal with prosecutors in 2008 that resulted in an 18-month prison sentence.
Barak served as prime minister from 1999 to 2001, when Israel and the Palestinians held high-level peace talks before the process collapsed and a Palestinian uprising broke out. He later served as defense minister.
His ties to Epstein came to light seven years ago after Barak announced a political comeback in an unsuccessful bid to topple Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
At the time, US tax records showed Barak received some $2 million in grants for unspecified “research” the previous decade from the Wexner Foundation, a philanthropic organisation that supports Jewish causes. At the time, Epstein was a trustee of the foundation.
Barak downplayed those ties when they surfaced, saying Epstein “didn’t support me or pay me.” However, some documents detail plans for a 2017 stay at Epstein’s New York residence, while others discuss mundane logistics for other visits, meetings and phone calls.
In June 2019, Barak’s wife, Nili, emailed Epstein, saying they delayed their flight to New York by roughly a week. In 2013, Epstein’s assistant, Lesley Groff, emailed Epstein about dinner with Barak, his wife and several business people and celebrities, including Woody Allen.
In 2019 — about a week before Epstein was arrested — an exchange about Barak between Epstein and an unknown person shows Epstein saying he was “dealing with Ehud in Israel.” Making me crazy.”
The documents show that Epstein connected Barak with US President Donald Trump’s former adviser, Steve Bannon, who was seeking to become more involved in Israeli politics. Emails from Epstein to his staff and others in 2018 discussed setting up dinners or meetings between Barak and Bannon.
Bannon has not been implicated in any wrongdoing related to Epstein.
Epstein died by suicide in detention in 2019 while awaiting trial on federal allegations of sexually abusing and trafficking dozens of girls.

Türkiye's Communications Director Burhanettin Duran met with international media representatives in Istanbul at an event held at a hotel in Beyoğlu on Feb. 14.
Türkiye’s Communications Director Burhanettin Duran said Türkiye’s growing profile as a go-to mediator in conflict zones is the result of a “solution-oriented and consistent” foreign policy, not chance.
Duran made the remarks during a meeting with international media representatives in Istanbul, where he also warned that global institutions are weakening at a time of rising uncertainty and overlapping crises.
He said countries are increasingly left to deal with crises on their own, while challenges such as climate change, food security, and the risks of technological transformation add to existing global fault lines.
He urged stronger multilateral solidarity to address what he described as a widening gap between global problems and the system’s capacity to solve them.
Pointing to President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s long-running call for “a fairer world,” Duran said journalists play a critical role in documenting events and helping the public see the “global picture.”
On Gaza, Duran said Türkiye considers a solution to the Palestinian issue “vital,” calling for humanitarian access, and a lasting peace.
Referring to the Gaza "genocide," he said Türkiye would continue “results-oriented initiatives” through the “Peace Council” established after a ceasefire.
Duran also said Türkiye supports efforts by Syria’s government to fight terrorism, rebuild, and restore stability across the country, stressing the importance of the “one state, one army” principle for lasting stability.
He cited Türkiye’s ability to keep channels open with both sides in the Russia-Ukraine war and its role in supporting the Black Sea Grain Initiative as examples of Ankara’s crisis diplomacy and also pointed to its involvement in efforts related to Ethiopia-Somalia tensions and the Azerbaijan-Armenia tensions.
Turning to media relations, Duran said his office aims to maintain “symmetrical, transparent, and open” communication with journalists and to counter disinformation with a proactive approach, including regular briefings and media programs.

Are lasers the future of anti-drone warfare?
Repelling mass drone strikes is a hard and expensive task, but lasers might help. Defence companies are in a gold rush to make that happen.
A drone appears on the grainy, gray-scaled image of the thermal camera. This is the type of drone used by groups such as Hezbollah, Hamas and the Yemeni Houthis. Suddenly, a blinding whiteness overtakes the image. Seconds later, the wing of the drone snaps off, sending it tumbling down, exploding when it hits the ground.
This is a video shared by the Israeli Ministry of Defence and arms producer Rafael, a hint towards the future of anti-drone warfare. In it, they are demonstrating one of their new weapons: a high-energy laser designed to take down aerial threats such as drones, but also rockets and even artillery shells. It’s called Iron Beam. Israel claims they have shot down several enemy drones with it already.

Laser weapons have been a dream for arms manufacturers and militaries since the invention of the laser in 1960. So far, they have remained a dream. But now they seem to be on the brink of a breakthrough. Technological advances have made lasers more robust. At the same time, the rise of drones increases the need for weapons that can shoot them down cheaply and efficiently.
“Lasers are the next step in air defence systems,” says Iain Boyd, director of the Center for National Security Initiatives at the University of Colorado Boulder, where he works on high-energy lasers in defence projects.
“When you are attacked by thousands of inexpensive drones, you cannot afford to defend yourself with expensive anti-air weapons, such as missiles. Lasers might be a solution.”
This promise is causing a gold rush among defence companies. Independent analyses on the market’s size are lacking, but a flurry of contracts and announcements have recently been made.
The Israeli Iron Beam contract is worth $500m for Rafael and Elbit Systems, another Israeli defence company. The US Navy has contracted Lockheed Martin to supply its ships with defensive high-energy lasers. UK defence firm MBDA was awarded a 316-million-pound ($430m) defence contract at the end of 2025 to deliver their DragonFire laser weapon system by 2027. MBDA is also cooperating with German defence giant Rheinmetall to develop a German system by 2029. France, in turn, took a similar approach, teaming up again with MBDA and a flurry of its own defence players to develop a laser system.
Star Wars
One of the companies benefitting from this gold rush is the Australian Electro-Optical Systems (EOS), led by the German CEO Andreas Schwer. In 2025, they secured a 71-million-euro ($84m) contract with the Netherlands for the development of a laser weapon. In December, another contract, worth $80m, was announced with South Korea.
Their laser technology is a descendant of the United States’s Strategic Defense Initiative programme, colloquially known as Star Wars. In the 1980s, US President Ronald Reagan created the programme to use lasers, fired from space, to shoot down Soviet ballistic missiles.
That grand vision failed. Billions were invested, but in the 1990s, most of the programmes ended. EOS was one of the participants. They used Star Wars’ insights to build lasers that track satellites. But now they are using them for a different goal: shooting down drones.
“Our high-energy laser is a derivative of our Star Wars technology,” says Schwer. “Initially, we developed lasers to track satellites. But when the Houthi rebels used drones to attack Saudi Arabia in 2018, we realised this technology was needed elsewhere.”
Today, they employ 500 people; by the end of next year, that should be 700. If EOS does any large acquisitions, that number might even be even higher, claims Schwer.
For their laser weapons, EOS is aiming to cooperate with local defence companies as a growth strategy. In Europe, for example, they are working together with players such as Helsing, OHB, MSI and KNDS. That way, they can grow without having to invest large amounts of capital. “We team up with local champions,” says Schwer.
Dependency and sovereignty
Particularly in Europe, the market for high-energy lasers is growing. The importance of drone warfare in Ukraine, but also recent cases of drone flights over critical infrastructure in Europe, and Russian drone incursions on the Eastern border of the EU, have caused a surge in demand for anything that can repel mass drone attacks.
“High-energy laser weapons have, supposedly, been just around the corner for a long time now. However, in the last few years we have seen the technology mature and systems actually being deployed,” says James Black, deputy director of the defence and security research group at RAND Europe.
The market is still fragmented, however, with many countries launching their own research projects. “You have different countries investing in sovereign R&D projects, testing and low-scale field tests,” says Black. “We don’t yet have a mass market rollout. We haven’t seen industrial consolidation yet.”
One of the reasons why lasers are so attractive is that they are not dependent on existing supply chains for air-defence weapons. “Countries want sovereign air defence solutions,” says Black. “They want to reduce their dependency on foreign suppliers. For different weapons, such as Patriot missiles, you’re, for example, dependent on the US.”
For many advanced anti-air weapons, the US is currently the dominant player. The companies that will dominate the market for laser weapons might come from a different part of the world, though. “For the US military, the main priority is deterring and defeating China,” says Black. “That affects which weapons US companies develop. China is more advanced than Russia or Iran. Also, the Indo-Pacific is a very large area, with mostly sea. Massed attacks by small drones are much less of a threat there than in Europe.”
Drone swarms
Lasers are becoming viable now, on the one hand, because the technology has simply matured. “Twenty years ago, we were using chemical lasers for these projects,” says Boyd. “They were the only ones that had enough power.”
A laser always has a medium through which the light passes and which amplifies it. Up until recently, for military lasers, the medium of choice was a cocktail of chemicals. These lasers generate a very powerful beam, but they also have downsides, including the volatile chemicals themselves.
In the past few years, however, solid-state lasers have become more powerful. In such lasers, the medium is a solid material, such as optical fibre. These lasers are more robust and easier to handle. “Solid-state lasers are used for all kinds of industrial processes,” says Boyd. “Civilian industries advanced them significantly. That accelerated their use in military applications.”
Technical issues still need to be resolved, however. One of those is collateral damage. A laser beam that misses its target just keeps going straight and could, for example, miss a drone and hit an airliner or satellite.
“Laser beams can also scatter off surfaces and blind people,” says Boyd. “That’s why good targeting systems are so important.”
This became clear this week when the airspace around El Paso, in the US, was closed down unexpectedly by the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), leading to chaos at the local airport. The shutdown seems to have been related to a non-scheduled test of an anti-drone laser weapon by the US Customs and Border Protection.
“The El Paso incident strongly illustrates the need for careful use of laser weapons,” says Boyd. “In cluttered civil environments, it is particularly important to have an effective process in place for de-confliction of the region into which a laser is being fired.”
Lasers are also sensitive to the weather; rain or fog reduces their effectiveness significantly. They also generate a lot of heat, which makes them prone to overheating and could make them an easy target on a battlefield. That is why initially, lasers might be used to defend critical infrastructure away from front lines, or be installed on ships.
“We’re not going to be shooting handheld lasers at each other anytime soon,” says Black. “Lasers aren’t a silver bullet. They don’t solve all problems. But they are making concrete advances, and countries are actually putting them in the field. They will, however, need to be integrated in wider anti-air systems, where they will serve beside other weapons.”
In Australia, EOS is working on that. One of their priorities is making their lasers more powerful, and able to handle large swarms of drones. “We want to have more kills per minute,” says Schwer. “That’s why you need more power. Our next step is to have 50 kills per minute. Even with large swarms of drones, nothing will be able to get through.”

'You arrived before things got insane': How moving to Sweden is tougher now
Sweden
Unknown Publisher

"It was a different world," exclaimed our contributor Mandy Pipher yesterday when I told her of my citizenship application back in 2016. It had taken only three months from application before a document confirming me a Swede dropped through my mailbox. "You arrived before things got insane," she sighed (or would have if sighing were possible over a messaging app).
As Mandy wrote in an excellent article detailing the exhausting immigration journey she's been going through, if not insane, it's definitely tougher now. What irks her is that Swedes tend to assume that, for her, it isn't. She's highly educated, comes from Canada, and is married to a Swede. It must be easy, right?
As readers probably know, when it comes to The Local's coverage of migration rules, our journalists very much have skin in the game.
When Sweden's government announced it will tighten citizenship rules on June 6th, National Day, our acting editor, Becky Waterton, gave a similar personal take. Will people like her with pending citizenship applications end up being rejected on the basis of language and citizen tests that do not yet even exist, she asked?
The answer we learned the next day in a statement from Migration Minister Johan Forssell's press spokesperson, is basically, "yes", as you can see Becky in the video below.
To me, at least, that seems pretty insane.
View this post on Instagram
Migration news
The draft citizenship law took up most of our time this week.
We tried to answer readers' questions on the new law as best we could, updating our answers as new information came in. (If you have questions of your own, you can ask them in the comments section to the article).
Becky explained how, in the absence of government citizenship tests, you can demonstrate your knowledge of Swedish language and society so your application won't be rejected after June 6th. It isn't going to be easy.
I outlined why the new rules will make it significantly harder for children to gain Swedish citizenship, with the law effectively abolishing the old, nearly automatic "citizenship via notification" route.
Mandy went through why the new rules will make Swedish citizenship almost impossible for stay-at-home partners to obtain.
We had a huge response to our reader survey on whether the stricter citizenship laws and their retroactive application made them regret coming to Sweden. "I am done with Sweden," wrote Ricardo, a software developer based in Stockholm, in one of the over a hundred responses we received. "I planned a long-term life here based on citizenship and now I see all my plans ruined. I want to live on a place that I am not afraid of the government changing the rules all the time."
The publication of the draft citizenship law knocked teen deportations – the big political story of recent weeks – slightly out of the spotlight. But we kept covering the political machinations.
On Monday, we published an interview with Annika Hirvonen, the immigration spokesperson for the Green Party, whose initiative in the parliament helped make it a mainstream political issue.
Membership+ subscribers can listen to this interview and another interview I did with the Centre Party's immigration spokesperson Niels Paarup-Petersen in our Sweden in Focus Extra podcast.
I listed the various solutions to the problem proposed by the opposition and government parties. You can watch me rush through them in a video here.
Our publishing director James Savage argued in his Politics in Sweden column that the episode was showing that the Swedish public is more pro-migration than most people, and certainly most politicians, think. You can watch him discuss Sweden's tougher migration rules in this video.
If you are affected by the teen deportation, we are looking to speak to people so we can drive through to the Swedish public that this is something that affects highly skilled workers. If this is you, you can tell us about your situation in our survey.
We also had some news on the other big immigration news story, the coming hike to the work permit salary threshold. I obtained the text of the instructions the government gave the Migration Agency in January when asking it to draw up a list of exempted professions. The agency, it said, should "start with the premise that the need for exemptions is limited".
If this all seems too much (and it's a lot) you can hear Becky and James discuss it all in a more digestible format in this week's episode of Sweden in Focus.
What else have we been writing about?
It was one of those weeks where migration news dominated everything, but we still found time to cover some other stuff. A government inquiry gave its proposals on how to make membership of a criminal gang a punishable offence. Sweden's finance minister, Elisabeth Svantesson, warned that "most of the leeway for extra spending" in the four years after the election has already been used up.
Next week, it's the sportlov holiday here in Malmö, so I'll be off from Wednesday. On Sunday I'll be taking to the slopes, dragging my children to hills of Halland to take advantage of the snow.
Oh, and I hope you all have a happy Valentine's Day!

US urges Europe to take lead in NATO conventional defence
United Kingdom
Unknown Publisher

19:54:05 KST

A senior US defence official has called on European NATO members to assume primary responsibility for the conventional defence of Europe, arguing the Alliance must adapt to a changed strategic environment and a growing need for the United States to prioritise threats elsewhere, according to remarks delivered at the NATO Defence Ministerial.
Speaking in Brussels, Under Secretary of War for Policy Elbridge Colby said the world that shaped NATO’s posture following the Cold War “no longer exists”, warning that “power politics has returned” and that large-scale military force is again being used.
Colby said the United States was prioritising defence of the homeland and interests in the Western Hemisphere, while reinforcing deterrence in the Indo-Pacific, particularly the Western Pacific. He added that allies must be prepared for the possibility of opponents acting simultaneously across multiple theatres.
“These realities compel us to think clearly, soberly, and realistically about how we defend ourselves, and how we do so together in a way that is sustainable, sensible, and enduring,” he said.
Colby rejected the suggestion that this shift represented a withdrawal from NATO, describing it instead as a return to the Alliance’s original purpose. He said NATO’s Cold War model involved allies being expected to “pull their weight”, citing burden-sharing debates under multiple US presidents and arguing that the approach helped deter Soviet aggression.
He described the post-Cold War era as a shift into what he called “NATO 2.0”, characterised by reduced European defence spending and a greater focus on operations outside the Alliance’s core area. Colby said this model was no longer “fit for purpose” and called for a “NATO 3.0” approach that more closely resembled the Cold War framework.
“This ‘NATO 3.0’ requires much greater efforts by our allies to step up and assume primary responsibility for the conventional defense of Europe,” he said.
Colby praised commitments made at the 2025 Hague Summit, saying NATO members had begun to recognise that a model in which the United States provided the “overwhelming share of high-end military power” while European allies spent relatively little was no longer sustainable.
He said allies were now moving toward the Hague commitments of 3.5% and 5% of GDP on core and broader defence spending, describing the levels as a “new global standard”.
However, Colby argued that NATO must now turn spending commitments into practical military outputs, including “ready forces, usable munitions, resilient logistics, and integrated command structures”.
“Defense spending levels matter, and there is no substitute for it. But what matters at the end of the day is what those resources produce,” he said.
He also called for greater emphasis on warfighting effectiveness and warned against over-ambitious procurement goals, stating that not every capability could be “gold-plated” and that NATO members would need to make hard choices about readiness and stockpiles.
Colby said the United States would continue to provide extended nuclear deterrence and would still contribute conventional capabilities, but in a “more limited and focused fashion”. He said Washington would be candid about the scale and timeline of change, while continuing to train, exercise and plan alongside allies.
“We will continue to provide the U.S. extended nuclear deterrent,” he said, adding: “We in the Department of War will continue to ready our forces to do our part under Article V with Europe taking the lead for its conventional defense.” Colby said the United States would continue to push for a “rebalancing of roles and burdens” within the Alliance, describing this as necessary to ensure NATO remained credible and sustainable.
He argued the approach was intended to strengthen Europe rather than weaken it, saying the US sought “partnerships, not dependencies”. He added that alliances were strongest when responsibilities were shared in line with power and interests, warning that imbalances could create “structural strain”. Colby said he was encouraged by increased defence spending among several European allies and ongoing reforms to procurement and readiness systems. He also pointed to NATO’s defence planning process becoming more operationally focused.
He concluded by describing a future NATO in which Europe provides the primary conventional defence of the continent, supported by US strategic power, and said the Alliance must be grounded in deterrence and effective defence rather than “symbolism”. “Partnership, by definition, means walking together, each carrying a fair share of the load,” he said.

AU calls for end to ‘extermination’ of Palestinians, decries African wars
African heads of state gather in Ethiopia’s Addis Ababa for the 39th African Union Summit.
The “extermination” of the Palestinian people must end, the chairman of the African Union Commission, Mahmoud Ali Youssouf, has said, as dozens of heads of state gather for the regional body’s 39th summit in the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa.
“In the Middle East, Palestine and the suffering of its people also challenge our consciences. The extermination of this people must stop,” said Youssouf, who was elected to head the institution a year ago, declared on Saturday.

The annual meeting is expected to focus on ruinous wars and security in the region as well as governance challenges around the world, threats to democracy and climate change, including water sanitation and water‑linked climate shocks.
“International law and international humanitarian law are the basis of the international community,” Youssouf added, as he called for the lifting of the Israeli blockade of humanitarian goods into the besieged Palestinian territory.
Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza has killed at least 72,045 people and wounded 171,686 since October 2023, and continues despite a “ceasefire”.
Youssouf also touched on the multiple conflicts raging in Africa, calling for the “silencing of the guns” across the continent.
“From Sudan to the Sahel, to eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), in Somalia and elsewhere, our people continue to pay the heavy price of instability,” Youssouf said.
The summit brings together heads of state from the 55 member states of the African Union over two days.
In his speech at the summit, United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres praised the AU as a “flagship for multilateralism” at a time of global “division and mistrust”.
Guterres also called for a permanent African seat in the UN Security Council, saying its absence is “indefensible”.
“This is 2026, not 1946. Whatever decisions about the African World around the table, Africa must be at the table,” he declared.
This year’s theme is water sanitation.
Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed highlighted the issue of water conservation on the continent, as he welcomed other leaders to the capital.
“Water is more than just a resource. It is a foundation of development, innovation and stability,” he said. “Here in Ethiopia, we have learned that responsible water management is central to guiding development wisely.”
In Africa, water cuts across interstate disputes, like Egypt and Ethiopia’s fight over the Nile, deadly tensions between farmers and herders in Nigeria over access to the same arable land, antigovernment protests over failed service delivery in Madagascar, and the outbreak of health epidemics in the wake of major floods and droughts.
Al Jazeera’s Haru Mutasa, reporting from Addis Ababa, said that while the issue of water is front and centre at this year’s summit, unresolved questions from last year’s gathering, including the cuts in global aide, continue to fester.
“There seems to be not enough money to the people who are in need,” our correspondent said.
She also added the ongoing deadly war in the DRC, which is causing mass displacement and famine, as well as the brutal, nearly three-year war in Sudan are also high on the summit agenda, as well as the reignited conflict in neighbouring South Sudan.
On Saturday, as the AU summit opened, at least four explosions were heard around the government-aligned Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) base in the city of Dilling in South Kordofan, as drones from the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) paramilitary group targeted the city.
The African continent makes up about a fifth of the global population, with an estimated 1.4 billion people, about 400 million of whom are 15 to 35 years old.
But it is also home to several of the world’s oldest and longest-serving leaders, many criticised as out-of-touch – a paradox that has contributed to an upsurge in military takeovers and other undemocratic means, notably in West African nations, such as Mali, Burkina Faso, Guinea, Niger, and Guinea-Bissau.
Some observers say the AU Summit will provide an opportunity to align continental priorities with international partners, especially at a time of discussions around a “new world order” stirred by US President Donald Trump, with foreign leaders signalling shifting global alliances and many looking towards China.

Russian subsidiaries of French agribusiness group Sucden support war effort in Ukraine
Russian subsidiaries of French agribusiness group Sucden have been accused of directly supporting the Russian Armed Forces between 2023 and 2025.
Source: RFI, a French news public radio station, citing European public service channelArte and Mediapart, an independent nonprofit French investigative online newspaper
Details: The investigation showed that the support included supplies of equipment and materiel to units involved in the war against Ukraine.
The journalists report that several Russian subsidiaries of Sucden (Sucres et denrées), owned by French sugar magnate Serge Varsano, provided the Russian military with equipment for weaving camouflage nets and rubber strips to protect armoured vehicles from drones and vehicles. They also took part in raising funds for frontline needs.
At two of Sucden's large sugar plants in Russia's Lipetsk Oblast, local authorities actively enlist businesses to support the Russian Armed Forces. They are the Yelets Sugar Plant (Agrosnabsakhar) and the Dobrinsky Sugar Plant.
The oblast runs a dedicated programme called Lipetsk Industry for Victory, which is said to include 34 companies, though a list of participants is not publicly available.
In May 2024, Vladimir Serikov, speaker of Lipetsk Oblast Council, said that a number of foreign companies in the oblast supported the so-called "special military operation", the term used by the Russian government to describe the Russo-Ukrainian war.
Arte reported that three subsidiaries linked to Sucden featured among the companies were involved in these activities.
The Yelets Sugar Plant handed Russian forces machines for cutting camouflage strips. The Dobrinsky Sugar Plant supplied rubber for protective conveyor belts at the request of the Russian 283rd Motor Rifle Regiment.
The investigation also established that the agricultural firm Yeletsky, which grows grain, helped volunteers buy mesh fabric for the Russian troops in 2025.
In the city of Kamenka in Penza Oblast, one of the oblast's biggest businesses, Atmis-Sakhar, reportedly manufactures ovens for the Russian military, supplied rubber conveyor belts and opened a camouflage net workshop.
In Russia's Krasnodar Krai, Uspensky Sugar Plant reportedly provided transport with anti-drone coverings for moving military personnel. The Uspensky Agropromsoyuz agricultural company bought anti-drone blankets for fighters from the Russian 810th Naval Infantry Brigade, which took part in the capture of Ukrainian city of Mariupol.
RFI said its journalists linked the companies to the effort by tracking social media posts from Russian volunteer networks, which regularly release messages thanking the plants for their support.
In response to media enquiries, Sucden said it launched an internal review. Its press office said the actions were "local private initiatives" carried out without the knowledge or approval of its Paris headquarters.
The company said the actions of its subsidiaries "contradict the group's rules and practice". It added it has strictly complied with European Union sanctions obligations since 2022.
Sucden was founded in the 1950s and entered the Russian market in the early 1990s as a trader before moving into direct industrial investment in the 2000s.
Mediapart said the group's main production cluster is in Russia, with four plants producing 800,000 tonnes of sugar a year and agricultural businesses growing sugar beet and grain across 250,000 hectares.
Nicolas Sarkozy linked to Sucden
The investigation mentioned former French president Nicolas Sarkozy, who works with the French company as a consultant and is a family friend to Serge Varsano.
Mediapart previously reported on Sarkozy's business and political ties in Russia and on his consultancy contracts with Russian companies.
Mediapart reported back in 2023 that the former French president received two transfers totalling €300,000 shortly before and some time after a speech he gave at a New Year's Eve reception hosted by the Russian Direct Investment Fund in late 2018.
Background:
- German prosecutors arrested five people on suspicion of forming a criminal organisation engaged in the illicit procurement of military equipment for Russian companies.
- Eight sanctioned tankers are travelling through the English Channel despite promises by the UK government to take decisive action against vessels of the shadow fleet, which Moscow has used to circumvent Western restrictions on its energy sector imposed since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.
- Russia has obtained Michelin aircraft tyres worth more than US$7 million despite EU sanctions.
- Cars made by German companies were delivered to a sanctioned Russian fertiliser producer, Uralkali, via Uzbekistan.

Belarus Tests Russian Molot Drone Interceptor

The Belarusian military has tested the Russian Molot drone interceptor, which is launched from a hand-held launcher.
In early February, Belarus began testing 59 different systems for combating drones, according to a representative of the country’s Ministry of Defense.
The tests involve detection, suppression, and destruction systems.
“More than 80% of the systems presented in the experiment are Belarusian-made,” the Ministry of Defence said.
The Russian Molot system from Nova Labs was admitted to the tests.
Molot consists of two main parts: a reusable launcher and an interceptor drone.
The launcher is designed as a tube closed at the rear, with two external handles, a stock, and a sight.
In combat position with the UAV installed, its length does not exceed 700–800 mm, and its weight is only a few kilograms. The system does not impose any special requirements on the user.
A UAV with a cylindrical body and a hemispherical nose cone is used as an interceptor.
Inside the body are a homing head, control devices, a warhead, and a battery. Depending on the configuration, the launch weight of the device does not exceed 1.5–2 kg.
Four electric motors with propellers provide flight. The UAV is capable of vertical takeoff, hovering, and horizontal flight.
In flight, the device reaches speeds of up to 50 m/s. The combat radius depends on the type of target: when operating against large aircraft-type drones, it reaches 1 km.
Interception of drones with a diameter of up to 500–700 mm is possible at a distance of 350–400 m, and the operating height is up to 200 m.
The UAV is equipped with an infrared homing head capable of independently tracking the target. It is claimed that the project implements the ‘launch and forget’ principle.
A 500 g high-explosive warhead is provided to destroy the target. The explosion occurs upon contact with the target or when passing it at a minimum distance. Kinetic interception is also possible — the UAV hits the target with a direct hit.
In the new version, the manufacturer claims that the interceptor can hit targets at an altitude of up to 2 km at speeds of up to 200 km/h. It is designed in two versions — portable and stationary.
The portable version features a thermal imaging homing head and 100 mm kinetic ammunition with a speed of up to 265 km/h.
The stationary version is equipped with radio command or laser guidance, has a range of up to 3.5 km, and the projectile speed reaches 360 km/h.
Ukraine also recently unveiled a new interceptor drone, the Saliut, which is already shooting down Shahed-type drones.

Tarique Rahman: From 17-year exile to landslide win in Bangladesh election
Results mark a remarkable reversal of fortune for the BNP chief, who left the country in 2008 and returned from London less than two months ago.
Less than two months after returning from 17 years of self-imposed exile in London, Tarique Rahman has won one of Bangladesh’s most pivotal elections and is set to become prime minister, leading the country as his parents once did.
A coalition led by his Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) won a decisive two-thirds majority in the parliamentary election, according to the results published in the official gazette of the Bangladesh Election Commission.

On Saturday, Rahman addressed the country during a press conference, calling for unity and dedicating his sweeping win to those who “sacrificed for democracy”.
“I firmly believe that national unity is a collective strength, while division is a weakness.”
The result is expected to bring stability after months of turmoil following the ouster of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in a Gen Z-led uprising in 2024, during which security forces killed hundreds on her orders. She has since been sentenced to death in absentia.
Hasina, now in exile in New Delhi, and Rahman’s mother, Khaleda Zia, long dominated Bangladeshi politics, while Rahman’s father was a leading Bangladesh independence figure who ruled the country from 1977 to 1981 before he was assassinated.
Thursday’s election marked a remarkable reversal of fortune for Rahman, who left the country in 2008, saying he needed medical treatment after his arrest during a military-backed caretaker administration’s crackdown on alleged corruption.
The soft-spoken 60-year-old BNP leader returned home to a hero’s welcome last Christmas with his cardiologist wife and barrister daughter, and took over the party’s command as chairman after the death of his mother five days later.
During the election campaign, Rahman pledged to recalibrate Bangladesh’s international partnerships to attract investment without tying the country too closely to any single power, in contrast with Hasina, who was seen as aligned with New Delhi.
He has also highlighted expanding financial aid for poor families, reducing reliance on garment exports by promoting industries such as toys and leather goods, and introducing a two-term, 10-year limit for prime ministers to deter autocratic tendencies.
Rezaul Karim Rony, a Dhaka-based political analyst, described the BNP’s landslide win as a “victory of a democratic, moderate force”.
“The challenge now is to ensure good governance, law and order, and public safety, and to establish a rights-based state, which was at the heart of the aspirations of the 2024 mass uprising,” he told Al Jazeera.
Rony said the job ahead for Rahman is moving away from cadre-based politics towards a rights-based system that reflects younger generations’ desire for a more inclusive governance.
“The task now is to build a state based on that spirit – ensuring the rule of law, human dignity and employment opportunities,” he said. “The question now is how Tarique Rahman will confront this responsibility.”
The bespectacled Rahman was born on November 20, 1965, in Dhaka to Khaleda and former President Ziaur Rahman, the founder of the BNP. He studied international relations at the University of Dhaka, dropped out, and later started businesses in textiles and agro-products.
After his return, Rahman tried to project himself as a statesman ready to look beyond his family’s difficulties under Hasina, and get rid of the image of a brash operator from the BNP’s 2001–2006 era, when his mother was prime minister.
Although he never held a government post, Rahman was often accused of running a parallel power centre during her tenure, a charge he denies.
“What does revenge bring to someone? People have to flee from this country because of revenge. This does not bring anything good,” he recently said. “What we need at the moment in the country is peace and stability.”
Under Hasina’s rule, Rahman became a central target of corruption cases and was convicted in absentia in several of them. In 2018, he was also sentenced to life over a 2004 grenade attack on a rally Hasina was addressing that killed and wounded many. He has always denied the allegations, calling them politically motivated, and has since been acquitted in all cases following Hasina’s ouster.
From London, he had watched his party marginalised election after election, with senior leaders jailed, workers disappeared, and offices shuttered.
Since his return, Rahman has adopted a noticeably understated style, avoiding inflammatory rhetoric and calling instead for restraint and reconciliation. He has spoken of restoring “people’s ownership of the state” and rebuilding institutions – a message that has energised BNP supporters eager for a fresh start.
Inside the BNP, Rahman’s grip on the party is strong. Party insiders said he directly oversaw candidate selection, strategy and alliance talks, roles he once performed remotely.
He may be a product of dynastic politics, but Rahman said restoring and sustaining democracy would be his biggest priority.
“Only by practising democracy can we prosper and rebuild our country. If we practise democracy, we can establish accountability,” he said. “So we want to practise democracy, we want to rebuild our country.”
Reporting from Dhaka, Al Jazeera’s Jonah Hull said since his return, Rahman has become “a pretty ubiquitous figure”, who made “lots of big promises about restoring law and order, rebuilding infrastructure and healthcare”.
“He has made big promises, notably on corruption, especially for a party tainted with corruption itself in the past. Rahman is promising a top-down, no-tolerance approach to corruption, and a new era of clean politics in Bangladesh.”
As he prepared on Saturday to take the reigns of power in the country, Rahman said the new government he will lead faces daunting challenges.
“We have paved the way for the establishment of democracy in the country,” he added.
“We are about to begin our journey in a situation marked by a fragile economy left behind by an authoritarian regime, weakening constitutional and structural institutions and destroying law and order.”

Ex-hostage reveals she tried to kill herself in Gaza, says view of protests saved her

Ex-hostage reveals she tried to kill herself in Gaza, says view of protests saved her
Arbel Yehoud and Ariel Cunio detail dire conditions in solitary captivity, decribe how terrorists passed letters between them, allowing for brief communication
Former hostage Arbel Yehoud revealed in an interview broadcast Friday that she attempted to end her life several times while held captive by Palestinian terrorists in Gaza, but ultimately decided not to after her captors showed her video of a protest in Israel where she saw her face on a poster, and she understood that people were fighting for her.
In a separate interview, Yehoud indicated that she had faced sexual assault on an almost daily basis among widespread abuses she suffered while being held alone.
“One of the times, not long before my release, I saw drone footage from Hostages Square [in Tel Aviv]. I saw people holding signs of people I don’t know, and then suddenly I saw signs of people I knew. I saw a sign for Ariel [Cunio] and a sign for me, signs of people from the kibbutz,” Yehoud told Channel 12 news in an interview alongside Cunio.
“From the moment I saw that, I didn’t try to put an end to my own life there.”
Amid the two-year war, tens of thousands of people staged weekly Saturday night protests in Tel Aviv and around the country, demanding that the government reach a deal to bring the hostages home.
“That was the last time I tried,” she continued, noting she attempted to kill herself at least three times while in captivity. “When I saw the drone footage and understood that people who I don’t know are fighting for me as if I were their sister or daughter, I have a duty to return to Ariel and my family, but also to those fighting for me.”
Torn apart
Cunio and Yehoud, self-described “high school sweethearts,” were kidnapped together from their shared home at Kibbutz Nir Oz during the October 7, 2023, Hamas-led invasion of southern Israel that sparked the war.
Yehoud was released after 482 days in captivity during a truce in January 2025, while Cunio was returned as part of the Israel-Hamas ceasefire deal reached in October.
Cunio recalled the terror of their abduction and being torn apart once they entered Gaza.
“I told her, ‘The most important thing is that we stay together. As long as they don’t separate us, we’ll be okay.’ Half an hour later, that is what happened,” Cunio said. “It happened so fast, there wasn’t even time to say ‘I love you, be strong.'”
“I didn’t manage to tell him bye, I didn’t get to see his eyes,” Yehoud added.
While many of the 251 hostages were held together in small groups by Hamas, both Yehoud and Cunio were held by the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, which kept them separate and alone.
Cunio described the isolation that he felt during his captivity. “I was completely alone for two years, I never saw a single captive,” he said. “Have you ever wondered if you’ll see the sunrise tomorrow?”
He said that after being captured, he was first taken to a residential building, before being transferred and held in a crawlspace above the ceiling of a store.
“I was there for about three and a half months, hunched over all the time, with mice walking around you, cockroaches, and you sitting on a mattress all day. The windows are closed, the door is closed all day,” he said. “Because of the heat, you don’t even have air to breathe. Even though you’re not underground, you don’t have air. You feel suffocated, the heat is so intense that you sweat 24/7 for months. You’re dirty, your skin turns black, a rash on your body, from head to toe.”
Additionally, because he was held above a busy street, he had to remain quiet at all times, otherwise he would be threatened with being handed over to Hamas and being forced into the tunnels.
Letters and notes
Cunio said that after repeatedly pressing his captors for information on Yehoud, they told him to write a letter, which they ended up passing along to her, leading to a period of a few months in which they were able to correspond.
Yehoud said that she was shocked to receive the first letter, and that her captors told her that Cunio “drove them crazy.”
“It was a lot of writing about the love between us, what was going on with us each day, our conditions, trying to get some sort of picture of what is going on outside,” he said in the interview. “She wrote to me in the last letter that she heard there was a massacre at Nir Oz and that we need to stay strong about what we will discover when we get out, because you don’t know anything. You don’t know if your family is living, who is dead, who was kidnapped.”
However, they weren’t able to keep up the communication. Yehoud described how the letters became shorter, “meaning they became a small note like this: ‘I’m fine, I love you.'” She added she wasn’t allowed to write more than that.
“They told me, ‘No more letters, you don’t ask about him anymore,'” Yehoud continued. “‘We will kill you, we will kill him.’ That’s it.”
She added, “We’re not the same people and we’re still trying to find our new path as a couple.”
Terrified
In a separate interview with The Daily Mail, Yehoud described her harrowing release and her fears that even as she was being set free, she would be captured by other gangs in Gaza.
Yehoud was released as one of seven hostages handed over during a long process in southern Gaza’s Khan Younis, one of the most chaotic handover ceremonies that saw her and Gadi Mozes paraded through a seething mass, including hundreds of masked gunmen.
They were forced to walk through the crowds, with gunmen at their side, from the vehicles that delivered them and, later, to the Red Cross vehicles, in chaotic scenes that prompted outrage from Israel.
“I remember stepping out and seeing that sea of green headbands,” she said. “I was the only woman. My mind was trying to process — am I free? But I’m still surrounded by them? I was terrified, but I knew I had to survive. My thoughts were of Ariel — I had to get back to him.”
Every single day
While speaking with Daily Mail, Yehoud also spoke of the difficulty in being able to speak about her experiences since her release and how she drew inspiration from other former hostages.
Yehoud said she hadn’t been able to watch the stories of other survivors, though that changed when former hostage Romi Gonen revealed in a recent interview that she was repeatedly sexually assaulted by terrorists before being transferred underground with other captives.
“It felt different,” she said. “It was hard for me — but in the end, I decided to watch the segment about her. I realized that what Romi describes experiencing once is what I went through almost every single day in captivity.”
In addition, Yehoud says she endured interrogations, forced conversion attempts and starvation.
There is a lot she says she is still unable to talk about.
“Because it was a very long time, and the things I went through, I went through from beginning to end, so they are in a sealed box,” she told Channel 12.

MUNICH, February 14. /TASS/. Washington prefers reaching a deal with Tehran on its nuclear program rather than pursuing a military scenario, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in an interview with Bloomberg.
According to him, the United States must maintain sufficient military capabilities in the Middle East to ensure that Tehran does not "come after" Washington. The White House believes that Iran should "never be allowed to have a nuclear weapon," Rubio added.

Ukrainian forces destroyed half of Russia's Pantsir missile systems in 2025 – Ukraine's Security Service
Special Operations Centre Alpha, part of the Security Service of Ukraine (SSU), destroyed half of Russia's Pantsir surface-to-air artillery and missile systems in 2025.
Source: SSU on Facebook
Quote: "Long-range strikes by the SSU's Special Operations Centre Alpha halved the number of Russian Pantsir surface-to-air artillery and missile systems in 2025."
Details: The SSU said the Pantsir is one of Russia's key modern air defence systems. A single system costs between US$15 million and US$20 million. Pantsirs are among the most effective systems in countering Ukraine's long-range drones.
Quote: "That is why the systematic destruction of Pantsir systems has a strategic goal: to break through the enemy's air defence and create corridors to strike targets deep in its rear. This enables Ukraine's defence forces to operate effectively against military bases, warehouses, airfields and other occupier facilities."
More details: The total value of all Russian air defence systems destroyed by the SSU's Special Operations Centre Alpha in 2025 is estimated at about US$4 billion.

Russia denies BRICS seeking to transform into military alliance

19:41:26 KST

Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov has denied that the BRICS economic bloc sought to transform into a military alliance.
In an interview with the state news agency TASS on Saturday, Ryabkov said BRICS is neither a military alliance nor a collective security organisation with obligations regarding mutual military assistance.
“It was never conceived in that spirit, and there are no plans to transform BRICS in that direction,” Ryabkov said, arguing that the 10-member bloc’s portfolio does not include military exercises or arms control.
Ryabkov also denied a recent naval exercise held in South Africa was a “BRICS event,” and that members that took part did so in their national capacity. He was referring to the “Will for Peace 2026” drills held on January 9-16, which included China, Iran, and Russia.
Asked whether BRICS could protect tankers belonging to members from attacks and ensure their safety, Ryabkov said the bloc has no potential beyond improving logistics and ensuring greater protection from sanctions, and that security must be “ensured by other means.”
Expressing solidarity with Iran
BRICS was formed in 2009 by Brazil, Russia, India, and China, with South Africa joining in 2010. Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Ethiopia, Indonesia, and Iran later joined, expanding the group to 11 members, alongside 10 partner countries.
The Russian deputy foreign minister said the growth of trade between BRICS countries significantly exceeds the global average, “an indication that BRICS, without being some kind of 'magic wand,’ can actually help solve problems."
Ryabkov said BRICS can and should express solidarity with Iran, and that Moscow and Beijing are in contact with the country and working on “ensuring the appropriate political environment” for negotiations between Tehran and Washington.
According to him, the focus now is “on the negotiations Iran is conducting with its partners, on the work Iran is doing indirectly — primarily through Arab intermediaries — with the Americans,” which he believes will continue.
US-Iran indirect talks
The US and Iran held indirect talks in Muscat on February 6 with Omani mediation to discuss Tehran’s nuclear program, marking the end of a roughly eight-month suspension after the US launched strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities during the 12-day Iran-Israel war in June 2025.
Washington has also significantly increased its military footprint in the region as US President Donald Trump warns Iran, which recently faced widespread protests over worsening economic conditions, that it must make a deal.
Uranium enrichment remains a central point of dispute, with the US demanding Iran halt uranium enrichment and transfer highly enriched uranium out of the country.

British warships to patrol Arctic as Starmer pledges Nato loyalty
- Sir Keir Starmer announced at the Munich Security Conference that British warships will patrol the Arctic with the US, Canada, and other Nato allies, a decision prompted by Donald Trump’s previous threats regarding Greenland.
- The Labour leader also revealed plans for Britain to seek "deeper economic integration" with the European Union, aiming to "move closer to the single market" in various sectors, acknowledging this would involve "trade-offs."
- Starmer reaffirmed the UK's commitment to Nato's Article 5, assuring allies that Britain would come to their aid if called upon, directly addressing concerns raised by Donald Trump.
- He stated that the current EU-UK "status quo is not fit for purpose" and remarked that he "ended the week much stronger than I started it" despite domestic political challenges.
- These announcements occurred during a security gathering where US Secretary of State Marco Rubio criticised past Western errors and notably declined to attend a Ukraine meeting, which European observers interpreted as a potential sign of diminishing US interest.

Swiss exhibition explores artistic dialogue between Kirchner and Picasso
In the Swiss mountain town of Davos, works by Pablo Picasso will be shown alongside pieces by Ernst Ludwig Kirchner for the first time. The director of the Kirchner Museum says it is one of the institution’s most ambitious exhibitions to date.

“People often say Picasso’s visual language is so dominant that everything else fades into the background,” the Kirchner Museum’s director, Katharina Beisiegel, told the Keystone‑SDA news agency at a press briefing on Friday. “With this exhibition, we show how striking and how equal this pairing can be.”

Ernst Ludwig Kirchner: a ‘true German artist’ who found peace in Switzerland
Around a hundred paintings, sculptures, drawings and prints by the two artists are on show at the museum. The director and curator stressed that the aim was not to determine which of the two was the greater artist. The idea for the exhibition goes back to a wish Ernst Ludwig Kirchner voiced in 1933, five years before his death, when he said he hoped for an international show “where Picasso and I would be shown side by side”.
Done and dusted? Not quite. It took 93 years for Kirchner’s vision to be realised. Three of those were spent securing the many loans, with works arriving from some of the world’s best‑known Picasso collections in Barcelona, Madrid, Paris and Berlin.
Parallels and contrasts
Only a year separates the two artists. Kirchner was born in Aschaffenburg, Germany, in 1880, and Picasso in Málaga, southern Spain, the following year. Both showed early artistic talent, and their parents encouraged them to pursue it. A selection of their childhood drawings are displayed together in one of the museum’s rooms, where the influence of Impressionism can already be seen in their work.

The miracle of Picasso in Basel
As their careers progressed, both artists developed distinctly personal visual languages. “Kirchner became highly expressive early on, working with intense, vibrant colours, while Picasso, during his Cubist period, relied on a far more restrained palette,” Beisiegel explained. After the First World War, their approaches converged again, with both turning to flatter, rounder and more organic forms.
The “Kirchner.Picasso” exhibition, which opens in Davos on Sunday, February 15 and runs until May 3, is also a significant art‑historical undertaking, the director said. “Both artists played a crucial role in the development of modern art and had a profound influence on the generations that followed. And now we’re able to show the full scope of their achievements side by side.”

US secretary calls for renewed transatlantic alliance rooted in sovereignty at Munich Security Conference
Rubio urges Europe, Washington to rebuild Western partnership, stresses Ukraine diplomacy, China dialogue, reform of global institutions
ISTANBUL
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio called Saturday for a renewed transatlantic alliance rooted in sovereignty, economic resilience, and shared Western identity, while outlining Washington’s approach to global conflicts and competition with China.
Speaking at the annual gathering of global leaders at the Munich Security Conference in Germany, Rubio framed the moment as a turning point for Europe and the US, drawing historical parallels to the Cold War era when the conference began in 1963.
“We gather here today as members of a historic alliance, an alliance that saved and changed the world,” Rubio said, recalling a divided Europe and the existential threats posed by Soviet communism. He warned that post-Cold War optimism had fostered what he described as misguided assumptions about globalization and liberal democracy.
“The euphoria of this triumph led us to a dangerous delusion ... that every nation would now be a liberal democracy,” he said, arguing that excessive reliance on global institutions, free trade policies, and mass migration had weakened Western societies and undermined economic sovereignty.
‘One civilization, Western civilization’
Rubio outlined the foreign policy direction of the Donald Trump administration, emphasizing a strategy centered on national interests, stronger borders, and industrial renewal.
“Under President Trump, the United States of America will once again take on the task of renewal and restoration,” he said, adding that Washington prefers to pursue this vision alongside European allies.
Highlighting shared cultural and historical ties, Rubio described the transatlantic relationship as rooted in “one civilization, Western civilization,” and urged European partners to increase defense capabilities and maintain cultural confidence.
He said alliances must focus not only on military cooperation but also on technological competition, supply chain security, and emerging sectors such as artificial intelligence and space exploration.
“Armies fight for a people. Armies fight for a nation. Armies fight for a way of life,” Rubio said, arguing that the West must clearly define the values it seeks to defend.
‘We don’t know if Russians serious about ending war’
The US secretary also criticized the aspects of the current international system, asserting that global institutions must be reformed to remain effective.
While acknowledging the UN’s potential, he said it had failed to resolve several major crises, citing Gaza, Ukraine, and Iran’s nuclear program as examples where US-led initiatives or military action played decisive roles.
In a question-and-answer session, Rubio addressed the ongoing war in Ukraine, saying negotiations remain uncertain despite some technical-level contacts between Russian and Ukrainian officials.
“We don’t know if the Russians are serious about ending the war,” he said, adding that sanctions and military support for Kyiv continue while Washington tests the possibility of a negotiated settlement that is “just and sustainable.”
On China, Rubio stressed the need for dialogue despite strategic rivalry ahead of a planned summit between President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping.
“It would be geopolitical malpractice to not be in conversations with China,” he said, noting that cooperation is possible where interests align but warning that “nothing that we agree to could come at the expense of our national interests.”
Rubio concluded by urging Europe and the US to reject narratives of Western decline and instead pursue a renewed partnership. “We do not seek to separate but to revitalize an old friendship and renew the greatest civilization in human history,” he said.

Europe must learn from Ukraine, European Commission president says
European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has said Europe must be ready to use force decisively and preemptively to defend itself and should learn from Ukraine's example.
Source: Ursula von der Leyen speaking at the Munich Security Conference, as reported by European Pravda
Details: Von der Leyen highlighted the need for a new European security strategy, including a new doctrine "to ensure that Europe can defend its own territory, economy, democracy and way of life at all times".
"Because this is ultimately the true meaning of independence," she said.
She held Ukraine up as an example, saying it had shown that "strength and deterrence and ultimately lives depend on industrial capacity".
Quote: "They say in Ukraine, 'you change or die'. We must adopt this mantra too. We need to tear down the rigid wall between the civilian and defence sectors. Europe is a powerhouse for car manufacturing, aerospace and heavy machinery. We should not look at these industries as purely commercial but as core to the defence and the defence value chain."
More details: Another lesson from the battlefield in Ukraine, von der Leyen said, is that dual-use technologies such as artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, drones and space must be boosted.
Quote: "And with this approach, we can close our capability gaps quickly. Drones, for example, are the most obvious of these examples. They are inflicting around 80% of battlefield damage on both sides in Ukraine. So we are massively investing and speeding up innovation and production in this area."
More details: In this context, she pointed to the new EU Defence Innovation Office in Kyiv, which is "merging European scale with Ukrainian speed and ingenuity".
Quote: "Some ask whether we can afford this. But I say we cannot afford not to."
More details: Von der Leyen also referred to the slow speed of decision-making in Europe and said the EU should rely on qualified majority support rather than unanimity to prevent attempts by individual countries to block measures.
Background:
- On 16 October, the European Commission presented a comprehensive plan to strengthen Europe's defence capabilities, including measures to counter drones and other threats from the air, sea and space, to EU member states.
- It has also been reported that the EU wants to create a drone alliance with Ukraine in early 2026.

Starmer to deploy UK warships to Arctic following Trump’s Greenland threats
The prime minister also used his speech at the Munich Security Conference to underline the UK’s commitment to Nato as he spelt out the ‘urgency’ of forging a closer UK defence relationship with Europe
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
Sir Keir Starmer told Europe it has to be ready to “fight” Russian aggression as he announced that the UK would deploy warships and fighter jets to the Arctic later this year.
The move, announced at the Munich Security Conference, will be seen as a bid to appease Donald Trump after he threatened to annex Greenland, citing security concerns in the region.
But even as the PM hailed what he said would be a demonstration of the transatlantic relationship, US secretary of state Marco Rubio warned the continent’s leaders over their ”malaise of hopelessness” and said that the US needed a partner with the “will to survive”.
It came as Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky hit out at the United States, saying his country was being asked to make concessions to Russia “too often” in US-brokered peace talks and that Europe was being sidelined.
During an eventful day at the summit:
- Sir Keir rebuked President Trump, saying he should “be in no doubt – if called on, the UK would come to your aid today”
- The PM said the UK should align more closely with the EU on the economy as well as on defence, and received a round of applause as he said: “We are not the Britain of the Brexit years any more”
- He attacked Reform as “pro-Putin” as he said Nigel Farage’s party and the Greens were offering a future of “division and then capitulation” that would see the “the lamps go out across Europe once again”
- Sir Keir denied that he had “narrowly missed” being toppled and said he had ended this week “much stronger than I started it, and that’s a very good place to be”
Addressing the event on Saturday morning, Sir Keir said leaders must not dither, because “Russia has proved its appetite for aggression”. He warned that, even if there were a peace deal for Ukraine, Russia’s rearmament “would only accelerate”.
“We must answer this threat in full,” he said. “The road ahead is straight and it is clear. We must build our hard power, because that is the currency of the age. We must be able to deter aggression, and yes, if necessary, we must be ready to fight.”
Announcing the planned deployment of the warships, the prime minister said that the US, Canada and other Nato allies would join Britain in bolstering security across what is known as the Nigh North.
Mr Trump has claimed that Europe does not do enough to defend Greenland, which is strategically important to the US, amid threats from Russia and China.
During his address, Sir Keir also hit out at Mr Trump’s claims that he is unsure whether other Nato allies would come to the US’s defence.
One of the alliance’s founding principles, Article 5, is that an attack on one Nato member is regarded as an attack on all. It has only been invoked once, after the 9/11 terror attacks in New York.
“Be in no doubt, if called on, the UK would come to your aid today,” he told the US president.
As the world approaches the fourth anniversary of the Russian invasion of Ukraine later this month, Sir Keir said the UK recognised the “urgency” of the need to establish closer defence ties with the EU.
In a move that will infuriate Brexiteers at home, he also said that Britain should move towards “deeper economic integration” with the EU, aiming to “move closer to the single market” in various sectors. He insisted his cabinet was in full agreement as he attempted to brush off the Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar’s bid last week to oust him from office, saying he had “ended the week much stronger than I started it”.
His speech came less than an hour after an address by Mr Rubio, who warned Europe that the US did not want to be caretakers of Western “decline”. The US secretary of state criticised countries he said had spent not enough on defence and too much on welfare, had appeased a climate “cult” to their own economic detriment, had allowed too much immigration, and had not defended their history, as he hit out at what he said was a “malaise of hopelessness and complacency”.
But Mr Zelensky in turn attacked the US, saying: “The Americans often return to the topic of concessions, and too often those concessions are discussed only in the context of Ukraine, not Russia.”
Mr Zelensky said he hoped that the US would stay involved in the negotiations, and that there would be an opportunity for Europe to play a larger role.
“Europe is practically not present at the table. It’s a big mistake, to my mind,” he said.

Federal agent hospitalized after assault during anti-ICE protest in Los Angeles
Authorities say suspects blended back into student-led march as demonstrations disrupted traffic and damaged property
ISTANBUL
A federal agent was hospitalized after being assaulted during an anti-US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) protest in Downtown Los Angeles on Friday, authorities said, as demonstrations linked to a student walkout disrupted traffic and led to property damage.
The Los Angeles Police Department confirmed the incident and wrote on the US social media company X before 1 pm (2100GMT) that “LAFD responding to a Federal Agent who was injured during the incident.”
Police said individuals suspected of attacking the agent rejoined the marching crowd, while some participants allegedly vandalized the Federal Building and threw objects at officers.
Local outlets reported the rally was organized as a student walkout, with aerial footage showing demonstrators carrying American and Mexican flags and holding signs including “Honk if you hate Nazis.”
The injured agent was transported to a hospital, though officials did not disclose the person’s condition or confirm the agency affiliation.
Authorities also said it remains unclear whether any arrests have been made.

According to him, Washington faces a number of "long-term challenges" that "are going to be irritants" in its relationship with Beijing. "That's not just true for the United States. That's true for the broader West," Rubio stated at the Munich Security Conference.

‘Armed men and intimidation’: Doctors Without Borders suspends work at Khan Younis hospital

Doctors Without Borders, known by its French acronym MSF, said it has suspended its work at Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis after staff reported the presence of armed men inside the facility.
The organization, one of the largest operating in Gaza, confirmed that in recent months its teams and patients saw armed men, some of them masked, in various parts of the hospital compound. MSF stressed that the individuals were not present in areas where its staff were directly operating, but elsewhere in the large complex.
Following what it described as a worsening security situation, MSF said it made the “difficult decision” to halt its activities at Nasser Hospital, currently the largest functioning medical facility in the Gaza Strip. The organization cited concerns about the hospital’s management, the preservation of its neutrality and broader security breaches.
“In recent months at Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis, patients and MSF staff have seen armed men, some masked, in different areas of the hospital compound,” the organization said in a statement posted on its website. “Since the ceasefire, the situation has worsened, and MSF teams have reported a pattern of unacceptable incidents, including the presence of armed men, intimidation, arbitrary arrests of patients and, most recently, suspected movement of weapons. These events constitute serious security threats to our staff and patients.”
MSF said it had formally raised its concerns with relevant authorities and emphasized that such violations are incompatible with its humanitarian mission.
“Hospitals must remain neutral, civilian spaces free from military presence or activity to ensure safe and impartial delivery of medical care,” the statement said.
The organization added that its concerns are heightened given previous strikes on hospitals during the conflict. It said health facilities have repeatedly been targeted by Israeli forces, resulting in loss of life and damage to infrastructure.
“We call on all armed groups, as well as Israeli forces, to respect medical facilities and ensure the protection of staff and patients,” MSF said.

Clarkson’s Farm star rushed to hospital after chopping off finger with log splitter
Show’s temporary farm manager Harriet Cowan suffered nasty injury in farming incident
- Bookmark

Clarkson’s Farm star Harriet Cowan was rushed to hospital after chopping the end of her finger off in a gruesome accident.
Cowan, who featured on the Prime Video show last year, informed her followers of the news on Friday (13 February), revealing she had “a run in with a log splitter”.
The accident occurred on Monday (9 February) and doctors were able to reattach the finger.
“Sorry I’ve been quiet!” she wrote. “Been a crappy week. Had a run in with a log splitter, chopped the end of my finger off, but a quick surgery they stitched it back on!!”
Cowan was introduced in the latest season of the show, which follows the ups and downs at Jeremy Clarkson’s Diddy Squat farm, as the temporary replacement of farm manager Kaleb Cooper.
The former full-time nurse, who was forced to urge viewers to “be kind” following her appearance on the show, was recruited due to Cooper’s professional commitments elsewhere.
Fans of the show couldn’t help but notice Cooper appeared rather unimpressed with Cowan upon their introduction when he returned to the Oxfordshire location.
Jeremy Clarkson himself pointed out that Cooper needed to be kind to Cowan, telling him: “Right, now, that’s Harriet. Now be nice – behave.”
Cooper then stood watching Cowan in silence as she worked, sarcastically questioning her farming skills, with Clarkson chiding him for his attitude.
However, Cowan assured viewers that she gets on with Cooper – and said that they have even become friends away from the cameras.
During an appearance on BBC Derby, Cowan, who has a big following on TikTok, said: “Kaleb’s amazing. Me and him are so close now. He’s such a good farmer and we got on really well.”
She continued: “He’s another farmer to add to my phone list to ring. Everyone checks in to make sure everyone’s fine.”
Cowan won over audiences with her witty asides and impressive farming knowledge, and many have expressed hope that she will become a permanent team member at the Chipping Norton farm.
In episode one of the latest season, former Top Gear presenter Clarkson gives Cowan a tour of the farm. At one point, he identifies a Neolithic fort, which he explains is “4000 years old”, prompting Cowan to quip: “Nearly as old as you.” She even makes an attempt at trimming Clarkson’s unruly eyebrows.
Clarkson warms to Cowan as the episode goes on, calling her a “star” and praising her farming knowledge. “She’s brilliant,” he tells his farming contractor Charlie Ireland.
Cowan previously graduated from the University of Derby, where she studied nursing. She was named her town’s Young Farmers spokesperson and continues to use social media to highlight the realities of working on a farm.
She has been vocal during the farmers’ protests in response to Labour’s changes to inheritance tax, which has seen thousands of farmers gather in Westminster in recent months.
After the show launched her to fame, she quit her job as a full-time nurse – and she soon won a presenting role alongside comedian Jessica Knappett on Channel 4’s Tiny Farmers.

Ukraine, IMF ease conditions on new $8.2 billion loan program
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
KYIV, Feb 14 - Ukraine's government and the International Monetary Fund have agreed to ease some conditions, including sensitive tax increases, for a new $8.2 billion lending programme, Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko said on Saturday.
She said the IMF board was expected to review the programme at its next meeting, noting its approval was crucial for unlocking other international support, including a 90‑billion‑euro ($106.8 billion) EU loan.
As the war with Russia grinds into its fifth year, Ukraine relies on Western financial aid to sustain its defences, keep the economy running, and pay wages and pensions.
After discussions, "the mission has simplified the agreements reached in November" and revised some structural benchmarks, Svyrydenko said, in remarks released by her office on Saturday.
In November, the IMF and Ukraine reached a staff-level agreement on the new four-year program. A key prior action for board approval was raising taxes for individual entrepreneurs.
ECONOMIC SITUATION DETERIORATES DUE TO RUSSIAN STRIKES
In recent months, Ukraine's economic situation has worsened as intensified Russian airstrikes have battered the energy system and infrastructure, cutting power, heat and water for millions in bitterly cold winter temperatures.
Costly energy imports and generator-produced electricity kept Ukrainian businesses running, but many cut working hours and output, prompting a review of economic forecasts.
The central bank lowered its 2026 GDP growth forecast to 1.8% from 2% due to larger-than-expected energy deficits.
Svyrydenko said the most sensitive part of the IMF programme was taxing individual entrepreneurs.
The government agreed to introduce a value-added tax for them, raising the revenue threshold to 4 million hryvnias (85,000 euros) from 1 million hryvnias.
Analysts now expect about 250,000 entrepreneurs to be affected by the increase, instead of over 600,000 in earlier plans.
The government was discussing the changes with lawmakers as it prepared draft legislation with other tax increases, Svyrydenko said. REUTERS

Memo says White House was ‘excellently preserved’ during East Wing demolition for Trump’s ballroom

Memo says White House was ‘excellently preserved’ during East Wing demolition for Trump’s ballroom
The White House mansion’s eastern facade appears to have been “excellently preserved” when demolition crews tore down the East Wing to make way for President Donald Trump’s planned ballroom, an administration official said in a memo made public Friday.
Contractors took pains to protect the White House residence during demolition, keeping heavy equipment at a safe distance and removing some pieces by hand, Joshua Fisher, director of the White House Office of Administration, wrote to the commission charged with approving plans for Trump’s ballroom. Some sections of the building were stabilized ahead of time, and vibration and crack movement were monitored, he wrote.
The National Capital Planning Commission, which is led by a top Trump aide, had requested more details about the demolition that began with little advance notice last fall. The agency has jurisdiction over construction and major renovations to government buildings in the region.
The East Wing demolition prompted a public outcry when it began without the independent reviews, congressional approval and public comment that are typical for even relatively minor modifications to historic buildings in Washington. The National Trust for Historic Preservation has sued to halt construction of the ballroom.
The memo documents the history of the East Wing dating back to Thomas Jefferson’s presidency and lays out the White House’s justification for tearing it down, saying it was not feasible to preserve it while meeting Trump’s goals for the project. The completed ballroom will include an improved visitors center for security screening and will lessen the need for road closures during major events, Fisher wrote.
Curators documented and preserved artwork, furniture and other items of historical significance, including “the East Wing cornerstone and plaque, movie theater furniture, the East Colonnade columns, the Porte-cochere columns, interior wood paneling, chandeliers, historic windows and doors, and other hardware and fixtures,” he wrote.
“Our goal is to ensure that some of these items will be integrated into the new structure,” Fisher added.
Engineers are studying whether the West Colonnade, which connects the White House residence to the West Wing offices, can support a second story that would make it more visually symmetrical with plans for a larger East Colonnade connecting to the ballroom, the memo said. No decisions have been made.
The White House also submitted the most detailed renderings of the ballroom published to date. It shows a massive new building that dwarfs the size of the demolished East Wing and matches the height of the historic White House mansion.
The project is scheduled for discussion during a March 5 meeting of the National Capital Planning Commission.

Zelensky Should Kick the US Out of Peace Negotiations

One of the most absurd phenomena in Russia’s war against Ukraine is the Trump-Witkoff-Kushner attempt to “negotiate peace” between Russia and Ukraine. Everything is wrong. US President Donald Trump is so obviously on Russia’s side. Trump has nothing to offer Ukraine, and Ukraine can only lose.
What does Trump want in Ukraine? Far too many people think that Trump represents the United States of America, when the reality is that he is a mafioso who only represents himself and his family and thinks of how he can make money. If he is loyal to any outside power, it is to Putin, whom he has praised so often for being a “genius,” as when he started the war against Ukraine. Outrageously, Trump has repeatedly accused former President Joe Biden and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, but never Putin, of having started this war. That should suffice to end any Ukrainian conversation with Trump.

Follow our coverage of the war on the @Kyivpost_official.
For those who did not understand his words, Trump stopped all military and financial assistance to Ukraine from January 2025, when he became US president. This was one of his first actions. Ever since, Trump has only put pressure on Ukraine and none on Russia. He invited the wanted war criminal Putin to the United States and received him personally with a red carpet, while he does not even send out the State Department protocol to meet President Zelensky when he arrives in the US. Trump tells us that he supports Russia and he has twice had the US vote against condemnations of Russia’s war in Ukraine in the United Nations.
Merz Pours Cold water on Macron’s Push for Putin Talks
Putin’s main demand appears to be that Ukraine give up the quarter of Donetsk oblast that Ukraine has heroically maintained since 2014. The US seems to do whatever it can to force Ukraine to give in to Putin.
Putin, who has arguably never been democratically elected, insists on new presidential elections in Ukraine, where millions are displaced or have been forced to leave the country because of Putin’s war. Putin’s obvious purpose is to weaken and destabilized Ukraine by forcing it through Trump to hold dubious elections. Tellingly, Trump and Witkoff support Putin’s demands, while not asking for any democratic elections in Russia.
Trump, Witkoff and Kushner seem to want to enlarge their fortunes in cooperation with Russia at the expense of Ukraine. Putin’s financial advisor Kirill Dmitiriev has apparently invented an idea of $12 trillion in US-Russia cooperation, while Russia is merely a $2 trillion economy. Only senile Trump can be dumb or mad enough to take such nonsense seriously, but none of his aides dare to say that the emperor is naked – and mentally deficient. This is both stupidity and attempted larceny.
Ultimately, Trump wants to get the Nobel Peace Prize, which he will of course never get since everything he does runs contrary to democracy, freedom and peace.
If Trump is so interested in “peace” in Ukraine, what is the US prepared to offer Ukraine? Nothing. Trump and the Republicans are not even discussing restarting the Biden administration’s generous financial and military support to Ukraine. The much-publicized US-Ukraine Reconstruction Fund is a minimal PR event with merely $75 million from the US Development Finance Corporation, while the EU just granted Ukraine $105 billion for the next two years. Trump’s USA is only a parasite on Ukraine’s body.
By contrast, Russia would get plenty. If the US forces Ukraine to give up its fortress line in the Donetsk region, Russia would finally gain what it has failed to win in 12 years of war. Putin could claim victory. Russia would gain a more advantageous position for the next round of its war of aggression against Ukraine. Putin wants to develop bilateral business relations with Trump and his billionaire friends, and most of all he wants the US to ease or even end its many sanctions against Russia, which will make it easier for him to attack Ukraine more forcefully.
It is obvious why Trump and Putin are interested in peace negotiations. Fut why would Ukraine play along? The only reason is that Ukrainians are very tired of war. Yet they would obtain nothing. Trump is unable to grant any security guarantees to Ukraine and he is far too unreliable and devious to be trusted. Thus, security guarantees from the US are not a serious topic. We don’t even know if NATO really exists after Putin’s fanboy Trump has taken over the US.
The simple truth is that Ukraine has nothing to gain from further “peace” negotiations with Russia and the US. There will be no real ceasefire, apart from if Russia needs a breathing space to mobilize resources for a worse attack. Ukraine must not give up well-defended territory to Russia. It must not legitimize Russia’s occupation of any Ukrainian territories. A messy semi-democratic election in the midst of the war would be worse than no elections. As long as Trump is US president, the US must unfortunately be seen as an anti-democratic supporter of Putin and Russia’s aggression.
Given that it is so obvious how harmful the current trilateral peace negotiations among Russia, the US and Ukraine are, it is quite obvious what should be done:

US courts have ruled 4,400 times that ICE jailed people illegally. It hasn’t stopped
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
WASHINGTON - Hundreds of judges around the US have ruled more than 4,400 times since October that US President Donald Trump’s administration is detaining immigrants unlawfully, a Reuters review of court records found.
The decisions amount to a sweeping legal rebuke of Mr Trump’s immigration crackdown. Yet the administration has continued jailing people indefinitely, even after courts ruled the policy was illegal.
“It is appalling that the government insists that this court should redefine or completely disregard the current law as it is clearly written,” US District Judge Thomas Johnston of West Virginia, an appointee of former president George W. Bush, wrote last week, ordering the release of a Venezuelan detainee in the state.
Most of the rulings centre on the Trump administration’s departure from a nearly three-decade-old interpretation of federal law that immigrants already living in the US could be released on bond while they pursue their cases in immigration court.
White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said the administration is “working to lawfully deliver on President Trump’s mandate to enforce federal immigration law”.
Soaring number of immigrant detainees
Under Mr Trump, the number of people in US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention reached about 68,000 in February, up about 75 per cent from when Mr Trump took office in 2025.
A conservative appeals court in New Orleans last week gave the Trump administration a victory in its drive to lock up more immigrants. Just because prior administrations did not fully utilise the law to detain people “does not mean they lacked the authority to do more”, US Circuit Judge Edith Jones wrote in a decision reversing rulings that led to the release of two Mexican men. Both remain free, their lawyer said.
Other appeals courts are set to take up the issue in the coming weeks.
Ms Tricia McLaughlin, a Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman, said the increase in lawsuits came as “no surprise” – “especially after many activist judges have attempted to thwart President Trump from fulfilling the American people’s mandate for mass deportations”.
The department did not respond to more specific questions about the cases and data findings in this story.
With few other legal paths to freedom, immigrant detainees have filed more than 20,200 federal lawsuits demanding their release since Mr Trump took office, a Reuters review of court dockets found, underscoring the sweeping impact of Mr Trump’s policy change.
In at least 4,421 cases, more than 400 federal judges ruled since the beginning of October that ICE is holding people illegally as it carries out its mass deportation campaign, Reuters found.
Other cases are pending, have been dismissed because the detainee was released, or were transferred to another judicial district, which would force immigrants to file a new case. Reuters was unable to determine how many cases were moved or re-filed.
Mr Joseph Thomas, an 18-year-old high school student from Venezuela, was arrested during a traffic stop in Wisconsin in late December, while riding with his father Elias Thomas on his Walmart delivery route.
The men are asylum seekers who entered the US in August 2023. Both are authorised to work, their lawyer Carrie Peltier said. Ms Peltier said they were stopped for “driving while brown”.
Within a month, judges ordered the release of father and son.
Chief US District Judge Patrick Schiltz – also a Bush appointee – ruled that Mr Joseph Thomas had been detained illegally and ordered his immediate release. In his ruling, he said Mr Thomas was not subject to mandatory detention, and called out a “lack of any evidence that ICE had a warrant when it detained Joseph while he was a passenger in his father’s car”.
US District Judge Eric Tostrud, a Trump appointee, ruled that Mr Elias Thomas was eligible for a bond hearing.
“This raises an issue of statutory interpretation that courts in this district have repeatedly considered and rejected, and it will be rejected here as well,” the district judge wrote in his order.
Mr Joseph Thomas is now taking classes online, afraid to return to school.
Landslide of lawsuits
Habeas corpus – Latin for “you shall have the body” – emerged in the English courts in the 1300s and is enshrined in the US Constitution. It provides a legal recourse for people the government has detained unlawfully.
Reuters counted habeas lawsuits by gathering the dockets of every publicly filed federal court case over more than two decades from Westlaw, a legal research tool that is a division of Thomson Reuters.
The records, combined with other court filings, offer the most comprehensive view to date of the scale of lawsuits moving through the US justice system and of the defeats for the administration.
Within the span of a few days in January, lawyers filed habeas petitions for Liam Conejo, a five-year-old Ecuadorean boy detained in the driveway of his Minnesota home; a Ukrainian man with a valid temporary humanitarian status who was detained on his way to work as a cable technician; a Salvadoran man married to a US citizen and father of a three-year-old autistic child who is also a US citizen; an Eritrean hospital worker with refugee status who was arrested after letting agents into his apartment complex; and a Venezuelan man who was arrested after dropping off his daughter at school.
None had criminal records.
Diverted lawyers, violated orders
The rush of lawsuits is forcing the US Justice Department offices to divert attorneys who would normally prosecute criminal cases to respond to habeas cases.
Using court dockets, Reuters found more than 700 Justice Department attorneys representing the government in immigration cases. Five of the attorneys each appeared on the dockets of more than 1,000 habeas cases.
Partly as a result of that legal logjam, judges have found that the government has left people locked up even after judges ordered their release.
In a court order issued in January in Minnesota, Judge Schiltz said the government had violated 96 orders in 76 cases. The US Attorney there, Mr Daniel Rosen, said in a filing two days later that the cases had created an “enormous burden” for government attorneys.
Similarly, US District Judge Nusrat Choudhury, an appointee of Democratic former president Joe Biden in New York, wrote in February that ICE violated two “clear and unambiguous orders” by flying a man to New Mexico for detention while falsely claiming he was in New Jersey and could be brought to a court hearing.
Justice Department spokeswoman Natalie Baldassarre said the administration “is complying with court orders and fully enforcing federal immigration law”.
“If rogue judges followed the law in adjudicating cases and respected the government’s obligation to properly prepare cases, there wouldn’t be an ‘overwhelming’ habeas caseload or concern over DHS following orders,” she said.
Legal hurdles
In New York, advocates have waited outside immigration court to connect detained immigrants with lawyers who can file same-day habeas claims – blocking their rapid transfer to a detention centre in another state.
On Jan 16, US District Judge J. Paul Oetken issued an emergency ruling for an Ecuadorean man who was detained at his court hearing, barring the government from moving him out of New York. On Jan 30, US District Judge Andrew Carter, who, like Judge Oetken, was appointed by Democratic former president Barack Obama, ordered his immediate release.
Still, many immigrants are not able to seek that relief. Some are not aware that they can file a habeas case. Others cannot find affordable lawyers.
Ms Judy Rall, the US citizen wife of a Venezuelan detainee who has spent almost a year at the Bluebonnet detention center in Texas, said she was quoted upwards of US$5,000 (S$6,300) to file a habeas petition, which she could not afford.
She and her husband have a pending immigration case based on their marriage, but the government has declined to release him while the case is being adjudicated. He has no criminal record, but the government has alleged, without providing evidence, that he has links to the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua.
In February, her lawyer offered to take on the habeas case for free.
“Our home burned down, and I had told them I needed him to come help,” she said. “I assume that is the reason.” REUTERS

Rubio tells Europe US wants renewed alliance – but on Trump’s terms

The US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, has described America as “a child of Europe” and made an emotional but highly conditional offer of a new partnership, insisting the two continents belong together.
In a much-anticipated speech at the annual Munich Security Conference, he said the US was intent on building a new world order, adding “while we are prepared, if necessary, to do this alone, it is our preference and it is our hope to do this together with you, our friends here in Europe”. The US and Europe, he said “belong together”.
Admitting the Americans may come across as a little direct and urgent, he said this was only because the US was profoundly concerned by the fate of Europe, and knew their destinies were intertwined.
Overall the tone of the speech was greeted with relief by the delegates in the hall, although many pointed out Rubio was not offering a partnership of equals, but an alliance largely framed in Donald Trump’s terms.
In offering the hand of friendship, in sharp contrast to the tone adopted by the US vice president, JD Vance, at the same conference last year, Rubio made clear the US was not shifting on its fundamental approach.
He said the US under Trump did not want a Europe that was weak or shackled by guilt or shame.
He continued: “We in America have no interest in being polite and orderly caretakers of the west’s managed decline. We do not seek to separate, but to revitalise an old friendship and renew the greatest civilisation in human history. What we want is a reinvigorated alliance that recognises that what has ailed our societies is not just a set of bad policies, but a malaise of hopelessness and complacency.”
He also tried to bind Europe into Trump’s ideology by saying Europe and the US had made the same mistakes together, including bowing down to “a climate cult”, expanding welfare states at the expense of national defence, embracing globalisation and “a world without borders in which everyone would be a citizen of the world”.
Gaining control of national borders was not an expression of xenophobia or hate, he said. “It is a fundamental act of national sovereignty. And the failure to do so is not just an abdication of one of our most basic duties owed to our people, it is an urgent threat to the fabric of our societies and the survival of our civilisation itself.”
He said in rebuilding the global order it would not be necessary to dismantle institutions such as the UN but to reform and rebuild them, arguing it had been Trump, not the UN, that was solving crises in Gaza and Ukraine.
“In a perfect world, all of these problems and more would be solved by diplomats and strongly worded resolutions. But we do not live in a perfect world. And we cannot continue to allow those who blatantly and openly threaten our citizens and endanger our global stability to shield themselves behind abstractions of international law which they themselves routinely violate.
“This is the path that President Trump and the United States has embarked upon. It is the path we ask you here in Europe to join us on.”
Rubio blamed “a foolish but voluntary transformation” of western economies that “left us dependent on others for our needs and dangerously vulnerable to crisis. Mass migration is not, was not, some fringe concern of little consequence. It was and continues to be a crisis which is transforming and destabilising societies all across the west.”
Throughout the speech he showered praise on Europe’s history, but in so doing raised questions whether Europe had the capacity to join the US’s rebuilding of the world.
He said little in his speech about Ukraine, after he skipped a meeting with European leaders on Friday night pointing to scheduling issues. But he said he believed the two sides had narrowed the items of difference, while the remaining issues were the hardest ones.

One year after JD Vance's hostile speech against Europe in Munich, what remains?

The German diplomat placed a hand on his chest, as if struck by history itself. On the stage at the Munich Security Conference on February 16, 2025, before an audience of ministers, military officials and geopolitical experts, Christoph Heusgen broke down. Tears welled in his eyes as the former diplomatic adviser to chancellor Angela Merkel, and former ambassador to the United Nations, bid farewell.
This conference, sometimes compared to the Cannes Film Festival for the Western diplomatic and military elite, had been under his chairmanship since 2022. But inside the Bayerischer Hof, the Art Deco palace that hosts the event, the audience understood that the head of the conference was also bidding farewell to a world in which Europe and the United States jointly claimed to uphold peace and democracy. "This becomes difficult," said Heusgen, his voice trembling, fearing that Europe might no longer share "a common value base" with its American ally.
Two days earlier, in less than 20 minutes, US Vice President JD Vance stunned Europe, causing a rift in the transatlantic relationship. "The threat that I worry the most about vis-à-vis Europe is not Russia, it's not China, it's not any other external actor. And what I worry about is the threat from within, the retreat of Europe from some of its most fundamental values – values shared with the United States of America," declared Vance, in a speech filled with fantasies and falsehoods about violations of freedom of expression in Europe.
The audience froze. Their body language, more than their words, revealed the shock that gripped the room as if it had been paralyzed. The floor seemed to give way beneath the feet of these experts, who were used to the restraint typically shown at major summits. "Not acceptable!" choked out Boris Pistorius, the German defense minister, from the front rows.

Drone strikes claim lives in Ukraine and Russia ahead of fresh peace talks
Attacks on Ukraine’s Black Sea port city of Odesa and in the border region of Bryansk have killed two people

Drone strikes claimed lives in both Ukraine and Russia on Saturday, casting a grim shadow over the prospect of fresh peace talks scheduled for next week.
An elderly woman was killed when a Russian drone struck a residential building in the Black Sea port city of Odesa, Ukraine’s State Emergency Service confirmed.
Meanwhile, in Russia, a civilian died in a Ukrainian drone attack on a car in the border region of Bryansk, according to regional Governor Alexander Bogomaz. These incidents followed a Ukrainian missile strike on the Russian border city of Belgorod the previous day, which killed two people and wounded five, as reported by Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov.
Against this backdrop of escalating hostilities, a new round of US-brokered discussions between envoys from Russia and Ukraine is set to take place in Geneva next week.
The talks, confirmed by officials in Moscow and Kyiv on Friday, will occur just days before the fourth anniversary of Russia’s full-scale invasion of its neighbour. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov stated the discussions would be held on Tuesday and Wednesday, a schedule corroborated by Dmytro Lytvyn, communications adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.
The negotiations unfold amid relentless fighting along the roughly 1,250-kilometre front line, persistent Russian bombardment of Ukrainian civilian areas and its power grid, and Kyiv’s almost daily long-range drone attacks on military-related assets within Russian territory.
Previous US-led efforts to find common ground, including two recent rounds of talks in Abu Dhabi, have failed to resolve contentious issues such as the future of Ukraine’s Donbas industrial heartland, which is largely occupied by Russian forces.
Speaking at the annual Munich Security Conference on Saturday, President Zelenskyy expressed profound gratitude to American and European allies for their provision of air defence systems, which he said protect vital infrastructure like power plants and "save lives." He emphasised the constant threat, stating: "Russian attacks happen almost every night in Ukraine and at least once a week, massive strikes."
He added: "Without you Americans, Europeans, and everyone who stands with us, it would have been very, very difficult to hold on." Mr Zelenskyy reiterated his conviction that security guarantees for Ukraine must precede any peace agreement with Russia. He also noted last week that the United States had set a June deadline for Ukraine and Russia to reach a deal, though previous deadlines given by Donald Trump have largely passed without consequence.

US Congress delegation's participation in MSC cancelled due to partial shutdown in USA - Stefanishyna
The American delegation’s participation in the Munich Security Conference (MSC) has been cancelled due to the freezing of funding for the US Department of Homeland Security, Ukrainian Ambassador to the USA Olha Stefanishyna announced.
"Since midnight on February 14, the work of federal agencies in the United States has been partially suspended due to Congress’ failure to pass the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) budget," she wrote on Telegram on Saturday morning.
According to Stefanishyna, it oversees more than 20 agencies, including ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement), CBP (Customs and Border Protection), and FEMA (Federal Emergency Management Agency).
Stefanishyna noted that the key consequence of this is the cancellation of the Congressional delegation’s participation in the Munich Security Conference due to regulatory restrictions.
She also stated that the House of Representatives cannot travel on official business until the issue is resolved.
The ambassador added that ICE and CBP are operating as usual, and their funding is already included in US President Donald Trump’s "One, Big, Beautiful Bill" (passed in the summer of 2025).
Stefanishyna added that the Congress will return to work on February 23, but may convene earlier—members have been warned to be ready to vote within eight hours of the Senate’s decision. The president’s annual State of the Union address is scheduled for February 24.

IMF eases conditions for new US$8.1bn Ukraine lending programme
The International Monetary Fund has agreed to drop the prior actions required for a new US$8.1 billion lending programme for Ukraine, removing requirements on VAT for sole traders, duties on parcels, a tax on digital platforms and the retention of the wartime levy.
Source: Ukrainian Prime Minister Yuliia Svyrydenko speaking to journalists, as reported by Suspilne, Ukraine's public broadcaster
Details: Svyrydenko said the new programme is expected to be considered at the next meeting of the IMF's executive board. She said the changes were made following a visit to Kyiv by the Fund's managing director, Kristalina Georgieva. Under the revised agreement with the IMF, all four conditions now need to be completed after the executive board approves the new programme.
Quote: "The most sensitive issues in the IMF programme are taxes on individual entrepreneurs. Details matter. In our work with the IMF, we agreed to raise the VAT threshold for sole traders to UAH 4 million [US$92,800]. This is the maximum threshold for VAT on goods in Europe. This means the changes will not affect two-thirds of sole traders in Ukraine."
More details: Svyrydenko said the government plans to submit one consolidated tax bill to the Verkhovna Rada (Ukrainian parliament) covering digital platforms, parcels, and the retention of the wartime levy after martial law ends.
There will be further discussions with the IMF on when the changes will take effect.
Background:
- On 14 February, Svyrydenko also said that the provision of €90 billion to Ukraine by the EU is linked to the approval of a new four-year IMF programme, which is expected in February.
- It was also reported that the IMF Board of Directors may approve a new four-year Extended Fund Facility (EFF) programme for Ukraine in February, but this will depend primarily on whether Ukraine has fulfilled the previously agreed prior actions.

Edith Bowman begs for return of case containing grandad’s ashes
The presenter has urged anyone who has seen ‘an old school case that’s green, dark green with brown straps’ to get in touch

Scottish broadcaster Edith Bowman has issued a tearful plea for the return of a stolen suitcase containing her grandfather’s ashes. The bag was reportedly taken during a train journey from London Paddington to Kemble, a village in the Cotswolds, on Friday.
The 52-year-old initially took to Instagram stories to express her frustration. In her first video, she stated: "I just got on a train at London Paddington – 9.32 am to Cheltenham and got off at Kemble, and some f***** has stolen my case."
She urged the individual responsible to "return it to the nearest station," adding: "There’s CCTV, so we’re on the case and British Transport Police is being informed."
Ms Bowman’s tone shifted to distress as she realised the profound sentimental value of the suitcase’s contents. Choking back tears in a subsequent post, she revealed: "I’ve just realised what’s in my bag is a jewellery box, and in that jewellery box are some really lovely personal things. In particular, a pinkie ring that’s got my grandad’s ashes in it."
The presenter appealed for anyone who might have seen someone disembarking a train at Didcot Parkway, Reading or Swindon with "an old school case that’s green, dark green with brown straps" to get in touch. She later shared a photo of the distinctive luggage, specifying potential sightings on a GWR train at Reading (09.58), Didcot Parkway (10.11), and Swindon (10.30).
Edith shared a profound bond with ‘Grandad Bowman’, spending weekends at his Fife hotel as her parents worked.
Speaking to The Guardian in 2015 she said: "I adored Grandad Bowman. He looked after me at weekends when Mum and Dad were working, and he’d make me oatcakes smothered with Dairy Lea, and a cup of hot milk, before reading me bedtime stories.”
At seven, Edith's grandfather suffered a stroke, leaving him only able to use one arm. Not expected to survive, he remarkably lived another 27 years.
Edith was present during his final moments, a difficult memory she nonetheless cherishes. "We were at a cousin’s wedding when we got the call to say he’d been taken into hospital. As he lay dying, I collected some pictures and candles to brighten up his room, and played his favourite Al Jolson songs. It was hard, but I’m glad I was there."
Ms Bowman is widely recognised for her work hosting BBC Radio 1 shows from 2003 to 2014. She currently presents the podcast Soundtracking, which launched in 2016.

Ukrainian forces strike Russian landing craft in Crimea
The General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces announced this on Facebook, Ukrinform reports.
As part of systematic measures to reduce the offensive potential of the Russian aggressor, Ukrainian units continue to strike important enemy military targets.
It was confirmed that on February 12, near the settlement of Novoozerne in Crimea, a Russian BK-16 transport-landing craft was successfully hit.
Also on February 12, near Hvardiiske in Crimea, an RSP-10 radar station was struck.
Near Prymorsk, in the temporarily occupied part of the Zaporizhzhia region, a communications hub of the Russian invaders was struck the same day.
In addition, on February 13, in the area of Novoekonomichne in the temporarily occupied territory of the Donetsk region, an enemy ammunition depot was struck.
Russian losses and the extent of the damage are being clarified.

Peace talks possible only after ceasefire – Poroshenko
Ukrainian MP and leader of the European Solidarity party, Petro Poroshenko, believes that peace talks are possible only after a ceasefire is reached, the political party's website reported on Saturday.
Poroshenko expressed belief that the war can and should be ended this year, but emphasized the need for real security guarantees, in particular, the presence of NATO troops in Ukraine.
"I firmly believe that the strategy of immediately heading towards negotiations on a peace agreement is meaningless. We need to divide this into two stages. Stage one: we need to ensure a ceasefire. We have very effective tools for this, because the first step of the United States and the European Union on secondary sanctions for countries that continue to buy Russian energy resources has shown its effectiveness," he emphasized in a comment to the Polish television channel Slawa TV during the Munich Security Conference.
The politician noted that secondary US and EU sanctions against countries that purchase Russian energy have already led to a drop in oil prices, and the attack on the "shadow fleet" has changed Moscow's position.
"We have two tools, Chancellor Merz said, including during our meeting. The first is sanctions that cut off Putin's ability to finance the war. The second is weapons that enable Ukraine to respond to attacks on civilian infrastructure," the politician clarified.
According to him, the European Union should be a full participant in the negotiations, because it is the one that finances the majority of the arms supply. "Nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine, but nothing without Europe," Poroshenko concluded.

Hidden killers: Families’ horror after children as young as five die in unexploded mine blasts
Ali Mohammed Al-Abrash was having breakfast while his niece and nephews played around outside - but after they picked up a scrap piece of metal, the unthinkable happened
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
Zahraa, Muhammad, Ali and Ibrahim thought they were playing with a harmless piece of scrap metal.
Within minutes, five-year-old Zahraa and six-year-old Muhammad had been killed.
Ali, 3, and Ibrahim, 12, were being rushed to the nearest hospital in northwest Syria, bodies pierced by pieces of shrapnel from an unexploded munition left in their village by forces belonging to deposed dictator Bashar al-Assad.
“We were in complete shock. We didn’t even realise what was happening. We couldn't understand how tragic it was,” recalls their uncle, Ali Mohammed Al-Abrash.
Just six days after the explosion, he spoke to The Independent about the heartache that has rippled through the community of Maardabsa, south of Saraqib.
“The roads, the village, everywhere reminds us of our beloved Zahraa and Muhammad,” he says, a voice strained with emotion as he spoke from the tent in which the family shelters.
With their father abroad, Ali said he was like a father to the two children who brought “joy and happiness to the whole family”.
It is a story all too common in the north, northwest and central regions regions of Syria, ravaged by years of war and littered with thousands of unexploded munitions.
The abandoned weapons pose an ever present threat to civilians even during a period of relative peace.
Since the fall of the Assad regime 14 months ago, around 10 Syrians have been killed by unexploded ordnance each week. Nearly one third of those killed have been children.
The explosion in Maardabsa occurred as Ali was eating breakfast on Friday 6 February. He rushed outside to find all four children lying on the ground and bleeding, two already dead, two with severe shrapnel injuries.
“They were just playing with scraps, pieces of metal,” Ali says. “One of them hit the munition with something. That's how it exploded. They were just playing with it.”
The children had found what is now believed to have been an unexploded cluster munition, a widely-banned weapon which was used by government forces in northwest Syria - and has a detonation failure rate of around 30 per cent.
In late January, Syrians suffered one of the deadliest weeks for mine-related casualties since the Assad regime, according to the latest figures from the UN’s Mine Action Area of Responsibility (MA AoR).
Seventeen people were killed, including seven children, and another 16 were injured, including five children.
This brings the total number of casualties since 8 December 2024 to 1,734, including 633 deaths. Children make up 185 of the deaths and 453 of the injuries, across the 959 incidents.
The majority of the incidents took place on agricultural land, where Syrians are returning to farm the fields they were forced to abandon due to the civil war.
A huge spike was recorded early last year when many Syrians returned for the first time.
But in the coming months numbers could again rise as farmers begin to harvest their crops in spring, explains Simon Jackson, the Syria Programme Manager for The Halo Trust, an organisation with a mission to remove unexploded ordnance from conflict-ridden areas.
“We’re getting back into the prime cultivating period. We’ve seen it in the north west, you can see where farmers have been cultivating their land and suddenly there’s a really defined line where people stop.
“Usually, somewhere along that line, you see the crater of where there’s been an accident,” he says.
Many know the risks, but with a food production crisis in Syria, families are “driven by desperation” to cultivate their land nonetheless.
Children, many who are heavily involved in farming activities, particularly for subsistence level farmers, are under particular risk.
A report in December found that deaths and injuries from landmines and unexploded ordnance around the globe hit a four-year high in 2024, driven by conflicts in Syria and Myanmar.
More than 6,000 incidents were recorded that year, including 1,945 deaths and 4,325 injuries, the highest annual total since 2020, according to the Landmine Monitor 2025 report.
Nearly 90% of victims were civilians, with almost half women and children.

African Union opens summit amid youth anger over ‘old leaders’

As the African Union gathers for its annual summit in Ethiopia to discuss the future of the continent’s some 1.4 billion people, frustration is mounting among young Africans.
Set up to "promote the unity and solidarity of the African States," analysts say the African Union is facing a legitimacy crisis among the continent's youth after failing to meet their expectations. African countries are battling military coups, disputed elections and protests inspired by hardship worsened by foreign aid cuts.
Africa has the youngest population in the world with more than 400 million people aged 15 to 35 years old. But it is also home to several of the world's oldest and longest-serving leaders - a paradox that has contributed to an upsurge in coups.
With a young population set to double by 2050, it is the only rapidly growing region where its people are getting poorer. In different countries and on social media, African youths view the AU as a bloc of old leaders and one which sees their interests as less of a priority.
The organization has missed opportunities to be people-centered and citizen-driven and has instead focused largely on governments and leaders, said Liesl Louw-Vaudran, a senior analyst with the Crisis Group.
"What the youth is really asking and why people are frustrated is because this is not an African Union for citizens. It's not a people-driven African Union," Louw-Vaudran added.
As several African countries held elections for new presidents over the last year, there was a clear pattern of sidelined opposition candidates, disputed results and protests from mostly young voters after incumbents were reelected.
Despite the election outcomes, the AU was often accused of being quick to side with reelected incumbents and slow to call out flawed processes.
As authorities in Uganda shut down the internet and clamped down on the opposition during the East African country's presidential election in January, the African Union Commission issued a statement "commending" the conduct of the poll. A day after, the AU election observer mission issued a preliminary report noting "reports of harassment, intimidation and arrest of opposition leaders, candidates, supporters' media and civic society actors" in the election.
The AU social media post commending the election enraged many youths, with one person retorting: "Dictatorship club has spoken."
One key challenge the AU has battled with over the years is weak enforcement of resolutions, according to Macharia Munene, a professor of history at the United States International University in Nairobi. And that's because "not all members meet their dues or fully accept what is generally decided," he said.
At the 39th African Union Summit being held in Ethiopia's capital of Addis Ababa on Saturday and Sunday, the theme is water and sanitation. Discussions will feature the continent's response to climate change and humanitarian crises following foreign aid cuts from international partners such as the United States.
Observers say the AU Summit will provide an opportunity to align continental priorities with international partners, especially at a time of discussions around a 'new world order' stirred by U.S. President Donald Trump with foreign leaders signaling shifting global alliances.
Still, critics urge the African Union to look inward by paying closer attention to the continent's most pressing challenges and doing more to hold leaders accountable when they fail to meet expectations.
In Nigeria's capital of Abuja, resident Chima Ekwueme said the African Union does not care about holding leaders accountable, citing Nigeria's deadly security crises and economic hardship despite its rich mineral wealth.
"They are there for their own interests," Ekwueme, 32, said of the AU. "In Nigeria, we have all it takes to put things in order (but) look at how difficult things are and where is the AU."

Rubio Tells Europe It Belongs with US, Calls it to Join Trump’s Fight

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio sought to reassure a nervous Europe on Saturday, saying that Washington wanted to “revitalise” the transatlantic alliance so that a strong Europe could help the US on its mission of global “renewal”.
Speaking at a security conference in Munich after months of turmoil in US-European relations sparked by US President Donald Trump’s vows to seize Greenland and his often derisive remarks about Washington’s allies, Washington’s top diplomat struck a markedly soothing tone.

“We do not seek to separate, but to revitalise an old friendship and renew the greatest civilisation in human history,” Rubio said. “What we want is a reinvigorated alliance.”
“We want Europe to be strong,” Rubio said, adding that the continent and the US “belong together.”
The United States will be “driven by a vision of a future as proud, as sovereign, and as vital as our civilisation’s past,” he said.
“It is our hope to do this together with you, our friends here in Europe,” he said.
He echoed Trump administration’s oft-stated assertion that immigration was a threat, saying that “mass migration” was “a crisis which is transforming and destabilising societies all across the West.”
“We want allies who are proud of their culture and of their heritage, who understand that we are heirs to the same great and noble civilisation and together with us are willing and able to defend it.”

“Acting together in this way, we will not just help recover a sane foreign policy... It will restore to us a clear sense of ourselves. It will restore a place in the world, and in so doing, it will rebuke and deter the forces of civilisational erasure that today menace both America and Europe alike.”
- Change in tone -
Rubio’s speech marked a sharp contrast to that of US Vice President JD Vance a year ago, when he used the same stage to attack European policies on immigration and free speech, shocking European allies.
Aside from the immigration issue, Rubio otherwise largely avoided the MAGA flashpoint and culture war issues that German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said Friday, had deepened a “rift” between US and Europe.
US-Europe ties were further strained by the Trump administration’s new National Security Strategy, which launched an unprecedented attack against Europeans, charging that the continent was threatened with “civilisational decline”.
Ties plunged further last month when Trump stepped up threats to annex Greenland, an autonomous territory of NATO member Denmark, forcing European nations to stand firm in protest.
- Europe security --
European leaders who have gathered at the Munich Security Conference have pledged to shoulder more of the burden of shared NATO defences.
Key leaders have pushed the message that this is essential for Europe to counter a hostile Russia, with NATO chief Mark Rutte saying that “a strong Europe in a strong NATO means that the transatlantic bond will be stronger than ever”.
European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen told the gather on Saturday that “Europe needs to step up and has to take on its responsibility” for its security and called for closer ties with Britain, saying “10 years on from Brexit our futures are as bound as ever.”
British leader Keir Starmer was expected to tell the conference that Europe is “a sleeping giant” and must rely less on the United States for its defence.
French President Emmanuel Macron said on Friday that “this is the right time for a strong Europe,” that would be “clear in the support of Ukraine” and “building its own architecture of security”.
- Ukraine war in focus -
The high-powered Munich meeting of government leaders, diplomats, defence and intelligence chiefs comes shortly before Russia’s full-scale war on Ukraine is set to enter its fifth gruelling year.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who has been in Munich since Friday and meeting multiple allies, was expected to address the meeting on Saturday. No Russian officials have been invited.
At the White House on Friday, Trump urged him to “get moving” to end the war. “Russia wants to make a deal... He has to move,” the US leader said.
But Rubio said that “We don’t know if the Russians are serious about ending the war.”
Macron said a new framework was needed to deal with “an aggressive Russia” once the fighting in Ukraine ends.
“If it makes sense to talk, we are willing to talk,” said Merz, but he also charged that “Russia is not yet willing to talk seriously”.

MUNICH, Germany — European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen on Saturday told the Munich Security Conference that the EU should get serious about its own mutual defense clause.
Article 42.7 of the EU treaty has been floated as a Plan B for Europe's security, in a world where there is worry about the U.S. commitment to NATO — despite vociferous pushback from the White House.
Like NATO's once-ironclad Article 5, which has been repeatedly undermined by U.S. President Donald Trump, the EU clause obliges countries to provide “aid and assistance by all the means in their power” if another nation in the bloc is attacked.

US courts have ruled 4,400 times that ICE jailed people illegally. It hasn’t stopped
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
WASHINGTON - Hundreds of judges around the US have ruled more than 4,400 times since October that US President Donald Trump’s administration is detaining immigrants unlawfully, a Reuters review of court records found.
The decisions amount to a sweeping legal rebuke of Mr Trump’s immigration crackdown. Yet the administration has continued jailing people indefinitely, even after courts ruled the policy was illegal.
“It is appalling that the government insists that this court should redefine or completely disregard the current law as it is clearly written,” US District Judge Thomas Johnston of West Virginia, an appointee of former president George W. Bush, wrote last week, ordering the release of a Venezuelan detainee in the state.
Most of the rulings centre on the Trump administration’s departure from a nearly three-decade-old interpretation of federal law that immigrants already living in the US could be released on bond while they pursue their cases in immigration court.
White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said the administration is “working to lawfully deliver on President Trump’s mandate to enforce federal immigration law”.
Soaring number of immigrant detainees
Under Mr Trump, the number of people in US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention reached about 68,000 in February, up about 75 per cent from when Mr Trump took office in 2025.
A conservative appeals court in New Orleans last week gave the Trump administration a victory in its drive to lock up more immigrants. Just because prior administrations did not fully utilise the law to detain people “does not mean they lacked the authority to do more”, US Circuit Judge Edith Jones wrote in a decision reversing rulings that led to the release of two Mexican men. Both remain free, their lawyer said.
Other appeals courts are set to take up the issue in the coming weeks.
Ms Tricia McLaughlin, a Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman, said the increase in lawsuits came as “no surprise” – “especially after many activist judges have attempted to thwart President Trump from fulfilling the American people’s mandate for mass deportations”.
The department did not respond to more specific questions about the cases and data findings in this story.
With few other legal paths to freedom, immigrant detainees have filed more than 20,200 federal lawsuits demanding their release since Mr Trump took office, a Reuters review of court dockets found, underscoring the sweeping impact of Mr Trump’s policy change.
In at least 4,421 cases, more than 400 federal judges ruled since the beginning of October that ICE is holding people illegally as it carries out its mass deportation campaign, Reuters found.
Other cases are pending, have been dismissed because the detainee was released, or were transferred to another judicial district, which would force immigrants to file a new case. Reuters was unable to determine how many cases were moved or re-filed.
Mr Joseph Thomas, an 18-year-old high school student from Venezuela, was arrested during a traffic stop in Wisconsin in late December, while riding with his father Elias Thomas on his Walmart delivery route.
The men are asylum seekers who entered the US in August 2023. Both are authorised to work, their lawyer Carrie Peltier said. Ms Peltier said they were stopped for “driving while brown”.
Within a month, judges ordered the release of father and son.
Chief US District Judge Patrick Schiltz – also a Bush appointee – ruled that Mr Joseph Thomas had been detained illegally and ordered his immediate release. In his ruling, he said Mr Thomas was not subject to mandatory detention, and called out a “lack of any evidence that ICE had a warrant when it detained Joseph while he was a passenger in his father’s car”.
US District Judge Eric Tostrud, a Trump appointee, ruled that Mr Elias Thomas was eligible for a bond hearing.
“This raises an issue of statutory interpretation that courts in this district have repeatedly considered and rejected, and it will be rejected here as well,” the district judge wrote in his order.
Mr Joseph Thomas is now taking classes online, afraid to return to school.
Landslide of lawsuits
Habeas corpus – Latin for “you shall have the body” – emerged in the English courts in the 1300s and is enshrined in the US Constitution. It provides a legal recourse for people the government has detained unlawfully.
Reuters counted habeas lawsuits by gathering the dockets of every publicly filed federal court case over more than two decades from Westlaw, a legal research tool that is a division of Thomson Reuters.
The records, combined with other court filings, offer the most comprehensive view to date of the scale of lawsuits moving through the US justice system and of the defeats for the administration.
Within the span of a few days in January, lawyers filed habeas petitions for Liam Conejo, a five-year-old Ecuadorean boy detained in the driveway of his Minnesota home; a Ukrainian man with a valid temporary humanitarian status who was detained on his way to work as a cable technician; a Salvadoran man married to a US citizen and father of a three-year-old autistic child who is also a US citizen; an Eritrean hospital worker with refugee status who was arrested after letting agents into his apartment complex; and a Venezuelan man who was arrested after dropping off his daughter at school.
None had criminal records.
Diverted lawyers, violated orders
The rush of lawsuits is forcing the US Justice Department offices to divert attorneys who would normally prosecute criminal cases to respond to habeas cases.
Using court dockets, Reuters found more than 700 Justice Department attorneys representing the government in immigration cases. Five of the attorneys each appeared on the dockets of more than 1,000 habeas cases.
Partly as a result of that legal logjam, judges have found that the government has left people locked up even after judges ordered their release.
In a court order issued in January in Minnesota, Judge Schiltz said the government had violated 96 orders in 76 cases. The US Attorney there, Mr Daniel Rosen, said in a filing two days later that the cases had created an “enormous burden” for government attorneys.
Similarly, US District Judge Nusrat Choudhury, an appointee of Democratic former president Joe Biden in New York, wrote in February that ICE violated two “clear and unambiguous orders” by flying a man to New Mexico for detention while falsely claiming he was in New Jersey and could be brought to a court hearing.
Justice Department spokeswoman Natalie Baldassarre said the administration “is complying with court orders and fully enforcing federal immigration law”.
“If rogue judges followed the law in adjudicating cases and respected the government’s obligation to properly prepare cases, there wouldn’t be an ‘overwhelming’ habeas caseload or concern over DHS following orders,” she said.
Legal hurdles
In New York, advocates have waited outside immigration court to connect detained immigrants with lawyers who can file same-day habeas claims – blocking their rapid transfer to a detention centre in another state.
On Jan 16, US District Judge J. Paul Oetken issued an emergency ruling for an Ecuadorean man who was detained at his court hearing, barring the government from moving him out of New York. On Jan 30, US District Judge Andrew Carter, who, like Judge Oetken, was appointed by Democratic former president Barack Obama, ordered his immediate release.
Still, many immigrants are not able to seek that relief. Some are not aware that they can file a habeas case. Others cannot find affordable lawyers.
Ms Judy Rall, the US citizen wife of a Venezuelan detainee who has spent almost a year at the Bluebonnet detention center in Texas, said she was quoted upwards of US$5,000 (S$6,300) to file a habeas petition, which she could not afford.
She and her husband have a pending immigration case based on their marriage, but the government has declined to release him while the case is being adjudicated. He has no criminal record, but the government has alleged, without providing evidence, that he has links to the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua.
In February, her lawyer offered to take on the habeas case for free.
“Our home burned down, and I had told them I needed him to come help,” she said. “I assume that is the reason.” REUTERS

France opens five probes into contaminated baby formula
French prosecutors have launched five investigations, including into Swiss food giant Nestlé, after batches of infant milk were found to contain cereulide, a toxin produced by the bacterium Bacillus cereus.

The five investigations, covering dairy products from Nestlé, Lactalis, Danone, Babybio and La Marque en moins, have been handed to the Central Office for Combating Environmental and Public Health Offences (Oclaesp) and the National Veterinary and Plant Health Investigation Brigade (BNEVP), the Paris prosecutor’s office said on Friday.
+ Read about a management meltdown at Nestlé
The proceedings were opened on January 30. Investigators are looking into suspected offences including the mislabelling of products that could pose a risk to human health, failures by manufacturers to launch recall procedures for potentially harmful goods and endangering life by breaching legal safety or due‑diligence obligations.
Complex investigation
“The Paris prosecutor’s office took over the case because of the large number of complaints filed across the country and the technical complexity of the investigation, particularly around regulatory and public‑health issues,” said Public Prosecutor Laure Beccuau.
Further inquiries will continue under the authority of local prosecutors, mainly in Angers, Bordeaux and Blois. Investigators are seeking to determine whether there is a direct link between the consumption of contaminated formula and the deaths or health problems reported in infants.

Foodwatch files tainted baby formula complaint involving Nestlé
The baby formula scandal has been unfolding since mid‑December. After Nestlé issued an initial recall of dozens of batches in around 60 countries, including Switzerland, over concerns about possible traces of cereulide, other manufacturers soon followed. Major producers such as Danone and Lactalis, as well as smaller companies in this rapidly growing market, launched similar recalls across the globe.
In France, three infant deaths have been reported, along with about 15 hospitalisations involving infants who consumed dairy products covered by the recalls. However, no causal link has been confirmed at this stage, and investigations are still under way.
Industry sources say the contamination stems from an oil supplied by a company in China, which is used as an ingredient in milk powder. Cereulide can trigger vomiting and diarrhoea shortly after consumption.

US does not seek split with Europe, but ‘revitalised’ alliance: Rubio

"We do not seek to separate, but to revitalise an old friendship and renew the greatest civilisation in human history," Rubio said as he addressed a security conference in Munich on Saturday. "What we want is a reinvigorated alliance."
"We want Europe to be strong. We believe that Europe must survive," Rubio said, adding that the continent and the US "belong together."
The United States will be "driven by a vision of a future as proud, as sovereign, and as vital as our civilisation's past," he said.
"And while we are prepared, if necessary, to do this alone, it is our preference, and it is our hope to do this together with you, our friends here in Europe," he said.

We don't know if the Russians are serious about ending the war, Rubio said in his speech on Saturday. "They say they are. We're going to continue to test it."

According to a source within the German government, Merz and Rubio met at the conference on Friday to discuss Ukraine, the status of negotiations with Russia, and further support for the country — particularly in terms of military aid
They also discussed Europe's role in NATO, and "Rubio praised Germany's steps to strengthen the alliance", the source added.
Rubio: UN playing 'no role' in resolving conflicts
Rubio also said the UN had played "virtually no role" in resolving the conflicts and called for global institutions to be reformed.
"The United Nations still has tremendous potential to be a tool for good in the world," he told the Munich Security Conference.
"But we cannot ignore that, today, on the most pressing matters before us, it has no answers and has played virtually no role. It could not solve the war in Gaza."

Nose for trouble: Italian town seeks ‘odour evaluators’ to sniff out bad smells

19:00:50 KST

An Italian town is seeking a crew of sniffers to identify bad smells in its quest to improve air quality.
Bruno Beltrame, the mayor of Brendola, a small town in the northern province of Vicenza, said he began the recruitment campaign for six “odour evaluators” after complaints about “unpleasant smells” from people living in neighbourhoods close to industrial zones.
The main prerequisite for the role is not to suffer from allergies or respiratory diseases such as asthma. The recruits must have a car and a smartphone, which will be used to record the odour data on a dedicated app.
Led by a firm specialising in odour measurement, they will be trained in how to distinguish between smells, for example those typically emitted from factories or which originate from industrial waste or sewage.
They will then be given the task of going to targeted areas to carry out sensory assessments. If an unsavoury smell is detected, they will spend time sniffing the air before recording their perceptions on the app.
The ultimate goal of the initiative, which is expected to last six months, is to trace the origin of the odours.
“We did a similar investigation about five years ago in an industrial area close to where the bad smells are coming from now,” said Beltrame. “From that, we were able to identify the companies emitting the odours. Now we are broadening the geographical scope to find out if the same companies have resumed the release of bad smells or if there are different ones.”
Vicenza falls within the Po valley, a huge geographical area straddling the provinces around the Veneto region as well as Piedmont, Lombardy and Emilia-Romagna. The Po Valley is among the worst areas in Europe for air pollution.
“We’re at the end of the valley just before the Alpine foothills,” said Beltrame. “So it’s a huge undertaking because these areas are among the most productive, but they’re also the ones at risk of creating pollution.”
He said several province-wide initiatives work continuously to improve air and water quality. “We have a lot of protocols in place, and if businesses break the rules they are heavily fined.”
Brendola is home to about 4,000 people who over the years have become more committed to protecting their environment. Beltrame said: “Whereas previously they might have been a bit careless, today they are more inclined to want to improve their quality of life and surrounding environment. So when they see abandoned waste or smell foul air, they report it. We’re happy because it allows us to promptly intervene in order to prevent potentially worse catastrophes.”
The local authority initially advertised for the jobs, which are paid, before Christmas but there were no takers, “perhaps because it was published so close to the holidays, many might have turned their noses up,” said Beltrame.
But since reposting the advert on Facebook this week, about a dozen people applied. “They were mostly university students who have a few hours to spare around their studies, and they seem very keen.”

‘It still rankles’: the French town living in the shadow of being an ayatollah’s refuge

Every February, members of the Iranian diaspora descend on an abandoned plot of land in an unremarkable street in the French town of Neauphle-le-Château, a 90-minute drive west of Paris.
On the nominated Sunday, a marquee is hastily thrown up and framed photographs of the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini hung on the canvas. Green baize is laid on the muddy garden path between posts painted with equal bands of green, white and red, the colours of the Islamic republic’s flag.
They come to remember the supreme leader who, in a chapter of history little known outside France, spent four months in the town in the late 1970s before his triumphant return to Tehran as the leader of the Islamic revolution.
The fact this is commemorated every year in a small town in Île-de-France evokes a deep grievance among local people, and particularly this year. That their home has become synonymous with a regime in Tehran accused of killing thousands, some say tens of thousands, in a continuing crackdown, feels, they say, like a betrayal. Rather than remembering, they would rather forget.
“People prefer not to speak of it. It’s a moment in history that has nothing to do with us,” says Pascal Pagand, who owns the Café des Sports in the town square, the hub of local life.
“I know it still annoys people. They don’t understand why he was given sanctuary here … The town wasn’t asked or consulted. It was imposed; people had no choice. I wasn’t here back then, but those who were here remember it as a difficult time.”
Visitors have been making the annual pilgrimage to Neauphle-le-Château for 47 years. In October 1978, the then French president, Valéry Giscard d’Estaing, agreed to allow Khomeini to settle in France after his expulsion from Iraq.
D’Estaing was persuaded that the Shia cleric would be a democratic alternative to the autocratic Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, the erratic shah whose regime was in its dying days. The Frenchman also believed Khomenei would reward Paris’s hospitality with lucrative contracts establishing France as a counterweight to US influence in the region.
Photographs and newsreel from the time show Khomeini meditating under an apple tree in the garden of 23 Route de Chevreuse. Inside, his acolytes prepared hundreds of cassette recordings of Khomeini urging Iranians to rise up, tapes that were flown to Tehran to be spread secretly across Iran.
Nowadays there is nothing left of the two-storey house that was destroyed many years ago. Locals believe it was “plastiqué” (blown to bits), either by French secret services or by angry Pahlavi supporters after Khomeini left. The force of the explosion cracked the windows of neighbouring homes, they say.
In France, leftwing intellectuals hailed Khomeini as the new Gandhi, among them Jean-Paul Sartre and Michel Foucault, who would later regret setting up a Khomeini support committee, ignoring Simone de Beauvoir’s warnings that the radical version of Islam he espoused threatened women’s rights.
On 1 February 1979, 15 days after Pahlavi fled into exile, Khomeini flew – first-class on Air France courtesy of the French government – to Tehran. He was greeted by ecstatic crowds and within days had established the theocratic dictatorship that has ruled Iran ever since.
In Neauphle-le-Château, what irks locals is the sense that the town is on the map for the wrong reason. Why can it not be remembered for the novelist and playwright Marguerite Duras who lived and wrote there? Why not for Grand Marnier Cordon Rouge, the Cognac and bitter-orange liqueur, created and produced there until, like Khomeini, it moved elsewhere?
Sitting under a photograph of Duras at a corner table in the Café des Sports, Jean-Claude Cintas, an artist and film-maker, summed up the collective dismay. “Most people here would rather Neauphle-le-Château was known for Marguerite Duras and Grand Marnier,” he said.
Cintas remembers seeing Khomenei on his way to pray and recalls the widespread support for him in France. “At the time, the left was very much for Khomeini and didn’t have a word to say against him,” he said.
“It was only 10 years after May 1968,” he added, referring to the leftwing student-led revolt that almost brought down the French government. “It was an extraordinary era. The shah was basically in the bin and if you were leftwing you were for Khomeini.
“But he was not at all welcome locally. It wasn’t aimed at him personally, because people didn’t know who he was at first; it was because the town was suddenly overrun with journalists and police and it caused chaos.”
Cintas added: “Suddenly every time the town was mentioned, it was in connection with Khomeini. It’s been like it for 47 years now and we feel that’s not what we are about.”
In Tehran, long after Khomenei’s death aged 86 in 1989, Neauphle-le-Château has become part of the city’s geography. The street on which the French embassy sits was changed to rue Neauphle-le-Château.
While most French people over the age of 50 will immediately associate Neauphle-le-Château with Khomeini, the town has been making efforts to bury the memories. Three years ago, during the protests resulting from the death in police custody of Mahsa Amini, who had been arrested three days earlier for allegedly breaching the Islamic dress code for women, a commemorative board at the property on Route de Chevreuse bearing Khomeini’s portrait was vandalised. The town hall ordered its removal and decreed there should be no permanent sign marking his stay.
Elisabeth Sandjivy, the mayor of Neauphle, told French media at the time: “I would like the town of Neauphle to no longer be associated with this part of history that has been imposed on it, because it was the government that gave permission for the ayatollah to stay here.”
French media reported that an official request from Tehran to create a museum on the site had been met with a definitive “non”. Attempts by the Guardian to speak to Sandjivy were unsuccessful.
“Locals will tell you they don’t care about the town’s association with the Ayatollah Khomeini and they don’t want to talk about it, but deep down it still rankles,” said Cintas. “It’s not what we want our town to be remembered for.
“Khomeini spent only four months living on the very outskirts of the town, but his stay has thrown a shadow over the entire place especially with what has happened since.
“There is a sense of betrayal: we gave him sanctuary and instead of democracy this is what he did.”

Learn this from Bezos and the Washington Post: with hypercapitalists in charge, your news is not safe  | Jane Martinson

Not long after being made Time magazine’s Person of the Year in 1999, Jeff Bezos told me: “They were not choosing me as much as they were choosing the internet, and me as a symbol.” A quarter of an increasingly dark century later, the Amazon founder is now a symbol of something else: how the ultra-rich can kill the news.
Job cuts in an industry that has struggled financially since the internet came into existence and killed its business model is hardly new, but last week’s brutal cull of hundreds of journalists at the Bezos-owned Washington Post marks a new low. The redundancies that were announced to staff on a video call, the axing of half its foreign bureau (including the war reporter in Ukraine) – not since P&O Ferries have layoffs been handled so badly. Former Post stalwart Paul Farhi described a decision that affected nearly half of the 790-strong workforce as “the biggest one-day wipeout of journalists in a generation”.
Why it happened is still baffling, at least for anyone not inside the head of one of the world’s richest men. Marty Baron, the Post’s former editor, highlighted the owner’s “sickening” efforts to curry favour with Donald Trump in a “case study in near-instant, self-inflicted brand destruction”. Slate magazine, owned by the Graham family (previous owners of the Post), accused Bezos of “accelerating the [Post’s] decline on purpose” because of “external economic interests” such as Amazon and Blue Origin, his space business. Perhaps he agreed to savage cuts because it showed he really was the boss, or just because he could. In any case, his ownership of the Washington Post is yet more proof, if needed, that owning a newspaper is not about money; it’s about power and influence. In other words, it’s about politics.
Bezos, with his $266bn fortune, doesn’t need the money that a newspaper might bring in; his interest payouts make the Washington Post’s $100m annual losses look like a rounding error. When he bought the paper in 2013, the age of Obama, Bezos splashed the cash on bonuses for reporters, used one of his private jets to collect reporter Jason Rezaian from an Iranian jail and travelled to Istanbul to make a speech about murdered columnist Jamal Khashoggi. Then, in the first age of Trump, who made no secret of his dislike for a paper known for bringing down corrupt presidents, Amazon lost a $10bn government computing contract. The resulting lawsuit blamed “improper pressure from President Donald J Trump … to harm his perceived political enemy – Jeffrey P Bezos”. (The US Department of Defense defended its selection process, saying there were no external influences.) The ability of Trump to use other means to flood the zone – social media run by himself or his big-tech pals – has made him even more dangerous in his second coming.
Last week’s news was the culmination of a new mood at the Post that started in 2024. Bezos had appointed an outsider for the first time, the British journalist and media executive Will Lewis, to be publisher just as opinion polls started to suggest that Trump would become the 47th US president. In the runup to the election, Bezos pulled the Post’s planned endorsement of Kamala Harris, Trump’s Democratic presidential rival, on the grounds that endorsements create distrust; and insisted on a more free market-friendly orientation in its opinion pages. The decision led, within days, to almost 250,000 subscribers deserting the paper.
Anyway, all this seems to go to show that uber-wealthy owners in the news industry can’t be trusted to put private interests over the public good. Or, as the award-winning editor Tina Brown says of the Post debacle: “The purpose of having fuck-you money is to say fuck you, but it seems the purpose of fuck-you money is to have more fuck-you money.” And if the pesky newspaper that burnishes your reputation hurts your ability to make fuck-you money? Kill it – or at least let it fade into managed irrelevance.
So what are the alternatives? There has been no shortage of ideas among those who care about the future of journalism. One of my favourites is the suggestion that Bezos’s ex-wife, MacKenzie Scott, could pair up with other first wives of big-tech billionaires, such as Melinda French Gates, and use their divorce payouts to support the Post instead of their other philanthropic causes.
A better, though possibly just as unlikely, idea is for Bezos to erect some legal frameworks to protect editorial safeguards. The best guarantees are embedded into a trust-based ownership such as that enjoyed by the Guardian. He could just stick a tiny fraction of his planet-sized fortune into a trust and have nothing to do with it.
The most likely scenario is the most depressing for anyone who cares about freedom of the press. The Post will simply do less and less of the great journalism that has seen it lauded with Pulitzer prizes, until eventually no one thinks of it as the paper of Watergate any more.
The crisis at the Washington Post marks a turning point in this new age of disillusionment, an era in which the excitement of the early web has made way for shame and bewilderment at how much we lose by allowing the rich and powerful to kill the parts of society that make it function better.

AI rattles US investors, while China’s tech stocks hold steady – for now
Investor jitters grow in the US as AI reshapes expectations, but China’s markets have so far reacted with caution rather than panic
Artificial intelligence is already reshaping industries and markets, even though artificial general intelligence (AGI) – a still theoretical form of AI capable of humanlike reasoning across many tasks rather than single specialised functions – has yet to be achieved.
That was the message of a recent essay posted on X by start-up founder Matt Shumer, titled “Something Big Is Happening”. He likened the current moment to the period just before the Covid-19 pandemic, arguing that the disruption driven by AI could prove “much, much bigger”.
The warning has resonated across US tech and investment circles, capping several uneasy weeks in which traditional software-as-a-service (SaaS) stocks came under pressure amid concerns that their business models could be undermined in an AI-driven economy.
China, however, has so far appeared relatively insulated from this latest bout of AI-fuelled anxiety.
Even as Chinese AI models continue to narrow the gap with their US counterparts, particularly following a string of major releases over the past week, legacy software stocks in China have largely held steady.
Some AI-adjacent firms have even attracted fresh investor interest. Cultural and content-creation companies, for example, saw share prices rise after ByteDance unveiled its powerful Seedance 2.0 video-generation model, as the industry expects the tool to improve productivity and streamline workflows.

Why do some Swiss dress up as Japanese during carnival?

Why do some Swiss dress up as Japanese during carnival?
There is a carnival group in Schwyz, central Switzerland, called the Japanesen (the Japanese), who sometimes seem a little strange – and not just to the Japanese. They perform open-air plays during the carnival season. The tradition is 170 years old, but it is struggling to survive.
On January 6, Epiphany, a public holiday in Catholic-dominated canton Schwyz, the Japanesen held their “Empire Assembly” in a congress hall near the main square for the 169th time. It is the general assembly of the Schwyz carnival group Japanesengesellschaft (Japanese Society).
“Are you in favour of us performing the 52nd Japanese carnival play in 2028?” asked the president of the society, Karl Schönbächler, known as “Hesonusode”, and the hall erupted in loud, approving applause. In addition to the Japanesen in oriental costume, other carnival groups also welcomed the decision.
In Schwyz, a carnival parade takes place every year on Ash Wednesday, the so-called Nüssler, where masked figures dance in their own unique way. Every four to six years there is also an open-air theatre called the Japanesenspiele (Japanese plays), the roots of which go back to the middle of the 19th century.
Roots in the Swiss Civil War
Back then, the conservative Catholic canton of Schwyz was defeated by the liberal cantons in the Sonderbund War of 1847 and had to contribute to the costs of the war.
To cheer up the defeated people of Schwyz, it was decided to put on an open-air play during the carnival season. In 1857 the satirical play Circus Carnival, with bizarre animals, was performed to great acclaim.
At the same time, a wave of change also swept through the Far East: in Japan, a movement emerged that ended the 200-year isolation of the island nation. Young Switzerland, which was suffering from high tariffs in its neighbouring countries at the time, wanted to benefit from the opportunity and sent a delegation to Japan to negotiate a trade agreement.
Expensive gifts to Japan
The Swiss parliament approved a budget of CHF100,000 for this, around 10% of the federal budget at the time. The aim was to win over the Japanese generals.
A six-person delegation led by watch dealer Aimé Humbert-Droz put together over 200 gifts to demonstrate Switzerland’s industrial and technological strength – from watches and silk fabrics to handicrafts and fire pumps.
However, the people in the agricultural canton of Schwyz were dissatisfied with the high cost of this export promotion. Ambros Eberle, one of the organisers of the open-air play and publisher of the local newspaper, then wrote a play, a biting satire on the federal state.
Biting satire
In the play a Swiss delegation travels to Japan with a mountain of gifts to meet the taikun, the emperor. However, the delegation is treated badly by the tyrannical taikun. The patriotism of the Swiss farmers finally causes the taikun to change his attitude. In the end, he even wishes to become a Swiss citizen.
The premiere of Switzerland in Japan in February 1863 was a huge success and earned the organisers a surplus of CHF2,000. The organisers then founded the Japanese Society and since then have regularly staged Japanesenspiel (Japanese plays) in which the Emperor Hesonusode and his people, the Japanesen, play the leading roles. The plays have been constantly revised and supplemented with current events and satirical elements.
≫In this video, Swiss public broadcaster SRF reported on the rehearsal for the 50th performance of the Japanesenspiel in 2013:
The fantasy world 170 years ago
Although they were called Japanesen, their appearance clearly corresponds neither to the actual Japanese nor to Japanese culture. Their long, thin beards and robes look rather Chinese – at least from today’s perspective.
The Japanesen epitomise the image of the Japanese as the people of Schwyz imagined them 170 years ago. They were created at a time when, despite diplomatic messages, visual information was rare and the distinction between China and Japan or between a shogun and an emperor was unclear to many in Europe. The fact that they are still called by their original name, Japanesen, and not by the modern German word Japaner bears witness to their long history.
Longing for exoticism
“For them, faithfully recreating the Japan of the time was not important,” says Japanese professor Keizo Miyashita, a representative of the Japanesenspiel in Japan. “For people who wanted to release their frustration as quickly as possible, the quickest way was to transform themselves into something as far removed from their everyday reality as possible.”
This longing for the exotic still exists today. “During carnival, it’s fun to see how we can imitate unknown, foreign things,” Karl Schönbächler tells Swissinfo. The architect has in-depth knowledge of Japanese culture and is aware that the Japanesen do not embody authentic Japanese culture.
“It’s a carnival, so you can’t be ‘authentic’. It took me a long time to understand that,” explains Emi Oshikawa, who has lived in Schwyz since 1987. At first, the staging of the Japanesen seemed strange to her and she tried to make up for it by, for example, fetching real Japanese kimonos and showing them to the organisers.
No interest in kimonos
But the Japanesen just nodded, said “yes, that’s right” – and made no effort to correct their appearance. It took over ten years for Oshikawa to realise that “the play is not about conveying authentic Japanese culture”, she says.

2nd Life – Off to Tokyo
So why does the Schwyz open-air theatre continue to insist on the Japanesen? For Peter Steinegger, former Hesonusode, it is not about the appearance of the Japanesen, but about “Tenno as mediator”.
The Swiss Sonderbund War, which marked the beginning of these plays, had divided Switzerland into liberals and conservatives. Steinegger explains that the lines of conflict established back then are still in effect today. There is a constant struggle in Switzerland, “that is the essence of our democracy”.
In the Japanesenspiele, the inhabitants of Schwyz are also affected by the conflict. But in the end, Hesonusode acts as a mediator for the quarrelling Schwyz residents. “His appearance is always extremely honourable. The High Tenno is never criticised or even insulted,” explains Steinegger, former president of the cantonal parliament. In this respect, one can speak of a faithful representation of the Japanese emperor, he says.
On the brink of extinction
The Japanesen have reduced their appearances in recent decades. The ceremonial entry on Epiphany no longer takes place. Neither will the children’s gift-giving with oranges on so-called Dirty Thursday. In 2019 and 2023, the plays were renamed Faschnachtspiel (carnival play), and Hesonusode and the Japanesen became less important.
What happened to the Japanesen? Franz Steinegger, journalist for Der Bote, attributes the decline of the Japanesen to the “normalised relationship between the authorities and ordinary citizens”.
For a long time, the Japanese Society was led by wealthy and influential local dignitaries. Today, where equality is highly valued, this exclusivity has proved fatal. No board could be found for the Japanese Society. The Japanesenspiele were on the verge of extinction.
But in 2016 Toni Dettling, a former federal parliamentarian, initiated comprehensive reforms. He appointed the well-connected Karl Schönbächler as the Society’s president, Hesonusode, and entrusted the script to Roger Bürgler, a young playwright from Schwyz. The two were to transform the origins of the Society into an open-air theatre during the carnival.
“The break with tradition in the play was also somewhat tactical,” says Bürgler, explaining why he had significantly reduced the Japanesen factor. The Japanesen were “effectively dead”, he says. To rekindle interest, a lot of singing, dancing and light shows were added, as well as satirical elements.

This strategy was successful: the new carnival piece was well received and “we’re closer to the audience again”, says Franz Steinegger.
But the Japanesen are not completely extinct. Bürgler, who is also working on the script for 2028, wants “the Japanesen to come back a little”.
And the President of the Japanese Society, Karl Schönbächler, says: “Tradition is not the worship of ashes, but the passing on of fire”.

Rubio slams European policies on climate, migration as he calls for unity
Top diplomat casts US as the ‘child of Europe’ in a message of unity at the Munich Security Conference after a year of turmoil in transatlantic relations.
Rubio at Munich Security Conference: US wants Europe to be 'strong'
United States Secretary of State Marco Rubio has said that Washington wants to revitalise its friendship with Europe in a speech at the annual Munich Security Conference, offering some reassurance to European countries after more than a year of turmoil in transatlantic relations.
But the speech, which drew a standing ovation on Saturday, was short on concrete commitments, made no mention of Russia, and criticised Europe’s values, including the continent’s approach to migration and climate change.

“In a time of headlines heralding the end of the transatlantic era, let it be known and clear to all that this is neither our goal nor our wish, because for us Americans, our home may be in the Western Hemisphere, but we will always be a child of Europe,” Rubio said. “For the United States and Europe, we belong together.”
While praising Europe’s cultural achievements – from Michelangelo to William Shakespeare – Rubio was firm about the US President Donald Trump’s administration’s intent to reshape the transatlantic alliance and push its priorities.
He argued that the “euphoria” of the Western victory in the Cold War led to a “dangerous delusion that we had entered ‘the end of history’,” where every nation would be a liberal democracy and “live in a world without borders, where everyone became a citizen of the world”.
This was a “foolish idea” that resulted in Western nations outsourcing their sovereignty to international institutions and opening “doors to an unprecedented wave of mass migration that threatens the cohesion of our societies, the continuity of our culture, and the future of our people”, he said.
To appease a “climate cult”, he added, “we have imposed energy policies on ourselves that are impoverishing our people”.
“We made these mistakes together, and now, together, we owe it to our people to face those facts and to move forward to rebuild.”
Rubio acknowledged that “we have bled and died side-by-side on battlefields from Kapyong to Kandahar”, and said he was in Munich to “make it clear that America is charting the path for a new century of prosperity… and that once again, we want to do it together, with you, our cherished allies and our oldest friends”.
‘Not a departure’
Rubio addressed the conference a year after US Vice President JD Vance stunned the same audience by dressing down European allies and arguing that the greatest danger to Europe came from censorship rather than external threats like Russia.
A series of Trump administration statements and moves targeting allies followed, including Trump’s short-lived threat last month to impose new tariffs on several European countries in a bid to secure US control of Greenland, a semiautonomous territory of fellow NATO member Denmark.
Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Union’s executive commission, said Rubio’s speech was “very reassuring”, but noted that “in the administration, some have a harsher tone on these topics”.
In her speech to the conference, she stressed that “Europe must become more independent”, including in defence. She also insisted on Europe’s “digital sovereignty”, or its approach to hate speech on social media.
Others struck a more cautious tone.
“I am not sure that Europeans see the announced civilisational decline, supposedly caused mainly by migration and deindustrialisation, as a core uniting interest. For most Europeans, the common interest is security,” said Gabrielius Landsbergis, a former foreign minister of NATO member Lithuania.
“This was not a departure from the general position of the administration. It was simply delivered in more polite terms,” he said on X.
Al Jazeera’s James Bays, reporting from Munich, said that while the difference in the US’s tone was “very noticeable”, the “policies of the Trump administration are unlikely to change”.
“Over the last year, there has been numerous problems between Europe and the US, including Trump’s tariffs, wrangling over defence and [the] US’s bid to take over Greenland. But the biggest issue of all is Ukraine.”
Russia’s war on Ukraine
On Ukraine, European allies have long worried about Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin trying to ram through a deal on Moscow’s terms, which would force Kyiv to cede land to end Europe’s deadliest conflict since World War II.
US-brokered peace talks resume next week in Geneva, after Russia’s sustained bombardment of Ukrainian cities during one of the coldest winters in years killed civilians and left hundreds of thousands of people without power and water.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy expressed hope at the conference on Saturday, but said he was feeling “a little bit” of pressure from Trump, who had said Zelenskyy should not miss the “opportunity” to make peace soon.
“The Americans often return to the topic of concessions, and too often, those concessions are discussed only in the context of Ukraine, not Russia,” Zelenskyy said.
The EU’s foreign affairs chief, Kaja Kallas, echoed the sentiment.
“Putting the pressure on the victim is, of course, hope for a quick win. Because if you just surrender and give the aggressor what they want, then the war would be over, wouldn’t it?” she told Al Jazeera.
“But actually, the war would be over only temporarily. Because the aggressor got what it want, the appetite only grows. It has a pause that it needs and then continues,” she added.
Donald Jensen, a former US diplomat and a professor of Russian foreign policy at Johns Hopkins University, said serious issues remain between Washington and Europe, despite Rubio’s conciliatory tone.
“He’s reaching out for Europe to join the Trump administration’s view of the world, view of international security. And in that regard, I think it will not do much to attain that goal,” he said.
He added that Rubio was “one of several voices on the Ukraine issue”, and not “always on the same page” with Vance or other administration officials, making it difficult for European partners to understand what they are dealing with.
“The problem remains on the Washington end, how to have a more consistent view of that worldview that Trump is extending towards the Europeans, because often, internally, the US administration also is not consistent,” Jensen said.
This makes it difficult for the Europeans to know what they’re dealing with, he said. “The changes of US policy back and forth on some issues also makes it difficult for the European partners to know what they’re dealing with.”

Trump says regime change in Iran could be ‘best thing’

U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday embraced a potential regime change in Iran, saying a “tremendous power” will soon be in the Middle East, as a second aircraft carrier headed to the region.
Trump's military moves and tough talk comes even as Washington and Tehran seek to revive diplomacy over Tehran's long-running nuclear dispute with the West.
A source briefed on the matter told Reuters that U.S. envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner will hold negotiations with Iran on Tuesday in Geneva, with representatives from Oman acting as mediators. The source said Witkoff and Kushner will also meet officials from Russia and Ukraine on Tuesday in Geneva in the U.S. drive to bring an end to the war in Ukraine.
Asked if he wanted regime change in Iran, Trump responded that it "seems like that would be the best thing that could happen." He declined to share who he wanted to take over Iran, but said "there are people."
"For 47 years, they've been talking and talking and talking," Trump said after a military event at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. "In the meantime, we've lost a lot of lives while they talk. Legs blown off, arms blown off, faces blown off. We've been going on for a long time."
Washington wants nuclear talks with Iran to also cover the country's ballistic missiles, support for armed groups around the region and the treatment of the Iranian people.
Iran has said it is prepared to discuss curbs on its nuclear program in exchange for lifting sanctions, but has ruled out linking the issue to missiles.
Trump has threatened strikes on Iran if no agreement is reached, while Tehran has vowed to retaliate, stoking fears of a wider war as the U.S. amasses forces in the Middle East. The U.S. targeted Iran's nuclear facilities in strikes last year.
When asked what was left to be targeted at the nuclear sites, Trump said the "dust." He added: "If we do it, that would be the least of the mission, but we probably grab whatever is left."
U.S. officials described the complex process of moving military assets. The carrier Gerald R. Ford will join the carrier Abraham Lincoln, several guided-missile destroyers, fighter jets and surveillance aircraft that have been moved to the Middle East in recent weeks.
The Gerald R. Ford, the United States' newest and the world's largest carrier, has been operating in the Caribbean with its escort ships and took part in operations in Venezuela earlier this year.
Asked earlier on Friday why a second aircraft carrier was headed to the Middle East, Trump said: "In case we don't make a deal, we'll need it... if we need it, we'll have it ready."
One of the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the carrier would take at least a week to reach the Middle East.
The United States most recently had two aircraft carriers in the area last year, when it carried out strikes against Iranian nuclear sites in June.
With only 11 aircraft carriers in the U.S. military's arsenal, they are a scarce resource and their schedules are usually set well in advance.
In a statement, U.S. Southern Command, which oversees U.S. military operations in Latin America, said it would continue to stay focused on countering "illicit activities and malign actors in the Western Hemisphere."
The Ford has essentially been at sea since June 2025. It was supposed to be operating in Europe before it was abruptly moved to the Caribbean in November.
While deployments for carriers usually last nine months, it is not uncommon for them to be extended during periods of increased U.S. military activity.
Navy officials have long warned that long deployments at sea can damage morale on ships.
Officials said the administration had looked at sending a separate carrier, the Bush, to the Middle East, but it was undergoing certification and would take over a month to reach the Middle East.
The Ford, which has a nuclear reactor on board, can hold more than 75 military aircraft, including fighter aircraft like the F-18 Super Hornet jet and the E-2 Hawkeye, which can act as an early warning system.
The Ford also has sophisticated radar that can help control air traffic and navigation.
The supporting ships, such as the Ticonderoga-class guided missile cruiser Normandy, Arleigh Burke-class guided missile destroyers Thomas Hudner, Ramage, Carney, and Roosevelt, include surface-to-air, surface-to-surface and anti-submarine warfare capabilities.

US President Donald Trump has said that a change of government in Iran would be "the best thing," amid reports the US military is preparing for potentially weeks-long Iran operations.
Trump's comments were his most overt call yet for the toppling of Iran's government, and came as he pushes on Washington's foe Tehran to make a deal to limit its nuclear programme.
Trump declined to say who he would want to take over in Iran from supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, but he added that "there are people."
Reuters has reported that the US military is preparing for the possibility of sustained, weeks-long operations against Iran if Trump orders an attack.
Citing two US officials, Reuters said that this would raise the stakes for the diplomacy underway between the United States and Iran and could become a far more serious conflict than previously seen between the countries.
US officials said on Friday the Pentagon was sending an additional aircraft carrier to the Middle East, adding thousands more troops along with fighter aircraft, guided-missile destroyers and other firepower capable of waging attacks and defending against them.

The Israeli military has said it has conducted a wave of airstrikes on south Lebanon targeting Hezbollah infrastructure, including weapons depots and rocket launchers.
Israeli forces have raided the village of Al-Mughayyir, north of Ramallah in the occupied West Bank, according to Palestinian news agency Wafa, which added that Israeli forces assaulted several residents during the assault.
President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu agreed at a White House meeting on Wednesday that the US would work to reduce Iran's oil exports to China, Axios reported, citing two US officials briefed on the issue.
"We agreed that we will go full force with maximum pressure against Iran, for example, regarding Iranian oil sales to China," Axios reported on Saturday, quoting a senior US official.
China accounts for more than 80 percent of Iran's oil exports. Any reduction in that trade would mean lower oil revenue for Iran.
US and Iranian diplomats held nuclear talks through Omani mediators last week in an effort to revive diplomacy, after the US president positioned a naval flotilla in the region as the American military prepares for the possibility of sustained, weeks-long operations against Iran.
A Palestinian NGO has denounced what it called an Israeli act of revenge after a video showed far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir overseeing the abuse of detainees in a military prison.
Just days before the start of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, Ben Gvir held a tour of Ofer Prison in the occupied West Bank, Israel's Channel 7 reported.
In footage filmed on Friday and broadcast by the channel, around 20 police officers are seen storming a hallway leading to prison cells, brandishing their weapons and firing stun grenades.
They then pull five detainees from their cells, their hands tied behind their backs, forcing them face-down onto the floor.
The operation took place as a bill proposing the death penalty for Palestinian prisoners convicted of terrorism awaited a final vote in the Israeli parliament.
"This is all part of ongoing displays meant to take revenge on Palestinian detainees," Abdallah al-Zaghari, head of the Palestinian Prisoners' Club, told AFP on Saturday.
"Everything Ben Gvir and the far-right government are doing affects not only the Palestinian people and prisoners in detention camps - it also impacts the global legal and human rights system," he added.
The US military is preparing for the possibility of sustained, weeks-long operations against Iran if President Donald Trump orders an attack, two US officials told Reuters, in what could become a far more serious conflict than previously seen between the countries.
The disclosure by the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitive nature of the planning, raises the stakes for the diplomacy underway between the United States and Iran.
The planning under way this time is more complex, the officials said.
In a sustained campaign, the US military could hit Iranian state and security facilities, not just nuclear infrastructure, one of the officials said. The official declined to provide specific details.
Experts say the risks to US forces would be far greater in such an operation against Iran, which boasts a formidable arsenal of missiles. Retaliatory Iranian strikes also increase the risk of a regional conflict.
The same official said the United States fully expected Iran to retaliate, leading to back-and-forth strikes and reprisals over time.
Associates of Israeli President Isaac Herzog have described US President Donald Trump's pressure for granting a pardon to Benjamin Netanyahu as "crossing a line", according to Haaretz.
Netanyahu has sought a pardon from Herzog over corruption trials that are currently underway.
Israeli settlers attacked Palestinians shepards in Masafer Yatta, south of Hebron, according to Palestinian news agency Wafa.
The head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees has said conditions on the ground contradict repeated attacks from Israeli politicians seeking to dismantle the organisation.
Philippe Lazzarini told Al Jazeera that shutting down the UNRWA would deprive thousands of Palestinians of essential daily services.
“UNRWA is under a lot of pressure. We have been under a lot of political attacks; there are a number of politicians in Israel who want to get rid of the agency,” he said on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference.
Lazzarini said there is no alternative body capable of meeting the scale of need among Palestinians after two years of Israel’s war on Gaza.
“The reality is completely different. We have 12,000 staff, we have the workforce, the expertise, the community trust to provide daily critical services,” he said.
Israel has repeatedly accused UNRWA of being lenient towards, or complicit with, Palestinian armed groups, without providing verifiable evidence.
The agency has strongly rejected these allegations, stressing that disciplinary action is taken against any staff member found to be involved in wrongdoing.
Switzerland said Saturday that Oman would host talks between the United States and Iran in Geneva next week, with Washington pushing Tehran to make a deal to limit its nuclear programme.
"Switzerland stands ready at all times to offer its good offices to facilitate dialogue between the United States and Iran," a Swiss foreign ministry spokesman told AFP news agency.
On February 6, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi held talks in Oman with US envoy Steve Witkoff and US President Donald Trump's influential son-in-law Jared Kushner.
The talks were indirect, with the Omanis acting as mediators.
Trump has recently focused his military threats on Tehran's nuclear programme, which US forces struck last July during Israel's unprecedented 12-day war with Iran.
Trump said Friday that a change of government in Iran would be the "best thing that could happen", as he sent a second aircraft carrier to the Middle East, ratcheting up military pressure on the Islamic republic.
Gideon Sa'ar is expected to represent Israel at a meeting of the Board of Peace, which is due to take place in Washington later this week.
According to Haaretz, the meeting is set to focus on plans for the reconstruction of the Gaza Strip, citing a source familiar with the discussions.
A man was shot dead in the northern city of Nazareth on Saturday, according to Israeli police.
Police said the victim has not yet been identified and confirmed that an investigation is under way. Officers are searching for suspects as part of a probe into the killing, which comes amid a wider surge in violent crime.
The Palestinian Ministry of Health said hospitals in the Gaza Strip received the bodies of two Palestinians over the past 48 hours, after they were recovered from beneath the rubble.
In its daily statistical report, the ministry said a further 15 people were treated for injuries caused by ongoing Israeli attacks. It added that a number of victims remain trapped under debris or lying in the streets, as ambulance and civil defence crews have been unable to reach them.
The ministry said that since the ceasefire took effect on 11 October, at least 591 Palestinians have been killed, with 1,598 injured and 726 bodies recovered.
According to cumulative figures since the start of the war on 7 October 2023, the total number of Palestinians killed has risen to 72,051, while 171,706 others have been wounded.
Award-winning Indian writer Arundhati Roy said Friday she was withdrawing from the Berlin Film Festival over jury president Wim Wenders's comments that he wanted to "stay out of politics" after being asked about Gaza.
Roy said in a statement that she was "shocked and disgusted" by Wenders' response to a question on Gaza at a press conference on Thursday. "With deep regret, I must say that I will not be attending the Berlinale," she said.
Roy, whose novel "The God of Small Things" won the 1997 Booker Prize, had been announced as a festival guest to present a restored version of the 1989 film "In Which Annie Gives It Those Ones", in which she starred and wrote the screenplay.
However, she said that the "unconscionable" statements by Wenders and other jury members had led her to reconsider.
"To hear them say that art should not be political is jaw-dropping," she said.
When asked about Germany's support for Israel at the press conference on Thursday, Wenders said: "We cannot really enter the field of politics", describing filmmakers as "the counterweight to politics".
In her statement, Roy described Israel's actions in Gaza as "a genocide of the Palestinian people by the State of Israel".
"If the greatest film makers and artists of our time cannot stand up and say so, they should know that history will judge them," she said.
Such arrests have been happening for weeks following the government crackdown last month that crushed the protests calling for the end of the country’s theocratic rule.
Reports of raids on homes and workplaces have come from major cities and rural towns alike, revealing a dragnet that has touched large swaths of Iranian society.
University students, doctors, lawyers, teachers, actors, business owners, athletes and filmmakers have been swept up, as well as reformist figures close to President Masoud Pezeshkian.
They are often held incommunicado for days or weeks and prevented from contacting family members or lawyers, according to activists monitoring the arrests. That has left desperate relatives searching for their loved ones.
The U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency has put the number of arrests at more than 50,000.
Tracking the detainees has been difficult since Iranian authorities imposed an internet blackout, and reports leak out only with difficulty.
Other activist groups outside Iran have also been working to document the sweeps.
“Authorities continue to identify people and detain them,” said Shiva Nazarahari, an organizer with one of those groups, the Committee for Monitoring the Status of Detained Protesters.
So far, the committee has verified the names of more than 2,200 people who were arrested, using direct reports from families and a network of contacts on the ground. The arrestees include 107 university students, 82 children as young as 13, as well as 19 lawyers and 106 doctors.

US Democratic lawmaker Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has said Washington should reconsider its unconditional military support for Israel, pointing to the scale of civilian deaths in Gaza Strip.
In an interview with Israeli newspaper Haaretz, Ocasio-Cortez was asked whether a future Democratic presidential candidate in 2028 should reassess US military assistance to Israel.
She said: "The idea of completely unconditional aid no matter what one does doesn't make sense. I think it enabled a genocide in Gaza and we have thousands of women and children dead – that was completely avoidable.
Ocasio-Cortez added: "So I believe that enforcement of our own laws through the Leahy Laws, which requires conditioning aid in any circumstance when you see gross human rights violations, is appropriate."
About 200,000 people joined a demonstration against the Iranian government in Munich on Saturday, police said, as world leaders gathered nearby for a security conference.
The protesters rallied on Munich's Theresienwiese fairgrounds, denouncing the leadership of Iran's Islamic Republic following the deadly repression of nationwide protests in January.
Some waved flags with a lion and a sun against horizontal green, white and red stripes, the emblem of the monarchy overthrown in 1979.
Human rights groups have reported that thousands of protesters have been killed in Iran.
Rallies calling for international action against Tehran are also planned in Toronto and Los Angeles on Saturday.
The exiled son of the former shah of Iran, Reza Pahlavi, spoke at the Munich Security Conference on Saturday and called on US President Donald Trump to "help" the Iranian people.
Pahlavi, who has lived in exile since his father was overthrown in the 1979 revolution, urged an outside "humanitarian intervention to prevent more innocent lives being killed" in Iran.
The Theresienwiese, which hosts the huge annual Oktoberfest folk gathering, is located less than three kilometres (1.8 miles) from the security conference venue.
Last week, an estimated 10,000 people gathered in Berlin in response to a call from the MEK, an exiled opposition group considered "terrorist" by Tehran.
The U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) said on Saturday that it conducted 10 strikes against more than 30 Islamic State targets in Syria between February 3 and February 12.
The U.S. struck ISIS infrastructure and weapons storage targets, it said.
Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas called on Saturday for the removal of "all obstacles" he said Israel has imposed on implementing phase two of the Gaza ceasefire.
"We emphasise the need to lift all obstacles imposed by the Israeli occupation on the implementation of the provisions related to the second phase of the agreement," Abbas said, in a speech read by his prime minister Mohammed Mustafa at an African Union summit in Ethiopia.
This included the work of a technocratic committee established to oversee the daily governance of Gaza, he added.
Removal of the obstacles was needed to "ensure continuity of services, coordinate humanitarian efforts and enable a swift recovery", the president said.
Abbas accused Israel of "continuing to violate" the ceasefire agreement with Palestinian militant group Hamas that took effect in October and was backed by the United States.
"From the announcement of the ceasefire until today, more than 500 Palestinians have been killed (in Gaza), which threatens the durability of the truce and the full implementation of its second phase," he added.
Israeli forces shelled several areas of Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip, according to reports.
Israeli artillery targeted neighbourhoods in the city, TNA’s Arabic-language sister site Al-Araby Al-Jadeed reported.
The exiled son of Iran's last shah called on US President Donald Trump on Saturday to help the Iranian people and said it was "time to end the Islamic republic".
"To President Trump... The Iranian people heard you say help is on the way, and they have faith in you. Help them," the US-based Reza Pahlavi told reporters at the Munich Security Conference.
Trump had said Friday that a change of government in Iran would be the "best thing that could happen", as he sent a second aircraft carrier to the Middle East to ratchet up military pressure on the Islamic republic.
He had earlier threatened military intervention to support a wave of street protests in Iran that peaked in January and were met by a violent crackdown that rights groups say killed thousands.
Pahlavi, who has not returned to Iran since before the 1979 Islamic revolution that ousted the monarchy, said in Munich: "It is time to end the Islamic republic."
"This is the demand echoing from the bloodshed of my compatriots who are not asking us to fix the regime but to help them bury it," he added.
The United Arab Emirates and the United States have each committed more than $1 billion to Donald Trump’s proposed Gaza Peace Council, according to officials cited by The New York Times.
The pledges, reported by the New York Times, signal significant financial backing from Washington and Abu Dhabi for the initiative, which is being presented as part of Trump’s plans for post-war governance and reconstruction in Gaza.
More than 100 prominent figures from the arts and entertainment world have signed an open letter supporting UN rapporteur Francesca Albanese, amid pro-Israel pressure for her to step down over comments critical of Israel’s genocidal conduct during the war on Gaza.
Calls for Albanese’s resignation have come from France and Germany, following remarks last weekend in which she described a “common enemy of humanity” and accused “most of the world” and the media of enabling Israel’s actions in Gaza.
The letter, organised by the Artists for Palestine group, is backed by figures including actors Mark Ruffalo and Javier Bardem, Nobel Prize–winning author Annie Ernaux, and British musician Annie Lennox.
The signatories state that they “offer our full support to Francesca Albanese, a defender of human rights and therefore also of the Palestinian people’s right to exist”.
The letter concludes: “There are infinitely more of us, in every corner of the Earth, who want force no longer to be the law. Who know what the word ‘law’ truly means.”
Other figures backing Albanese include actresses Rosa Salazar and Asia Argento, filmmakers Yorgos Lanthimos and Kaouther Ben Hania, as well as Latin music artist Residente.
The "extermination" of the Palestinian people must end, the chairman of the African Union Commission Mahmoud Ali Youssouf said on Saturday as he launched the organisation's 39th summit.
"In the Middle East, Palestine and the suffering of its people also challenge our consciences. The extermination of this people must stop," said Youssouf, who was elected to head the institution a year ago.
That attack resulted in the deaths of 1,221 people on the Israeli side, mostly civilians, according to Israel figures.
Since then, at least 71,667 Palestinians have been killed in the small coastal territory by Israel's retaliatory military campaign, according to Gaza's health ministry.
He also touched on the multiple conflicts raging in Africa.
"From Sudan to the Sahel, to eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, in Somalia and elsewhere, our people continue to pay the heavy price of instability," Youssouf said.
The summit brings together heads of state from the 55 member states of the African Union over two days.
This year's theme is water sanitation.
The top diplomat overseeing the US-brokered ceasefire deal in Gaza said Friday that continued violations of the agreement pose major obstacles to the Palestinian committee expected to oversee postwar governance and reconstruction.
Nickolay Mladenov, who serves as high representative for Gaza for the US-established Board of Peace, spoke during a panel discussion at the Munich Security Conference. The international board, established by U.S. President Donald Trump, is set to meet next week.
The transitional committee, made up of Palestinian administrators, has met in Egypt but has not yet entered Gaza. Mladenov said it won't be able to do its work unless Hamas, the group that has governed Gaza since 2007, hands over institutional control.
He also called for more aid and improved security.
The agreement calls for Hamas to lay down its arms and for an international security force to be deployed, but there has been no visible progress on either. Israel has continued to carry out strikes in response to what it says are violations of the truce.
Palestinian fighters have also attacked Israeli forces.
“We need to make sure that what is happening now with the violations of the ceasefire stops,” Mladenov said. “We’re only embarrassing the committee and ultimately making it ineffective.”
Mladenov didn't lay out a specific timeline but said “all of this needs to move very fast.”
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov held a phone call with Saudi Arabia's Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan on Friday, the ministry said.
The two ministers discussed the situation around Iran and the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, it said.
Two sets of diplomatic negotiations, on Ukraine and Iran, are set to take place in Geneva on Tuesday, a source briefed on the matter told Reuters news agency on Friday.
A US delegation including envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner will meet with the Iranians on Tuesday morning, the source said. Witkoff and Kushner will then participate in trilateral talks with representatives from Russia and Ukraine in the afternoon, the source said.

African Union: youth anger mounts over corruption, lack of accountability
Africa has the youngest population in the world, with more than 400 million people aged 15 to 35 years old – set to double by 2050
Africa’s top regional body is hosting its annual summit in Ethiopia this weekend to discuss the future of the continent of some 1.4 billion people, as the organisation faces widespread discontent.
Set up to “promote the unity and solidarity of the African States,” analysts say the African Union faces a legitimacy crisis among youth for failing to meet their expectations. Meanwhile, several African countries battle military coups, disputed elections and protests inspired by economic hardship worsened by foreign aid cuts.
‘A bloc of old leaders’
Africa has the youngest population in the world, with more than 400 million people aged 15 to 35 years old. But it is also home to several of the oldest and longest-serving leaders – a paradox that has contributed to an upsurge in coups.
With a young population set to double by 2050, it is the only rapidly growing region where its people are getting poorer. Many African youths express on social media how they view the AU as ‘a bloc of old leaders’, which sees their interests as less of a priority.
The organisation has missed opportunities to be people-centred and citizen-driven and has instead focused largely on governments and leaders, said Liesl Louw-Vaudran, a senior analyst with the Crisis Group.
“What the youth is really asking and why people are frustrated is because this is not an African Union for citizens. It’s not a people-driven African Union,” Louw-Vaudran added.

Paratroopers, guards undergo fitness tests as army inspection in Belarus continues

BORISOV, 14 February (BelTA) – The snap inspection of the Armed Forces ordered by the Belarusian president continues. On 14 February, at the 72nd joint training center for warrant officers and junior specialists, soldiers from the 103rd Vitebsk Airborne Brigade and the 120th Separate Guards Mechanized Brigade are undergoing fitness tests, BelTA has learned.
“We continue to take part in the inspection conducted by order of the Belarusian president. According to the plan, today the servicemen are performing a 5km forced march with weapons. The personnel are ready, they know the task, understand it, and are capable of carrying it out. I am confident in my subordinates. Afterwards, we will continue undergoing fitness tests. Tomorrow, the servicemen will do pull-ups on the bar. The soldiers will complete the inspection with control exercises in weapons training,” Commander of the 103rd Vitebsk Airborne Brigade Vladimir Safonov told journalists.
The brigade commander also pointed out that the personnel of the inspected units are constantly on alert. “Therefore, there is nothing special for them during this inspection. They are doing their job, showing the skills they mastered before the inspection. Moreover, more than half of the time, the servicemen are in the field, performing various tasks,” he emphasized.
Among those taking part in the forced march was Dmitry Tsyngalev, a serviceman of the 103rd Vitebsk Airborne Brigade. “It was not easy, especially on the second and third laps. But our commander supported us, the guys did not give up, did not stop. The weather was not a problem,” he noted.
Commander of the Special Operations Forces of the Belarusian Armed Forces Aleksandr Ilyukevich pointed out that he was satisfied with the actions of the servicemen. “The main thing is that the soldiers have the aspiration, the desire to show results, there are no indifferent people. I am satisfied with the results. Of course, weather conditions and temperature changes make it more challenging. But a paratrooper isn’t afraid of frost or rain, it only gives them a boost,” Aleksandr Ilyukevich stressed.
Also on 14 February, soldiers of the 120th Separate Guards Mechanized Brigade were passing pull-up standards on the bar. “The combat readiness check for us began with a 50km march. Four hours on the road in vehicles, everything went perfectly, the soldiers were very pleased, they coped with the bad weather conditions. Afterwards, we conducted shooting drills with small arms and combat vehicles. Today we are doing pull-ups. Tomorrow we have a 5km run with weapons. We systematically have tests, both in shooting and fitness. So, this is not new for us,” deputy company commander for ideological training Ilya Grishchenko said.
Alongside the men, female servicemen also underwent fitness tests. “We were passing the standard for sit-ups from a lying position. For my age group, 36 repetitions were required, I did 52. I tried not to let my comrades down, because everyone is worried, everyone wants to pass as best as possible, because in the battalion we are one family,” senior assistant to the chief of staff for personnel and unit strength Tatyana Kuderko said.
The large-scale inspection of the Armed Forces on the instructions of the head of state began on 16 January. The commander-in-chief is personally monitoring its progress. A new system has been implemented that allows the president to directly place military units on combat readiness, circumventing the Ministry of Defense and the General Staff. The main aim of these inspections is to gain an objective assessment. This is precisely why they are carried out without prior notice.

A Photo, No Words: Trump's aircraft Carrier post sparks speculation

ALBAWABA - On Saturday, U.S. President Donald Trump posted a picture of an aircraft carrier on his Truth Social platform without any caption or explanation. This led to speculation about when and why he did it.
Trump said Washington would send a second aircraft carrier to the Middle East if talks with Iran fail. This post came after that. When reporters asked Trump about the possible deployment of the USS Gerald R. Ford, he said that the ship would be needed "if we're not able to make a deal."
He also said that if the talks go well, both carriers will leave quickly, which shows that the military buildup is directly related to how well the talks are going.
Mixed Messages About Diplomacy
Later, when he spoke at Fort Bragg in North Carolina, Trump sounded less sure about the talks and said that "the best thing that could happen" might be regime change in Iran. He said that decades of talks with Tehran had not made much progress and had cost lives.
Trump has said that the US won't use military force against Iran if the country agrees to a deal over its nuclear program. "We have to make a deal, or else it will be very painful," he told reporters. He stressed that he would rather find a diplomatic solution, but that other options are still on the table.
Military Presence in the Area
The USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group is leading the way as the United States strengthens its military presence in the Middle East. There were talks between Washington and Tehran in Oman not too long ago, but no date has been set for another round.
Iran says that talks should only be about its nuclear program and not about its ballistic missile activities or alliances in the region.
As tensions rise and fall between diplomacy and deterrence, Trump's unexplained post has added another layer of mystery to an already unstable time in world politics.

Rubio: We do not know whether Russia is serious about ending war
U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said this on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference, according to an Ukrinform correspondent.
Rubio noted that the issues that need to be resolved to end this war have been narrowed. However, the bad news is that "they've been narrowed to the hardest questions to answer and work remains to be done in that front."
"We don't know if the Russians are serious about ending the war – they say they are – and under what terms they were willing to do it and whether we can find terms that are acceptable to Ukraine upon that Russia will always agree to. But we're going to continue to test it," Rubio said.
He stressed that other steps are being taken to put pressure on Russia to end the war. In particular, the United States has imposed additional sanctions on Russian oil, and in U.S. talks with India, commitments were obtained to halt further purchases of Russian oil. On the other hand, the PURL program continues: U.S. weapons are being sold to support Ukraine's war effort.
"So all these continue. Nothing has stopped. […] What we can't answer – but we're going to continue to test – is whether there is an outcome that Ukraine can live with and that Russia will accept," Rubio said.
He described as "progress" the fact that, for the first time in many years, at least at the technical level, military officials from both sides met last week. He added that there will be further meetings, including next Tuesday, "although it may not be the same group of people."
"We're going to continue to do everything we can to play this role of bringing this war to the end. I don't think anybody in this room would be against a negotiated settlement to this war so long as the conditions are just and sustainable. And that's what we aim to achieve and we're going to continue to try to achieve it even as all these other things continue to happen on the sanctions front and so forth," Rubio concluded.

Marco Rubio stresses intertwined destiny of US and Europe at security conference
- Marco Rubio, US Secretary of State, addressed the Munich Security Conference, stressing the intertwined destiny of the United States and Europe, in contrast to a previous critical speech by JD Vance.
- Rubio criticised past Western mistakes, labelling the “rules-based global order” a 'dangerous delusion' and stating that the UN has failed on pressing global matters.
- He emphasised that the US expects seriousness and reciprocity from European allies, while acknowledging shared responsibility for past errors and the need to rebuild.
- Rubio's absence from a meeting of Ukraine's allies at the conference raised concerns among Europeans about US commitment to the conflict.
- Sir Keir Starmer is expected to call for increased European defence spending and closer ties with the EU, arguing against reliance on America and warning against inward-looking policies.

Shadowlands review: Sanitised production can’t capture the darker realities of mortality
Hugh Bonneville brings plenty of affable charm to his role as the ‘Narnia’ author CS Lewis, but it’s an unstintingly mild-mannered performance in a deeply joyless play
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
At the end of CS Lewis’s classic Narnia series [spoiler alert], the children find out that they’ve died in the real world – and that the magical land they’ve been having such wonderful adventures in is actually a version of heaven, where they’ll live for ever. If you find that idea at all disconcerting or mawkish, then don’t dream of setting foot in the heavily moralistic, intensely sentimental world of film-turned-play Shadowlands. It opens with a gown-clad Lewis sermonising that real life is a shadowy land compared with the golden rewards after. Then, it shows him testing his faith to its limits, when his late-blooming love affair takes a tragic turn.
Television’s favourite nicely brought up Englishman Hugh Bonneville (Downton Abbey, Paddington) brings plenty of affable charm to this devout, emotionally repressed character, but neither this sanitised production nor his unstintingly mild-mannered performance can capture the darker realities of grief, sex and mortality.
The real CS Lewis had a personal life that was a lot more complicated and colourful than his sermons. Despite preaching about the joys of marriage, he cohabited with a woman (and her young daughter) for decades, and scholars who’ve scrutinised his diaries reckon it’s pretty clear they were lovers. Here, writer William Nicholson brushes this awkward biographical reality under the carpet. Instead, he paints Lewis as a lonely little boy in a tweed-suited, middle-aged gentleman’s body. When he meets married American poet Joy Davidman (the vivacious Maggie Siff), she’s portrayed as the first female interloper to enter his bachelor pad – and when they finally tie the knot, she must tenderly reassure him that he can still kneel down to say his prayers in his PJs, unmolested.
Still, if you can resist the temptation to be cynical, these early scenes are pretty charming. Siff captures all the gauche impulsivity of a woman who set sail from New York just to take tea with her literary idol, and who carries her poems inside her like an unexploded bomb, to be defused carefully in a controlled environment. She’s a dangerous addition to Lewis’s staid social set: learned men who cluster in his book-lined house like black-gowned crows, pecking away at dusty matters of literature and theology. Timothy Watson stays just the right side of panto villain as the meanest of them, Sir Christopher, who sees women as unreasoning creatures to be avoided at all costs. Needless to say, Lewis disagrees.
He bonds with Joy over poetry: “Desire is a baby” and it must be fed, they tell each other, quoting 16th-century poet Sir Philip Sidney as justification for their increasingly modern relationship. They take tea, and she slips her way into his life, awkwardly third-wheeled by the brother he lives with. Then, tragedy forces this couple out of their shadows.
Rachel Kavanaugh’s production injects little notes of magic – a forest beyond the bookshelves, softly falling snow – that help suggest the imaginative landscapes that Joy and Lewis tread together. But there’s still something deeply joyless about this play’s reluctance to show the couple actually being happy together before they descend into a world of hospitals and misery. It’s as though the knowledge that Joy is a scandalously divorced woman (and thus ineligible for traditional Christian marriage) means that Nicholson can only justify depicting their love when the character is at death’s door.
The bleaker second act swaps flirtation for a heavily romanticised depiction of Joy’s suffering, complete with melodramatic cries of agony and much-discussed crises of faith. There are audiences who’ll lap it all up as an emotive alternative to a church sermon, but they deserve better. Real life is much more complicated than the fridge magnet quote-worthy moralising that fills this play’s later scenes, and an author with the imaginative power to turn God into a friendly lion would have understood that.

The United States will continue efforts to achieve a peaceful settlement to Russia’s war against Ukraine and to find a negotiated solution that would satisfy all parties, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said at the Munich Security Conference on Saturday.
He said something they can’t answer, but we will continue to test, is whether there is an outcome that Ukraine can live with and that Russia will accept. And he also added that up until now, that had been elusive.

Russia denies BRICS seeks to transform into a military alliance
‘It was never conceived in that spirit,’ deputy foreign minister tells state media
ISTANBUL
Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov on Saturday denied that the BRICS economic bloc sought to transform into a military alliance.
In an interview with the state news agency TASS, Ryabkov said BRICS is neither a military alliance nor a collective security organization with obligations regarding mutual military assistance.
“It was never conceived in that spirit, and there are no plans to transform BRICS in that direction,” Ryabkov said, arguing that the 11-member bloc’s portfolio does not include military exercises or arms control.
Ryabkov also denied a recent naval exercise held in South Africa was a “BRICS event,” and that members that took part did so in their national capacity. He was referring to the “Will for Peace 2026” drills held on Jan. 9-16, which included China, Iran, and Russia.
Asked whether BRICS could protect tankers belonging to members from attacks and ensure their safety, Ryabkov said the bloc has no potential beyond improving logistics and ensuring greater protection from sanctions, and that security must be “ensured by other means.”
BRICS was formed in 2009 by Brazil, Russia, India, and China, with South Africa joining in 2010. Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Ethiopia, Indonesia, and Iran later joined, expanding the group to 11 members, alongside 10 partner countries.
The Russian deputy foreign minister said the growth of trade between BRICS countries significantly exceeds the global average, “an indication that BRICS, without being some kind of 'magic wand,’ can actually help solve problems."
Ryabkov said BRICS can and should express solidarity with Iran, and that Moscow and Beijing are in contact with the country and working on “ensuring the appropriate political environment” for negotiations between Tehran and Washington.
According to him, the focus now is “on the negotiations Iran is conducting with its partners, on the work Iran is doing indirectly — primarily through Arab intermediaries — with the Americans,” which he believes will continue.
The US and Iran held indirect talks in Muscat on Feb. 6 with Omani mediation to discuss Tehran’s nuclear program, marking the end of a roughly eight-month suspension after the US launched strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities during the 12-day Iran-Israel war in June 2025.
Washington has also significantly increased its military footprint in the region as US President Donald Trump warns Iran, which recently faced widespread protests over worsening economic conditions, that it must make a deal.
Uranium enrichment remains a central point of dispute, with the US demanding Iran halt uranium enrichment and transfer highly enriched uranium out of the country.
The US has also sought to include Iran’s missile program and its support for armed groups in the region in the negotiations, but Tehran has repeatedly said it would not negotiate issues beyond its nuclear program.

European countries discuss possible seizure of tankers from Russia' shadow fleet

European countries discuss possible seizure of tankers from Russia' shadow fleet
UK Defence Secretary John Healey has met with his counterparts from the Baltic and Nordic countries to discuss the possible seizure of oil tankers linked to Russia's shadow fleet.
Source: Bloomberg, citing a source familiar with the matter, as reported by European Pravda
Details: Bloomberg's source reported that the Joint Expeditionary Force – a group of 10 countries with shared interests in the North Atlantic and the Baltic Sea – met on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference.
The meeting underscores a growing willingness among European allies to step up efforts to reduce the revenues that fund Russia's war against Ukraine, Bloomberg said.
"The atmosphere and the understanding was that we need to be more proactive. The message is that the countries who give flags to the shadow fleet vessels need to know that there are measures that can be taken by other countries," Estonian Defence Minister Hanno Pevkur said in an interview after joining the meeting.
Further discussions are needed before any decision is taken, Pevkur noted.
However, Estonian Foreign Minister Margus Tsahkna said that some members remain cautious, fearing escalation.
According to sources, Healey was joined at the meeting by Richard Knighton, Chief of the UK Defence Staff, who presented options, including joint seizure operations.
This would allow the Joint Expeditionary Force to build on US interceptions of tankers sailing to and from Venezuela.
The source added that it remains unclear to what extent the United States would be involved in the UK-led efforts, though some coordination is likely.
The detention of vessels linked to Russia has caused concern in Moscow, and Russian officials have privately demanded that the US halt such actions, the source said.
Background:
- On 9 January, the United States seized the tanker Olina in the Caribbean Sea amid intensified efforts by Washington to restrict exports of Venezuelan oil.
- On 7 January. US forces took control of two tankers, including the Russian-flagged vessel Bella 1 (Marinera), which they had pursued for more than two weeks.
- At the end of January, a group of 14 European countries issued a public warning to Russian shadow fleet tankers operating in the Baltic and North seas.

'We don't always agree with what she says': UN Chief Guterres distances himself from Albanese

UN Secretary-General António Guterres distanced himself from UN Special Rapporteur Francesca Albanese after several member states criticized her speech at the 17th Al Jazeera Forum in Doha last weekend.
“We’ve always believed that the institution of special rapporteurs, while being completely separate from the secretary-general, is an important part of the international human rights architecture. We don’t always agree with what they say, and that includes Ms. Albanese,” Guterres’ spokesperson, Stéphane Dujarric, said.
Dujarric added that Guterres’ office “doesn’t agree with much of what she says, and wouldn’t use the language that she uses to describe the situation in the region.”
Albanese ignited rebukes from an array of world leaders when she suggested that Israel was “a common enemy” for all.
“Instead of stopping Israel, most of the world has armed” it, she said, adding that the international community has given the Jewish state “political sheltering and economic and financial support.”
“We who do not control large amounts of financial capital, algorithms, and weapons – we now see that we as humanity have a common enemy,” Albanese continued.
When questioned further regarding Albanese’s comments during the Al Jazeera Forum, Dujarric said, “I’m not here to defend what she says or criticize what she says, right? She has a right, as a special rapporteur, to speak within her mandate. People have a right to criticize her. People have a right to support her.”
He went on to say that if someone was unsatisfied with Albanese’s work, there were mechanisms to address it, citing France’s request to remove Albanese from her post.
Dujarric refused to comment on whether Guterres had listened to Albanese’s speech, telling reporters, “You should ask him instead.”
Albanese under heavy fire for antisemitic speech
Italy and Austria supported France’s calls to oust Albanese from her position as a UN special rapporteur, citing her speech during the forum, which representatives of Hamas and Iran attended.
The vice president of the Council of Ministers of Italy, Antonio Tajani, wrote on X/Twitter that Albanese’s comments do not reflect the Italian government’s position.
“Her behaviors, statements, and initiatives are not appropriate for the position she holds within a body of peace and guarantee, such as the United Nations,” he wrote.
Austria’s Federal Minister for European and International Affairs, Beate Meinl-Reisinger, said that Albanese branded Israel an “enemy of humanity."
She slammed the UN special rapporteur for using language that “undermines the impartiality and highest standards that the role of a UN representative requires.”
France, meanwhile, will demand Albanese’s resignation during the United Nations Human Rights Council session set for February 23, French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot announced during a parliamentary meeting this past week.
Albanese’s comments, Barrot said, “target not the Israeli government, whose policies can be criticized, but Israel as a people and as a nation, which is absolutely unacceptable.”
In response to the accusations leveled against her, she blamed her critics for not condemning Israel with the same conviction, as she put it.
She said her words were misinterpreted and taken out of context.
Releasing the full video of her statement to support her stance, Albanese said, the common enemy of humanity is the broader system she blames for Israel’s actions, not the country itself, per se.

'US freed captives from barbarians in Gaza': Rubio calls out UN's inability to solve conflicts

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio called out the United Nations’ inability to solve world conflicts, including liberating the former Gaza hostages from Hamas captivity and striking Iran’s nuclear program, and asked for the organization to be reformed on Saturday.
Rubio spoke at the 2026 Munich Security Conference, noting that “it was US leadership who freed captives from barbarians [in Gaza], and brought about a fragile truce.”
He also cited the 12-day war with Iran last June, saying that the UN was “powerless to constrain the nuclear program of radical Shia clerics of Tehran.”
“That required 14 bombs dropped with precision by American B-2 bombers,” Rubio explained. He also pointed out the US government’s role in both the Ukraine-Russia war negotiations and the capture of Venezuelan dictator Nicolas Maduro.
“We cannot allow those who blatantly threaten our citizens, and endanger our global stability, to shield themselves behind abstractions of international law which they themselves routinely violate,” he added.
Iran can't be allowed to have nuclear weapons
In dialogue with Bloomberg, Rubio also talked about the risk of Iran getting nuclear weapons. “That poses a threat not just to the United States, but also to Europe, to world security, and to the region. There’s no doubt about it,” he said.
He also explained that the US has sufficient firepower in the region to ensure that the regime doesn’t “make a mistake and come after us, and trigger something larger.”
He said that, even if US President Donald Trump said his preference was to reach a deal with Iran, it would be very hard to do so.
“And that’s what we’re trying to do right now, and Steve Witkoff and Jared [Kushner] have some meetings lined up fairly soon,” he added.
Rubio says United States and Europe 'belong together'
Rubio also gave a robust message of unity with Europe, saying Washington’s destiny was intertwined with Europe and that it had no intention of abandoning the Transatlantic alliance.
The keynote speech was a stark change from 2025, when Vice President JD Vance, speaking from the same stage, launched an attack on European leaders, accusing them of censoring free speech and failing to control immigration.
“In a time of headlines heralding the end of the Transatlantic era, let it be known and clear to all that this is neither our goal nor our wish, because for us Americans, our home may be in the Western Hemisphere, but we will always be a child of Europe,” Rubio said.

Chinese FM: Doors open for dialogue in Ukraine
Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, speaking on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference, said that "the door to dialogue in Ukraine is open, and all parties should strive to reach a comprehensive and lasting peace agreement and address the root causes of the conflict."
"The door to dialogue on the ‘Ukrainian crisis’ [Russia’s full-scale war against Ukraine] has finally opened. All interested parties must seize this opportunity to reach a comprehensive, lasting, and binding peace agreement, address the root causes of the conflict, and ensure lasting peace and stability in Europe," he said.
According to the Chinese Foreign Minister, "Europe should not watch this from the sidelines. It was here in Munich last year, when cooperation with Russia began, that Europe seemed to remain a bystander. And I said then that since the conflict erupted here in Europe, Europe has every right to participate in the negotiations at the appropriate time," he noted.
"I said that Europe shouldn’t be on the menu, but at the table. Now we see that Europe has found the courage to negotiate with Russia. This is good, and we support it," Wang Yi emphasized.
At the same time, he stated that "China is not a party directly involved in the conflict. We do not have the final say. We are only facilitating peace negotiations."
As previously reported, Wang Yi met with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio in Munich.

Budget standoff over immigration shuts down US Department of Homeland Security

Budget standoff over immigration shuts down US Department of Homeland Security
A prolonged impasse between US lawmakers over immigration enforcement ensnared the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in a partial government shutdown on Saturday, with Democrats in Congress vowing to withhold funding until major changes are enacted in the wake of two fatal shootings by federal immigration agents in Minneapolis.
The Department of Homeland Security entered a partial shutdown Saturday as US lawmakers fight over funding the agency overseeing much of President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown.
Thousands of government workers, from airport security agents to disaster relief officials, will either be furloughed or forced to work without pay until funding is agreed upon by Congress.
At the center of the budget dispute is the department's Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), whose agents killed two US citizens amid sweeping raids and mass protests in Minneapolis.
Democrats oppose any new funding for DHS until major changes are implemented over how ICE conducts its operations.
In particular, they have demanded curtailed patrols, a ban on ICE agents wearing face masks during operations and the requirement that they obtain a judicial warrant to enter private property.
Watch moreFacial recognition: ICE agents use app to scan US citizens and immigrants
"Donald Trump and Republicans have decided that they have zero interest in getting ICE under control," House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said Friday.
"Dramatic changes are needed," Jeffries told a news conference. "Absent that, Republicans have decided to shut down parts of the federal government."
White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt put the blame on the opposition, telling Fox News that "Democrats are barreling our government towards another shutdown for political and partisan reasons."
But while DHS faces a shutdown, ICE itself will remain operational, under funds approved in last year's government spending bill.
Senator John Fetterman pushed against his fellow Democrats, saying: "This shutdown literally has zero impact on ICE."
The primary impact would land on other agencies, including the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), which oversees emergency response to natural disasters.
The Transportation Security Administration, which runs airport safety, warned on X that a prolonged shutdown could result in longer wait times and cancelled flights.
Negotiations stalled
The shutdown would be the third of Trump's second term, including a record 43-day government closure last October and November.
The government just reopened from a smaller, four-day partial shutdown earlier this month, also over DHS funding.
Even if all 53 Republican senators vote to fund DHS, Senate rules require support from 60 of the body's 100 members to advance the budget bill, meaning several Democrats would need to get on board.
In response to the Democrats' demands, the White House said it was ready to negotiate over immigration enforcement policy.
Senate Majority Leader John Thune called it "an extremely serious offer", but warned Democrats are "never going to get their full wish list".
Some concessions were made during the previous shutdown amid Democratic pressure and national outcry after federal agents shot and killed Renée Good, a mother of three, and Alex Pretti, a nurse who worked with military veterans, in Minneapolis last month.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said federal agents in the city would wear body cameras "effective immediately" in a move that would be later "expanded nationwide".
The Senate went into recess for a week starting Thursday, but senators could be called back to Washington in case of a rapid leap in negotiations.
For the moment, however, talks between the White House and Democrats appear to be at a standstill.

As sub-zero cold grips the region, animals are guided into Budakli’s thermal baths near Güroymak, using the naturally heated water to remove barn dirt, ease physical stress and protect dairy output.
Every ten days, breeders walk them several kilometres for the soak, often spending hours guiding the herd through snow. Steam rises around dark silhouettes, drawing photographers to the valley below Nemrut volcano.
Locals say the routine helps wounds heal and keeps animals calm through winter, turning the springs into a simple, open-air spa.
Fed by geothermal heat from the Nemrut volcano, the Budakli Thermal Springs draw rainwater deep underground, where it warms inside fractured volcanic rock before resurfacing naturally at close to 40°C.

Checkout worker fired for drinking unpaid bottle of water
- A Lidl employee, Julian Oxborough, was dismissed from his job after drinking a 17p bottle of water without paying for it at the Wincanton store on 19 July 2024.
- Mr Oxborough, who had worked for Lidl for over a decade, claimed he was dehydrated and forgot to pay for the water, describing his dismissal as "a huge overreaction".
- Lidl's area manager, Karina Moon, found his explanations inconsistent and noted he had four days after the incident to report it but failed to do so.
- The company maintained a zero-tolerance policy on consuming unpaid stock, stating it was essential for their operations and that rules must be followed by everyone.
- An Employment Tribunal in Southampton upheld Lidl's decision, rejecting Mr Oxborough's claim for unfair dismissal.

Quantum Systems Unveils Previously Unknown Jet UAV

During a visit by a Ukrainian delegation to Quantum Frontline Industries, the first joint Ukrainian-German drone manufacturing enterprise, German company Quantum Systems unveiled a previously unknown jet UAV.
A video of the visit, which included footage of the new UAV, was published by Ukrinform.
According to the Office of the President, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky began his visit to Munich with a meeting with the management and employees of the first joint Ukrainian-German enterprise, Quantum Frontline Industries, which manufactures drones for the Armed Forces of Ukraine. German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius also took part in the meeting.
The head of state was shown the production lines and tested the first strike drone manufactured there. The technology for the production of drones is Ukrainian. They claim that they are equipped with artificial intelligence and have already proven their effectiveness on the front lines.
During the delegation’s visit, the German company Quantum Systems, one of the founders of the joint venture, also presented its line of drones. Among them, journalists filmed a previously unknown jet UAV.
No additional information about the characteristics or purpose of this drone is currently available. Judging by its appearance, it can be assumed that this is a middle strike attack drone with a relatively small warhead. Another possible use could be as a jet interceptor drone.
Given the appearance of the model presented, as well as the fact that it has not been publicly reported on before, it is likely that this UAV is still in the development stage.
As a reminder, in December 2025, the German company Quantum Systems and the Ukrainian drone manufacturer Frontline Robotics announced the creation of a joint venture, Quantum Frontline Industries.
The new company plans to scale up the production of Ukrainian defense solutions using German automation expertise.
The new line will produce the Zoom and Linza drones developed by Frontline Robotics. All systems manufactured in Germany will be supplied to the Ukrainian military in quantities determined by the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine. In a comment to Militarnyi, Frontline said it plans to produce more than 10,000 drones per year.

‘Bangladesh will be better’: BNP victory puts nation at crossroads
The victorious Bangladesh Nationalist Party supporters are jubilant, but analysts warn of challenges ahead.
As rickshaw puller Anwar Pagla turned into the road leading to the Bangladesh Nationalist Party’s (BNP) office in Gulshan, Dhaka, on the afternoon after the parliamentary election, a small commotion stirred. His rickshaw had a Bangladeshi flag fixed to one side of the hood and the BNP’s flag to the other. Pagla is an ardent supporter.
“They call me mad because I consider this party everything in my life. But it doesn’t matter. We have won and Bangladesh will now be better,” he told Al Jazeera.

Nearly two decades after it last governed, the BNP returned to power after a landslide victory in Thursday’s parliamentary election.
The Election Commission published the gazette of the members of parliament elected, a final official seal on the election process, on Saturday. The centre-right BNP’s alliance secured 212 of the 300 seats. The alliance led by its main rival, the Jamaat-e-Islami – Bangladesh’s largest religion-based party – secured 77.
Those elections came a year and a half after a nationwide protest movement ousted the country’s former leadership and saw 1,400 people killed in the streets. Bangladesh has been led by a caretaker government since Sheikh Hasina, who led the crackdown, fled the country.
The BNP’s Tarique Rahman, set to become Bangladesh’s next prime minister, greeted supporters on Friday, saying he was “grateful for the love” they had shown him. He promised throughout BNP’s campaign to restore democracy in Bangladesh.
Mahdi Amin, BNP’s election steering committee spokesperson, said Rahman pledged that, as prime minister, he would safeguard the rights and freedoms of citizens.
Thursday’s vote passed largely peacefully, and, despite alleging “inconsistencies and fabrications” during the vote count, Jamaat accepted the outcome of the election on Saturday.
BNP had recently lost its former chairperson, Khaleda Zia – Tarique Rahman’s mother and a two-time prime minister – who died on December 30.
Khaleda Zia had led the party to power in 1991 and again in 2001. Two decades later, her son has returned the BNP to government.
At the party’s Gulshan office that afternoon, BNP activist Kamal Hossain stood among a jubilant crowd. Visibly emotional, he reflected on what he described as years of repression.
“For so long, I felt the regime of Sheikh Hasina would never go,” he said. Referring to the July 2024 uprising that forced her to flee, he added: “Now people have given us this mandate. We have taken back Bangladesh.”
Hossain said the new government’s immediate priorities should be job creation and curbing inflation.
“Prices have been hurting us, and there are too many unemployed young people. The government must address this immediately,” he said.
Meanwhile, the Bangladeshi capital, Dhaka, remained unusually quiet on Friday.
The calm was largely by design: the BNP chose not to hold victory processions.
The Jamaat head office in the capital’s Moghbazar also appeared subdued on Friday. A few supporters around the head office expressed disappointment.
“There has been engineering in the counting process, and the media has been biased against the Jamaat alliance,” said Abdus Salam, a supporter near the office. He argued that a fair process would have yielded more seats.
Others, like Germany-based Jamaat supporter Muaz Abdullah, said Jamaat’s defeat was a failure of organisation.
“In many constituencies, Jamaat didn’t run a good election campaign. They didn’t even have proper polling agents in several places,” he said.
Though the BNP and Jamaat were allies for years, they faced each other as rivals in this election. The campaign period saw sporadic violence and months of divisive online rhetoric.
Sujan Mia, a BNP activist outside the party office, struck a conciliatory tone. “We do not want enmity. We should focus on building the nation,” he said.
Rezaul Karim Rony, editor of Joban Magazine and a political analyst who closely followed the BNP’s campaign, said the party’s victory is likely to allay concerns of a lurch to the right in Bangladesh.
“Through this election, people have, in a sense, freed the country’s politics from that risk,” he argued.
However, Rony cautioned that the real test begins now.
“The challenge is to ensure good governance, law and order, and public safety – and to establish a rights-based state,” he said, describing those goals as being at the “heart of the aspirations of the 2024 mass uprising.”
Michael Kugelman, senior fellow for South Asia at the Atlantic Council, said a BNP victory represents “a blow to the politics of change that have galvanised Bangladesh since the 2024 mass uprising”.
“The BNP, dynastic and long saddled with corruption allegations, reflects the principles that the Gen Z protesters rejected,” he said.
The party will now face pressure from both the public and the opposition to push beyond old political habits, Kugelman added.
“If the new government falls back on repressive or retributive politics, reform advocates will be disappointed and democratisation efforts will be set back,” he said.
The outcome might be the least disruptive for the region as a whole.
Pakistan might have preferred a Jamaat win, given the party’s historical affinity for Islamabad. But Pakistan has also had strong relations with the BNP, Kugelman pointed out, as has China.
And “India much prefers the BNP to Jamaat,” he added, noting that the BNP is no longer in alliance with Jamaat, which New Delhi believes takes positions contrary to its interests.
Back at the BNP’s office in Dhaka, however, geopolitics felt distant.
Shamsud Doha, a party leader, had brought his two grandchildren to share the moment.
“Nothing matches this feeling,” he said. “We have long suffered under autocratic rule. Now it is our time to build the nation.”

As the 39th summit of the African Union opened in the Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa, the chair of the African Union Commission, Mahmoud Ali Youssouf, used his opening address to denounce what he described as the “extermination” of the Palestinian people, while António Guterres spoke to African leaders on Saturday, renewing his appeal for the continent to gain permanent representation on the United Nations Security Council; although this year’s official theme focuses on access to water and sanitation, ongoing conflicts across the continent—particularly in Sudan and the Democratic Republic of the Congo—have already pushed security to the forefront of discussions, as our correspondent Tom Canetti reports from Addis Ababa.

MUNICH – Secretary of State Marco Rubio cast the United States as the “child of Europe” in a message of unity on Feb 14, offering some reassurance as well as levelling more criticism at allies after a year of turmoil in transatlantic relations.
Mr Rubio was addressing the annual Munich Security Conference, where Europe’s leading powers have tried to project their own independence and strength while straining to keep a long-time alliance with the US under President Donald Trump alive.
The speech delivered a degree of respite to European countries who fear being left in the lurch on anything from the war in Ukraine to international trade ructions in a rapidly shifting global order.
But it was short on concrete commitments and made no mention of Russia, raising questions about whether Mr Rubio’s tone, more emollient than that of Vice-President J.D. Vance at the same event a year ago, would change the underlying dynamics.
“In a time of headlines heralding the end of the transatlantic era, let it be known and clear to all that this is neither our goal nor our wish, because for us Americans, our home may be in the Western Hemisphere, but we will always be a child of Europe,” Mr Rubio said.
“For the United States and Europe, we belong together,” he said in the speech, which drew a standing ovation at the end.
While European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said she was “very much reassured” by the speech and German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul called Mr Rubio a “true partner”, others struck a more cautious tone.
“I am not sure that Europeans see the announced civilisational decline, supposedly caused mainly by migration and deindustrialisation, as a core uniting interest. For most Europeans, the common interest is security,” said Mr Gabrielius Landsbergis, former foreign minister of NATO member Lithuania.
“This was not a departure from the general position of the (Trump) administration. It was simply delivered in more polite terms,” he said on X.
One particular area of anxiety is Ukraine, where allies have long worried about Mr Trump and Russia’s Vladimir Putin trying to ram through a deal on Moscow’s terms and force Kyiv to cede land to end Europe’s deadliest conflict since World War II.
On Feb 14, five European allies accused Russia of killing Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny using venom from poison dart frogs
The findings, attributed to analyses of samples taken from Navalny’s body, were released while Navalny’s widow Yulia Navalnaya was attending the Munich conference. “I was certain from the first day that my husband had been poisoned, but now there is proof,” she said on social media.
US-brokered peace talks resume next week in Geneva after a sustained bombardment of Ukrainian cities during one of the coldest winters in years killed civilians and left hundreds of thousands of people without power and water.
President Volodymyr Zelensky expressed hope at the conference
“The Americans often return to the topic of concessions and too often those concessions are discussed only in the context of Ukraine, not Russia,” Mr Zelensky said.
Rubio hits out at West’s ‘managed decline’
The Munich conference of top security leaders has been dominated this year by how countries are scrambling to adjust to a year of confrontations with Mr Trump on issues from tariffs to his threat to wrest Greenland
German Defence Minister Boris Pistorius said the transatlantic alliance depended on the predictability and reliability of the US.
“Questioning the territorial integrity and sovereignty of a NATO member state. Excluding European allies from negotiations that are crucial to the security on the continent. All this damages our alliance and strengthens our adversaries,” he said.
A 2025 address by Mr Vance,
While praising Europe’s cultural achievements from the artist Michelangelo to the poet William Shakespeare, Mr Rubio also touched on themes that have raised hackles, including criticism of mass migration and zealous action on climate change.
“We do not want our allies to be weak, because that makes us weaker,” he said.
“For we in America have no interest in being polite and orderly caretakers of the West’s managed decline. We do not seek to separate but to revitalise an old friendship and renew the greatest civilization in human history.”
French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot said he could see why Mr Rubio’s appeal to a common legacy had drawn applause.
“Is it going to change our strategy? Of course not. Because, you know, what we’re hearing today, we heard already in the past,” Mr Barrot said. REUTERS

China to scrap tariffs for most of Africa from May: Xi
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
BEIJING – Beijing’s scrapping of tariffs for all but one African country will start on May 1, Chinese President Xi Jinping said on Feb 14, according to state media.
China already has a zero-tariff policy for imports from 33 African countries,
China is Africa’s largest trading partner and a key backer of major infrastructure projects in the region through its vast “Belt and Road” initiative.
From May 1, zero tariffs will apply to all African countries except Eswatini, which maintains diplomatic relations with Taiwan.
China claims the democratic island as its own, and does not rule out using force to take it.
Many African countries are increasingly looking to China and other trading partners since US President Donald Trump imposed steep tariffs worldwide in 2025.
Mr Xi said the zero-tariff deal “will undoubtedly provide new opportunities for African development”, announcing the date as leaders across the continent gathered in Ethiopia for the annual African Union summit. AFP

Secretary of State Rubio insists US and Europe 'belong together'

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio sought to reassure a nervous Europe on Saturday, February 14, saying that Washington wanted to "revitalize" the transatlantic alliance so that a strong Europe could help the United States on its mission of global "renewal." Washington's top diplomat struck a markedly reassuring tone as he addressed a security conference in Munich after months of turmoil in US-European relations sparked by US President Donald Trump's vows to seize Greenland and his often derisive remarks about Washington's allies.
"We do not seek to separate, but to revitalize an old friendship and renew the greatest civilisation in human history," Rubio said. "What we want is a reinvigorated alliance." "We want Europe to be strong. We believe that Europe must survive," Rubio said, adding that the continent and the US "belong together."
The US will be "driven by a vision of a future as proud, as sovereign, and as vital as our civilization's past," he said. "And while we are prepared, if necessary, to do this alone, it is our preference and it is our hope to do this together with you, our friends here in Europe."
He echoed the Trump administration's oft-stated assertion that immigration was a threat, saying that "mass migration" was "a crisis which is transforming and destabilizing societies all across the West."
"We want allies who are proud of their culture and of their heritage, who understand that we are heirs to the same great and noble civilisation and together with us are willing and able to defend it."
"Acting together in this way, we will not just help recover a sane foreign policy... It will restore to us a clear sense of ourselves. It will restore a place in the world, and in so doing, it will rebuke and deter the forces of civilizational erasure that today menace both America and Europe alike."
Change in tone
Rubio's speech marked a sharp contrast to that of US Vice President JD Vance a year ago, when he used the same stage to attack European policies on immigration and free speech, shocking European allies.
Aside from the immigration issue, Rubio otherwise largely avoided the MAGA flashpoint and culture war issues that German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said Friday, had deepened a "rift" between US and Europe.
US-Europe ties were further strained by the Trump administration's new National Security Strategy, which launched an unprecedented attack against Europeans, charging that the continent was threatened with "civilizational decline."
Ties plunged further last month when Trump stepped up threats to annex Greenland, an autonomous territory of NATO member Denmark, forcing European nations to stand firm in protest.
European security
European leaders who have gathered at the Munich Security Conference have pledged to shoulder more of the burden of shared NATO defenses.
Key leaders have pushed the message that this is essential for Europe to counter a hostile Russia, with NATO chief Mark Rutte saying that "a strong Europe in a strong NATO means that the transatlantic bond will be stronger than ever."
European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen told the gathering that "Europe needs to step up and has to take on its responsibility" for its security and called for closer ties with Britain, saying "10 years on from Brexit our futures are as bound as ever."
French President Emmanuel Macron told the gathering on Friday that "this is the right time for a strong Europe," that would be "clear in the support of Ukraine" and "building its own architecture of security." "This Europe will be a good ally and partner for the United States of America," he said.
British leader Keir Starmer was expected to tell the conference that Europe is "a sleeping giant" and must rely less on the United States for its defense.
Ukraine war in focus
Merz on Friday had appealed to Washington: "Let's repair and revive transatlantic trust together." The high-powered Munich meeting of government leaders, diplomats, defense and intelligence chiefs comes shortly before Russia's full-scale war on Ukraine is set to enter its fifth grueling year.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who has been in Munich since Friday and meeting multiple allies, was expected to address the meeting on Saturday. No Russian officials have been invited. At the White House on Friday, Trump urged him to "get moving" to end the war. "Russia wants to make a deal... He has to move," the US leader said. "We don't know if the Russians are serious about ending the war," Rubio said in his speech on Saturday.
A German government source said Merz and Rubio met at the conference Friday and discussed "Ukraine, the status of negotiations with Russia and further support for the country, particularly in terms of military aid." They also discussed Europe's role in NATO and "Rubio praised Germany's steps to strengthen the alliance," the source added.
Macron said a new framework was needed to deal with "an aggressive Russia" once the fighting in Ukraine ends. Kremlin critic Mikhail Khodorkovsky said he feared "a new cold war" between Europe and Russia in the coming decade, making reopening dialogue with Moscow essential. "If it makes sense to talk, we are willing to talk," said Merz, but he also charged that "Russia is not yet willing to talk seriously."

UK, EU consider seizing Russian shadow fleet vessels – Bloomberg

UK, EU consider seizing Russian shadow fleet vessels – Bloomberg
That is according to Bloomberg, citing its own sources, Ukrinform reports.
According to the article, British Defense Secretary John Healey met with counterparts from Baltic and Nordic nations to discuss seizing oil tankers linked to Russia's shadow fleet.
The meeting of the Joint Expeditionary Force, a group of ten nations with a shared commitment to the North Atlantic and Baltic Sea, took place on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference, according to one of the participants and people familiar with the matter.
Healey was joined at the meeting by the head of Britain’s military, Richard Knighton, who presented options including joint seizure operations, according to the people, who asked not to be identified discussing private deliberations.
"The atmosphere and the understanding was that we need to be more proactive," Estonia's Defense Minister Hanno Pevkur said in an interview after joining the gathering. "The message is that the countries who give flags to the shadow fleet vessels need to know that there are measures that can be taken by other countries."
For his part, Estonian Foreign Minister Margus Tsahkna said in a separate interview that some members remain cautious given a "fear of escalation."
With such a move, the Joint Expeditionary Force would build on U.S. interdiction of tankers moving to and from Venezuela – sometimes with the help of allies – in the wake of President Nicolas Maduro’s capture. Several of those vessels have had ties to Russia.
It's unclear to what extent the U.S. would be involved in the UK-led effort but there would likely be some coordination, according to one of the people familiar with the matter. The interdictions of the Russia-linked vessels have prompted concern in Moscow, with Russian officials privately demanding that the U.S. stop, the person said.
The shadow fleet is a group of about 1,500 tankers that use false flags to appear legitimate without having to comply with regulations. More than 600 tankers have been sanctioned by some combination of the EU, the UK and the U.S. for their links to Russia.
On January 7, the UK helped the U.S. seize the oil tanker Marinera, which was sailing under a Russian flag, following a days-long chase after it left the Caribbean Sea. France’s navy boarded an oil tanker coming from Russia into the Mediterranean Sea on January 22.

Medical activities halted at Gaza hospital after reports of gunmen, suspected weapons transfers
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF), or Doctors Without Borders, has halted “non-critical” medical activities at a major hospital in southern Gaza, following reports from patients and its own staff of armed men inside the facility and concerns over the movement of weapons within it.
MSF’s statement appeared to mark the first time that an international humanitarian group in Gaza has publicly reported the presence of armed men in a hospital or the possible use of such a facility for moving weapons.
The Geneva-based medical charity said non-essential operations at Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis were suspended on Jan 20 over concerns with the “management of the structure, the safeguarding of its neutrality and security breaches”.
In recent months, patients and personnel had “seen armed men, some masked”, in areas of the hospital compound, MSF said.
The Hamas-run Interior Ministry said in a statement that it was committed to preventing any armed presence inside hospitals, and that legal action would be taken against violators. It suggested that armed members of certain Gazan families had recently entered hospitals, but did not identify those involved.
‘Unacceptable acts’ reported, including weapons movements
Israel and Hamas agreed to a ceasefire in October
Since the ceasefire, “MSF teams have reported a pattern of unacceptable acts, including the presence of armed men, intimidation, arbitrary arrests of patients and a recent situation of suspicion of movement of weapons”, it said.
According to Gaza’s Health Ministry, more than 590 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli troops
MSF disclosed the Nasser Hospital suspension in a “frequently asked questions” section on its website about its work in Gaza, last updated on Feb 11.
The armed men had been seen in areas of the hospital compound where MSF does not carry out activities, but their presence, along with suspected weapons transfers, posed serious security risks to patients and personnel, MSF said.
An MSF representative told Reuters the organisation continued to support some critical services at Nasser Hospital, including inpatient and surgical care for certain patients requiring life-saving treatment.
‘Hospitals must remain neutral spaces’
MSF said it had expressed concern to the relevant authorities, without detailing to whom the reports were submitted.
“Hospitals must remain neutral, civilian spaces, free from military presence or activity, to ensure the safe and impartial delivery of medical care,” MSF said.
Israel in January ordered MSF and 30 other international organisations to stop their work in Gaza and the Israeli-occupied West Bank if they did not meet new rules, including sharing details about their staff.
MSF on Jan 30 said it would not submit a staff list to Israel after failing to receive assurances over their safety.
Parts of tunnel network found under hospitals
The Israeli military says it has targeted hospitals during the war because Hamas fighters were operating inside them, and parts of Hamas’ tunnel network have been found running beneath medical facilities. The Palestinian Islamist group denies using hospitals for military purposes.
Some Israeli hostages, taken during Hamas’ Oct 7, 2023, attack on southern Israel that ignited the war, have said they were held at Nasser Hospital, the largest in southern Gaza.
Hospitals are protected sites under international law. Both attacking hospitals and their use for military purposes are typically considered a breach of law.
Although medical facilities can lose their protected status under certain conditions, rights groups say Israel has not shown sufficient evidence in many cases to justify its attacks on them during the war. REUTERS

Minister: Belarus and China have unique opportunities to deepen cultural ties

Ruslan Chernetsky
MINSK, 14 February (BelTA) – Belarus highly values its long-standing strategic partnership with China, Belarusian Culture Minister Ruslan Chernetsky said while speaking at a concert during the Happy Spring Festival 2026 event at the Minsk’s Palace of Culture of Trade Unions on 13 February, BelTA has learned.
The minister noted that the event is a vivid confirmation of the strength of the cultural bridges connecting Belarus and China. He emphasized that the Republic of Belarus highly values its long-standing strategic partnership with the People’s Republic of China, built on the principles of mutual respect, equality, and consideration of mutual interests.
“It is worth noting that our mutually beneficial cooperation is primarily built on the trust and friendship between the leaders of our countries: Belarusian President Aleksandr Lukashenko and Chinese President Xi Jinping. Our countries have built a robust architecture of interaction, encompassing fruitful cooperation in all key areas,” the minister said.
Ruslan Chernetsky pointed to the dynamically developing cultural ties between the two countries. “To date, a solid and multi-level foundation for comprehensive cultural cooperation has been formed between our states. We have a full range of necessary conditions – from the regulatory and legal framework enshrined in intergovernmental and interdepartmental agreements to a developed network of informal contacts, friendly and personal ties. All this creates unique opportunities to further deepen cultural dialogue and strengthening mutual understanding between our peoples,” the minister believes.
“Our artistic groups actively and permanently tour China. For example, just last year, the Bolshoi Theatre of Opera and Ballet successfully gave concerts in 12 Chinese cities, and the National Theatre of Belarusian Drama staged seven performances in Shanghai,” he added.
Ruslan Chernetsky also said that landmark exhibitions are held in museums of Belarus and China, emphasizing the strong cultural connection between our peoples. For instance, Shanghai hosted the exhibition titled as With the Blood of the Heart about Belarusian frontline writers, while in Minsk, the National Historical Museum displayed the unique exhibition The Thread of Fate. Belarus – China, which for the first time featured postcards and photographs of Northern China from private collections, as well as gifts from Chinese delegations and a collection of numismatic and banknote items from the funds of the National Historical Museum of Belarus.
According to the minister, the development of cinematic dialogue between Belarus and China deserves special attention.
“Chinese masters of screen art have long and firmly secured a worthy place in the program of the Minsk international film festival Listapad. A particular milestone was the second Chinese Cinema Day held within the festival’s framework. This event is certainly acquiring the status of a good tradition, enriching the festival’s palette with genuine masterpieces of Chinese cinematography and strengthening the cultural bridges between our countries. In turn, Belarusian cinema is confidently gaining recognition in China. A vivid confirmation of this is the success of the film The Black Castle by the national film studio Belarusfilm, which was awarded a prestigious prize for best production design at the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation Film Festival in Chongqing,” the head of the ministry stated.
Furthermore, the minister noted that nearly one thousand Chinese students are studying in Belarusian cultural institutions.
“Various educational programs are being implemented with Chinese partners, and summer schools are organized to introduce Belarusian culture. Every student, every joint project, every cultural meeting lays the foundation for a long-term partnership based on mutual respect and a sincere interest in each other’s spiritual values,” the Belarusian culture minister summarized.

DHS says ICE agents may have lied about Minnesota shooting, placed on leave

DHS says ICE agents may have lied about Minnesota shooting, placed on leave
Video review raises questions over sworn testimony after Venezuelan immigrant shot during enforcement operation
ISTANBUL
The US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said on Friday that two federal immigration agents involved in the Jan. 14 shooting of a Venezuelan immigrant in Minneapolis appear to have provided false sworn testimony.
NPR reported that DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said the officers were placed on administrative leave after a joint review by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and the Justice Department examined video evidence that indicated “untruthful statements” may have been made.
“The men and women of ICE are entrusted with upholding the rule of law and are held to the highest standards of professionalism, integrity, and ethical conduct,” McLaughlin said. “Violations of this sacred sworn oath will not be tolerated.”
The incident involved Julio Cesar Sosa-Celis, who was shot in the leg during what DHS initially described as a self-defense response after agents were “ambushed and attacked” during a targeted traffic stop.
However, eyewitness accounts, including testimony from his partner, Indriany Mendoza Camacho, disputed that version of events. “I'm a witness, I saw everything, and my partner never grabbed anything to hit him or anything like that,” she told Minnesota Public Radio.
Federal prosecutors on Thursday dropped charges against Sosa-Celis and another Venezuelan man previously accused of assaulting officers, while DHS said the agents could face dismissal or criminal prosecution depending on the outcome of the investigation.
The shooting occurred during Operation Metro Surge, a large-scale immigration enforcement campaign launched in December that deployed roughly 3,000 federal agents across Minnesota.
The Trump administration announced the operation’s end this week after more than 4,000 arrests, according to White House border czar Tom Homan, as federal authorities continue to investigate multiple fatal incidents linked to the crackdown.

Virginia Supreme Court clears path for redistricting referendum amid national map battle
Voters will decide in April 21 special election whether lawmakers can redraw congressional districts through 2030, as legal challenges continue and partisan tensions rise ahead of US midterms
ISTANBUL
Virginia’s Supreme Court has cleared the way for a spring referendum on congressional redistricting, intensifying a broader national struggle over electoral maps ahead of the US midterm elections, according to a report.
The Washington Times reported on Friday that the court allowed the April 21 special election to proceed while legal challenges continue, meaning voters could decide whether to grant Virginia’s legislature authority to redraw districts through 2030, temporarily overriding the bipartisan commission created by a 2020 constitutional amendment.
Early voting is set to begin on March 6.
‘Virginians will have final say’
Democratic lawmakers have framed the proposal as a response to Republican-led mid-decade redistricting efforts in states such as Texas, North Carolina, Ohio, and Missouri, moves encouraged by President Donald Trump to help Republicans protect their narrow US House majority.
GOP-led Texas was among the first to revise maps, prompting countermeasures from Democratic-led states, including California.
Supporters welcomed the court’s decision.
“Today’s order is a huge win for Virginia voters,” Dan Gottlieb, spokesperson for Virginians for Fair Elections, said in a statement. “The Court made it clear that nothing in this case stops the April 21 referendum from moving forward and that Virginians will have the final say.”
Opponents argue the initiative reverses bipartisan reforms designed to remove politicians from the map-drawing process.
A coalition, including former Virginia governor and US senator George Allen, urged voters to reject the measure, warning: “Thanks to the strong recent vote of the people, Virginia has much better standards of fairness than this. We must stand above these sorts of political election-rigging schemes.”
The legality of the process remains under review by the state’s highest court, leaving open the possibility that the ballot measure could be invalidated even after votes are cast.

Rubio: We don't know whether Russia is serious about ending war, but we'll see
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has said the United States does not know how serious Russia is about the negotiations to settle its war against Ukraine but will continue to test this.
Source: Rubio speaking at the Munich Security Conference (MSC), responding to a question from MSC Chair Wolfgang Ischinger, as reported by European Pravda
Details: In the context of the negotiations to resolve Russia's war against Ukraine, Rubio noted that the range of issues to be resolved has narrowed, but he said the hardest questions to answer remain.
Quote: "We don't know if the Russians are serious about ending the war – they say they are – and under what terms they are willing to do it, and whether we can find terms that are acceptable to Ukraine that Russia will always agree to. However, we're going to continue to test it."
Details: Rubio believes the US has made progress in the negotiations between Ukraine and Russia.
"I don't think anybody in this room would be against a negotiated settlement to this war, so long as the conditions are just and sustainable. And that's what we aim to achieve, but we're going to continue to try to achieve it even as all these other things continue to happen on the sanctions front and so forth," Rubio noted.
Background:
- A new round of talks between Ukraine, the US and Russia will take place in Geneva on 17-18 February.
- Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told journalists that the US has proposed ending Russia's war against Ukraine by the summer, as later it will have another priority – the congressional elections.
- US President Donald Trump has stated that Zelenskyy has to "move" and reach a deal to end the war.

Ben Gvir's Ofer prison visit sparks widespread backlash

ALBAWABA - The visit of Israel's National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir to Ofer Prison near Ramallah has elicited a significant amount of online backlash. This was due to the dissemination of videos that depicted the harsh treatment of Palestinian detainees during the inspection, which was described by activists.
Ben-Gvir and the chief of the Israeli Prison Service toured the facility on Friday, according to Israeli media reports, just days before the Muslim holy month of Ramadan began. Prisoner cabins were examined during the visit.
It appeared that Israeli forces were employing tear gas and stun grenades inside prison sections, while simultaneously pointing weapons toward detainees inside their cells, according to footage shared on social media. The scenarios elicited strong reactions from activists and rights advocates, who condemned the ongoing abuse that they perceived within Israeli detention facilities.
Ben-Gvir reportedly cautioned prisoners against any unrest during Ramadan and defended the changes that were instituted under his leadership during the visit. He declared that prisons had evolved into "real prisons and not hotels," a reference to the more stringent conditions that had been implemented since his election.
Reaction on Social Media
The videos rapidly acquired popularity on the internet, prompting a debate among human rights advocates and commentators. Numerous individuals contended that the footage did not reveal novel practices; rather, it underscored the systematic maltreatment that Palestinian detainees endure, which includes punitive measures, beatings, and deteriorating living conditions.
According to certain critics, the minister's presence within the prison indicated a hardline political posture that was intended to bolster his public image. Others emphasized the international community's inconsistent responses, observing that certain detainee cases receive increased global attention, while allegations of maltreatment against Palestinian prisoners receive less scrutiny.
Expanded Context
The incident occurred in the wake of the announcement of the death of detainee medic Hatem Rayan, who was purportedly apprehended at Kamal Adwan Hospital in northern Gaza while conducting humanitarian work. The conditions within Israeli prisons were once again the subject of attention following his death.
International intervention and accountability have been advocated for by rights organizations. A report was published in January 2026 by the Israeli human rights organization B'Tselem, which alleged that there were pervasive abuses occurring in Israeli prisons and detention centers. The organization characterized the system as one that encompassed severe restrictions on detainees, medical neglect, and physical and psychological maltreatment.
According to the report, between October 2023 and December 2025, a minimum of 84 Palestinian prisoners perished while in custody. Other human rights organizations have provided figures that are more substantial. According to data from the Israeli prison authorities as of September 2025, over 10,800 Palestinians, including minors and women, were detained in Israeli prisons.
Activists continue to advocate for increased international supervision of prison conditions, particularly in anticipation of Ramadan, when concerns regarding restrictions and treatment frequently escalate, as tensions remain elevated.

Canadian Prime Minister and opposition leader join hands in poignant moment at mass shooting vigil
Mark Carney named each of the six people killed at Tumbler Ridge Secondary School and said the mother and brother of the shooter who were killed also ‘deserve to be mourned’

Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney and the country’s main opposition leader held hands Friday as they paid tribute to the victims of one of the worst mass shootings in the country’s history at a vigil in a devastated British Columbia town.
Carney and Opposition Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre joined hands as an Indigenous leader sang a prayer outside the town hall in Tumbler Ridge.
Carney and Poilievre also spoke. The prime minister named each of the six people killed at Tumbler Ridge Secondary School and said the mother and brother of the shooter who were killed also “deserve to be mourned.”
Authorities said the 18-year-old alleged shooter, identified as Jesse Van Rootselaar, killed her 39-year-old mother, Jennifer Jacobs, and 11-year-old stepbrother, Emmett Jacobs, in their home on Tuesday before heading to the nearby Tumbler Ridge Secondary School and opening fire, killing five children and an educator before killing herself.
Carney said he sat with people who are “living through something no one should ever have to endure.”
“When you wake up tomorrow, and the world feels impossible, know that millions of Canadians are with you. When the cameras leave and the quiet sets in — know that we will still be here,” Carney said.
A crowd of hundreds attended the vigil. Some held photos of loved ones they lost.
Carney said the community has always been defined by people caring for each other.
“And when the unimaginable happened on Tuesday, you were there again. First responders at the school within two minutes. Teachers shielding their children,” he said.
Poilievre commended Carney for his “tremendous grace.” Canada’s political leaders flew from Ottawa together.
British Columbia Premier David Eby said the students of the school won’t ever have to return to the building if they don’t want to.
“I will promise that not one of you will ever be forced to go back to that school. We will provide a safe place for you to go back to school,” Eby said.
Authorities on Thursday identified those killed at the school as Kylie Smith, Abel Mwansa, Zoey Benoit and Ticaria Lampert, all age 12, as well as 13-year-old Ezekiel Schofield and assistant teacher Shannda Aviugana-Durand, 39.
Maya Gebala, 12, who was wounded in the head and neck, and Paige Hoekstra, 19, who also suffered bullet wounds, remain hospitalized in Vancouver.
Dwayne McDonald, the deputy commissioner of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in British Columbia, said earlier Friday that the alleged shooter did not appear to be searching for a specific target at the school.
“This suspect was, for lack of a better term, hunting,” McDonald said. “They were prepared and engaging anybody and everybody they could come in contact with.”
McDonald described a “chaotic” scene at the school when police arrived, with fire alarms sounding and a person yelling out a window that the suspect was upstairs.
“They entered the school, proceeded to go up the stairwell, and were met with gunfire,” he said. “It was a matter of seconds after that there was more gunfire, not as we know now, having reviewed video, directed at any persons. Then the suspect took their life.”
McDonald said from the time the suspect encountered police there were no further injuries to students at the school.
Four guns were seized, two from the family home and two from the school, he said.
The attack was Canada’s deadliest since 2020, when a gunman in Nova Scotia killed 13 people and set fires that left another nine dead.
School shootings are rare in Canada, which has strict gun-control laws. The government has responded to previous mass shootings with gun-control measures, including a recently broadened ban on all guns it considers assault weapons.

Jamaat-led bloc accepts Bangladesh polls outcome, will act as main opposition
Election Commission releases names of newly elected lawmakers, date of swearing-in yet to be announced
DHAKA, Bangladesh
Bangladesh's Jamaat-e-Islami party-led alliance on Saturday accepted the results of Thursday’s general election after claiming some irregularities in the ballot counting process.
In the election, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) secured 209 parliamentary seats, a two-thirds majority, while its close contender Jamaat won 68 seats.
The BNP-led alliance won 212 seats in total, whereas the Jamaat-led bloc won a total of 77 seats, with the remaining seats obtained by other parties and independent candidates.
Jamaat's chief Shafiqur Rahman said in a post on US social media platform Facebook early Saturday that his party and alliance accepted the overall election results.
“We recognize the overall outcome, and we respect the rule of law,” he added.
We will serve as a vigilant, principled, and peaceful opposition, holding the government to account while contributing constructively to national progress,” he noted.
He, however, alleged that some faced intimidation and harassment simply for exercising their democratic right.
Earlier, on Friday night, their alliance at a news conference alleged that there were some irregularities in the vote counting process as dozens of candidates won the competition in a tough competition and with a low margin.
One person was killed in post-election violence on Friday.
Meanwhile, interim government head Muhammad Yunus, in an official statement on Saturday, congratulated BNP chairperson Tarique Rahman on the landslide victory of his party under his leadership.
“This clear verdict of the people in the historic process of democratic transition will be a very important milestone in the country's constitutional and democratic continuity and institutional stability,” said Yunus.
Election Commission releases names of new MPs
Meanwhile, the Election Commission early Saturday published the official gazette notification, releasing the names of the newly elected lawmakers in 297 constituencies.
The voting in 299 of the 300-seat parliament was held on Thursday. The election in a constituency has been suspended due to the death of a candidate before the election.
More than 127.6 million people were eligible to cast ballots, and the country recorded a voter turnout of 59.44%, up from 41.8% in the January 2024 elections. Those polls were boycotted by the BNP-Jamaat opposition under ousted former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's government.
The date of the oath-taking ceremony, however, has not yet been announced by the government.
Earlier, law adviser Asif Nazrul said that due to the absence of the speaker or deputy speaker of the last parliament, the oath-taking ceremony of the new lawmakers will be administered by a "presidential nominee."
He also said that if no one takes the oath within three days of being elected, then the chief election commissioner can administer the oath.
The commission also officially published the referendum results on constitutional reforms. Votes in favor exceeded 60%, with a voter turnout of 59.44%.
Meanwhile, the EU Election Observation Mission vising Dhaka on Saturday at news conference termed Thursday's general elections as credible and a pivotal step toward restoring democracy and rule of law in Bangladesh.
“The electoral legal framework largely accords with international standards, while the Bangladesh Election Commission worked independently and transparently, maintaining stakeholders’ confidence and lending integrity to the polls,” Ivars Ijabs, a member of the European Parliament and the chief observer of the mission, said.

The Carmelitas street parade brought crowds into Santa Teresa on Friday, following a steep route beneath the Carmelite Convent of Santa Teresa overlooking Rio de Janeiro. Accompanied by samba bands, revellers moved uphill through the historic district, marking one of the first major street events of the carnival season.
Organisers scheduled a second, smaller procession for Saturday morning, aimed at local residents before larger blocos take over the city in the days ahead.
The Carmelitas group takes its name from the nearby Convento de Santa Teresa and a local tale of a nun who once slipped out to join the party. To help her blend in, dancers wear habits and march beside a giant doll dressed the same.
Started in the 1990s by locals inspired by gatherings at Parque das Ruínas, Carmelitas now draws thousands.

The US military said three suspected narco-terrorists were killed Friday when it carried out a strike in the Caribbean on a vessel allegedly tied to designated terror organizations and narcotics trafficking.
“On Feb. 13, at the direction of #SOUTHCOM commander Gen. Francis L. Donovan, Joint Task Force Southern Spear conducted a lethal kinetic strike on a vessel operated by Designated Terrorist Organizations,” US Southern Command (SOUTHCOM) said on US social media company X.
It added that the intelligence confirmed the vessel was “transiting along known narco-trafficking routes in the Caribbean and was engaged in narco-trafficking operations.”
It said no US military forces were harmed in the operation.

‘Carnage of concern and upset’: Women’s Institute groups close after transgender ban

At least 12 Women’s Institute (WI) groups are closing or considering closure after the organisation barred transgender women from membership.
Members say more groups are likely to close, and that the federation’s decision has opened up a toxic, traditionalist culture that will deter younger women from joining.
Branches said they felt forced to shut after the National Federation of Women’s Institutes (NFWI) confirmed that, from April, membership will be restricted to those registered female at birth. Several plan to relaunch as independent social groups.
The WI is one of the UK’s largest voluntary organisations, with thousands of local branches and about 180,000 members nationwide.
Emma Hawley, chair of Social Lites WI in Urmston, Greater Manchester – a group with nearly 140 members that has run for 13 years – said her entire committee has decided to step down.
“None of the other members want to take our places – many immediately said they weren’t even going to renew their membership,” she said.
“We’re all heartbroken. I’ve put 13 years into running this amazing group but I can’t, ethically or morally, be a member of something that excludes transgender women,” she said.
Seven Hills WI in Sheffield will also close after the current board decided to step down and no other members came forward.
Clementine Dexter, vice-president of Seven Hills WI, said the group received about 220 abusive online comments after posting that they were closing. “Out of 250 comments, there were just 30 that were supportive,” she said. “The rest were really abusive and awful.
“The NFWI’s decision has emboldened certain members to speak their minds and I think the federation has a serious issue as a result,” she said. “It’s going to struggle even more than it already does to attract younger members, and the more conservative members are going to be more emboldened to stick to what feels like a toxic culture.”
Dexter said she had met Melissa Green, NFWI chief executive. “We asked how this would be policed and were told that gender at birth would be included in the list of questions determining eligibility for membership,” she said. “Members have to reapply every year and that just feels really nasty. I can’t be a member of an organisation that does that.”
Even branches continuing under the new WI rules said they are facing practical fallout. Some have lost venues; others report speakers cancelling bookings.
Sophie Hossack, president of Ladies of the Lock WI in Kentish Town, London, said the venue they have used for nearly a decade has refused future bookings because of the policy.
“They said they did not feel comfortable renting their room to us because they are a trans-inclusive space,” she said.
Nora Salmon’s Hackney Wicked Women group – Hackney Wick’s WI – will also close next month. She said the NFWI’s decision had created “a carnage of concern and upset” and that groups had received little support.
“We were blindsided by their decision,” she said. “The lack of guidance and consultation has left us feeling betrayed. When we contacted them to say we’d lost members and were closing, the only response we got was, ‘We’re sorry to hear that’.”
The NFWI’s decision followed a 2025 UK supreme court judgment which held that the legal definition of a woman under the Equality Act 2010 refers to biological sex.
After reviewing the ruling, the NFWI announced it could no longer lawfully offer transgender women formal membership if it wished to continue operating as a women’s charity.
In its statement, the organisation said it was acting with “utmost regret and sadness”, adding it would create alternative “sisterhood groups” open to all. Approached for this article, the NFWI declined further comment.
Salmon said the move cut against the WI’s traditions. “The WI has alway been an incredibly grassroots organisation where every member has a say in how it’s run. But all that has been taken entirely out of our hands.”
Hawley agreed the decision ran counter to the WI’s prior ethos: “We pay our fees to be part of a collective but although we’ve asked for a consultation, that doesn’t seem to be planned,” she said.
For some branches, the implications of the ruling have actually worsened concerns rather than easing them.
Jules Mortimore of Wells Angels, a 125-member WI group in Tunbridge Wells that also plans to close, pointed out the ruling means transgender men could join WI groups.
“That is likely to be far more confronting and alarming for women than a trans woman,” she said.
“The fact that we also haven’t been contacted about this and given any guidance about what to tell our members or how to handle it suggests the WI just haven’t thought any of this through properly at all,” she added.
She said a WhatsApp network of about a dozen branches discussing closure is growing, with confusion and uncertainty driving increasing numbers of committees to consider leaving the NFWI.
Despite the upheaval, however, many departing members say they remain attached to the community spirit that defined their groups, and intend to preserve it outside the official structure.
“We’re going to reopen as an independent community group and we’re really positive about that,” said Mortimore.
For Hawley, the aim is continuity rather than rupture. “We’ve been through so much together and given each other so much support,” she said. “We just want to carry on doing that.”

Swiss becomes first woman to head chemical weapons body
Swiss ambassador Sabrina Dallafior will take the helm of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) as global tensions and technological developments threaten to undermine progress in eliminating stockpiles of chemical weapons.
After 25 years as a Swiss diplomat, Sabrina Dallafior is taking over as director-general of the OPCWExternal link in July, after more than a decade in which men, women and children from Syria to Ukraine and Britain to Malaysia have been increasingly targeted with often indiscriminate use of deadly toxins.
She will have to deal with risks of proliferation from rogue states and terror groups gaining access to technologies such as drones and artificial intelligence (AI).
That’s on top of weakening support for the international agencies that contained conflict after the Second World War as the United States, China and Russia jostle for global influence.
A previous three-year stint as ambassador to the UN-linked Conference on Disarmament in Geneva would provide essential experience for the job, the Swiss government said.
“Her selection from a pool of qualified candidates highlights Ambassador Dallafior’s merit, and her recognised expertise in arms control, disarmament and non-proliferation,” Jonas Montani, a foreign ministry spokesperson, told Swissinfo.

What was the chemical weapons agency set up to do?
The OPCW was created in 1997 to oversee implementation of the Chemical Weapons Convention, adopted in Paris four years earlier. It banned development, production, stockpiling, transfer and use of chemical weapons.
The Convention has been ratified by 193 nations, with only North Korea, Egypt and South Sudan not signing, and Israel signing without ratifying, a requirement for the treaty to become legally binding.
The organisation, while not a United Nations agency, works closely with the UN and conducts round-the-clock inspections at weapons destruction sites, investigates suspected attacks and can send inspectors or experts to any signatory country.

The body was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2013 for helping eliminate stockpiles, partly because of its work during the Syrian civil war in which thousands of civilians have been killed in repeated attacks by its government, as well as by jihadist terrorists.
The OPCW is neither a court nor a prosecutor. It seeks to establish responsibility but does not issue verdicts.
Reports are forwardedExternal link to the United Nations Security Council and may serve as a basis for resolutions, investigations and international pressure. States use its findings in preparing punitive sanctions.
External Content
What’s the background of the new director general?
Born in the northern Swiss city of Basel, Dallafior studied Eastern European history and Russian studies before joining the diplomatic service in 2000.
Her career has taken her from the Swiss missions to the European Union and NATO military alliance in Brussels to senior roles in Bern focused on multilateral security policy. Before her latest appointment, she was Switzerland’s ambassador to Finland.
“I will accord the highest importance to upholding the norm against chemical weapons,” she said in the statementExternal link announcing her appointment, adding that its “long-term sustainability” must be ensured by investigating all credible allegations.
The appointment of Dallafior to the head of a major international organisation represents a success for Swiss diplomacy.
Filling such positions with Swiss politicians or diplomats is a strategic objective of the foreign ministry, aimed at safeguarding Swiss interests and enabling Switzerland to help shape international policy.
In addition, Switzerland is home to the Spiez Laboratory,External link a world-leading specialist institution that is part of the network of OPCW-designated laboratories.
What attacks has the agency worked on and what has it achieved?
Syria was the most prominent location of chemical weapons attacks during the 2010s as President Bashar al-Assad, supported by Russia, clung to power following so-called Arab Spring protests that spread across the Middle East and North Africa.
Even after Assad’s ousting in 2024, more than 100 chemical weapons sites were believed to remain in the country, much higher than prior estimates, the OPCW saidExternal link last year.
Since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, both Moscow and Kyiv have repeatedly accused each other of using chemical weapons.
At Ukraine’s request, the OPCW provided technical and protective assistance and confirmed the use of banned chemical substances on the battlefield in reports released in 2024 and 2025.
The organisation has also been involved in probes into high-profile political poisonings, including the Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalny with the nerve agent Novichok in 2020 and an attack on former spy Sergei SkripalExternal link and his daughter in the UK in 2018. Britain and independent investigators produced evidence of the involvement of Russian military intelligence in the assassination attempt, which Moscow denied.
After the Skripal case, and despite opposition from Russia, OPCW member countries agreed to expand the agency’s mandateExternal link to allow it to document responsibility for use of chemical weapons. Previously inspectors were only permitted to investigate suspected attacks, and identify toxins, without saying who carried them out.
Perhaps the organisation’s greatest success to date was its announcementExternal link in 2023 that it had verified the destruction of all the world’s “declared” chemical stockpiles, or those that member nations had admitted to holding.
External Content
How is the chemical weapons ban being undermined?
Despite such achievements, accusations remain that countries are still using banned substances against foreign enemies, as well as their own populations.
Authorities in Georgia used a First World War-era poison against protestors in the capital, Tbilisi, the BBC reportedExternal link in December, citing a peer-reviewed study accepted for publication by Toxicology Reports, an international journal.
The government of Iran is also among those accused of using toxins, according to a reportExternal link by the Chemical Weapons Convention Coalition, a network of NGOs that partnersExternal link with the OPCW to support treaty objectives.
The regime has used live munitions against mass protests in recent months, with state television saying more than 3,000 have died. Others estimate the figure at as much as ten times higherExternal link.
While Dallafior has stressed that protecting the norm against use of chemical weapons is her top priority, institutions such as Britain’s Ministry of DefenceExternal link and InterpolExternal link have warned that it is at risk of being eroded.
“The taboo against chemicals weapons use has been degraded in the past decade,” Natasha Hall, a senior associate for the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, wrote in a researchExternal link report in October 2024 after interviewing US and allied government officials, members of the OPCW and other experts in the field. “Actors would likely choose a gradual approach to test the limits of international condemnation,” she said.
“Escalating tensions between the United States and Russia, coupled with fractures in the international community, challenge existing mechanisms for chemicals weapons control and accountability,” Hall added in the report for the Washington thinktank.
A further threat comes from the spread of advanced computing, drone technology and so-called dual-use chemicals that can be utilised for civilian or military purposes.
The OPCW’s current director-general, Fernando Arias, saidExternal link in November that the body was increasingly focused on how to ensure that technological advances reinforced rather than undermined its verification efforts and oversight of the weapons convention.
“Emerging technologies, including artificial intelligence and the evolution of dual-use chemicals, are further complicating detection and enforcement,” said Jonas Montani at the Swiss foreign ministry. “All of this is taking place against a backdrop of growing geopolitical tensions, where trust between states is weakening and collective security mechanisms are being put to the test.”

‘Dehydrated’ Lidl worker sacked for drinking 17p bottle of water
Julian Oxborough worked at the supermarket for more than a decade and subsequently had his claim for unfair dismissal rejected by a tribunal

A Lidl employee was dismissed from his job after drinking a 17p bottle of water because he felt "dehydrated" while working at the checkout, an employment tribunal has heard.
Julian Oxborough, who had served Lidl for more than a decade at its Wincanton store, subsequently had his claim for unfair dismissal rejected by the tribunal.
The incident unfolded on 19 July 2024, when Mr Oxborough was serving a customer who wished to purchase a bottle of water taken from a multipack, which lacked a barcode. The customer exchanged it for a barcoded bottle, leaving the original at the till. Later that day, Mr Oxborough drank from the discarded bottle and used it to top up his own drink as he continued to serve customers.
The following day, a store manager discovered the bottle near the checkout and suspected a breach of company policy. A review of CCTV footage led to Mr Oxborough being invited to a meeting and suspended pending an investigation into allegations of gross misconduct.
During the inquiry, Mr Oxborough explained he was experiencing dehydration during his shift and was concerned about his health, noting he had made his personal squash drink too strong to consume. He stated he believed the multipack bottle could be written off, having observed single bottles of water in the canteen without receipts.
When questioned about payment, he admitted: "No, I think I may have forgot or can’t actually remember taking it." He further claimed he was in a rush at the end of his shift and forgot to have the item written off, asserting he had no intention of being dishonest, though he acknowledged it was wrong afterwards. Mr Oxborough described his subsequent dismissal as "a huge overreaction".
However, area manager Karina Moon, who oversaw the disciplinary process, told the hearing that Mr Oxborough had provided inconsistent explanations regarding his intent to purchase or write off the water. She also questioned why he had not opted for tap water instead. Ms Moon highlighted that Mr Oxborough had four days after the incident to come forward but failed to do so. She concluded that he was aware of the correct procedures and that there was no assurance his behaviour would not be repeated, leaving no suitable alternative to summary dismissal for gross misconduct.
At the tribunal, Mr Oxborough reiterated his lack of dishonest intent, attributing his actions to being tired, stressed, hot, thirsty, unwell, worried about contracting Covid from his partner, and in a hurry to catch a bus at the end of his shift.
An Employment Tribunal in Southampton later upheld Lidl’s decision, with Employment Judge Yallop dismissing Mr Oxborough’s claims, including unfair dismissal.
A spokesperson for Lidl commented: "We would never take the decision to dismiss a long-serving colleague lightly, and the tribunal has upheld that our actions were fair and followed a thorough process. As a retailer, maintaining a consistent zero-tolerance approach to the consumption of unpaid stock is essential to our operations and ensures that clear rules are followed by everyone across the business."

More than 1000 people charged in first year of domestic violence choking laws

More than 1000 people charged in first year of domestic violence choking laws
More than 1000 people were charged with non-fatal choking, strangling or suffocating their partners or family members in the year after landmark new offences were introduced in Victoria.
The data analysed by the Crime Statistics Agency paints a grim picture revealing more than 230 of those perpetrators were repeat offenders and some were charged more than five times in a year for choking or strangling their partner.
The first offence of strangulation in Victoria carries a five-year maximum sentence and does not require physical proof of injury.
New data from the Crime Statistics Agency shows that in the first 12 months of the law’s operation, between October 2024 and September last year, police charged 996 people with this crime.
A further breakdown of the data shows that in 166 cases, the perpetrator was a repeat offender and in the most extreme cases they were charged with this offence more than five times.
About 130 offenders were charged with this offence twice and 23 offenders were charged three times.
Seven offenders were charged with the crime more than five times.
The second, more serious, offence of non-fatal strangulation intentionally causing injury carries a maximum sentence of 10 years behind bars and requires more evidence to prove.
For this offence, 131 people were charged during the first year. A breakdown of those offenders shows 72 were repeat perpetrators and four were charged more than five times with choking their partners or family members.
In total, 1312 criminal charges of non-fatal strangulation were laid by police under the two new criminal offences, created to increase the rate of convictions against domestic violence abusers and take the onus off victim-survivors to prove they were choked unconscious.
The new offences came after sweeping reforms were announced by the state government following the murder of Victorian woman Joy Rowley, who was strangled to death by James Martin Mulhall at her home in Rye in 2011.
A subsequent coronial inquest heard police failed Rowley at least eight times after she sought help when Mulhall choked her to the point of unconsciousness in the months leading up to her murder.
The inquest identified the urgent need for new legislation in Victoria that directly addressed non-fatal strangulation in domestic violence cases.
Last year, this masthead revealed that since the non-fatal strangulation law came into effect in October 2024, 172 criminal charges of the new offences had been finalised and perpetrators sentenced in magistrates’ courts up to August. One charge of non-fatal strangulation was also finalised in the Children’s Court.
Melbourne University law professor Heather Douglas, a renowned family violence researcher who has been tracking how strangulation laws are working across Australia, said the sheer numbers of charges laid in Victoria was a positive sign.
“It is a very strong uptake given it is the first year of the laws, and shows that police are comfortable using it,” she said.
Douglas said that historically, perpetrators would be charged with offences such as assault or intentionally causing injury, but the new law more accurately reflected the seriousness of the crime, including the risk it posed of future homicide.
Mounting research suggests a person who survives non-fatal strangulation by a current or former partner was seven times more likely to be seriously injured or murdered by that person.
One study found the likelihood of homicide leapt by 800 per cent if their partner or former partner attempted to strangle them.
Douglas warned that securing convictions for the strangulation and choking charges remained difficult.
She said research indicated that in Queensland, for example, about half of strangulation charges fall over during the court process, often due to a lack of forensic evidence.
In a world first, the Victorian Institute of Forensic Medicine in Melbourne is hoping to change this. A team of experts at the institute will soon begin using a dedicated, state government-funded MRI scanner to help police investigate internal injuries to gather forensic evidence for non-fatal strangulation victims
Professor Kate Fitz-Gibbon, an international research leader in the area of family violence at Monash University, said the criminal charges alone were not the full story.
“We need ongoing monitoring of how these matters progress through the courts, including sentencing outcomes and whether victim-survivors feel safer, are supported through the process and have access to the services needed to support them to recover from the abuse experience,” she said.
“These laws must be accompanied by sustained investment in early intervention and prevention efforts so that we are not only responding after harm has occurred, and we are working to reduce the prevalence of acts of non-fatal strangulation.”
Christine Mathieson, interim chief executive for Safe and Equal, Victoria’s peak body for specialist family violence services, said that while the number of charges laid in the first year of these laws was promising, charges do not necessarily result in convictions.
To curb the scourge of domestic abuse, Mathieson said the government must prioritise responses from all parts of the community and service system, including upskilling workforces such as frontline specialist family violence workers.
The roll-out of the laws came as experts warn the practice of strangulation during sex has become so widespread that more than half of Australian young people have used it.
Doctors and researchers warn that understanding of the dangers is so lacking that even those who consent to it are not aware of the grave risks, which include death within minutes, brain injury and stroke.

After two year of war, Palestinians scramble to salvage Gaza’s history

After two year of war, Palestinians scramble to salvage Gaza’s history
Palestinians fear destruction and damage to mosques, churches and archaeological sites threatens to erase centuries of history; recovery efforts face obstacles under ceasefire
Muneer Elbaz remembers the joy of visiting the Great Omari Mosque in Gaza with his family, praying at a site where people have worshipped over centuries as empires came and went.
“These were the best days,” Elbaz said, as he recalled promenading through the lively markets around the mosque before the Israel-Hamas war. “This place transports us from one era to another.”
Today, much of the mosque stands in ruins — like most of Gaza — after being hit by Israeli strikes in the two-year war muffled by an uncertain ceasefire. The sight of the rubble brings to mind “a tree that had been uprooted from the land,” said Elbaz, a Palestinian heritage consultant involved with recovery work at the site.
Gone too is some of the heritage of a land with a rich history going back to ancient times. The mosque was built on a site where a Byzantine church had stood, and changed hands and even religions as one invader followed another.
Israel’s military offensive in Gaza, launched in response to the October 7, 2023, Hamas-led attacks that killed approximately 1,200 people and took 251 hostages, has killed over 72,000 Palestinians, according to the territory’s Hamas-run Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians. The Israel Defense Forces believes the Hamas toll to be largely accurate, a senior Israeli military official said last month.
IDF officials have previously said that the combatant-to-civilian death ratio remained relatively the same throughout the war, with two to three civilians killed for every dead terror operative. Israel has said it seeks to minimize civilian fatalities and stresses that Hamas uses Gaza’s civilians as human shields, fighting from civilian areas, including homes, hospitals, schools, and mosques.
With major military operations halted, Palestinians are gaining a clearer picture of the destruction. Some organizations are trying to save what they can at historical sites, even as full-scale restoration — and the broader reconstruction of the territory — face major obstacles.
Dozens of sites were damaged
The UN cultural agency, UNESCO, in an ongoing assessment based on satellite images, says it has verified damage to at least 150 sites since the start of the war. They include 14 religious sites, 115 buildings of historical or artistic interest, nine monuments and eight archaeological sites.
“These sites were an important element that solidifies the presence of the Palestinian people on this land and that represents the continuity of their cultural identity,” said Issam Juha, co-director of the Centre for Cultural Heritage Preservation, based in the West Bank.
“They want to erase the Palestinian identity and Palestinian heritage and … to remove any connection that keeps the Palestinian society clinging to this land,” he charged, referring to Israel.
The IDF has repeatedly accused Hamas of concealing military assets beneath or near heritage sites, as well as other civilian structures, including mosques, schools, and hospitals.
Hamas has fought from within hospitals and from tunnels under hospitals throughout the war, and periodically hid some of the hostages kidnapped from Israel on October 7, 2023, inside them, according to the IDF and the released hostages themselves.
International law generally prohibits targeting hospitals during wartime, but hospitals can lose this protection if they are used for military purposes.
The military has published evidence showing that the terror group maintained tunnels and command centers under major hospitals in the Strip. The group’s top commander, Mohammed Sinwar, was killed in a strike targeting a tunnel that runs under a hospital in southern Gaza.
Internal Hamas documents declassified by the IDF also show that the terror group has long exploited medical facilities in the territory for military purposes.
The Centre for Cultural Heritage Preservation is doing urgent rescue work at the badly damaged Pasha Palace, which housed centuries-old artifacts, many of which appear to have been looted, Juha said. Among the missing items are an Ottoman-era Quranic manuscript, jewelry from the medieval Mamluk era and a Roman-era sarcophagus from which only some fragments have been recovered, according to Hamouda al-Dohdar, an expert working at the site.
The Israeli military said it struck “a Hamas military compound and an anti-tank missile array” at the site. It said its forces struck a “terror tunnel” at the Omari mosque. It did not provide evidence in either case.
Amir Abu al-Omrain, an official with Gaza’s endowments ministry, part of the Hamas-run government, denied the allegation about the mosque.
UNESCO does not have a mandate to assign responsibility for the damage it assesses.
An independent commission established by the UN’s Human Rights Council said it was not aware of any evidence of a tunnel shaft in the mosque. Noting the Israeli allegations about the mosque, it said that even the presence of a “legitimate military objective … would not have justified the resulting damage.” Israel has previously accused the commission of widespread bias and antisemitism.
The centuries-old Saint Porphyrius Orthodox church complex, which had been sheltering displaced Palestinians, was also hit in an Israeli attack early in the war, causing deaths and injuries. The military said it had targeted a nearby Hamas command center. UNESCO said the church complex was moderately damaged.
Some of Gaza’s heritage sites appear to have been spared. UNESCO said it has found no evidence of damage at the Saint Hilarion Monastery, dating to the 4th century.
Under international law, cultural property should not be targeted or used for military purposes.
The Israeli military says it takes the sensitivity of cultural and religious sites into account, aims to minimize damage to civilian infrastructure and adheres to international law.
A rich history
Artifacts and accounts stretching back thousands of years testify to Gaza’s long history of commerce and conflict. Egypt’s pharaohs sent chariots through the low-lying coastal strip in their wars with the Hittites in modern-day Turkey. Traders in Gaza did brisk business with the ancient Greeks.
The Omari mosque, named for Islam’s second caliph, was initially built in the seventh century. Centuries later, the Crusaders converted it into a cathedral, and it went back to being a mosque after they were expelled, said Stephennie Mulder, associate professor of Islamic art at the University of Texas at Austin.
The mosque was damaged during World War I, when the British shelled Gaza in their campaign against the Ottoman Turks, and was later rebuilt.
“The building itself told the story of Gaza’s past as a crossroads of trade, armies, empires, and religious traditions,” said Mulder. “For many Gazans, the Omari mosque stood as a beloved symbol of multiplicity, resilience and persistence.”
More than stones
Mohammad Shareef, 62, remembers attending prayers at the mosque with his father when he was a child, and studying for exams in its quiet confines. Years later, he would bring his own children there. He wept when it was hit.
“We were raised in it and around it, and there’s no stone here that we haven’t stepped on,” he said. “For the people of Gaza, this is their history.”
The loss will feel particularly acute during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which begins later this month. Before the war, thousands converged on the mosque for Ramadan prayers amid a festive atmosphere. This year, a large tented structure has been erected.
In recent days, workers have been filling wheelbarrows in the shadow of a damaged minaret.
Hosni Almazloum, an engineer working at the site, said the mosque’s prayer hall ceiling had collapsed and columns had crumbled. He said it could be rebuilt, if construction supplies are allowed in. For now, teams have been focused on recovery and preventing further damage, sifting through and storing stones.
The US-brokered ceasefire agreement, which halted most of the fighting in October, gives no timeline for Gaza’s reconstruction, which may prove impossible if Israel and Egypt maintain the blockade imposed on the territory when Hamas seized power in 2007 from the Palestinian Authority.
Many historic sites suffered from neglect before the war. The blockade and previous Israel-Hamas wars, along with a lack of resources and urban sprawl, posed challenges. Hamas-run authorities have leveled parts of what archaeologists believe was a Bronze Age settlement to make way for construction projects.
Elbaz says that before the ceasefire, grief was a luxury he couldn’t afford — his family was just trying to survive.
“What would you begin to cry over?” he asked. “The historic mosques or your home or your history or your children’s schools or the streets?”
Now, as he processes the war’s toll, he sometimes weeps, away from the eyes of his children.
“Gaza is our mother,” he said. “We have memories everywhere — in this tree, this flower, this garden and this mosque. Yes, we cry over every part of Gaza.”

EU to provide Ukraine with €90 billion after IMF programme approval
The provision of €90 billion to Ukraine by the EU is linked to the approval of a new four-year IMF programme, which is expected in February.
Source: Ukraine's Prime Minister Yuliia Svyrydenko, while speaking to journalists, as reported by Ukrinform
Quote from Svyrydenko: "The International Monetary Fund plans to consider the next programme of support for Ukraine by the end of February. This decision will determine whether we receive €90 billion in assistance from the European Union in April, as planned."
Details: However, Svyrydenko expressed confidence in a positive decision on Ukraine by the IMF.
As for the EU loan, it is intended for 2026-2027.
"This year we expect €60 billion, of which €15 billion should go to budget support and €45 billion to the procurement of weapons and equipment. Next year the distribution will be €15 billion and €15 billion," Svyrydenko said.
She added that Finance Minister Serhii Marchenko and Defence Minister Mykhailo Fedorov are currently preparing monthly estimates of Ukraine's financial needs in order to agree the tranches.
After these calculations are finalised, they will be submitted to partners, allowing financing to begin as early as April.
Background:
- Earlier, Prime Minister Yuliia Svyrydenko stated during a question-and-answer session with the government that the Cabinet of Ministers will not submit a bill in February to introduce VAT for sole proprietors.
- It was also reported that the Board of Directors of the International Monetary Fund may approve a new four-year Extended Fund Facility (EFF) programme for Ukraine in February, but this will depend primarily on Ukraine fulfilling agreed prior actions.
- After meeting with IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva, Ukraine's Prime Minister Yuliia Svyrydenko said the discussion focused on preparations for approving the next IMF support programme, which is crucial for maintaining Ukraine's macro-financial stability.

Zelenskyy says questions remain for allies over security guarantees for Ukraine
Zelenskyy says questions remain for allies over security guarantees for Ukraine
KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy thanked his international allies for their support but suggested there was still questions remaining over the future security guarantees for his country.
Speaking at the Munich Security Conference in Germany, Zelenskyy repeatedly thanked American and European allies for helping Ukraine by providing air defense systems that protect infrastructure like power plants and “save lives.”
Previous U.S.-led efforts to find consensus on ending the war, most recently two rounds of talks in Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates, have failed to resolve difficult issues, such as the future of Ukraine’s Donbas industrial heartland that is largely occupied by Russian forces.
Later with reporters, Zelenskyy questioned how the concept of a free trade zone — proposed by the U.S. — would work in the Donbas region which Russia insists Kyiv must give up in order to get peace.
He also said the Americans want peace as quickly as possible and that U.S. team wants to sign all the agreements on Ukraine at the same time whereas Ukraine wants guarantees over the country’s future security signed first.
European nations, including the U.K. and France, have already said they will commit troops to Ukraine to guarantee its future security. The U.S. is also expected to be involved and discussions are currently ongoing about the nature of America’s support.
Russian officials are opposed to any foreign troop presence in Ukraine, Zelenskyy suggested, because Russian President Vladimir Putin wants to have the opportunity to attack Ukraine again.
Zelenskyy also said he was surprised that Moscow had replaced the head of its negotiating team before another round of U.S.-brokered talks and suggested the move was deliberately aimed at delaying negotiations.
The talks take place against a backdrop of continued fighting along the roughly 1,250-kilometer (750-mile) front line, relentless Russian bombardment of civilian areas of Ukraine and the country’s power grid, and Kyiv’s almost daily long-range drone attacks on war-related assets on Russian soil.
During negotiations, Russian officials have insisted Ukraine give up more territory in the east of the country to end the war. But Zelenskyy told The Associated Press that it was “a little bit crazy” to suggest Ukraine withdraw from its own territory or exchange it.
Thousands of Ukrainians have been killed defending the country’s Donbas region, he said, pointing out that 200,000 people also live there and it would not be acceptable to effectively hand them over to Russia.
Zelenskyy also questioned how the concept of a free economic zone would work.
“Imagine,” he said, if foreign soldiers patrolled the zone and Putin provoked them and they left. In that case, he said, there could be a “big occupation” of Ukraine and a lot of losses.
If Putin is given any opportunity for victory “we don’t know what he will do next,” Zelenskyy said.
Such a model, Zelenskyy told the AP, would have “big risks” for Ukraine and for any country which committed to guaranteeing Ukraine’s security. But he said he was ready to discuss it as it could be important as a compromise in exchange for securing support to reconstruct Ukraine.
During negotiations, Moscow has to accept monitoring of a ceasefire and return some 7,000 Ukrainian prisoners of war in exchange for more than 4,000 Russian prisoners held by Ukraine, Zelenskyy said.
Earlier on Saturday, drone strikes killed one person in Ukraine and another in Russia, Ukrainian officials said, ahead of fresh talks next week in Geneva aimed at ending the war.
An elderly woman died when a Russian drone hit a residential building in the Black Sea port city of Odesa, Ukraine’s State Emergency Service said.
In Russia, a civilian was killed in a Ukrainian drone strike on a car in the border region of Bryansk, regional Gov. Alexander Bogomaz said.
Russia-installed authorities said a Ukrainian airstrike on a village Saturday wounded 15 people in Ukraine’s partially occupied Luhansk region.
The attacks came a day after a Ukrainian missile strike on the Russian border city of Belgorod killed two people and wounded five, according to regional Gov. Vyacheslav Gladkov.

Rubio expresses desire to maintain trans-Atlantic relations despite increasing rift

Rubio’s speech to European allies takes a softer tone but sticks to Trump’s firm stance
Rubio’s speech to European allies takes a softer tone but sticks to Trump’s firm stance
MUNICH (AP) — U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio offered a reassuring message to America’s allies on Saturday, striking a less aggressive but still firm tone about the administration’s intent to reshape the trans-Atlantic alliance and push its priorities after more than a year of President Donald Trump’s often-hostile rhetoric toward traditional allies.
Reminding his audience at the annual Munich Security Conference about America’s centuries-long roots in Europe, Rubio said the United States would remain forever tied to the continent even as it pushes for changes in the relationship and the institutions that have been the bulwark of the post-World War II world order.
Rubio addressed the conference a year after Vice President JD Vance stunned the same audience with a harsh critique of European values. A series of Trump administration statements and moves targeting allies followed, including Trump’s short-lived threat last month to impose new tariffs on several European countries in a bid to secure U.S. control of Greenland, a semiautonomous territory of NATO ally Denmark.
On Friday, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz had opened this year’s gathering by calling for the U.S. and Europe to “repair and revive trans-Atlantic trust together,” saying that even the U.S. isn’t powerful enough to go it alone in an world whose old order no longer exists. But he and other European officials made clear that they will stand by their values, including their approach to free speech, climate change and free trade.
‘A child of Europe’
While offering a calmer and more reassuring tone, Rubio made clear that the Trump administration is sticking to its guns on policy. He denounced “a climate cult” and “an unprecedented wave of mass migration that threatens the cohesion of our societies.”
Rubio argued that the “euphoria” of the Western victory in the Cold War led to a “dangerous delusion that we had entered ‘the end of history,’ that every nation would now be a liberal democracy, that the ties formed by trade and by commerce alone would now replace nationhood ... and that we would now live in a world without borders where everyone became a citizen of the world.”
“We made these mistakes together and now together we owe it to our people to face those facts and to move forward to rebuild,” Rubio said.
“This is why we Americans may sometimes come off as a little direct and urgent in our counsel,” he said. “This is why President Trump demands seriousness and reciprocity from our friends here in Europe.”
Rubio said that an end of the trans-Atlantic era “is neither our goal nor our wish,” adding that “our home may be in the Western hemisphere, but we will always be a child of Europe.”
He acknowledged that “we have bled and died side-by-side on battlefields from Kapyong to Kandahar,” a contrast with disparaging remarks by Trump about NATO allies’ troops in Afghanistan that drew an outcry. “And I’m here today to make it clear that America is charting the path for a new century of prosperity. and that once again, we want to do it together with you, our cherished allies and our oldest friends.”
U.S. officials accompanying Rubio said his message was much the same as Vance’s last year but was intended to have a softer landing on the audience, which they acknowledged had recoiled at much of Trump’s rhetoric over the past year.
Europeans reassured but not complacent
The president of the European Union’s executive commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said Rubio’s speech was “very reassuring” but noted that “in the administration, some have a harsher tone on these topics.”
In her speech to the conference, she stressed that “Europe must become more independent,” including on defense. She insisted on Europe’s “digital sovereignty” — its approach to hate speech on social media.
British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said that “we shouldn’t get in the warm bath of complacency. He said the U.K. must reforge closer ties with Europe to help the continent “stand on our own two feet” in its own defense, and said there needs to be investment that “moves us from overdependence to interdependence.”
Hanno Pevkur, the defense minister of EU and NATO member Estonia, said it was “quite a bold statement to say that America is ‘a child of Europe’.”
“It was a good speech, needed here today, but that doesn’t mean that we can rest on pillows now,” he told The Associated Press. “So still a lot of work has to be done.”
Rubio didn’t mention Greenland. After last month’s escalation over Trump’s designs on the Arctic island, the U.S., Denmark and Greenland started technical talks on an Arctic security deal.
The Secretary of State met briefly in Munich on Friday with the Danish and Greenlandic leaders, a meeting Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen described as constructive.
But Frederiksen suggested Saturday that although the dispute has cooled, she remains wary. Asked whether the crisis has passed, she replied: “No, unfortunately not. I think the desire from the U.S. president is exactly the same. He is very serious about this theme.”
Asked whether she can put a price on Greenland, she responded “of course not,” adding that “we have to respect sovereign states ... and we have to respect people’s right for self-determination. And the Greenlandic people have been very clear, they don’t want to become Americans.”

‘My ketamine addiction got me locked up in Japan – it isn’t the innocent party drug people think it is’
Izabel Rose said her five-month detention abroad was ‘traumatic’ but helped her overcome a dangerous ketamine addiction. She told Nicole Wootton-Cane she doesn’t want others to make the same mistakes she did

- CommentsGo to comments
In the early hours of 12 April last year, nine Japanese police officers quietly gathered outside a hotel room in Osaka. Inside and oblivious, 26-year-old Briton Izabel Rose was suffering the effects of a nasty hangover following a night out. Eventually, in need of the communal bathroom, Rose opened the door – and the officers descended.
Days prior, Rose had messaged a friend in the UK asking them to send her the class B drug ketamine. She had left London at the start of the month in the depths of her addiction to the drug, and hoped her travels would be an opportunity for her to get away from her usual environment.
But almost as soon as she arrived, she found herself trying to source the illegal substance. Eventually, unable to find it elsewhere, she paid the friend £150 for 7g (0.25oz) of ketamine, which was sent to her in the post, concealed inside a birthday card. But the package was intercepted at the border, and shortly after, Rose was arrested in her hotel room.
It was the start of what would become a five-month stint in a Japanese detention centre after she admitted to the importation of drugs.
Speaking to The Independent, she said the experience is “the most traumatic thing that ever happened to me”, but she is sharing her story in hopes of raising awareness of what she called a “crisis” of ketamine addiction.
‘A slippery slope’
Rose first remembers being introduced to ketamine at university. She said she didn’t actually enjoy the drug the first time she took it, as it made her unwell, but it quickly became a frequent part of her life after moving in with a friend who was a “regular” user.
She said she went from using the drug occasionally as part of the London rave scene to daily within a matter of months, describing how, eventually, the housemates would often take ketamine while watching a film on weekday evenings.
“That turned into me buying my own, and then that turned into me using on my own,” she said.
“My usage went from partying to daily very quickly, and it was a very slippery slope.”
Her body also began to suffer the consequences of her ketamine use. She began to get abdominal cramps known as “K cramps”, which even drove her to visit A&E.
She had begun to recognise she was going down a “dark path” but said she was “in denial” over her addiction.
“I wanted to stop, and I couldn’t stop,” she said.
In April 2025, she decided to take a trip to Japan – somewhere she had always wanted to travel – in the hope that time away from London would also help her get away from the temptation of taking the drug.
‘My intention was never to import’
But before she had even passed through customs in Japan, Rose said she was on her phone trying to source drugs.
“Addiction doesn’t understand geography, and the voice in my head took over, and within half an hour of landing,” she confessed.
She messaged a friend whom she believed might be able to find her a dealer on the ground, saying her “intention was never to import”. Instead, the friend suggested they mail her the ketamine in the post.
“Right there and then, I decided to send them the money,” she said. “The next day, they had gone to the post office and put the ketamine in a birthday card and sent it to me in the post.”
A week later, Rose was arrested at her hotel in Osaka.
‘My life flashed in front of my eyes’
Rose said she initially “naively” believed she might be able to talk her way out of trouble.
Despite Japan’s strict drug laws, she had also purchased marijuana while in the country and decided to hand this over to investigators in the hopes it would placate them.
“They very quickly said, well, that’s not why we’re here – my stomach dropped and my life flashed before my eyes.”
Over the next few days, she was questioned by investigators, who had seized her phone. After meeting with a lawyer, she decided to admit to importing ketamine into the country.
Rose was then taken to Osaka Detention Centre, where she stayed for five months.
‘It’s the most traumatic thing that ever happened to me’
She described the first two months of her detention as the hardest, as she grappled with withdrawing from ketamine alongside coming to terms with her situation.
“There were moments where I was crying and so emotional,” she said. “Ketamine numbs your feelings so much that when you come off it, they all come rushing back.”
She added that the experience was “very lonely and isolated”, with most of her days spent alone with her thoughts.
But despite these challenges, Rose said she was able to use the experience to form a routine of exercise, meditation, reading about addiction, and journaling.
“At first it was hard, it was a shock to the system, but having no phone and just time to reflect and journal really was beneficial for me,” she said.
After five isolated months spent almost exclusively in her small cell, Rose was given a suspended sentence, meaning she could go free but would be locked up again if she committed any offence in Japan.
‘This is a crisis’
Rose is now back in the UK and in recovery.
She is sharing her story on TikTok on her account to raise awareness of the dangers of ketamine addiction.
“I think there’s such a stigma on what an addict looks like, but they are just normal people,” she said. “Ketamine addiction is a real crisis and we need to look at helping people in the best way possible.”
Recent government data published in December 2025 found the number of children aged 17 and under reporting problems with ketamine had doubled between 2021 and 2024. For under-17s in treatment, ketamine is the fourth most-used drug after cannabis, alcohol and nicotine.
Grace Willsher, head of young people’s services in the North at drug and alcohol support charity WithYou, said the number of young people being supported for ketamine use across its services has more than doubled in the past five years.
She told The Independent the charity is “concerned that the risks associated with ketamine aren’t well understood”, adding its easy availability and low cost mean many see it as a “party drug” and an alternative to alcohol.
But she warned that in a “very short period of time”, ketamine can cause “permanent damage” to the body.
“This includes really horrible effects like bladder problems, changes in mental health and memory, and damage to your nose, liver and kidneys,” she said.
WithYou aims to encourage young people to seek early advice and support around drug and alcohol use, helping to prevent harm before problems escalate.
Ms Willsher encouraged anyone worried about themselves or someone they know to reach out for support.

‘I used to have to go down to the police station every single day about my son, crying’ – parents open up to Tara Cobham about the trauma of not feeling listened to

The worst thing a parent can go through had already happened to Christine Durand. Her son Steven was missing, and she had no idea if he was even alive. But what Christine, who is now 70, didn’t realise was that things were only going to get worse over the coming months and years.
“I just feel like they’ve not cared at all, like I’ve been left on the shelf,” she tells The Independent. “I used to have to go down to the police station every single day about my son, crying. They let me down on many occasions.”
Steven was meant to be travelling from his sister’s flat to his home in Preston on the day he disappeared – 19 October 2018. He had lost his phone, so all he had on him was his bus fare.
After Christine reported Steven missing, Lancashire Constabulary put out public appeals for the 31-year-old, who Christine said was known to officers as he suffered from mental health issues. But they misidentified his ethnicity twice, describing him as white when he is mixed-race.
“Everything I asked the police to do, they did the opposite,” says Christine, citing incidents such as the police breaking down the door of Steven’s flat when she had told them she had a spare key. “I think the police are racist – I think they didn’t care about my son because he was mixed-race.”
Christine, from Leyland, believes that her son, whom she describes as “the kindest person you could meet”, could have been found if the police had handled the investigation better.
Only 31 per cent of missing Black people, and 35 per cent of missing Asian people, are found by police, compared with 39 per cent of white people who go missing, according to research carried out by the charity Missing People.
That report also found that Black and Asian children are more likely to be missing for longer periods of time than white children. One in five missing person incidents relating to Black children lasted for longer than 48 hours, compared with 14 per cent of those involving Asian children, and 13 per cent for white children.
Missing People has now launched its new SafeCall service, a national lifeline designed to support the 72,000 children who go missing in the UK every year. The Independent reached its £165,000 fundraising target last month, enabling the free, confidential, round-the-clock service to go live.
Evidence Joel’s experience echoes that of Christine. Her son Richard Okorogheye, then aged 19, went missing from Ladbroke Grove, London, on 22 March 2021. Evidence, 43, says she reported Richard as missing to police the following day, telling them he was away from home without his medication for sickle cell anaemia.
But she claims that officers did not treat her concerns with urgency, and describes the investigation as a “disaster”, alleging that she was told: “Don’t worry, he’ll come back home”, and even: “If you can’t find your son, how do you expect us to?”
Richard was found dead in Epping Forest two weeks later, on 5 April.
Evidence, a nurse, believes that her son might have been found alive if the investigation had been handled properly. “I felt the whole thing was governed by discrimination and racism,” she says. “Every day I have to go through this agony in my heart, knowing something maybe could’ve been done, but nothing was done. I remember having sleepless nights, walking barefoot from my house to Ladbroke Grove police station, crying, begging them to look for my child.”
The Metropolitan Police did apologise to Evidence for providing a level of service that was “not at a level the public would expect of us”, but it did not acknowledge any discriminatory treatment. An Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) investigation identified several failures by police and described the level of service that Evidence received as “unacceptable”, but it found that “the evidence did not indicate that any delay in upgrading Richard’s risk level was due to his or Ms Joel’s race”.
In Christine’s case, she made a complaint, and an internal investigation by Lancashire Constabulary found that there was “insufficient evidence” that Steven had been discriminated against on the basis of his race or mental health. The force declined to comment on this.
Lancashire Constabulary also disputed Christine’s claims about the door being broken down, but the IOPC upheld her allegation after a review of her complaint. It added that the constabulary had apologised for misidentifying his ethnicity.
Josie Allan, head of policy and partnerships at Missing People, says the charity has heard from a number of families who have felt discriminated against because of their race. Explaining why investigations might be coming to competing conclusions, she says that “underlying systemic bias” will be affecting police responses, but that its “insidious” nature makes it difficult to pinpoint.
“There are inherent issues in being able to identify discrimination in the complaints process,” says Allan. “We know that data shows there are disparities for Black missing people, so there’s a gap between the evidence about the disparities and the acknowledgement of them... The data and the sheer amount of families who are raising concerns should be raising very serious concerns within policing that there is a pattern.”
She notes that the IOPC has recently revised its guidance in an effort to improve the “problematic” handling of discrimination complaints.
In 2021, the home affairs select committee’s “Macpherson: 20 Years On” inquiry suggested that police services had largely failed to overcome perceptions of institutional racism following the initial inquiry into the murder of Stephen Lawrence, which found consistent evidence of “over-policing” and “under-protection” of Black, Asian and minority ethnic communities.
On the matter of Steven Durand, a spokesperson for Lancashire Constabulary said: “We’ve carried out extensive inquiries in relation to CCTV, telephony, searches of open land and waterways, inquiries with associates, witnesses, health agencies and financial checks and numerous media appeals, prior to the decision to archive the investigation.”
The force said that “difficult” decisions, such as archiving a case, sometimes have to be made, but that “any new information will be fully investigated”.
On the case of Richard Okorogheye, a Met Police spokesperson said: “When Richard went missing in 2021, hundreds of officers worked tirelessly over 15 days as part of the extensive search, which also included specialist search teams, dogs and horses, and colleagues from Essex Police, before his body was sadly found.”
They said that the force accepted all of the IOPC’s recommendations from its 2022 investigation, and that it had “made a significant number of changes to the way we respond from the moment a person is reported missing”. They added: “This includes putting more emphasis on engaging with the person who reports someone missing, so we can better understand the risks they face.”

Gisele Pelicot ‘overwhelmed’ by personal letter of support from Queen
The Queen commended the rape survivor’s ‘extraordinary dignity and courage’

French rape survivor Gisele Pelicot has said she is “overwhelmed” after receiving a personal letter of support from Queen Camilla following her ex-husband Dominique Pelicot’s conviction.
The Queen, a longtime campaigner against domestic violence and sexual abuse, commended Ms Pelicot’s “extraordinary dignity and courage” in the correspondence.
Ms Pelicot’s former husband was sentenced to 20 years in prison for drugging and raping her, and for allowing other men to assault her while she was unconscious. The horrific abuse spanned nearly a decade.
He had recruited other men in an online chatroom to rape her while she was unconscious; following a trial that took place in Avignon, 47 of them were found guilty of rape, two were found guilty of attempted rape, and two were found guilty of sexual assault. They were jailed for a total of 428 years.
Extracts from Ms Pelicot’s book, A Hymn to Life: Shame Has to Change Sides, written with journalist Judith Perrignon and published by French newspaper Le Monde, explain how her then husband was summoned by police after a supermarket security guard caught him secretly filming up women’s skirts.
The 73-year-old bravely waived her right to anonymity, asserting that the shame should fall on her abusers, not on her.
In the letter, Queen Camilla told Ms Pelicot: “I very much wanted to write to express my heartfelt admiration for the courage, grace and dignity with which you have faced the horrific crimes committed against you.”
Speaking to the BBC’s Newsnight, Ms Pelicot described the letter as an “honour”, adding: “I was overwhelmed that the Queen could send me this letter. Although my words touched the whole world, I wasn’t expecting a letter from the Court of England. I felt moved and very honoured that she had become aware of what had happened to me. I am grateful to her.”
Camilla has dedicated her royal charity work to supporting victims of sexual assault. Last year, she praised the “brilliant” efforts of health workers and staff at a specialist centre in Exeter, which she officially opened.
The Queen has previously championed the idea of providing free toiletries to those who have been attacked, an initiative that has recently been revived. In an ITV documentary, she vowed to “keep trying” to end domestic violence “until I am able to no more”.

On February 13, Kim Jong Un visited the construction site of the Memorial Hall of Military Feats in Foreign Military Operations.
This was reported by the publication Rodong Sinmun.
The North Korean dictator personally inspected the progress of the work, examined the sculptural panels, and gave instructions on the final design of the facility. The authorities involved units of the Korean People’s Army in the construction.
Pyongyang began actively transferring its units to Russia in October 2024. Initially, special forces of the 11th Corps of the Korean People’s Army, known as the ‘Storm Corps’ trained at training grounds in the Far East.
North Korea officially confirmed the deployment of its armed forces on April 28, 2025, citing the strategic partnership agreement with the Russian Federation.
According to South Korean and Western intelligence, the total number of North Korean troops in Russia has reached 15,000. Most of the forces are stationed in the Kursk region.
As of February 2026, North Korean troop losses in killed and wounded amount to approximately 6,000. Most of the soldiers were killed during counteroffensives in the Kursk region.

Writing for survival: Gaza author dares to hope against the odds

Writing for survival: Gaza author dares to hope against the odds
Palestinian author Safaa Al-Nabaheen has kept working in Gaza through Israeli attacks, the loss of loved ones and food shortages. She has won fellowships, residencies and admission in Western universities. But the bureaucracy of occupation keeps her tied, against her will, in the besieged enclave. And the lessons she taught in creative workshops are proving to be a challenge.
It started out small, very small, in a vacant lot next to her house in Al-Zawayda, a once sleepy, agricultural town not far from Deir al-Balah in central Gaza. That’s where Palestinian author Safaa Al-Nabaheen decided to hold a workshop for children to help them build stories, dream, and let their imaginations soar above the death and destruction around them.
In early 2024, just months after Israel launched its latest war following the October 7, 2023, Hamas attack, Gaza’s population was already on the move. The Israeli army had started issuing evacuation orders, sparking a process that would displace 1.9 million out of Gaza’s 2.2 million population by the end of the year.
Towns and cities in central and southern Gaza were starting to flood with refugees from the north, the death toll was rising and as despair spiralled with every bombardment, Nabaheen came up with an idea.
“As a writer and novelist, I could offer training workshops for children and adolescents on the art of short-story writing, teaching them how to channel their inner worlds through narrative,” said the 31-year-old Palestinian author.
But when she started to put her plan into action, she had a revelation. “In my first session with them, I discovered that some of them had aged 20 years,” she recounted. “When I asked a child about his childhood or his dreams, his only answer was that his concern today was filling water containers, gathering firewood for his mother to cook whatever food was left, and praying it wouldn’t rain so their tents wouldn't drown.”
Not one to give up, Nabaheen persevered with her programme – and gradually, the kids started to respond. “It was a very simple beginning; our gatherings cost nothing more than my voice, some ideas for entertainment, and inventing new games for them. It was a very small tent at the edge of the land, where children sat on mats with a mountain of hope in their hearts,” she explained.
More than a year later, Nabaheen is confronting her own “mountain”, but it’s of despair, not hope. On October 13, 2025, President Donald Trump announced a ceasefire at a summit in Egypt attended by leaders from around 30 countries. Against a banner proclaiming, “Peace in the Middle East”, the US president signed “The Trump Declaration for Enduring Peace and Prosperity” and called it “a tremendous day for peace in the Middle East”.
Last month, US special envoy Steve Witkoff announced the start of the second phase of the ceasefire deal. But while emergency supplies have kept famine at bay in Gaza, the death toll from Israeli fire keeps mounting. Earlier this week, the Gaza health ministry said 586 Palestinians were killed since the start of the ceasefire, bringing the war’s cumulative toll to more than 72,000.
For Nabaheen, the ceasefire has changed nothing. “It is a lie. In reality, the war has not stopped. It has only stopped in the media to quiet public opinion,” she maintained. “The [Israeli] strikes continue. We are living in an unprecedented state of chaos. There has been a slight breakthrough regarding food and water, but the general situation remains dire.”

Israel still does not allow foreign journalists independent access into Gaza. Communication with the outside world remains a challenge with frequent internet cuts. FRANCE 24’s interviews with Nabaheen were conducted via emails, messages and calls. During one interview on a messaging app, a massive blast went off seemingly close to her bedroom. Nabaheen flinched momentarily, looked toward the window and insisted on continuing.
The drive to get her story – and herself – out of Gaza keeps her going these days. But with every mountain of hardship, river of loss and valley of despair, the journey just keeps getting harder. From bombardments to bureaucracy, the challenges have at times seemed insurmountable. Through it all, she has kept working – and writing for survival.
Expanding networks outside, a loss at home
From a “simple” start in early 2024, Nabaheen’s workshops, which she called The Creative Refuge Project, began to grow, attracting more children as Gaza’s schools remained close.
“In the beginning, the sessions focused on psychological support and recreation. Then, I began integrating them into the world of dreams – teaching them how to express everything they feel through writing. I started implementing small activities, such as performing a radio news broadcast, a short theatrical play, reading folk stories that inspire expression, or forming a choir for our old Palestinian songs. I then started announcing my small camp via Facebook,” she said.
As the project grew, Nabaheen started looking for sponsors and applying for international funding. She was managing the project alone and needed help, which was difficult to secure since the war was at its peak.
Then tragedy struck her family.
Her brother, Mohammed, was killed on July 13, 2024, in an Israeli drone strike while collecting wood outdoors.
“Losing my brother was not easy,” said Nabaheen, using an understatement to keep her emotions in check. “I tried to keep myself busy at the time, doing my university studies despite the impossible circumstances, via the internet – which was rarely available.”
Horror from the sea
After halting The Creative Refuge Project for six months following Mohammed’s death, things started picking up again. The Goethe-Institut, a German NGO, had expressed interest in funding her little programme, and Nabaheen was busy doing the paperwork to make it happen.
By September 2024, the carnage in Gaza was unfolding at a ferocious pace, with the death toll surging past 40,000. Daily headlines noted Israeli attacks in Khan Younis, Gaza City, Rafah, Deir al-Balah, Mawasi, Jabaliya … names of cities, towns and camps that would become familiar to international audiences.
But the outside world back then was still unaware of the extent of Israel’s use of quadcopters and drones to spy and kill in every corner of the besieged enclave. Gazans though did not have that luxury.
On September 15, 2024, the horror came home from the sea for Nabaheen.
That night, her second brother, Saeb, had gone fishing. A father of three young children, Saeb had ignored the family’s warning that “the sea is dangerous”.
The UN would confirm their prognosis the next year, when a report noted that Israel’s “systematic” attacks had killed 200 civilian fishers as of December 2024. They were targeted “generally without warning, while fishing using paddling boats posing no discernible threats” to the Israeli Naval Forces, the UN concluded.
Despite the family’s pleas, Saeb took to “the dangerous sea” in a desperate bid to provide for his kids as the economic situation deteriorated, prices soared and food stocks plummeted.
While he was fishing, an Israeli quadcopter spotted and pursued Saeb, explained his sister. “It chased him in the water, and as he tried to swim away, it fired bullets everywhere into his body. He tried to flee,” she said, adding that the quadcopter continued to follow Saeb as he ran to the shore and then headed towards a main street. “People were shouting to him that his death was inevitable and to recite the Shahada [the Islamic creed], as they saw his blood gushing from every part of him. Then, another aircraft pursued him and targeted his head with a projectile. He fell to the ground, stained with the sand of the sea … he once told me, "I am a son of the sea; if I leave it, I die,”… yet the sea did not care for him,” she said sadly.
Warm tent in ‘beautiful colours’
The day Saeb died also happened to be the day that Nabaheen signed a contract with the Goethe-Institut for her workshop project – and it was during her university final exams.
“Despite the impossible situation, I was determined to complete both my studies and my project simultaneously. Five days later, I went to work at the camp. I built a large tent decorated with the most beautiful colours and pictures. With the funding, I had some resources, so I prepared a warm tent that embraced them all,” she recounted.
There were 50 children, aged eight to 15, in the project. With her new funding, Nabaheen enlarged the programmes, adding theatre rehearsals and stagings. “In truth, I was suffering from the pangs of loss as one suffers labour pains … I had no choice but to immerse myself in them and my studies,” she confessed.
The project lasted three months, with meetings three days a week. On the final day, “we all collapsed in tears,” she said. “There I was, falling apart and weeping just like them. The project used to occupy me completely.”
By that time, most of the kids in her workshop started returning to their homes in northern Gaza. Without projects to plan, organise and occupy her days, Nabaheen once again turned to writing.
Her first novel in Arabic was published in 2021 and received an award in Lebanon before the war. She took up writing again, working on her second novel, “The Mystery of the Forgotten Girl”, also in Arabic, with a mission: to “intentionally” avoid writing about the war “because I wasn't ready to face the bitter reality”.
She has since written her third novel, “Disowned”, which was published in Egypt and recently showcased at the Cairo International Book Fair. A collection of poems, “When Ash Blossoms”, followed, and she has finished her fourth novel, “Letters Not Yet Delivered”.
Admitted in the West, blocked in Gaza
Writing has long been a coping mechanism and resilience booster for Nabaheen. The difficulty, for the young Palestinian writer though, are the forces beyond her control.
For the past few months, Nabaheen has been trying to leave Gaza to pursue a life of the mind, free of the terrors of everyday life in the besieged enclave. But the process has trapped her in a cycle of hope followed by crashing bureaucratic despair.
An Italian university forwarded her application for a writer’s residency to a foundation. But then she received no response. An international fund for artists and cultural actors at risk supported her “incredibly”. But during the final selection, “they rejected me the moment they realised I was from Gaza,” Nabaheen recounted.
She managed to get a conditional admission into a UK university for the next semester, but the conditions included funding and tests, which in turn require a visa. A writing fellowship at a US university came through, once again with help from a few US-based writers. But the process is going nowhere since the US government does not evacuate Palestinians.
On February 2, the Rafah crossing partially opened under the US-brokered ceasefire deal to chaotic scenes. Around 20,000 Gazans need urgent medical treatment abroad, but on the first day, Israel allowed just five patients to leave. Earlier this week, Ali Shaath, head of the National Committee for the Administration of Gaza, which is charged with overseeing day-to-day affairs in Gaza, told Egyptian media that the situation at Rafah was starting to improve.
While emergency medical patients struggle to make it out, Gazans who have admission into Western schools and institutions, are painfully aware that they are not on the priority list. As deadlines for the next semester loom, they are watching seats and scholarships slip away.

For Nabaheen, it’s been a heartbreaking process. “I cannot find the words to describe the scale of injustice and frustration I am enduring,” she said helplessly. After spending years working with Gaza’s children to help them dream of a future beyond the pressing worries of survival, her own lessons are proving to be a challenge.
But she is not one to give up. “I’m not losing hope. I will never lose hope, actually,” she said. “I knows that there are so many people stuck in so many difficult places like Gaza. I’ll keep going on. Writing is my way to go forward.”

Canada’s Carney, opposition leader hold hands during school shooting vigil
School shootings are rare in Canada, and the government has responded to previous mass shootings with strict gun control measures.
Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney and the country’s main opposition leader held hands Friday as they paid tribute to the victims of one of the worst mass shootings in the country’s history at a vigil in a devastated British Columbia town.
Carney and Pierre Poilievre, leader of the opposition Conservative Party, joined hands as an Indigenous leader sang a prayer outside the town hall in Tumbler Ridge.
Carney and Poilievre also spoke. The Prime Minister named each of the six people killed at Tumbler Ridge Secondary School and said the mother and brother of the shooter who were killed also “deserve to be mourned”.
Authorities said the 18-year-old alleged shooter, identified as Jesse Van Rootselaar, killed her 39-year-old mother, Jennifer Jacobs, and 11-year-old stepbrother, Emmett Jacobs, in their home on Tuesday before heading to the nearby Tumbler Ridge Secondary School and opening fire, killing five children and an educator before killing herself.
Carney said he sat with people who are “living through something no one should ever have to endure”.
“When you wake up tomorrow, and the world feels impossible, know that millions of Canadians are with you. When the cameras leave and the quiet sets in – know that we will still be here,” Carney said.

How ‘Zionist’ became a safe word for hate

Opinion
How ‘Zionist’ became a safe word for hate
At protests against Israeli President Isaac Herzog’s visit to Australia, some demonstrators directed their anger not only at Israel’s policies but at “Zionists” themselves – accusing them of malign influence in the media and government. At other recent rallies, Zionism has been equated to Nazism and terrorism.
Victor Klemperer, a Jewish academic who survived Nazi Germany, warned that words can act like tiny doses of arsenic – swallowed unnoticed, accumulating slowly, until their poison takes hold. His insight was not about shouted slogans, but about respectable language that can normalise contempt. “Zionist” has entered this territory over the past two years.
In the wake of the Bondi attack, I was involved in a public campaign for a federal royal commission into antisemitism. My role prompted a message from someone I have known for more than 20 years. Had I been paid by Israel for my advocacy, he asked. It was an offensive question. The answer was no.
What followed was more revealing. “Zionists have always been morally bankrupt with a superiority complex,” he told me.
I asked him two simple questions. Did he believe the state of Israel should continue to exist? Yes. Did he believe it should exist as a Jewish state, provided Jews, Christians, Muslims and others were given equal rights? Yes.
By the standard definition, he qualified as a Zionist. He either did not understand the term – or he was deliberately repurposing it.
That exchange mattered not because it was especially aggressive, but because it was ordinary. It was delivered calmly, with moral certainty, and without any sense of contradiction. It revealed something that has become increasingly common: the use of the word “Zionist” not to describe a belief, but to impugn a target.
Zionism, properly understood, is not complicated. It is the belief that the Jewish people have the right to self-determination in their ancestral homeland. In practical terms, it is the idea that Israel should exist as a Jewish state. In Australia, Zionism has long been openly supported by mainstream leaders from across the political spectrum as a legitimate expression of Jewish self-determination.
Zionism does not dictate borders. It does not prescribe military policy. It does not require allegiance to any government, leader or political party. It does not exclude any race or religion from Israeli citizenship. It does not preclude criticism of Israel and nor does it demand support for all actions taken by the Israeli state. Expansionism is not intrinsic to it, and nor does it require opposition to a two-state solution. To be clear, criticism of Israel that is similar to that levelled against any other country cannot be regarded as antisemitic.
Like any national movement, Zionism contains a wide spectrum of political views. Many Zionists oppose Israel’s current government. Many Israelis have protested against it for years. Some of the fiercest critics of Israeli policy are Israeli citizens, who nonetheless consider themselves proudly Zionist.
This clarity matters because once a word’s meaning is hijacked, it becomes available for misuse – or abuse.
In recent years, “Zionist” has increasingly been deployed as an insult. The term Zionist is no longer used to identify an idea, but it is spat to assign blame. “Zionists” are held responsible for a wide range of evils, often without definition or limitation. In many instances, “Zionist” is used synonymously with “Jew”, while maintaining just enough ambiguity to deny that Jews are being targeted at all. So why does this substitution occur?
Because openly targeting Jews is no longer socially acceptable. “Zionist” becomes the workaround – broad enough to encompass most Jews, yet elastic enough to provide moral cover. It allows hostility to be expressed while preserving plausible deniability.
We are repeatedly told that hostility toward “Zionists” is merely political critique. But if that were true, the criticism would be of policy. Instead, “Zionists” are accused of supremacy, immorality, or inherent evil. That is not political criticism. It is collective character assassination.
This matters because Zionism is not an abstract ideology for most Jews. It is bound up with history, vulnerability and survival. For many Jews – including those deeply critical of Israel – Zionism represents the belief that Jews should not again be stateless, dependent on the goodwill of others for protection. To insist that “anti-Zionism has nothing to do with Jews” while knowing that the overwhelming majority of Jews identify in some way with Zionism is disingenuous.
At best, it ignores how the word is actually used. At worst, the ambiguity is used intentionally as cover. This is why the definitional battle matters. Hijacking the meaning of Zionism allows hatred to masquerade as politics. The federal royal commission into antisemitism must grapple with these subtleties if it is to understand Jew hatred in Australia.
Existing legal frameworks are poorly equipped to deal with language that is technically deniable yet socially corrosive. They miss the cumulative effect of rhetoric that repeatedly singles out a group under a different name.
If the commission is to be meaningful, it must confront this linguistic sleight of hand directly. It must be willing to ask whether “Zionist” has become a socially acceptable stand-in for “Jew” – a way to legitimise hostility while denying responsibility for its impact. Because when words are repurposed to disguise prejudice, history suggests the damage rarely stops with words.

MOSCOW, February 14. /TASS/. BRICS is aware of the risks of pressure from Washington and will develop an alternative to any system the US could dismantle "with the push of a button," Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov told TASS in an interview.
"I don’t think anyone is underestimating the risks associated with the US policy of sanctions and tariff pressure. But it doesn’t mean that everyone is ready to succumb to pressure, or in effect, a diktat. BRICS was established to create, if you will, an alternative for anything that could be shut down with the push of a button, as we’ve already seen," the diplomat said.
"What’s important is that we are looking for and finding solutions to the challenges created by this new hostile international environment for our work," the diplomat added. "Both within BRICS and in cooperation with those who are interested, but not part of BRICS, using the resources BRICS offers. This includes partner states and other countries," Ryabkov said.
"Digital methods and systems are at the forefront here. And, of course, national currencies and conducting all transactions in those currencies," the deputy foreign minister explained.

Prime Minister Carney and Canada’s main opposition leader hold hands during school shooting vigil
Prime Minister Carney and Canada’s main opposition leader hold hands during school shooting vigil
VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) — Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney and the country’s main opposition leader held hands Friday as they paid tribute to the victims of one of the worst mass shootings in the country’s history at a vigil in a devastated British Columbia town.
Carney and Opposition Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre joined hands as an Indigenous leader sang a prayer outside the town hall in Tumbler Ridge.
Carney and Poilievre also spoke. The prime minister named each of the six people killed at Tumbler Ridge Secondary School and said the mother and brother of the shooter who were killed also “deserve to be mourned.”
Authorities said the 18-year-old alleged shooter, identified as Jesse Van Rootselaar, killed her 39-year-old mother, Jennifer Jacobs, and 11-year-old stepbrother, Emmett Jacobs, in their home on Tuesday before heading to the nearby Tumbler Ridge Secondary School and opening fire, killing five children and an educator before killing herself.
Carney said he sat with people who are “living through something no one should ever have to endure.”
“When you wake up tomorrow, and the world feels impossible, know that millions of Canadians are with you. When the cameras leave and the quiet sets in — know that we will still be here,” Carney said.
A crowd of hundreds attended the vigil. Some held photos of loved ones they lost.
Carney said the community has always been defined by people caring for each other.
“And when the unimaginable happened on Tuesday, you were there again. First responders at the school within two minutes. Teachers shielding their children,” he said.
Poilievre commended Carney for his “tremendous grace.” Canada’s political leaders flew from Ottawa together.
British Columbia Premier David Eby said the students of the school won’t ever have to return to the building if they don’t want to.
“I will promise that not one of you will ever be forced to go back to that school. We will provide a safe place for you to go back to school,” Eby said.
Authorities on Thursday identified those killed at the school as Kylie Smith, Abel Mwansa, Zoey Benoit and Ticaria Lampert, all age 12, as well as 13-year-old Ezekiel Schofield and assistant teacher Shannda Aviugana-Durand, 39.
Maya Gebala, 12, who was wounded in the head and neck, and Paige Hoekstra, 19, who also suffered bullet wounds, remain hospitalized in Vancouver.
Dwayne McDonald, the deputy commissioner of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in British Columbia, said earlier Friday that the alleged shooter did not appear to be searching for a specific target at the school.
“This suspect was, for lack of a better term, hunting,” McDonald said. “They were prepared and engaging anybody and everybody they could come in contact with.”
McDonald described a “chaotic” scene at the school when police arrived, with fire alarms sounding and a person yelling out a window that the suspect was upstairs.
“They entered the school, proceeded to go up the stairwell, and were met with gunfire,” he said. “It was a matter of seconds after that there was more gunfire, not as we know now, having reviewed video, directed at any persons. Then the suspect took their life.”
McDonald said from the time the suspect encountered police there were no further injuries to students at the school.
Four guns were seized, two from the family home and two from the school, he said.
The attack was Canada’s deadliest since 2020, when a gunman in Nova Scotia killed 13 people and set fires that left another nine dead.
School shootings are rare in Canada, which has strict gun-control laws. The government has responded to previous mass shootings with gun-control measures, including a recently broadened ban on all guns it considers assault weapons.

4 Palestinians injured by Israeli army gunfire across Gaza Strip despite ceasefire
At least 591 Palestinians killed, over 1,578 others injured in Israeli attacks since ceasefire
- Israeli media says troops targeted fighters emerging from tunnel in Beit Hanoun
GAZA CITY, Palestine
Four Palestinians were injured on Saturday by Israeli army gunfire across the Gaza Strip amid daily Israeli violations of the ceasefire agreement in effect since last October.
A young girl and an elderly man were wounded by Israeli gunfire east of the southern city of Khan Younis, a medical source told Anadolu.
Another young girl was shot in the head by Israeli army gunfire in the Netzarim area in the central Gaza Strip, a medical source said.
In a separate incident, the medical source said a 60-year-old man was shot in the foot by Israeli army gunfire in the Al-Mughraqa area south of Gaza City.
Eyewitnesses said Israeli forces opened heavy, indiscriminate fire east of the city before carrying out large-scale demolitions of several residential buildings in the area.
They added that Israeli troops also fired indiscriminately in eastern areas of the Bureij refugee camp and the Zeitoun neighborhood.
In a related development, witnesses said Israeli fighter jets carried out several airstrikes on Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip and east of Gaza City.
In the northern Gaza Strip, witnesses told Anadolu that Israeli warplanes and artillery struck the Sheikh Zayed area east of Beit Lahia amid heavy gunfire from military helicopters overhead.
Residents also reported hearing explosions in multiple locations across northern Gaza, including areas under Israeli military control.
The so-called “Yellow Line” separates areas of Israeli military deployment, which account for about 53% of the Gaza Strip’s eastern territory, from western areas where Palestinians are permitted to move.
Israeli forces identified five fighters exiting a tunnel shaft in the Beit Hanoun area, Israel’s Channel 12 reported, citing its military correspondent.
The report said troops targeted them, adding that preliminary assessments indicated four were killed, while operations at the site were ongoing.
No details were provided about the identity of the fighters or the group they allegedly belonged to. The Israeli military did not issue a statement on the reported incident.
The Oct. 10 ceasefire agreement ended Israel’s two-year war that began on Oct. 8, 2023. Palestinian authorities say the conflict killed more than 72,000 Palestinians, wounded over 171,000 others, and caused widespread destruction affecting 90% of civilian infrastructure. The UN estimates reconstruction costs at approximately $70 billion.
At least 591 Palestinians have been killed and over 1,578 others injured in Israeli attacks since the ceasefire, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry.

Two Philippine senators named ‘co-perpetrators’ in Duterte ICC case
Former Philippine justice secretary Vitaliano Aguirre II also among eight current, past officials named in complaint.
Two sitting Philippine senators have been identified as “co-perpetrators” in former president Rodrigo Duterte‘s crimes against humanity trial at the International Criminal Court (ICC), documents released by prosecutors show.
Senators Ronald “Bato” Dela Rosa and Christopher “Bong” Go are among eight current and former officials named in a document dated February 13 and posted to the court’s website late on Friday.

- list 2 of 3ICC charges ex-Philippine President Duterte with crimes against humanity
- list 3 of 3ICC rejects ex-Philippine leader Duterte’s appeal for provisional release
Duterte was arrested in the Philippines’ capital, Manila, in March 2025, and was swiftly flown to the Netherlands, where he has been held in ICC custody at The Hague. The 80-year-old insists his arrest was unlawful.
ICC prosecutors have charged him with three counts of crimes against humanity, alleging his involvement in at least 76 murders as part of his “war on drugs”.
“Duterte and his co-perpetrators shared a common plan or agreement to ‘neutralise’ alleged criminals in the Philippines [including those perceived or alleged to be associated with drug use, sale or production] through violent crimes including murder,” the prosecution document reads.
Dela Rosa, the former national police chief and enforcer of Duterte’s drug war, has previously said he believed he faced potential arrest and has been in hiding for months.
Go, re-elected in May in a landslide victory, was a key lieutenant of Duterte during both the latter’s terms as mayor of southern Davao City and as president from 2016 to 2022.
A representative of Dela Rosa said they had not yet seen the document. Go has yet to comment on the latest development.
It was not immediately clear if any of the men named in the prosecution document would face charges in court.
In a statement posted on Facebook, Kristina Conti, lawyer of several of the deceased victims’ families, noted that it’s the first time “significant details” were disclosed by the ICC to the public.
She said the inclusion of several high-ranking officials under Duterte showed that the deadly drug war under his presidency “was crafted not only to ensure implementation, but to ensure impunity”.
“The involvement of those in the investigating units, which should have acted as the killings happen, is material to the plan. This also emphasizes that the ‘war on drugs’ began in Davao,” Conti said.
Duterte is facing a four-day “confirmation of charges” hearing from February 23, in which judges will decide whether the prosecution’s allegations are strong enough to proceed to trial.
Judges have rejected arguments that the 80-year-old, who was arrested in March last year and transferred to the Netherlands the same day, was unfit to stand trial.
Go and Dela Rosa have been named as co-perpetrators in acts that took place during Duterte’s tenures as Davao mayor and president.
Former Philippine justice secretary Vitaliano Aguirre II, who served as a lawyer for Duterte in cases involving the so-called “Davao Death Squad”, is also among the eight men named.
Ross Tugade, an ICC-accredited lawyer from the Philippines, said in a post on Facebook that the inclusion of the names of former Duterte officials indicates “that the ICC has evidence” to show a “criminal structure” in the commission of the alleged crimes.
The first of three counts against Duterte concerns his alleged involvement as a co-perpetrator in 19 murders carried out between 2013 and 2016 while he was mayor of Davao City.
The second relates to 14 murders of so-called “High Value Targets” in 2016 and 2017 when Duterte was president.
The third charge covers 43 murders committed during “clearance” operations of lower-level alleged drug users or pushers.
These took place across the Philippines between 2016 and 2018, the prosecution alleged.
The ICC also on Friday allowed the addition of 500 more complainants against Duterte in the trial.

Public urged to take ‘extra care’ as heavy snow and ice sweeps UK
Saturday is set to be a cold but sunny day for most of the country, as a yellow warning for ice remains for certain places
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
Yellow weather warnings for heavy snow and ice remain in effect across much of the UK, with forecasters urging the public to exercise “extra care” on roads. An ongoing flood risk also prompts continued vigilance from authorities.
Saturday is set to be a cold, sunny day for most, as Arctic maritime air sweeps across the nation, according to the Met Office. A yellow warning for ice covers Wales and central and southern England, active from Friday evening until Saturday morning. Icy surfaces could lead to difficult travel conditions and potential “some injuries” from slips and falls.
Further north, parts of northeast England and northern Scotland are under a snow and ice warning, which began on Friday afternoon and lasts until Saturday morning. Another yellow warning for snow and ice, stretching from Derby to Scotland, will take effect on Saturday evening through to Sunday morning.
The Met Office anticipates snow in these areas could be “heavy at times”, leading to “some disruption to travel”. Accumulations of “1-3cm (of snow) will be possible at low levels, with 3-7cm possible above about 150m elevation, and perhaps 10-15cm above 400m”. Northern Ireland also faces an ice warning until Saturday morning.
Met Office chief forecaster Rebekah Hicks warned: “Snow is likely ahead of the rain across northern England and Scotland and could reach lower levels at times on Saturday night into Sunday. The snow will gradually turn to rain as the front moves east across the country on Sunday.
“The rain may be heavy at times and it will be windy in coastal areas. Additional warnings may be required. We encourage the public to keep up to date with the latest forecasts and any warnings that may be issued.”
Meanwhile, the Environment Agency has called for continued “vigilance” due to persistent flood risks, with 75 flood warnings and 151 flood alerts currently active. Jonathan Day, flood duty manager, stated: “With another band of rain on its way, we need the public to remain vigilant to the risk of flooding.
“So far, more than 24,000 homes and businesses have been protected but sadly around 330 have suffered flooding, and our thoughts are with those communities affected.
“Our teams will continue to do all they can to support local people, with pumps, temporary barriers and by clearing waterways to ensure flood water can drain away.”
Floods minister Emma Hardy added: “Flooding is devastating and my thoughts are with the people affected, and I urge residents to follow local advice over the next few days to ensure they stay safe.”

Iranian judiciary announces conditional release of several detained political activists
Latest wave of arrests comes weeks after protests in Iran that began peacefully over economic grievances but later turned violent
ISTANBUL
Iran’s judiciary said Saturday several political activists, detained in recent weeks, have been conditionally released on bail pending the continuation of legal proceedings.
In a statement carried by Mehr News Agency, the judiciary said the releases came following the completion of initial investigations and after the detainees received formal warnings regarding “the nature of their actions and conduct.”
The statement said the individuals were freed “on an appropriate bail order and on a conditional basis” until judicial proceedings are concluded.
The judiciary added that in other cases involving detainees who had already received final court rulings, judicial sentences have been enforced, and those individuals are currently serving their prison terms.
No further details were provided regarding the number of activists released.
The latest wave of arrests comes weeks after protests in Iran that began peacefully over economic grievances but later turned violent, resulting in more than 3,000 deaths, according to official figures.
Iranian authorities accused the US and Israel of backing what they described as “rioting” and “terrorism.”

Munich security conference live: Marco Rubio addresses European leaders rattled by Trump

US pressure on Greenland is ‘totally unacceptable’, says Danish PM – as it happened
Mette Frederiksen tells Munich Security Conference that Denmark is willing to work with the US, but ‘there are, of course, things that you cannot compromise on’
Pressure on Greenland is 'totally unacceptable,' Danish PM says
Frederiksen gets asked (again) if Trump is still interested in acquiring Greenland, and she confirms that “unfortunately, the desire is the same”.
She says “it is something we, of course, talk a lot about”, and she adds that “the pressure on Greenland is totally unacceptable”.
“We are talking about threats, but as you Jens-Frederik often say, the people of Greenland have never been threatened before by anyone, so that pressure is unacceptable,” she says.
She says Denmark is willing to work with the US, but “there are, of course, things that you cannot compromise on” including the respect of other state’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.
She says Denmark will not compromise on that, but suggests there are other points that can be discussed, including a revision of the 1951 defence agreement with the US, which she syas offers a “very easy” way for the US to “have a stronger footprint in Greenland”.
“We don’t think it’s over. We now have a working group, we will try to see if we can find a solution, and … we will do whatever we can, but of course there are red lines that will not be crossed,” she says.
The US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, has sought to reassure European leaders that ending the transatlantic era is “not out goal nor our wish,” but urged them to leave behind the postwar “delusions” on trade (9:07), deindustrialisation, green policies and mass migration (9:10, 9:16).
Rubio insisted that “Americans may sometimes come off as a little direct and urgent in our counsel” as they “care deeply about Europe” (9:13), as he says the US “do not want our allies to be weak, because that makes us weaker” (9:20).
He said the US was intent on building a new world order, adding “while we are prepared, if necessary, to do this alone, it is our preference and it is our hope to do this together with you, our friends here in Europe”.
Earlier today,
Ukraine wants security guarantees for a minimum of 20 years from the US before it can sign a peace deal with dignity, Volodymyr Zelenskyy said ahead of talks next week with Russia and the US.
In an earlier speech, he said that “none of our people chose to be heroes” (12:28) as he described the everyday life under Russian attacks (12:11), urged Europe to “stand up to Russia” (12:36) and warned against any half-baked deal with Russia saying it would be an “illusion” to think it would stop Putin from attacking again in the future (12:40).
Later in the evening, Zelenskyy held bilateral talks with US secretary of state Marco Rubio (20:52) and spoke on the phone with US envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner (21:15).
Meanwhile,
The UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, said there was an urgent need for a closer UK defence relationship with Europe (10:42, 10:56), so that the UK would be at the centre of a stronger European defence setup and economic revival (10:46), insisting “we are not the Britain of the Brexit years any more” (10:33).
Starmer said “the new normal” required Europe to “take primary responsibility for its own defence” (10:37), as “the solidity of peace” was “softening” amid “warning signs” from Russia (10:31).
Separately,
The Danish prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, condemned “totally unacceptable” pressure on Greenland amid continuing US interest in taking over the semi-autonomous territory (19:07).
The Greenlandic prime minister, Jens-Frederik Nielsen, said it was “outrageous” to see the Greenlanders threatened by a Nato ally (19:12), as he warned about setting a broader precedent in international relations.
Their comments came a day after they held a brief meeting with the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, on the sidelines of the conference.
Finally,
Late Russian opposition leader and anti-corruption activist Alexei Navalny was poisoned by Russia with a deadly toxic found in the skin of Ecuador dart frogs, “highly likely” leading to his death, the UK Foreign Office said (14:06).
The disclosure came at the same conference at which the news of his passing broke two years ago (14:28).
And the quote of the day award today goes to Poland’s Radosław Sikorski for his answer on a question on how Poland and Nato would respond to a Russian attack on its territory (17:07).

Zelenskyy spoke with US envoys Witkoff, Kushner ahead of next round of talks
As expected (18:00), Zelenskyy also spoke with US envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, ahead of next week’s trilateral talks in Gevena.
In a short statement, he said they “discusses some developments following the meetings in Abu Dhabi,” but noted that “not everything can be disclosed over the phone.”
He also debriefed them on his meeting with Rubio, and thanked again for the US support for Ukraine.
Zelenskyy spoke with Rubio discussing Russian attacks, diplomatic peace process
More importantly, before coming to the dinner, Zelenskyy also met with the US secretary of state Marco Rubio.
In a brief statement on Telegram, the Ukrainian president said he informed Rubio “about the situation on the frontline, ongoing Russian attacks, and the consequences of the [Russian] attacks on the energy system”.
He said the pair also “discussed in detail the diplomatic process and trilateral meetings” including the upcoming meeting in Geneva next week.
It’s a pretty standard statement; let’s see what, if anything, we are going to get from the US side.
At the award event, Zelenskyy delivered a short, courteous speech, thanking several European leaders by first name for their support, and saying the Ukrainian people – on whose behalf he collected the award – will know them well and remember their support.
He’s not staying for the dinner, though – seems that he’s not done with the government business for tonight.
Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelenskyy is at the Munich Residence, where he is due to receive the Ewald von Kleist Award for 2026 shortly.
In a brief statement to the press, standing alongside Bavaria’s Markus Söder and the MSC chair Wolfgang Ischinger as well as Poland’s prime minister Donald Tusk, he thanks Germany for its continuing support, saying it is now the largest donor of help to the wartorn country.
He also says that he was glad to visit the joint German-Ukrainian drone production facility yesterday, where he received the first produced drone. He says it is “already on the battlefield”.
Poland’s Tusk, who will deliver laudatory remarks at the ceremony later, said that “for Ukraine, there is no prize, even Nobel peace prize is not enough” for what it suffered during the Russian aggression.
He adds:
“Some say that Ukraine should be grateful for everything. The truth is, exactly the opposite: the rest of us should be grateful to you.”
Europe needs to be able to respond to several crises simultaneously, Danish PM says
In a pretty stark warning, Denmark’s Frederiksen says that Europe radically needs to step up its ability “to tackle more crises at the same time, because the old world is not coming back.”
“Forget about tackling one crisis [at a time]. We have to be able to tackle all of them at the same time,” she says.
“I’m sorry to say, I think it’s a part of the strategy from different parts of the world right now to throw as many conflicts as many discussions, as many tweets, as many messages as possible on the table at the same time, so everybody is running around like a chicken without head,” she says.
That’s why Europe needs to find out to approach these issues in a more strategic way, she says.
US threats on Greenland 'damage' Nato, Germany's Pistorius says
German defence minister Boris Pistorius joins in condemnations of US aggressive policy towards Greenland, as he says:
“[That] the biggest ally of the [Nato] alliance threatens and questions the territorial sovereignty and integrity of another ally – this is incredible and damages the alliance … which has been the most successful alliance in the history of mankind.”
'Outrageous' to see Greenlandic people feel unsafe because of ally's behaviour, Greenlandic PM says
Greenlandic prime minister Nielsen says picks up the issue of pressure on the Greenlandic people.
“If I think about my people, we are so proud. We live in a harsh environment, we are resilient, we live in a land where nobody was able to live for many, many, many years. There’s a reason why we are the ones left,” he says to some laughs in the room.
He says there is a broader principle at stake here, about whether it is legitimate to make other territories “a puzzle in a big game” of global powers.
“What would prevent, if they did that, the US, Russia and China to split up the world in three big blocks? … it’s outrageous,” he says.
He picks up on Frederiksen’s comments:
“The paradox is that the Greenlandic people have never felt threatened, and [now] the first time they feel unsafe for real, [it is] … with an ally talked about acquiring them, buying them and so on. It’s outrageous,” he says.
Pressure on Greenland is 'totally unacceptable,' Danish PM says
Frederiksen gets asked (again) if Trump is still interested in acquiring Greenland, and she confirms that “unfortunately, the desire is the same”.
She says “it is something we, of course, talk a lot about”, and she adds that “the pressure on Greenland is totally unacceptable”.
“We are talking about threats, but as you Jens-Frederik often say, the people of Greenland have never been threatened before by anyone, so that pressure is unacceptable,” she says.
She says Denmark is willing to work with the US, but “there are, of course, things that you cannot compromise on” including the respect of other state’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.
She says Denmark will not compromise on that, but suggests there are other points that can be discussed, including a revision of the 1951 defence agreement with the US, which she syas offers a “very easy” way for the US to “have a stronger footprint in Greenland”.
“We don’t think it’s over. We now have a working group, we will try to see if we can find a solution, and … we will do whatever we can, but of course there are red lines that will not be crossed,” she says.
Packed room for early evening session on Arctic security

In the meantime, an early evening panel on Arctic security is now under way over at the Bayerischer Hof – and the room is absolutely packed.
Denmark’s Mette Frederiksen says it’s not usual to see so much interest in the region’s security.
But she is “very satisfied that Nato is now working [on] security in the Arctic region in a more structured way,” and wants to see a “permanent presence” in the Arctic region, including in and around Greenland.
She says that as climate change progresses, there will be need to monitor more closely what Russia and China “will do around Greenland,” but stresses “we are not there yet” – in a clear rebuke to Trump’s (repeated) claims on this issue.
Greenlandic prime minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen strikes a similar tone, as he said that the talks about Russian and Chinese activity is premature.
“But we are not naive and we see the longer perspective when our routes in the north west and the northeast … [when] they they melt, there might be more traffic,” he says.
But he says allies are aligned, as Nato steps up its activity in the region through the new Arctic sentry mission.
I am now at the Munich Residence, where Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelenskyy will receive the Munich Security Conference’s Ewald von Kleist Award for 2026 later tonight.
Poland’s prime minister Donald Tusk will deliver laudatory remarks.
Getting into this beautiful building – the seat of government and residence of the Bavarian dukes, electors and kings from 1508 to 1918, as its website says – requires passing several security checkpoints, but it’s only understandable given numerous other senior officials are also expected to be in attendance.
I will bring you the key lines from this evening’s speeches, but there is still some time to go before then.
Zelenskyy 'still in conflict with US about lot of final aspects of deal' – Guardian's Patrick Wintour on Ukraine talks
Jakub Krupa
in Munich
Zelenskyy’s comments show how much still needs to be resolved before an agreement on ending the Russian invasion on Ukraine can be agreed.
Our diplomatic editor Patrick Wintour told me that it appears that “he is still in conflict with the Americans about a lot of the final aspects of the deal”.
Looking ahead to next week’s Geneva talks, Wintour said:
“I don’t think there’s going to be any short-term progress. I don’t think Vladimir Putin feels he’s under enough pressure at the moment.”
Russia changing its chief negotiator ahead of Geneva talks could be delaying tactic, Zelenskyy says
Separately, Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelenskyy has given a press briefing on the margins of the main conference in the last hour.
He said he was due to meet with the US secretary of state Marco Rubio today, and hold a phone call with US envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner later tonight, with his chief negotiator and former defence minister Rustem Umerov talking to them “several times a day”. Zelenskyy also met with a delegation of US senators earlier today.
He stressed it was important to engage with the US through all possible channels to ensure no one can say that Ukrainians were stalling the talks.
Zelenskyy also spoke about his expectations for the Geneva negotiations next week, saying he was surprised to hear about Russia’s decision to change the head of its delegation after the first two rounds.
He said he saw this as a potential move to delay decisions, but counted on Americans to continue talks and not let Russia force them to reopen previously resolved issues.
He also confirmed he was still seeking a political commitment to allow Ukraine into the European Union, ideally by 2027, as part of the security guarantees.
“We have to be ready, to prepare everything … technically, Ukraine has to be ready in 2027, but the date of accession depends on all these dialogues with 27 member states,” he said.
Zelenskyy was also asked if he worried he could also get poisoned by Russia, after the earlier report about Alexei Navalny
“I can’t think about Vladimir Putin and his poison ambitions, if he has them. I try not to think about it; otherwise it’s all I think about,” the said.
'A conditional offer to cooperate with Europe' – Guardian's Patrick Wintour on EU-US relations after Rubio's speech
Jakub Krupa
in Munich
If you are looking for a quick summary of events so far, I caught up with our diplomatic editor Patrick Wintour who is also here at the Munich Security Conference to get his thoughts on what the events of the last 48 hours mean for the transatlantic relationship.
Poland’s Sikorski gets asked about what would Poland’s response be if Russia crossed the border and invaded its territory.
He gives this rather entertaining answer:
“We joined Nato for common defence.
If they cross the border, start killing Nato citizens, Polish citizens, we would expect the North Atlantic Council to meet and to activate the contingency plan, and after that, the plan is very easy: we win, they lose.”
US Democratic senator Elissa Slotkin – also on the panel, in a rather awkward position of having to comment on the US policies she disagrees with – says she is “very concerned” about the 2026 US midterm elections in November.
“He [Trump] is telling us what he wants to do. He is laying it out for us, and is up to the Americans to believe him, right? That, just like in 2020, he said, If I don’t win, then it wasn’t a free and fair election. He is repeating the playbook now, threatening to put uniformed federal agents around polling locations. I mean, he’s telling us the playbook.”
She says “the question is what are we going to do as Americans to defend our democracy that we helped invent.”

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio told the Munich Security Conference that it would be “geopolitical malpractice” not to talk to China, as he pledged that Washington would carefully manage its differences with Beijing.
“Because we’re two large countries with huge global interests, our national interests will often not align,” Rubio told the event in a keynote address on Saturday morning.
“We owe it to the world to try to manage those as best we can, obviously avoiding conflict, both economic and worse … but no one is under any illusion that bilateral relations will have fundamental changes.”

Rubio’s remarks – ahead of US President Donald Trump’s expected trip to Beijing in April – were a continuation of his government’s softer rhetoric towards Beijing, even as he tried to rally the US’ allies against unnamed common challenges to Western civilisation.
“We have to have a relationship with China, and many of the countries represented here today are going to have to have a relationship with China, always understanding that nothing that we agree to could come at the expense of our national interest,” Rubio said.

He added that the “goal of diplomacy is to try to navigate those times in which our national interests come into conflict with one another, always hoping to do it peacefully”.

Trump: "Peace Through Strength" as Iran tensions escalate

ALBAWABA - President Donald Trump of the United States has said that regime change in Iran could be a good thing. He has also said that the U.S. would not use military force against Iran if a "proper agreement" is reached. His comments come at a time when reports say the U.S. military is making backup plans for long-term operations in case diplomacy fails.
Trump spoke at a military base in North Carolina and said that he had thought a deal with Iran was possible in the past, but that Tehran's approach to nuclear talks was difficult. He said that showing strength and maybe even putting more pressure on the other side might be necessary to reach a peaceful solution. He stressed that deterrence could ultimately decide the outcome.
Earlier, Trump said that the world's largest aircraft carrier would be ready to go in case talks fell through. He also talked about the U.S. attacks on Iranian nuclear sites last June, which showed that Washington is ready to act if necessary.
The White House correspondent for Al Jazeera says that these comments are the first time Trump has openly suggested regime change as a possible goal. For weeks, he has been publicly supporting a diplomatic path that he calls "peace through strength."
Military Readiness and Risks to Diplomacy
Two U.S. officials told Reuters that the Pentagon is getting ready for the possibility of military operations against Iran that could last for weeks if the president gives the order. The officials, who asked not to be named, said that making such plans is very risky for the fragile diplomatic process that is currently going on.
The USS Gerald R. Ford aircraft carrier, which is currently in the Caribbean, will go to the Middle East to support the USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group that is already there, according to reports from U.S. media outlets like The New York Times. More U.S. naval ships, such as eight Arleigh Burke-class destroyers, are stationed in the Arabian Sea, eastern Mediterranean, and Red Sea.
What Tehran Says and What It Won't Do
Iranian officials say that the US and Israel are making up reasons to get involved and change the government. Tehran has said that it will respond strongly to any military attack, even if it is small. Iranian leaders still say that any deal that limits the country's nuclear activities must also include relief from sanctions.
Washington, on the other hand, wants Iran to completely stop enriching uranium and send its stockpile of highly enriched uranium to another country. The U.S. government has also tried to expand talks to include Iran's missile program and its alliances with armed groups in the region. Tehran has turned down these offers many times.
Ali Shamkhani, who is in charge of Iran's Supreme National Defense Council, said that Iran's defense system was a "red line" that could not be crossed. He said that the country's armed forces are still on high alert and that any mistake would have serious consequences. He did, however, say that talks could go forward if they were held on realistic terms and didn't make too many demands.
He went on to say that diplomatic efforts are meant to ease tensions and strengthen the political track, even though military deployments show that pressure is growing in the area.

Change in power in Iran ‘would be the best thing that could happen’, Trump says

The remarks came shortly after Trump confirmed that he was sending a second aircraft carrier group to the Middle East and after he spoke with troops at Ft. Bragg, North Carolina.
US President Donald Trump said Friday that a change in power in Iran “would be the best thing that could happen” as his administration weighs whether to take military action against Tehran.
The remarks came shortly after Trump confirmed earlier on Friday that he was sending a second aircraft carrier group to the Middle East and after he spoke with troops at Ft. Bragg, North Carolina.
“It seems like that would be the best thing that could happen,” Trump said in an exchange with reporters when asked about pressing for the ouster of the Islamic clerical rule in Iran. “For 47 years, they’ve been talking and talking and talking.”
Although Trump has stated in recent weeks that further reducing Iran's nuclear program is his top objective, he implied on Friday that this is just one of many concessions the United States requires from Iran.
During his trip to Washington this week to meet with Trump, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been insistent that any agreement include measures to stop Iran's support of proxy organisations like Hamas and Hezbollah and to neutralise its ballistic missile development.
“If we do it, that would be the least of the mission,” Trump said of targeting Tehran’s nuclear program, which suffered significant setbacks in US military strikes last year.
Another round of talks planned
Trump's remarks supporting the possible overthrow of Ayatollah Ali Khamenei also come weeks after Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated that the administration's recent attempt to remove Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro from office was not nearly as complicated as a possible change of power in Iran.
During a Senate hearing last month, Rubio stated that "you're talking about a regime that's in place for a very long time" when discussing Iran.
“So that’s going to require a lot of careful thinking, if that eventuality ever presents itself,” Rubio said.
Trump said the USS Gerald R. Ford, the world’s largest aircraft carrier, is being sent from the Caribbean Sea to the Mideast to join other warships and military assets the US has built up in the region.
Trump had suggested another round of talks with the Iranians was planned for this week, but those negotiations didn’t materialize as one of Tehran’s top security officials visited Oman and Qatar and exchanged messages with US intermediaries.
“In case we don’t make a deal, we’ll need it,” Trump told reporters about the second carrier. He added, “It’ll be leaving very soon.”
With the Middle East still reeling from the Israel-Hamas battle in the Gaza Strip, Gulf Arab countries have already cautioned that any attack may escalate into another regional confrontation.
Iranians are also starting to observe 40-day mourning rituals in remembrance of the thousands of people who were slain during Tehran's brutal suppression of statewide demonstrations last month, which will increase internal pressure on the heavily sanctioned Islamic Republic.
Iran has insisted its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes, but experts say before the June war, Tehran had been enriching uranium up to 60% purity, a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels.

European debate over nuclear weapons gains pace
Sweden

17:11:12 KST

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz told the Munich Security Conference (MSC) that he had "held confidential talks with the French president about European nuclear deterrence".
And Prime Minister Keir Starmer of Britain, Europe's other nuclear power along with France, said it was "enhancing our nuclear cooperation with France".
The UK's nuclear deterrent already protects NATO members, and Starmer said "any adversary must know that in a crisis they could be confronted by our combined strength" alongside France.
Still, while the United States and Russia have thousands of nuclear warheads each, the combined French and British arsenal is in the hundreds.
Discussion of nuclear armament has long been viewed as taboo in many other European countries -- but Russian aggression and worries about US commitment have forced the issue into mainstream European politics.
In a report assessing "Europe's nuclear options" published for the MSC, experts warned that the relatively small nuclear arsenals of France and the United Kingdom might not be enough to face down Russia without US support.
"Europeans can no longer outsource their thinking about nuclear deterrence to the United States," the group of 11 experts warn in the paper, which calls on Europe to "urgently confront a new nuclear reality" in the face of "Russia's nuclear-backed revisionism".
Many European officials are convinced that Moscow's territorial ambitions will not be confined to Ukraine, and that other European countries -- including even NATO members -- could face some sort of attack.
US President Donald Trump's disdainful comments about NATO and his highly transactional approach to foreign relations, meanwhile, have Washington's European allies questioning whether they can risk relying on US protection.
'Complacency has ended'
The MSC report lays out five nuclear options for Europe, but cautions that none are good and that there is "no low-cost or risk-free way out of Europe's nuclear predicament".
"The era in which Europe could afford strategic complacency has ended," the authors write.
"However uncomfortable the debate may be, the new security environment requires European policymakers to confront the role of nuclear weapons in the defence of the continent directly and without delay -– and to invest the resources needed to do so competently."
The five options are: Continue to rely on American deterrence; strengthen the role of British and French nuclear weapons in a European deterrent; jointly develop European nuclear weapons as a deterrent; increase the number of European countries with their own nuclear arsenals; or expand European conventional military power to present a more intimidating non-nuclear deterrent.
Sticking with the status quo, and relying on America's unmatched military might, remains "the most credible and feasible option" in the short term, according to the authors.
"We have nuclear deterrence already" within the NATO framework "which is working, which has plans with capabilities and doctrines," Estonian Foreign Minister Margus Tsahkna told AFP.
Merz declared that European NATO allies need to remain united while building up a European nuclear deterrence, stressing that "we will not allow different security zones to emerge in Europe".
Macron's speech
The capability gap between the United States and Russia on the one hand, and the much small French and British arsenals on the other, is currently so large that very few believe Europeans can assume full responsibility for deterrence in the short term.
"If there's going to be some kind of bigger European investments in France or the UK's nuclear deterrence, that's only a good thing," Finnish Defence Minister Antti Hakkanen recently told AFP.
But he quickly added: "If you're talking about to compensate US nuclear deterrence, that's not realistic at this point."
Still, experts welcomed the increasingly serious political debate on an issue that has long worried military planners.
"That's very positive, but now we need action," Heloise Fayet of the French Institute of International Relations (Ifri), a contributor to the MSC report, told AFP.
The report notes that both France and Britain would face a range of challenges in growing their arsenals and extending nuclear protection across Europe, from hefty costs to tricky questions about who holds final authority to launch the warheads.
Britain's nuclear weapons also currently depend heavily on US technology, meaning for the moment there is "no sustainable future for a UK nuclear deterrent without US collaboration," the experts note.
French President Emmanuel Macron, who has previously raised the possibility of extending France's nuclear umbrella across Europe, is scheduled to deliver a major speech on French nuclear doctrine at the end of February.
Macron said in Munich he was considering a doctrine that could include "special cooperation, joint exercises, and shared security interests with certain key countries".
"This speech by Macron will be very important," said Fayet. "It has generated enormous expectations in Europe."

With their first female leader gone, can the Liberals shake their 'women problem'?
Unknown

With the Liberals' first female leader, Sussan Ley, dumped after less than a year at the helm, experts say the party has done little to shake its perceived "women problem".
But senior party figures insist gender had nothing to do with Ley's removal, instead blaming dire polling and looming electoral oblivion.
Ley became the Liberal Party’s first female leader in its 80-year history after the Coalition’s landslide defeat at the May 2025 election. A moderate, she narrowly defeated conservative frontbencher Angus Taylor 29 votes to 25.
Nine months later, she was ousted and replaced by Taylor, who secured a decisive 34 to 17 victory after several of Ley’s key backers switched sides.
On Friday morning, before Ley was ousted, Northern Territory Senator Jacinta Nampijinpa Price said any attempt to frame a leadership change around gender would amount to "identity politics".
"Frankly, Australians can see through this nonsense. Leadership is not about gender — it is about competence," she said on social media.
She pointed to the Coalition’s primary vote falling from about 31 per cent at the election to 18 per cent in recent polling, arguing the party was "bleeding votes to One Nation".
Victorian senator and key Liberal power-broker James Paterson was among the first to publicly back Taylor’s leadership bid, also pointing to recent opinion polls.
"Political leaders are judged on their performance, not their gender," he said.
'A classic case of the glass cliff'
While Ley's detractors rejected the idea that the leadership spill reflected a broader issue for women, some experts argued her removal risked reinforcing long-standing concerns among female voters.
Michelle Ryan, director of the Global Institute for Women's Leadership at the Australian National University, told SBS News Ley's elevation was a "classic case of the glass cliff".
Ryan was among the first researchers to coin the term that describes women being promoted during times of crisis, when the risk of failure is high.
"Coming in after the worst electoral performance in history ... the fact that she's now been pushed out after such a short time sort of illustrates the precarity," she said.
The day she was elected Liberal leader, Ley said she didn't accept that she was facing a "glass cliff", saying her agenda was broader than gender.
Tony Barry, a former senior Liberal staffer and now director of RedBridge Group, which conducts polling and political research, said the party faced an entrenched perception problem around gender.
"The problem for the Liberal Party is there's an existing prejudice amongst voters," he said.
"They do have a women problem, whether that's real and whether that's fair or not, that is the perception.
"The events of the last week are at risk of reinforcing that."
He said Labor did not have the same issue despite Julia Gillard being knifed as leader because the party had a high representation of female MPs.
Dr Blair Williams, a politics lecturer at the University of NSW Canberra, said the Liberals' gender problem was threefold: Under-representation in parliament, declining support among female voters and what she described as a "toxic blokey culture".
She said accusations of bullying and sexual assault over the past decade had contributed to a culture many women viewed as unwelcoming.
"Young women, Gen Z, Millennials, they are not voting for the Liberals," she said.
"It's a competition between Labor and the Greens at this point for those votes. You really do see a pretty dire scenario if they don't get their act together when it comes to women."
Women under-represented in Liberal ranks
Despite setting targets more than a decade ago for equal gender representation by 2025, both the Liberals and their Coalition partner, the Nationals, have fallen short.
Women make up just 33 per cent of Liberal MPs. Among the Nationals, a little over a quarter of MPs are female. Neither party has adopted gender quotas.
By contrast, Labor reached 50 per cent female representation in 2022. After its landslide victory at last year’s election, its caucus rose to 56 per cent women, and 12 of its 23 cabinet portfolios were held by women.
Labor introduced a 35 per cent quota for female MPs in 1994, later moving to a "40:40:20" model requiring no fewer than 40 per cent of seats be held by men or women, with the remaining 20 per cent open to either gender.
In June last year, Taylor said a "crusade" was needed to involve more women in the Liberal party, but he remained opposed to gender quotas, arguing they "subvert democratic processes".
"I think there are better ways of achieving this … mentoring, recruitment, support is the way to make sure you have talented people," he told ABC Radio National.
Professor Catharine Lumby, an expert in media and gender studies at the University of Sydney, said quotas could be implemented while still setting "high bars for achievement".
"Those two things can coexist," she told SBS News.
"The fact that there's a resistance to quotas tells you there's a deep-seated cultural issue in the Liberal Party."
University of NSW Canberra's Blair Williams said the Liberal Party needed a clear policy platform that spoke to women if it wanted to attract support, noting its proposal to end work-from-home for public servants, which it took to the last election and was later dumped, was particularly unappealing.
"It's not just about who your leader is, it's about what does the party actually stand for ... how can they actually relate to a changing generation of Australians and especially Australian women?" she said.
Barry said all political parties benefited from diversity.
"Putting mostly Gen X white men around a table doesn't bring about diversity of opinion and viewpoints, and that's a dangerous thing for any political party," he said.
"It means that you're representing a small base as opposed to the majority."

UK government's 'own goal': anti-extremism game character becomes protest symbol
Unknown

17:03:06 KST

What began as a government-backed effort to steer young Britons away from right-wing extremism has turned into an unexpected protest symbol against the government itself.
Last week, women wearing purple wigs gathered in London’s Parliament Square to protest illegal immigration and sexual crimes committed by migrants. The demonstration was not unusual in Britain’s current political climate — except for one detail. The protesters were dressed as “Amelia,” a fictional character from an online video game funded by the British Home Office.
The game, “Pathways,” was launched in 2023 with support from the Home Office’s Prevent program, which aims to counter radicalization among youth. Developed by the East Riding of Yorkshire Council and Hull City Council, the interactive platform was designed to help players recognize and respond to extremist content online, particularly narratives associated with the far right.
On the game’s website, it is described as an “interactive learning experience about extremism, radicalization and prevention,” encouraging users to consider how to react to online content and understand the consequences of certain actions.
In the storyline, players control a white teenage character named Charlie, who is encouraged to avoid what the game defines as right-wing extremist ideology. This includes attending protests against the “erosion of British values,” searching for immigration statistics online and sharing videos claiming that “the government is betraying white Britons” and that citizens must “take back control of our country.”
Amelia appears early in the narrative as a college student and political activist involved in right-wing groups. She urges Charlie to join anti-immigration protests and defend “traditional British values.” If players consistently choose the “wrong” options, Charlie may ultimately be referred to the government’s Prevent program over terrorism concerns.
From villain to viral icon
Nearly three years after its release, “Pathways” resurfaced on social media, where critics argued that the activities labeled “extremist” were often mainstream political views and disproportionately targeted white British youth. The backlash transformed Amelia from a cautionary antagonist into a viral symbol of defiance.
Supporters began sharing AI-generated images depicting Amelia as a heroic figure: leading medieval knights into battle, flying above the British Parliament as a superhero, replacing the central figure in Norman Rockwell’s “Freedom of Speech,” or portrayed as the Lady of the Lake presenting King Arthur with Excalibur.
In one widely circulated video, Amelia warns popular British fictional characters — including Harry Potter, members of Monty Python and Paddington Bear — about the dangers of radical Islam. In another, she appears as a British “Power Ranger,” rescuing a girl from a Muslim man. A parody “bad ending” video imagines Charlie and Amelia marrying and having “four white children,” presented as an intentionally provocative twist on the game’s messaging.
The character’s popularity reached a new peak when protesters from the Women’s Safety Initiative appeared in Parliament Square dressed as Amelia, chanting “We are all Amelia.”
The group said it was protesting what it described as sexual crimes committed by illegal migrants and accused the government of sacrificing women’s safety. “We are tired of our safety being sacrificed for the comfort of migrant men,” the organization wrote on X.
One protester invoked the UK’s grooming gang scandals, claiming that “mass immigration has harmed the personal safety of too many women in Britain.”
Government response and broader tensions
The Home Office rejected criticism of the game, stating that the Prevent program has diverted nearly 6,000 individuals from violent ideologies and that such projects are tailored to address local threats.
The controversy comes amid broader political tensions over immigration and national identity. Since Labour returned to power under Prime Minister Keir Starmer, critics argue that the government has failed to curb illegal crossings via the English Channel, while providing migrants with housing and access to services.
At the same time, Britain’s High Court ruled this week that the designation of the activist group Palestine Action as a terrorist organization was unlawful, describing the decision by then-Home Secretary Yvette Cooper as disproportionate. The ruling paves the way for the anti-Israel group to continue operating, though the ban remains in place pending the government’s appeal.
Palestine Action was designated a terrorist organization last July after a series of break-ins and acts of vandalism, including an August 2024 intrusion into an Elbit Systems facility near Bristol, where activists armed with hammers and axes damaged property and clashed with police, and a June 2025 break-in at RAF Brize Norton, where red paint was sprayed on two refueling aircraft.
Following the court’s decision, London’s Metropolitan Police acknowledged that there may be “some confusion” among the public and said officers would no longer arrest individuals solely for association with the group while gathering further evidence.
Against this backdrop, the rise of a fictional video game character as a protest icon underscores the depth of Britain’s culture wars. What was intended as an educational tool to counter extremism has instead become, in the words of one critic, “a spectacular own goal” for the government.

How many non-local students are going to Hong Kong universities since quota rise?

How many non-local students are going to Hong Kong universities since quota rise?
‘We will not rule out reviewing the quota if there is such a need, and the universities’ supporting facilities are ready,’ minister says
Hong Kong public universities had more than 20,000 non-local undergraduate students in the second academic year since the government doubled quotas, a 17 per cent year-on-year increase, as the education minister promised to review the threshold.
The Education University of Hong Kong (EdU) saw the sharpest increase in non-local undergraduate students under the policy, jumping by 90 per cent over three academic years, followed by Baptist University.
Starting in the 2024-25 academic year, the government doubled non-local student admission quotas at public universities to the equivalent of 40 per cent of the number of local students. Authorities plan to raise the threshold to 50 per cent in 2026-27.
Secretary for Education Christine Choi Yuk-lin on Saturday told the media that some universities had nearly reached their quotas for this year, underlining the fast pace of development.
“We will keep an eye on the situation. We will not rule out reviewing the quota if there is such a need, and the universities’ supporting facilities are ready,” she said.
Choi said that a supply of about 5,000 hostel places could be increased under a scheme to accommodate more non-local students by allowing private developers or operators to convert commercial buildings into student hostels.

Eat like an Olympian: what athletes need to eat during the Games and how nutrition helps performance

During the Winter Olympic Games, thousands of athletes have breakfast, lunch, and dinner in the facilities. What are they eating, and what role does nutrition play in the competition?
At the heart of the 2026 Winter Olympic Games’ experience is the food, which, for high-performance athletes, is not only a way of discovering the rich Italian cuisine but also provides fuel for the competition.
Every day, more than 10,000 meals are prepared across the different villages and facilities.
According to the organisation of the games, in the Milan Olympic Village alone, the kitchens serve around 3,000 eggs and approximately 450 kilograms of pasta daily.
In the 24-hour canteens, athletes can find balanced meals to help fight jet lag and help with training, high-protein diets for cross-country skiiers, lighter ones for bobsleighers, and options for vegans, celiacs, and religious traditions, according to the Italian Minstry for Infrastructure and Transport.
"Food as energy, but also as a universal language and a tool for inclusion: in villages like the one in Cortina, everything revolves around one principle,” reads a press release from the Ministry.
“Those arriving from the other side of the world will be able to eat as if they were at home, without compromising their preparation or recovery,” it added.
Routine is vital
Nutrition is key for professional athletes, even more so during intense periods of activity such as competing in the Olympic Games.
“People don’t realise how much their body needs,” Olivia Morgan, dietitian and sports nutrition expert at Mass General Brigham in Boston, told Euronews Health.
She stressed that the core to athlete nutrition is to make sure the energy intake matches the demands of their performance, especially during intense periods.
Morgan, who has experience working with Olympic athletes, noted the importance of making sure that nutrition still fits amid the travel, the new environment, the change in routine, and heightened emotions.
“Making sure, as always, that we're hitting our intervals throughout the day and keeping to things that we know we enjoy and that work really well for our body and enjoying the really fun things afterwards,” she added.
Special characteristics of winter sports
These days in Italy, we can witness sports from nordic skiing, to figure skating and biathlon. Winter sports have their own specificities and demands, which is the same as when it comes to food.
“If we're looking at more of the Nordic sports, the demands of the training, a lot of times, exceed potentially competition times”, Kelly Drager, lead performance dietitian at the Canada Sport Institute Alberta, working with the country’s Olympic athletes, told Euronews Health.
She added that winter athletes often train voluminously and have very intense periods during the summer months as preparation.
Even with the special circumstances under which winter athletes compete, Drager said, things are changing and weather, even in winter is less and less extreme.
Another aspect to consider for winter athletes is that they are usually travelling and competing during the peak of respiratory viruses such as influenza.
Carbs, carbs, carbs
Italy is world-renowned for its pasta and pizza, which, during the games, may be athletes’ closest allies.
“I think protein has been a major focus in society right now, but really, for athletes, carbohydrates are kind of the king,” Morgan said.
According to her, many have the misconception that protein is more important for athletes than carbohydrates, and emphasise it more in their diet.
“What happens is we just get a ton of protein and not enough carbs, we're not really able to utilize all of that protein for its designated purpose”, she added.
Italian style is at the heart of the menus, the organisers have said, with pasta and pizza at the center of the carbohydrate stations.
Together with local cold cuts, cheeses, fruits, and desserts, they aim to give the athletes an “authentic taste of Italy.”
The importance of “boring balance”
For Morgan, at the core of good nutrition are the basics: five pieces of fruit or vegetables a day, balanced meals, and the occasional cheeky treat – all while maintaining a regular schedule.
“We need to eat balanced meals consistently throughout the day, and it's boring nutrition; nobody wants to listen to it. They want to follow a fancy diet. They want to take a fancy supplement. But the real roots of nutrition are in that boring balance,” Morgan added.
She explained that, especially for athletes, who demand so much from their bodies, even the smallest misses in these basics tend to have bigger consequences.
Yet, food is not only fuel, nutrition experts warn. There has to be enjoyment, satisfaction, and a good relationship with the body.
“The body is not just a machine and food is just not a means to an end”, Drager said, adding that at her work in Canada, individual preferences and cultural variances also play a key role in nutrition.

‘The time of monsters’: everyone is quoting Gramsci – but what did he actually say?

At a time when geopolitical certainties of old are crumbling away, it has become the go-to quote to make sense of the current moment in all its seeming senselessness. “The old world is dying, and the new world struggles to be born: now is the time of monsters” is a line attributed to the former Italian Communist party leader Antonio Gramsci.
Over the last two months alone, it has been quoted – and often mangled – by a rightwing Belgian prime minister, a leftwing British political leader, an Irish central banker and in the title of the most recent BBC Reith lecture, given by the author Rutger Bregman.
“We can’t let the monsters win,” influencers earnestly warn their followers on Instagram; on LinkedIn, business consultants post graphs that visualise the “Gramsci gap” and its relevance to corporate strategy.
The only problem is, Gramsci never said or wrote such a thing. Or at least not in the snappy wording that has made it go viral.
“The time of monsters” powerfully sums up the repulsion and disbelief many people feel about the news in 2026 – whether it’s emanating from the White House, the Epstein files or the battlefields of Ukraine. It evokes Goya’s famous etching The Sleep of Reason Produces Monsters as much as contemporary pop culture.
“It has an apocalyptical feel, like when the Demogorgon appears at the end of Stranger Things,” said Peter Thomas, a historian of political thought and a Gramsci expert at Brunel University of London.
But in the notebooks that Gramsci filled with his thoughts on political theory, philosophy and linguistics after being imprisoned by the Italian fascist government in November 1926, there is no mention of monsters. In the original Italian, he wrote: “In questo interregno si verificano i fenomeni morbosi più svariati.”
The most widely used translation of the Prison Notebooks, by the British academics Quintin Hoare and Geoffrey Nowell Smith in 1971, renders this as: “In this interregnum a great variety of morbid symptoms appear.” Not quite so pithy.
An alternative 1996 edition by Joseph Buttigieg, the late father of the former US transport secretary Pete Buttigieg, talks of morbid “phenomena” instead of “symptoms”. Still, no mention of monsters.
The first recorded English use of “time of monsters” in connection with Gramsci is in a 2010 article in the New Left Review by the Slovenian philosopher Slavoj Žižek titled A Permanent Economic Emergency. In this context, the quote lends poetic gravitas to the challenge that the eurozone’s banking crisis posed to the left.
However, when approached about why he had chosen to poetically refashion the original Italian, Žižek insisted the monsters were not his. “I DON’T REMEMBER anything about it, but I am sure that I took the word from somewhere else,” he told the Guardian in an email.
In fact, a French version of the same phrase predates the moment it was popularised by Žižek in English. “Dans ce clair-obscur surgissent les monstres,” the French economist and urbanist Gustave Massiah wrote in a 2003 essay – “in this twilight monsters arise”. The phrase “dans cet interrègne surgissent les monstres” was used in the pages of Le Monde as early as 1996.
While the exact origin of Gramsci’s monsters remains elusive, there are wider reasons why the Italian intellectual’s ideas remain so potent today. Published in 1947, years after Gramsci’s death, the Prison Notebooks were written during concentrated periods in which the communist thinker was allowed pen and paper in his cell. “They distill a lot of things Gramsci had on his mind, so they are incredibly precise, at least for an Italian,”said Silvio Pons, the president of Rome’s Gramsci institute.
The notebooks did not go truly global until after the cold war, with translations into more than 40 languages, but their central idea has proven electric for activists for much longer.
“When Gramsci wrote the Prison Notebooks, he was trying to make sense of why there hadn’t been a socialist or communist revolution in Italy before the fascist takeover,” said Marzia Maccaferri, a political historian at Queen Mary University in London. “And the key concept to emerge from that thought process is his theory of hegemony: that the ruling class can rule not only through coercion, but also through the intersection of popular and high culture, through intellectual and civil society.”
In continental Europe, this cultural turn inspired many of the student revolutionaries of 1968, while in Britain it provided a theoretical framework that Marxist sociologists such as Stuart Hall applied to Thatcherism in the 1980s.
As early as the 1970s, however, Gramsci’s ideas were co-opted by the chief thinker of France’s Nouvelle Droite, or “new right”, Alain de Benoist. The attempt to centre far-right politics on cultural rather than racial identities can be seen in the former Trump strategist Steve Bannon’s dictum that “all politics is downstream of culture”, and in many of the key figures of the contemporary European far right.
The Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orbán’s master’s thesis applied Gramci’s ideas to Poland’s Solidarność (Solidarity) movement; in Italy, Giorgia Meloni’s culture minister recently published a book called Gramsci è vivo (Gramsci is Alive).
The “time of monsters” quote may have captured the minds of politicians and thinkers of today but many feel it strips Gramsci of the activist zeal that he embodied for previous generations.
“Monsters are something exceptional, an inverted miracle that comes out of nowhere with no real explanation,” Thomas said. “It’s a metaphor that shuts off the possibility of trying to think through what is occurring. We get outraged or shocked at the monstrosity of these Trumpian figures, rather than trying to work out what produced it.”
Before his imprisonment, Gramsci spent two formative years in revolutionary Russia, where he is said to have witnessed proof that a new world, in spite of its struggles, could eventually be reborn.
“It was almost inconceivable for him that whatever temporary setbacks he would have to suffer, we wouldn’t eventually arrive at a victory,” Thomas said. “We probably find it a little bit harder to think like that.”

Great Barrier Reef calling: Chinese tourists make Australia a Lunar New Year hotspot
Bookings projected to surge on new flights, flexible itineraries and ease of payment
Industry insiders said the lure of wine, seafood, nature and flexible small-group itineraries was driving interest in the island country.
Australia is projected to attract “the most travellers from China” during the break, with bookings likely to more than double over last year’s total, according to Trip.com’s 2026 Lunar New Year travel forecast.
The report highlighted natural wonders such as the Great Barrier Reef and the outback’s landscapes as among the most appealing attractions.
Total trip spending from China, Australia’s top market, reached A$12.3 billion (US$8.7 billion) for the year ending in September 2025, according to Tourism Australia, a government promotional agency.
Nick Henderson, Tourism Australia’s regional general manager for Greater China, pointed to wine tours, Melbourne’s cafe culture and the Sydney Fish Market as top attractions.

MOSCOW, February 14. /TASS/. Former US President Barack Obama (2009-2017) and his team turned traditional media into a propaganda machine, Russian special presidential envoy for investment and economic cooperation with foreign countries and Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) CEO, Kirill Dmitriev, said.
"Obama and his team carefully shaped legacy media into a leftist propaganda machine that ‘surprisingly’ always protects Obama," he wrote on X, commenting on a post about the connections of former White House Counsel to Obama Kathryn Ruemmler with US financier Jeffrey Epstein. According to the post, they exchanged more than 11,000 emails, but this information was suppressed.
"Are any corrections possible to this fake narrative machine that silences anything that does not fit the narrative? What and who controls the machine?" Dmitriev concluded.
Epstein was detained by New York State law enforcement on July 6, 2019. The prosecutor’s office said there was evidence that in 2002-2005 he organized visits to his home in Manhattan by dozens of underage girls, the youngest of whom was 14 years old. Epstein’s friends and acquaintances included a large number of current and retired officials not only from the United States, but also from many other countries, major entrepreneurs and show business stars.
The criminal prosecution of the financier was terminated after his suicide in a prison cell in August 2019. Notably, Epstein’s acquaintances included the 42nd US President Bill Clinton and the current President Donald Trump, as well as the brother of British King Charles III, ex-Prince Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor.

Public fury as China mental hospitals recruit people to impersonate patients in insurance scam
‘Healthy’ so-called patients lured into psychiatric facilities with promise of long, cheap stay; receive little treatment, face ‘beatings’
A number of psychiatric hospitals in central China have been exposed over a scam in which they lure healthy people to become patients in a bid to defraud the public medical insurance scheme.
According to an undercover report by the Beijing News, most of the patients in such privately run psychiatric institutions in Xiangyang, Hubei province, do not show any abnormal behaviour and receive little treatment.
The healthy individuals told the newspaper that they stayed there because of a “free hospitalisation, free living costs” promise on offer.
In China, patients have to bear a percentage of their medical bills; public insurance covers the rest.
After they are admitted, they become cash cows for the hospital because the institutions use their personal information and fabricate medical treatments to swindle funds from the medical insurance scheme, the report said.

Away from the headlines, microplastics field grapples with tricky questions
The year was 1966. The Soviets landed on the moon, the Beatles were more popular than Jesus, and plastic was still a miracle.
On the golden sands of Hawaii, Karl Kenyon and Eugene Kridler began the long unwinding of that view.
That year, hundreds of native Laysan albatrosses had died, their remains scattered across the sand. Kenyon and Kridler surveyed their stomaches. There, among the leftover squid, they found plastic. Lots of plastic. Caps, bags, fragments of toys.
In the ’60s, perhaps 10 million tonnes of plastic a year was produced globally. By 2010, that number was past 300 million and growing.
Plastic is strong, and over the intervening decades scientists discovered it breaks down but rarely vanishes completely. In 2004, researchers studying archived plankton discovered microscopic plastics – microplastics, they called them – alongside the tiny creatures as far back as the ’60s. Every decade, concentrations increased.
Microplastics are everywhere, from the deep sea to the Arctic, from plankton to apex predators, in dirt and at the summit of Mount Everest and up in the atmosphere.
“The quantities of plastics we’re talking about are vast. Beyond any normal exposure to anything we would expect,” says Professor David Hamilton, the director of the Australian Rivers Institute who has studied microplastics in Australia’s waterways.
And now, in a series of papers that have attracted global headlines, scientists have started finding them inside us. Headlines warn the “Human Brain May Contain as Much as a Spoon’s Worth of Microplastics”, or that we are consuming “the equivalent of a credit card worth of plastic every week”.
It is tempting to panic. But a survey of microplastics researchers reveals a more nuanced picture. Many are concerned about the health impacts, but they are also concerned about the rigour of the science.
“They are not very robust findings at all, to be blunt,” says Oliver Jones, a professor of analytical chemistry at RMIT, who has published on measuring microplastics. “Some of it is biologically implausible. There’s no way you eat a credit card of plastic a week. Or a plastic spoon in your brain.”
Let’s start with a study that appears to closely link microplastics with bad health outcomes.
In 2024, researchers looked at 304 patients undergoing surgery to clear the plaque out of clogged arteries in the neck. In 150 of those patients, the researchers found polyethylene in the plaque; some also had polyvinyl chloride. Those with plastic-contaminated plaques were 4.5 times more likely to have a stroke or die.
But if microplastics are everywhere, it means they are in hospitals. They are in surgeries. The devices used to do delicate work inside the arteries are often coated in plastic, which is known to shed. How much plastic in the study was from the environment, and how much was accidental contamination?
“There are plastics everywhere, essentially. That’s a challenge in keeping your blank measurements clean,” says Professor Kevin Thomas, the director of the Queensland Alliance for Environmental Health Sciences who studies ways to measure microplastics.
Counting large plastics – like fragments in the belly of an albatross – can be done manually. But the microplastics scientists are now trying to study are so small, measured in nanometres, they are beginning to reach the absolute limits of detection.
“Hypothetically, they are the ones we should be worried about, because they have the ability to cross the gut-blood barrier, or the air-blood barrier if we breathe them in,” says Thomas. But as particles get smaller, detection gets dramatically harder. “This is where I think we have maybe underestimated the challenge.”
Many of these detections rely, for now, on an approach called pyrolysis-gas-chromatography-mass-spectrometry.
Scientists start with a sample of plastic, which is placed in a furnace. The heat vaporises the sample, before the mass-spectrometer tries to identify each molecule.
Unfortunately polyethylene, the world’s most commonly produced plastic, just so happens to break down after pyrolysis into compounds that are identical to the compounds you get after breaking down human fat.
Recall the suggestion we may have as much as a plastic spoon’s worth of plastic in our brains. The brain also happens to be about 60 per cent fat, higher than any other organ.
“If you have any residual fat in your sample, it can produce the same triplet of hydrocarbons,” says Thomas. “For samples that are high fat, even the most robust filtration measure may not eliminate all the fat.”
Let’s assume, for a moment, microplastics are penetrating our bodies. What are they doing to us?
A 2025 review led by Dr Nicholas Chartres, senior research fellow at the University of Sydney, found harms to reproductive, respiratory and digestive health, with a possible link to colon and gut cancer.
“Unless we turn the tap off now and we ban all single-use, non-essential plastic … we are going to have one of the great human crises in the next 20 or 30 years,” Chartres told this masthead.
But the field is nascent. Looking at those three areas, the review found 28 animal studies to include, and just three human studies (one from Iran, another from Turkey) covering 163 people.
If we aren’t confident of the exact levels of microplastic exposure, it is harder to make sense of the animal data. Some studies use concentrations of microplastics “higher than anything you’d be exposed to unless you went and ground up a bunch of plastic and breathed in the dust,” says Hayden Gillings, a PhD candidate in nanoplastics and health at Flinders University. “It’s definitely something that needs to be taken with a grain of salt.”
And how do we disentangle any signal of microplastic-harms from all the other negative effects from environmental exposures we face every day, like air pollution or junk food?
“It’s really tricky to measure what people are exposed to, and then to link that to health effects, because people are exposed to lots of stuff. If someone gets liver disease, is that because they were exposed to a lot of plastic, or because they drank a lot of alcohol?” says Oliver Jones. “I don’t think we can say with any certainty what the health impacts are.”
The study of microplastics is a new field, behaving in the way new fields do: first comes excitement, then comes scepticism. The challenge now is rigour. Most experts who spoke to this masthead were confident the problems with measurement could, eventually, be surmounted.
The question for now is: how worried should we be, and what should we do?
“Do you want to wait a few more decades to see if these things made from oil or gas and 16,000 chemicals harm us?” Chartres asks. Mark Green, an associate professor in reproductive biology at the University of Melbourne, agrees. “We are better to have a precautionary approach, than to wait 20 or 50 years time for damaging evidence.”
Even Kevin Thomas, whose work has raised important questions about the accuracy of microplastic measurements, tries to minimise his exposure. He does not use plastic containers or a plastic chopping board.
“You are definitely being exposed to plastics. The key thing we’re trying to find out in the work we do here is, of that proportion of plastics, what happens to them when we inhale them,” he says. “That’s where the uncertainty is at the moment.”

Britain’s most-loved car goes electric as Everrati plans iconic Mini revival
Exclusive: Original Mini to be reborn as a £155,000 electric car by British specialist Everrati
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
In a Valentine’s Day exclusive, The Independent can reveal that Britain’s most-loved car is set for an electric rebirth. Oxfordshire-based car specialist Everrati has confirmed plans to build a zero-emissions version of the original Mini. The 1960s classic is widely regarded as Britain’s best-loved and most iconic car. Made famous by Twiggy and The Beatles, it was etched into motorsport folklore by Monte Carlo Rally winner Paddy Hopkirk.
For Everrati founder Justin Lunny, the Mini is more than just another model in the company’s growing portfolio of electrified classics. “I think it’s one of the most emotionally important cars ever built,” he told me. “We’ve all got a Mini memory.”
The project began, perhaps surprisingly, with a request from overseas. Lunny says Everrati was approached by the family office of a Middle Eastern prince who wanted a bespoke electric Mini inspired by high-end restomod projects of the past. “He loved what we do and he said, ‘could you do this for us?’” Lunny explained. That one-off commission quickly evolved into something more strategic.
“We then looked at it and said, actually, as an entry-level Everrati, it’s a great car. It’s a car people absolutely love. It’s one that to many people is a very emotional car.”
Everrati’s approach to the Mini makeover mirrors that used on its electric Porsche 911, Mercedes-Benz Pagoda and Land Rover models.
Each donor Mini will be stripped back to a bare shell, restored and rebuilt with a bespoke electric powertrain, with many of the specialist parts that go into the other Everrati models finding their way into the Mini, too.
Lunny insists the ethos is preservation rather than reinvention. “The whole point of it is not to ruin these cars. It’s about respecting them and actually creating something that is going to be fun, engaging, and used for generations to come as well.”
The Mini’s compact dimensions dictate modest battery packaging, with a targeted range of around 110 to 120 miles – meaning the car will be aimed squarely at urban use rather than motorway touring, exactly as the original was. Charging is currently via a 7kW AC system, designed primarily for overnight home charging.
Crucially, Lunny says the car will look like “just a beautifully restored Mini”. Everrati avoids cutting or structurally altering original body shells wherever possible and does not tamper with chassis architecture. Suspension and braking are subtly upgraded to cope with the electric drivetrain, but the visual integrity remains intact. “You don’t need to do anything with it,” Lunny said. “People love it for what it is.”
Everrati Mini prices start at £155,000, plus the donor car and local taxes. That places the Mini well below Everrati’s average vehicle price, which over the past 12 months has been just under half a million US dollars (£367,000) before those taxes and donor car costs. The Mini is therefore positioned as the most more accessible entry point into the brand, albeit at £155,000.
Everrati itself was founded after Lunny exited a technology business and – as a lifelong car enthusiast – he began questioning how classic motoring could coexist with environmental concerns. He recalls his daughter, then seven or eight, worrying about climate change. At the same time, he was inspired by the electric Jaguar E-type Zero revealed at the Duke and Duchess of Sussex’s royal wedding in Windsor. “The goal was always to create the world’s most iconic electric cars,” said Lunny.
That ambition has since expanded beyond retail conversions. Around 70 per cent of Everrati’s cars are now delivered to US clients, and the company has developed a separate “Powered by Everrati” division that’s set to supply turnkey electric powertrains to low-volume manufacturers.
The Everrati engineering team includes former McLaren, Bentley, Jaguar Land Rover, Rimac and Formula One engineers, while each vehicle undergoes a full re-engineering process that goes well beyond replacing engine and gearbox. Weight distribution, centre of gravity, dial design, switchgear, air conditioning and software calibration are all considered. “We don’t just convert a car,” Lunny said.
In some cases, that process can be extensive. A forthcoming electric Lamborghini LM002 project for a Middle Eastern client involves detailed 3D scanning and a complete rethink of the vehicle architecture. Yet Everrati is selective. The company has declined requests to electrify certain historically significant models unless damaged examples could be sourced. “We said no, it’s too important a car,” Lunny recalled of one proposal.
Inside, discreet modernisation is allowed. Apple CarPlay, upgraded audio systems and heating are integrated but hidden behind period-correct fascia designs, while heated seats can also be added.
While Everrati sees itself as proudly British, expansion into North America is on the horizon, with plans for a Southern California facility to serve its largest market and support business-to-business opportunities.
For now, though, it is the Mini – small, cheeky and unmistakably British – that takes centre stage. More than six decades after Sir Alec Issigonis created a packaging revolution on four wheels, and after celebrities and rally heroes cemented its place in the nation’s affections, the original Mini is preparing for a new electrified chapter.

Starmer has grasped what his predecessors would not – that Britain is better off in Europe than with the US
The prime minister has shown that the UK needs to stand with the friends it needs – not an American ally that doesn’t need Britain, writes world affairs editor Sam Kiley from Kyiv

Keir Starmer is announcing a pivot away from America and towards Europe in the most radical shift in British foreign policy for decades – resetting the UK’s place in a world that will diminish America’s power.
There will be consternation in some quarters of the nation’s armed forces, particularly the Special Forces, but ending the junior partner status of Britain under the US puts an end to the fantasy of the “special relationship”.
The PM has grasped a barbed wire nettle many of his predecessors could not even see when he stands up at the Munich Security Conference to say: “There is no British security without Europe, and no European security without Britain. That is the lesson of history – and it is today’s reality too.”
He has insisted the US remains an indispensable ally. But he is now insisting that America is no longer the only ally and recognising that Washington is not even a reliable friend.
It has been a long time coming. But it has not always been the case.
Until the end of the Cold War, Britain and the US had a more equal partnership. It was underpinned by the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing relationship with Canada, New Zealand, Australia, the US and UK, but London showed fierce independence.
The UK stayed out of the Vietnam war. The US gave little to no support to Britain’s recapture of the Falkland Islands from Argentina in 1982.
When the US led a multinational UN-sanctioned mission to end warlordism and mass starvation in Somalia in 1992, France, Turkey, Morocco, Pakistan and numerous other nations joined a mission of noble intent. But not Britain.
In those days, it was recognised by a British defence attache in Washington, a major general, that the “special relationship is special to us but not to the Americans”.
“They’re polite and courtly and always seem to listen. Then they close the door behind us when we’ve gone and ignore what we said. It made us feel important but we mattered little to them,” he said before the UK joined the US in the ill-fated war in Iraq and the two-decade fiasco of Afghanistan.
In taking Britain into the Iraq war, the UK became a sub-unit of the US military and in the decade of the so-called war on terror that followed, that status was cemented by underfunding and overreliance on the equipment known as “enablers” – the satellite imagery, air transport and refuelling, and the logistics chains that the US leads the world in providing.
Then, last year, 80 years of assumptions about the UK’s future defences were upended by the Trump administration when the junior relationship was downgraded.
Writing on Substack this week, Tom Tugendhat, a Tory backbencher and former chair of the defence select committee (and former frontline intelligence officer), said: “British defence policy rested on four pillars. The assumption of automatic American support. The credibility of Nato as a guaranteed security provider. The stability of long-term defence planning. And the political consensus that defence could remain a secondary concern. Within the first fifty days of Donald Trump’s return to the White House, all four were effectively dismantled.”
Britain’s Special Air Service and the Special Boat Service, each (officially) comprising four squadrons of tier 1 “operators”, are the only units with which the UK and US are on parity. The Americans have about the same number of their most highly trained soldiers.
For the last 25 years, they have worked hand in glove. Britain’s military reputation with the US has largely rested on this relationship; even though the UK lacked the specialist equipment and aircraft their cousins could call on, they enjoyed access to the very best kit through that relationship.
Elsewhere, the UK has fared less well from the relationship. In Iraq, American and Iraqi troops had to bail the British out of a disastrous campaign in Basra and the south of the country. In Helmand, embattled British-led troops in southern Afghanistan were again bailed out by a 30,000-person surge by US Marines.
For the Americans, it has been good to have the British along. Frontline soldiers deeply appreciated the panache and bravery of the UK’s fighting men and women. But they were never militarily necessary.
The British army, now around 72,000, is less than half the size of the US Marine Corps, 172,000. Active service personnel in the whole of the British armed forces are less than the marines can field – and on top of that, the marines have their own jets, transport, artillery and ships. They can operate with far greater direct punch and autonomy than the British. There are more of them, they have better equipment, and they’re all from the same unit.
The threat to the UK is from Russia. So it makes sense to concentrate military efforts and improve military capacity in Europe, and with European forces.
“We are not the Britain of the Brexit years any more. Because we know that, in dangerous times, we would not take control by turning inward – we would surrender it. And I won’t let that happen,” the prime minister said.
“I'm talking about a vision of European security and greater European autonomy that does not herald US withdrawal but answers the call for more burden sharing in full, and remakes the ties that have served us so well.”
He is right to argue that Europe and the UK need to invest in their own arms manufacturing capability and wean themselves off American-made equipment. A rapid end to duplication across the continent will be essential for the region to better cope with the autonomy that Trump is thrusting upon it with his threats against Greenland and his general contempt for Nato.
Britain’s Royal Navy is the most powerful in Europe, with two aircraft carriers and nuclear-powered submarines, with the total tonnage of vessels greater than the German, French and Italian navies combined. France has more people in its forces, around 200,000, and a larger army, but the UK has more specialised units focused on fast deployment.
Poland’s forces are fast-growing, with around 215,000 on active service, and it is arming at a staggering pace. Turkey is Nato’s second-largest force of about 440,000 after the US (1.3 million).
But in more directly working in Europe and as a European nation, the UK’s forces will have the opportunity to be the first among equals in cooperating over defending against a real and present danger in the Kremlin, and dealing with Moscow’s grey, or hybrid, war that’s already being fought across Europe.
They’ll be joined, no doubt, by Ukraine’s 800,000-plus battle-hardened veterans and Kyiv’s fast-growing military-industrial sector.
“We want to bring our leadership in defence, tech and AI together with Europe – to multiply our strengths and build a shared industrial base across Europe which can turbocharge our defence production,” Sir Keir said.
Trump has insisted that is what he wants to see. But when it starts to happen, an independent Europe will leave America much enfeebled.

Teaching Jewish happiness after October 7: An educator's fresh approach to Jewish pride

VIENNA – How can we teach happiness in a post-October 7 world? And how can we focus Jewish education on pride, success, and victory, rather than trauma and oppression?
These are some of the key questions facing Jewish leaders, educators, and parents today.
Research suggests post-traumatic stress disorder has risen sharply since the October 7 attack, with a significant number of adult and adolescent Israelis showing symptoms of post-trauma. Though figures in the Diaspora are less precise, the rise in antisemitism and the increasing isolation of Jewish communities have led many Diaspora Jews to experience similar trauma.
However, some experts believe focusing on positivity and happiness may be the most effective approach to trauma and Jewish growth.
One of these experts is Dr. Tal Ben-Shahar, an Israeli professor and writer in the areas of positive psychology and leadership. Ben-Shahar has taught happiness studies at Columbia University, and now runs fully accredited MA and PhD programs in happiness studies with Centenary University.
'The first secret to happiness'
“My answer is that there are three secrets to happiness,” Ben-Shahar told The Jerusalem Post at the Yael Foundation conference in Vienna. “The first secret to happiness is reality. The second secret to happiness is reality. Third secret, reality.”
This, he explained, means focusing on our successes. “That’s part of reality that has largely been ignored, whether it’s by the Jewish community or whether it’s by the psychology tradition, the 20th-century psychology that mostly focuses on psychopathology. And positive psychology says let’s focus on what works, let’s focus on the positive.”
Within the Jewish community, and especially within Jewish education, there is often a focus on the traumatic past – the Holocaust, pogroms, expulsions. While Ben-Shahar said it is important to learn about past suffering, he stressed it is also important to learn about the amazing history that we have and the accomplishments.
“Just focusing on the suffering is unhealthy. It’s as unhealthy as, within a relationship, a couple only talking about their problems. Again, with good intentions, because we want to fix them. But if you only talk about problems, you live your problems. And you become them.”
Take Israel, for example. Israel is a country that faces threats from multiple fronts and has a deeply traumatic past, but it is also the Start-Up Nation. And it is also consistently ranked as one of the happiest countries in the world.
“Why is Israel one of the happiest countries in the world? Despite all of our challenges? The main reason is because of relationships. It’s a real focus in Israel, whether it’s on Shabbat, dinner with your family. And that explains why Israel is among the happiest countries in the world. And that also explains why Israelis are so resilient.
“And secondly: giving, generosity. Whether it’s charity, whether it’s helping someone in need, whether it’s just listening to someone. Of course, when we help other people, we are also helping ourselves. We become happier and we become more resilient and more likely to experience post-traumatic growth.”
Researchers estimate that roughly half to two-thirds of people who experience a traumatic event also experience post-traumatic growth. Post-traumatic growth is a positive psychological transformation that can occur after struggling with highly challenging, traumatic life experiences. It involves profound shifts in perspective such as deeper appreciation for life, enhanced relationships, and increased personal strength.
Ben-Shahar referenced a favorite phrase of his by Eknath Easwaran, an Indian-born meditation teacher and professor of English.
“He says we become what we meditate on. We become what we talk about. We become what we repeatedly say. So, again, I’m not saying ignore the Holocaust, just like we shouldn’t ignore October 7. But there are also amazing things that are happening.
Jewish pride
“They say about Gandhi that the most important thing he did for India was that he made India proud of itself. We need to learn Jewish pride, Israeli pride, because we do have a lot to be proud of.”
Jewish pride and how to spark it in the next generations were at the heart of Ben-Shahar’s discussion with the Post. He explained that part of invoking pride comes from making Judaism relevant for Jewish children.
“If I tell children Shabbat is important and it’s also in the Torah, it’s one thing; many kids will be persuaded by that. However, if you say: listen to this research showing that if you take a day off during the week you’ll not just be happier, you’ll be healthier and more successful overall, more children may be encouraged to keep the Sabbath.
“Or if you tell them you should say Modeh Ani in the morning, that’s one thing. If you tell them that if you express gratitude in a regular way you’ll be happier, healthier, and more successful, that’s another layer.”
He provided the example of the research of Martin Seligman, the founder of the field of positive psychology and a professor at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia.
He said Seligman asks teachers and parents two questions. “‘What would you most want for your children?’ The parents tell him they want their child to be happy, or they want their child to have good relationships, or they want their child to be resilient or healthy. And Seligman adds these to a list. Then he asks them a second question: ‘What are children learning in school?’ And he makes a list of math, language, geography, history, biology, and so on.”
What becomes clear is that there is almost no overlap between the two lists.
“It’s unfortunate, especially today given the fact that we have a science of happiness. So we know how to teach happiness. We know how to help children and adults be more resilient, have better relationships, and become happier. Why aren’t schools focusing on that as well? Why aren’t schools in Israel or Jewish schools around the world connecting between our tradition and what the science of happiness has to offer?”
Ben-Shahar also advocates for more physical exercise, something which he says is essential for emotional well-being.
“It’s important for physical well-being and for psychological well-being. I absolutely think it’s lacking in schools. Schools teach math, but they don’t have enough funding for PE. Children who exercise regularly will also sit down to do science better. They’ll be less distracted. One of the best ways to deal with ADHD is through movement. One of the best ways to enhance creativity and innovation is by cultivating healthy relationships. They’re connected.
“Children now spend unprecedented amounts of time on smartphones, a trend increasingly linked to anxiety and depression. One of the dangers of the phone generation is that children have more exposure to hatred, antisemitism, and potentially traumatic content. While antisemitism isn’t new, it’s taken a different form in the digital age.”
Do children have the tools and facilities to be able to deal with that?
“I don’t think so,” said Ben-Shahar. “One of the reasons why we founded The David Project [his public diplomacy organization] all those years ago was because Jewish schools or Jewish children and adults were not receiving the tools to be able to deal with attacks against Israel. When I was teaching, I used to say we need to learn to go on the offensive without being offensive.
“So we shouldn’t just passively receive all the lies and distortions that are being promoted in the media worldwide and certainly in social media worldwide. We need to stand up for Israel and fight.”
Ben-Shahar lamented how some Jewish students – predominantly those who do not go to Jewish schools – not only do not care about Israel, but some are opposed to the very existence of a Jewish state.
“We need to teach our children to not just stand up for Israel, not just understand why we have a right to this land, but why this is also a moral and righteous cause. To stand for Israel and to put Israel at the epicenter of good versus evil. It’s our goal to be that candle in a dark room.”
Ben-Shahar thinks that, both Israel and in the Diaspora, there has to be much more focus on the “Jewish” in “Jewish education.” He noted that, in Israel, children who do not go to Jewish religious school, get “very, very little” Jewish education. “In fact, there is also antagonism towards it.
“In the Diaspora we need to continue with Jewish education, to connect it to their daily life, so [we continue] this bridge between modern research and ancient wisdom.
“We need to learn Jewish pride, Israeli pride,” he said, “because we have a lot to be proud of.”

March 2, 1859
Birthday of Shalom Aleichem (Solomon Rabinovitz), writer/playwright born in Ukraine, known as the “Yiddish Mark Twain,” whose stories were made into the musical hit Fiddler on the Roof.
The humor and pathos with which he portrayed the simple lives of the shtetl were unmatched by any other Yiddish writer. Upon his death in 1916, some 200,000 people, many of them immigrants from the shtetl, followed his funeral cortège from Manhattan to his burial site in Queens. “No matter how bad things get, you got to go on living, even if it kills you,” he wrote.
Adar 14: 3405 (356 BCE)
Jews throughout the Persian Empire were victorious in their battles against Haman’s antisemitic mobs seeking to kill them, an event we commemorate today with the Purim holiday. We read the megillah (Scroll of Esther), dress up in costumes, and joyously celebrate how the Jews of Persia narrowly escaped real genocide, thanks to the bravery of Esther and Mordechai.

Minneapolis left to decide future of streetside memorials to 2 people killed by federal officers
Minneapolis left to decide future of streetside memorials to 2 people killed by federal officers
MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — As the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown in Minnesota winds down, Minneapolis will need to decide how to manage makeshift memorial sites for two U.S. citizens killed by federal agents last month.
Piles of flowers, signs and artwork swiftly formed to commemorate the lives of Renee Good and Alex Pretti at the locations where they were fatally shot. The memorials are the site of candlelight vigils and musical performances and draw a regular stream of visitors.
The public grieving spots echo the community-driven memorial to George Floyd, who was murdered in 2020 by a police officer less than one mile (1.61 kilometers) from Good’s killing. It took the city more than five years to figure out how to officially memorialize the site of George Floyd Square, and construction is set to begin this year.
Now, the city has two more high-profile memorials to manage.
A memorial for Good sprung up within hours of her Jan. 7 killing on a Minneapolis street.
And before the smell of tear gas used by federal agents had dissipated on the day of Pretti’s killing on Jan. 24, Minneapolis protesters were already using branches, police tape and candles to mark the space. Later, people placed crosses, stuffed animals, American flags and images of Pretti.
Minnesota resident Karel Hoffmann said that while she remained outraged with Good and Pretti’s killings, the memorials represented community solidarity.
“This is so unfair, the trauma, for everyone, is too much,” Hoffmann said as she visited Pretti’s memorial recently. “We’re all in this together. And I’m really glad they have this here so everybody can come and be together.”
Lynn Elrod, a nurse, visited Pretti’s memorial last month and added her own offering: a plastic evergreen tree with red hearts and portraits of him and Good.
“I printed both of their pictures and put those on there again, just to signify the love that we have for both of them, really, and their contributions to the community and supporting their neighbors,” Elrod said.
The residential street where Good died remains open, but orange traffic cones offer a narrow walkway for those paying their respects, and a small band of volunteers watches over the mound of flowers, artwork and handwritten signs that has amassed between the sidewalk and the street.
Around the Pretti memorial along a commercial district known as “ Eat Street,” traffic lanes have been temporarily shifted and parking is closed off, said Jess Olstad, a spokesperson for the city of Minneapolis.
“The City’s top priority is to give our community space to grieve and heal,” Olstad said. “This both ensures emergency vehicles can get through the area and protects those who gather or visit the memorial.”
Olstad added that the city is “actively working on next steps, including continued community engagement regarding both memorials.”
Ally Peters, a spokesperson for Mayor Jacob Frey, said last week that it was “too early” to comment on whether the memorials would be made permanent.

Iranian security use dragnet spanning the entire country to arrest protesters
Iranian security use dragnet spanning the entire country to arrest protesters
CAIRO (AP) — The Iranian security agents came at 2 a.m., pulling up in a half-dozen cars outside the home of the Nakhii family. They woke up the sleeping sisters, Nyusha and Mona, and forced them to give the passwords for their phones. Then they took the two away.
The women were accused of participating in the nationwide protests that shook Iran a week earlier, a friend of the pair told The Associated Press, speaking on condition of anonymity for her security as she described the Jan. 16 arrests.
Such arrests have been happening for weeks following the government crackdown last month that crushed the protests calling for the end of the country’s theocratic rule. Reports of raids on homes and workplaces have come from major cities and rural towns alike, revealing a dragnet that has touched large swaths of Iranian society. University students, doctors, lawyers, teachers, actors, business owners, athletes and filmmakers have been swept up, as well as reformist figures close to President Masoud Pezeshkian.
They are often held incommunicado for days or weeks and prevented from contacting family members or lawyers, according to activists monitoring the arrests. That has left desperate relatives searching for their loved ones.
The U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency has put the number of arrests at more than 50,000. The AP has been unable to verify the figure. Tracking the detainees has been difficult since Iranian authorities imposed an internet blackout, and reports leak out only with difficulty.
Other activist groups outside Iran have also been working to document the sweeps.
“Authorities continue to identify people and detain them,” said Shiva Nazarahari, an organizer with one of those groups, the Committee for Monitoring the Status of Detained Protesters.
So far, the committee has verified the names of more than 2,200 people who were arrested, using direct reports from families and a network of contacts on the ground. The arrestees include 107 university students, 82 children as young as 13, as well as 19 lawyers and 106 doctors.
Nazarahari said authorities have been reviewing municipal street cameras, store surveillance cameras and drone footage to track people who participated in the protests to their homes or places of work, where they are arrested.
Held for weeks with no contact
The protests began in late December, triggered by anger over spiraling prices, and quickly spread across the country. They peaked on Jan. 8 and 9, when hundreds of thousands of people in more than 190 cities and towns across the country took to the streets.
Security forces responded by unleashing unprecedented violence. The Human Rights Activists News Agency has so far counted more than 7,000 dead and says the true number is far higher. Iran’s government offered its only death toll on Jan. 21, saying 3,117 people were killed. The theocracy has undercounted or not reported fatalities from past unrest.
Gholamhossein Mohseni Ejehi, a hard-line cleric who heads Iran’s judiciary, became the face of the crackdown, labeling protesters “terrorists” and calling for fast-tracked punishments.
Since then, “detentions have been very widespread because it’s like a whole suffocation of society,” said one protester, reached by the AP in Gohardasht, a middle-class area outside the Iranian capital. He said two of his relatives and three of his brother’s friends were killed in the first days of the crackdown, as well as several neighbors. The protester spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of being targeted by authorities.
The Nakhii sisters, 25-year-old Nyusha and 37-year-old Mona, were first taken to Tehran’s notorious Evin prison, where they were allowed to contact their parents, their friend said. Later, she said, they were moved to Qarchak, a women’s prison on the outskirts of Tehran where rights groups reported conditions that included overcrowding and lack of hygiene even before the crackdown.
Other people whose arrests were documented by the detainees committee have disappeared into the prisons. The family of Abolfazl Jazbi has not heard from him since his Jan. 15 arrest at a factory in the southern city of Isfahan. Jazbi suffers from a severe blood disorder that requires medication, according to the committee.
Atila Sultanpour, 45, has not been heard from since he was taken from his home in Tehran on Jan. 29 by security agents who beat him severely, according to Dadban, a group of Iranian lawyers based abroad who are also documenting detentions.
Authorities have also moved to suspend bank accounts, block SIM cards and confiscate the property of protesters’ relatives or people who publicly express support for them, said Musa Barzin, an attorney with Dadban, citing reports from families.
In past crackdowns on protests, authorities sometimes adhered to a veneer of due process and rule of law, but not this time, Barzin said. Authorities are increasingly denying detainees access to legal counsel and often holding them for days or weeks before allowing any phone calls to family. Lawyers representing arrested protesters also have faced court summons and detention, according to Dadban.
“The following of the law is in the worst situation it has ever been,” Barzin said.
Signs of defiance continue
Despite the crackdown, many civic groups continue to issue defiant statements.
The Writers’ Association of Iran, an independent group with a long tradition of dissent, issued a statement describing the protests as an uprising against “47 years of systemic corruption and discrimination.”
It also announced that two of its members had been detained, including a member of its secretariat.
A national council representing schoolteachers urged families to speak out about detained children and students. “Do not fear the threats of security forces. Refer to independent counsel. Make your children’s names public,” it said in a statement.
A spokesman for the council said Sunday that it has documented the deaths of at least 200 minors who were killed in the crackdown. That figure is up several dozen from the count just days before.
“Every day we tell ourselves this is the last list,” Mohammad Habibi wrote on X. “But the next morning, new names arrive again.”
Bar associations and medical groups have also spoken out, including Iran’s state-sanctioned doctors council, which called on authorities to stop harassing medical staff.
Anger over the bloodshed now adds to the bitterness over the economy, which has been hollowed out by decades of sanctions, corruption and mismanagement. The value of the currency has plunged, and inflation has climbed to record levels.
The Iranian government has announced gestures such as launching a new coupon program for essential goods. Labor and trade groups, including a national retirees syndicate, have issued statements condemning the economic and political crisis.
Meanwhile, U.S. President Donald Trump has moved an aircraft carrier and other military assets to the Persian Gulf and suggested the U.S. could attack Iran over the killing of peaceful demonstrators or if Tehran launches mass executions over the protests. A second American aircraft carrier is on its way to the Mideast.
Iran’s theocracy has faced down protests and U.S. threats in the past, and the crackdown showed the iron grip it holds over the country. This week, authorities organized pro-government rallies with hundreds of thousands of people to mark the anniversary of the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
Still, Barzin said, he sees the ferocity of the crackdown as a sign that Iran’s leadership “for the first time is afraid of being overthrown.”

Hamas to discuss demilitarization, NCAG with Egyptian mediators in Cairo - report

Hamas plans to discuss disarmament and its disapproval of the National Committee for the Administration of Gaza (NCAG) appointments during upcoming talks with mediators in Egypt, a source with knowledge of the matter told Sky News Arabia on Thursday.
The Hamas delegation intends to present demilitarization-related proposals to its Egyptian counterpart, including one that suggests that the terrorist group would pause the use of all weapons until a full withdrawal of the Israeli military from the Gaza Strip is complete, the source told Sky News Arabia.
Another idea set to be proposed is that Hamas may surrender “heavy weapons,” including its remaining missiles and rockets, and maps of its intricate underground terror tunnel network, in exchange for permission to retain light weapons, such as guns.
Earlier, on Tuesday, the New York Times published a report claiming that an initial draft of the United States plan for demilitarizing the terrorist group included allowing Hamas to keep small arms, citing officials familiar with the draft.
National Committee for the Administration of Gaza's role in disarmament
The Cairo meeting is part of a larger set of negotiations intended to work out the logistics for implementing US President Donald Trump’s peace plan for Gaza, which included the establishment of a Palestinian technocratic body set to take over governance of the enclave.
According to Sky News Arabia’s source, Hamas additionally intends to advocate for the integration of its terrorists into “the future administration of the Gaza Strip” during the Cairo talks.
The NCAG, according to US-set demilitarization principles, will oversee and verify the disarmament of terrorist groups in Gaza, including Hamas, with one goal being to ensure that all arms maintained by individuals are registered with and approved by the NCAG.
Hamas involvement in the NCAG may result in the terrorist organization maintaining some amount of power in the Gaza Strip or reducing the effectiveness of disarmament efforts.
According to the Sky News Arabia source, Hamas officials objected to the appointment of Sami Nasman to oversee security under the NCAG.
Gaza-native Nasman, a former Palestinian Authority general, was accused by Hamas of “instigating chaos” in 2007 after he moved to the West Bank following clashes between the PA and Hamas.
Hamas officials believe that Nasman’s appointment “could provoke retaliatory reactions,” Sky News Arabia quoted their source as saying.
Shir Perets and Reuters contributed to this report.
