Pakistan’s military has carried out air strikes in Afghanistan, targeting what it called “camps and hideouts” belonging to armed groups behind a spate of recent attacks, including a deadly suicide bombing at a Shia mosque in Islamabad.
Taliban's Ministry of Defence condemned Sunday’s attacks, arguing they “hit a religious school and residential homes” in the border provinces of Nangarhar and Paktika, “resulting in dozens of deaths and injuries, including women and children”.
Afghan sources told Al Jazeera that at least 17 people were killed in Nangarhar.
Pakistan’s Ministry of Information and Broadcasting said in a statement on X that the country’s military conducted “intelligence-based, selective operations” against seven camps and hideouts belonging to the Pakistan Taliban, also known as Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), and its affiliates.
It said Pakistan has repeatedly urged Afghanistan’s Taliban government to take action to prevent armed groups from using Afghan territory to launch attacks, but that Kabul has failed to “undertake any substantive action”.

BERLIN, February 22. /TASS/. Co-chair of the Alternative for Germany (AfD) Alice Weidel stated that peace in Europe is possible only in cooperation with Russia and called the current approach to relations with Moscow erroneous.
She has landed sharp criticism regarding the foreign policy rhetoric voiced by the current German government as part of the CDU/CSU and SPD bloc.
"I have no clue which course the federal government of Germany pursues, but it is definitely not a peaceful one," she said. "As an Alternative for Germany, we want harmonious relations with our neighbors and with our European partners. And that's what we stand for."
Weidel stressed that the Gernam political party of Alternative for Germany strives to reach mutual understanding with its partners.
"We seek a dialogue, an exchange of opinions, and a certain level of communication both with the United States and Russia," she continued. "It is because that peace in Europe is possible only with Russia, not without it"
"That is why we have always considered the current approach to relations with Russia to be erroneous," Weidel added.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said earlier that President Vladimir Putin has never refused from direct contacts and if German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and French President Emmanuel Macron want this, all they have to do is just call.
Trilateral talks on Ukraine involving Russia, the United States, and Ukraine were held in Geneva on February 17 and 18. On the first day, they lasted about six hours, on the second about two. Head of the Russian delegation presidential aide Vladimir Medinsky described the negotiations as difficult, but businesslike. According to him, a new meeting on the Ukrainian settlement will be held soon.
The first round was held in Abu Dhabi on January 23-24, followed by the second round on February 4-5.

Stars descend on the BAFTA film awards, with 'One Battle' and 'Sinners' leading the race
The BAFTA Film Awards have a tight race, with “One Battle After Another” and “Sinners” leading the nominations
- Bookmark
TO MOVE AT 0500GMT SUNDAY
Politically charged thriller “One Battle After Another” and blues-steeped epic “Sinners” lead the race for Sunday’s British Academy Film Awards as the two movies jostle for awards-season supremacy.
Oddsmakers suggest Shakespearean family tragedy “Hamnet” could beat them to best picture if British film industry voters respond to the emotionally rich story, earthy English setting and intense performances of Chloé Zhao’s adaptation of Maggie O’Farrell’s historical novel.
“One Battle” has 14 nominations, including best picture and acting nods for five of its cast. “Sinners” is just behind with 13, while “Hamnet” and the ping-pong odyssey “Marty Supreme” each have 11 nominations.
Guillermo del Toro’s reimagining of “Frankenstein” and Norwegian family drama “ Sentimental Value” each got eight nominations.
The British prizes, officially called the EE BAFTA Film Awards, often provide hints about who will win at Hollywood’s Academy Awards, held this year on March 15. In the Oscar nominations, “Sinners” leads the race with a record 16 nominations, followed by “One Battle After Another” with 13.
Stars including Emma Stone, Cillian Murphy, Glenn Close and Ethan Hawke are expected on the red carpet outside London’s Royal Festival Hall before a black-tie ceremony hosted by Scottish actor Alan Cumming.
Cumming, who hosts the U.S. version of reality show “The Traitors,” pledged to strike a “balance between celebration and mischief.”
The BAFTA best film nominees are “One Battle After Another,” “Hamnet,” “Marty Supreme,” “Sinners” and “Sentimental Value.” The BAFTAs also have a distinctly British accent, with a separate category for best British film. Its 10 nominees include “The Ballad of Wallis Island,” “Pillion,” “I Swear” and “Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy.”
Directing contenders are Paul Thomas Anderson for “One Battle,” Josh Safdie for “Marty Supreme,” Ryan Coogler for “Sinners,” Yorgos Lanthimos for dystopian tragicomedy “Bugonia,” Joachim Trier for “Sentimental Value” and Zhao for “Hamnet.” Zhao will be the first female director to win two BAFTAs if she takes the prize. She won the directing award in 2021 for “Nomadland.”
Best leading actor nominees are bookies’ favorite Timothée Chalamet for “Marty Supreme,” Leonardo DiCaprio for “One Battle After Another,” Ethan Hawke for Broadway biopic “Blue Moon,” Michael B. Jordan for “Sinners,” Jesse Plemons for “Bugonia” and Robert Aramayo for playing a man with Tourette’s syndrome in biographical drama “I Swear.”
The leading actress category includes the strongly favored Jessie Buckley for her performance as Agnes Hathaway, wife of William Shakespeare, in “Hamnet.” She’s up against Rose Byrne for “If I Had Legs I’d Kick You,” Kate Hudson for “Song Sung Blue,” Chase Infiniti for “One Battle After Another,” Renate Reinsve for “Sentimental Value” and Emma Stone for “Bugonia.”
“One Battle” actors Teyana Taylor, Benicio del Toro and Sean Penn are all nominated for supporting performances.
The Associated Press was recognized in the best documentary category with a nomination for Mstyslav Chernov’s harrowing Ukraine war portrait “2000 Meters to Andriivka, ” co-produced by the AP and Frontline PBS.
Most BAFTA winners are chosen by 8,500 members of the U.K. academy of industry professionals. Contenders for the Rising Star award – the only prize decided by public vote and a reliable picker of future A-listers – are Infiniti, Aramayo, “Sinners” star Miles Caton and British actors Archie Madekwe and Posy Sterling.
Donna Langley, the U.K.-born chairwoman of NBCUniversal Entertainment, will be awarded the British Academy’s highest honor, the BAFTA fellowship.
The ceremony airs on BBC in the United Kingdom starting at 1900GMT (2 p.m. EST) and on E! in the U.S. at 2000EST.

Trump says sending 'great hospital boat' to Greenland
February 22, 2026US President Donald Trump said Saturday he was sending a hospital boat to Greenland, a semi-autonomous Danish territory.
He said the boat would treat many "sick" people in the island.
Trump did not provide any additional details about who he was referring to or the number of people the boat would help.
"We are going to send a great hospital boat to Greenland to take care of the many people who are sick, and not being taken care of there," Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform.
"It's on the way!!!," he added.
Danish Arctic Command evacuates US submariner
Trump said in the post that he was working with Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry to send the hospital boat.
The US president named Landry as his envoy to Greenland in December.
It was unclear whether the ship had been requested by Denmark or Greenland and which sick people needed help.
Trump's post came after Denmark's Joint Arctic Command said it had evacuated a US submarine crew member who required urgent medical attention.
The submarine was in Greenland's waters, seven nautical miles outside of the capital Nuuk and it was not clear if Trump's post was connected in any way to the evacuation.
Trump's Greenland push ratchets up tensions
The announcement, however, gains significance amid a deep rift between the Trump administration and Europe over control of the territory.
Greenland, the world's largest island, is a mineral-rich, strategically important Arctic territory. It is self-governing but remains part of the Kingdom of Denmark.
Trump says the island is crucial for US national security and that he wants to acquire it. He even threatened to seize it by force if necessary
The rhetoric has ratcheted up tensions between Washington and its European NATO allies.
Greenland, Denmark and the US have engaged in talks to resolve the situation.
Trump dialed back his threats after reaching a "framework" deal with NATO chief Mark Rutte to ensure greater US influence over Greenland.
Earlier this week, Denmark's King Frederik X visited Greenland.
It was his second visit to the island in a year, an attempt to demonstrate unity with the territory in the face of Trump's push to acquire control of the vast island.

AI agent invasion has people trying to pick winners
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
NEW YORK – An onslaught of artificial intelligence agents that handle tasks from writing code to dispensing tax advice has the tech world and financial markets scrambling to pick winners and shed losers.
Gone are the days of being satisfied with OpenAI’s ChatGPT simply creating responses to text prompts.
Makers of leading AI models have embraced “agentic” capabilities that provide software assistants capable of independently tending to tasks, such as creating software applications, based on simple descriptions.
Futurum chief strategist Shay Boloor sees the moment as an “inflection point” where millions of AI agents will soon be routinely handling tasks long tended to by people.
“We’ve never had a tech disruption at this scale before,” Mr Boloor told AFP.
“It’s extreme. The market is underwriting that future uncertainty in a doom-based scenario.”
The turning point has been marked by rapid-fire releases of ever-improving AI models, including recent new versions from OpenAI and Anthropic.
Add to that the November debut of autonomous AI agent OpenClaw that some have equated to the fictional “Jarvis” AI assistant from the “Iron Man” superhero films.
The creator of OpenClaw was snapped up by ChatGPT-maker OpenAI, signaling that the San Francisco-based startup has even more ambitious agentic aspirations.
Future or fiction?
Investors quickly saw AI agents as a threat to software publishers, particularly those serving businesses.
Monday.com, which specialises in workplace collaboration, along with Salesforce and Thomson Reuters with its tax, accounting and trade software arms saw their stock value plummet 30 per cent or more on Wall Street in a matter of days.
Georgetown University management professor Jason Schloetzer recounted a recent chat with a chief executive who remarked about no longer needing consultants since there was “one in my pocket” thanks to AI.
“There’s paranoia around AI in every industry,” said Wedbush analyst Dan Ives.
“I believe it’s way overdone.”
He viewed the concept of AI models replacing enterprise software and cybersecurity firms as “a fictional tale”.
Too much?
As AI agents begin shaking up work, creators of large language models powering them continue to pour hundreds of billions of dollars
Claude-maker Anthropic has OpenAI, Google’s Gemini and even Grok from xAI nipping at its heels in the market for professional AI.
Even though massive spending on AI infrastructure has some investors worried, Mr Boloor contends “the risk is not overinvesting, but underinvesting” in the transformative technology.
Prof Schloetzer reasons that the economic impact of AI may not be clear for several years, the same way it took time for the internet itself to become a vital part of daily life.
“Suddenly, entirely new businesses that had no economic attractiveness without the internet started to exist, like Netflix,” Prof Schloetzer said.
“I’m waiting to see these new companies or industries that are created (by AI).”
AI angst is spreading way beyond the tech industry.
A recent blog post by US entrepreneur Matt Shumer titled “Something Big Is Happening” includes a prediction that AI will be tackling jobs in law, finance, accounting, consulting, medicine and other fields.
The experience that tech workers had of seeing AI go from a “helpful tool” to something that “does my job better than I do” will ripple through the service sector, Mr Shumer predicted.
Some observers have criticised Mr Shumer’s post. In an opinion piece at the Mind Matters website, technology consultant Jeffrey Funk called it “hype” driven by fear.
“The markets are a rational mechanism,” analyst Ives said of company shares being punished by AI worries.
“We’re going to get to a crossroads here pretty soon where things will settle down.” AFP

I was charmed by a respected school principal. I’m devastated to discover his evil secret

Opinion
I was charmed by a respected school principal. I’m devastated to discover his evil secret
I met Richard Barren a few times while he was the principal of Langwarrin Park Primary School, in Melbourne’s south-east. He was gregarious, enthusiastic, professional and proud of his school.
I particularly noticed the fondness with which he spoke about his students. I raked through my old meeting notes and found I’d written the words “potential” and “full of possibilities” as being how Barren described the children in his school.
I fell for it.
Last week, Barren was sentenced to effectively three paltry months of prison time for having some of the most disgusting child abuse material on his phone that anyone – let alone a school principal – might have.
And, despite more than three decades of working with teachers and teaching myself, collaborating with principals and also being one – my meetings with Barren didn’t raise a single red flag. I admit to being both confused and ashamed about that.
The meek and feeble nature of the Barren sentence has landed with incredulity on many of the school’s parents. They’re rightly confounded that a man afforded the trust of being a safe figure in the entire community’s eye could have betrayed them so deeply.
I remember, from my principal days, seeing the nervous faces of parents as they handed their children into my care – a bloke running a primary school. I felt the gravity of that responsibility and I accepted it.
The notion that a fellow member of the principal fraternity could have content on his phone revealing that he “love[s] perving on pool change rooms” sickens me.
Barren’s reply to a fellow Grindr user enquiring as to his age limits for potential prey was that there’s “no limit. the younger the better” left me stunned.
When I read further of the vile imagery and videos saved on a second phone of his, of grown men with girls around 12 years of age, I was enraged.
Principals are not just extractors of the best possible NAPLAN scores from our children. We are the custodians of a precious community trust. Barren’s indiscretions are far more than a crime. They’re a breach of a relational covenant.
While I’d loathe to be a judge considering the full plethora of factors in such cases, three months’ jail feels grotesquely meagre. I guess it’s another simple case of courts sentencing crimes, but communities carrying the consequences.
Beyond the parents of one school, the wider teaching community is also shamed by the full revelation of Barren’s offences. Each of the 141,000 registered and dedicated teachers across Victoria now stands in the shadow of his conduct.
Each now must strive that little bit harder for the parents of their students to trust them. Each knows what that lingering stare over a parental shoulder as they walk away from an early childhood classroom is really all about.
The outrage of our educators is also justifiable, as they must now accept that one predator has the power to unfairly stain their entire profession. Already living and working under intense scrutiny and strict ethical standards, their efforts to meet safeguarding requirements are already exhaustive.
This is why the Langwarrin Park PS story is awful, but equally important as it draws us to confront a hideously inconvenient truth. Deep down, we know there’s no way to psych test evil away. There’s no survey or observation that can weed out every paedophile.
Screening can always be made more robust – but it will remain as fallible as I was when I chatted cheerily with Barren over coffee. Even the tightest of systems will fail to eliminate human deception.
Allowing our outrage to lead us to the complete mistrust of every school employee welcomes a different and permanent harm upon our school communities.
Turning a blind eye is also no alternative.
And so, the community of Langwarrin Park PS is left with a dual burden. They have a rightful outrage to carry, at the same time as they hope to build a future for their children that requires deep trust of their school.
Fortunately, I’ve met most of the staff in that wonderful school and that trust – of my informed, experienced and imperfect observation – is well-placed.
Without trust, parents hover unhelpfully over qualified teachers and school leaders. Those teachers are then prone to retreating, removing the personal connection that underpins the best growth and learning.
Our schools become frightened, defensive institutions and children absorb the anxiety flowing through their corridors.
Trusting relationships are the foundations of learning and the fuel of growth. No school can thrive in a climate of entrenched suspicion.
When this happens, we need to grieve, denounce and ensure full accountability without abandoning our commitment to trust.
For if we stop trusting our schools, it’s our kids who will pay twice for the crimes of an infinitesimally small number of perpetrators.

Trump’s CIA pulls 19 intelligence reports, including analyses of white nationalism and LGBT+ issues
The reports ‘failed to be independent of political consideration,’ according to agency
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
The Central Intelligence Agency has withdrawn more than a dozen intelligence reports, including some that cover LGBT+ activism, white nationalism and contraception.
Director John Ratcliffe ordered the “official retraction or substantive revision” of 19 CIA intelligence reports that the agency claims “did not meet” intelligence community standards and “failed to be independent of political consideration,” the agency said Friday.
These documents were identified by the President’s Intelligence Advisory Board, which recently reviewed hundreds of analytic reports published over the last decade, the agency noted.
The CIA completely retracted 17 of those reports — which predate President Donald Trump’s second term — and pulled two for revisions, according to The Washington Post. The agency publicly shared redacted versions of three affected reports.
One of the reports — titled “Women Advancing White Racially and Ethnically Motivated Violent Extremist Radicalization and Recruitment” — was released in October 2021 under former President Joe Biden.
Racially motivated violent extremists were considered a significant security threat under Joe Biden’s administration and Trump’s first administration. Federal law enforcement under his second administration has focused on left-wing movements including antifa, which he labeled a domestic terrorist organization last year.
The White House also claimed in September that “radical left violence” has “permeated the nation in recent years.”
Another report — “Middle East-North Africa: LGBT Activists Under Pressure” — was issued under former President Barack Obama in January 2015.
A third report, “Worldwide: Pandemic-Related Contraceptive Shortfalls Threaten Economic Development,” was published in July 2020, during Trump’s first term.
The CIA said these documents “exhibit substantial deviations from the President’s expectations that CIA’s workforce remains independent from a particular audience, agenda, or policy viewpoint.”
A senior CIA official who spoke to journalists on the condition of anonymity said the reports dealt with inappropriate topics for the agency to cover, and in some instances relied on biased sources, according to The Washington Post.
The official added that training for analysts has been “retooled.”
“The intelligence products we released to the American people today — produced before my tenure as [CIA director] — fall short of the high standards of impartiality that CIA must uphold and do not reflect the expertise for which our analysts are renowned,” Ratcliffe said in a statement.
“There is absolutely no room for bias in our work and when we identify instances where analytic rigor has been compromised, we have a responsibility to correct the record,” he added.
Democratic Senator Mark Warner, vice-chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, criticized the move.
“The President’s Intelligence Advisory Board plays an important advisory role, but it is not a substitute for the independent analytic judgment of the CIA and the broader Intelligence Community,” he said.
“When a politically appointed body appears to be dictating what analysis is acceptable, it risks eroding confidence in the objectivity of our intelligence,” he added.
Republican Senator Tom Cotton, who chairs the Senate Intelligence Committee, praised Ratcliffe’s announcement and said he’s “been sending these kind of reports back to the CIA for years and observing that they contain no intelligence.”
“Our intelligence agencies have too often missed critical national-security developments to waste time on, for instance, how ‘pandemic-related contraceptive shortfalls threaten economic development.’ Honestly,” Cotton wrote on X.

Tehran announces reciprocal action after EU move against IRGC

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Islamic Republic of Iran announced in a statement that it has designated the naval and air forces of all member states of the European Union as terrorist entities.
According to the statement, the measure constitutes reciprocal action in response to the “illegal and unjustified” decision by EU governments to label the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) as a terrorist organization.
The decision follows a move adopted by EU member states on February 19, 2026. Iran’s Foreign Ministry stressed that the European action contravenes fundamental principles of the United Nations Charter and international law, noting that the IRGC is an official branch of Iran’s armed forces.
The ministry cited Article 7 of Iran’s 2019 law titled “Countermeasures Against the Designation of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as a Terrorist Organization by the United States.” Under this legislation, any country that follows or supports the United States’ designation of the IRGC may be subject to reciprocal measures by Iran.
Based on this legal framework — including Article 4 of the same law — Iran has formally identified the naval and air forces of all EU member states as subject to countermeasures and designated them as terrorist organizations under its domestic legal system.
The statement concluded by emphasizing that the measure was taken within the framework of Iran’s national laws and in response to the clear violation of international legal principles by European governments.

Tar Halva: Traditional Iranian Ramadan dessert

As Ramadan arrives in southern Iran, the atmosphere shifts. In the historic city of Shiraz, the scent of fresh bread, dates, and homemade sweets fills homes before sunset. Among the many foods prepared for iftar, one traditional sweet continues to hold a special place on the table: Tar Halva.
Tar Halva has long been a staple of iftar tables in Shiraz. Made from wheat flour, natural syrups, and oil, the sweet is valued for its energy-boosting properties and what locals describe as its “warming” nature — qualities considered beneficial after a full day of fasting.
Despite the growing popularity of modern desserts and industrial sweets, Tar Halva has retained its place in Ramadan traditions.
More than just a sweet dish, Tar Halva forms part of the collective memory of Ramadan in Iran's Shiraz — recalling family gatherings before the sunset call to prayer, when households would break their fast with simple, homemade foods.
Mohammad Ramazani-Pour, a veteran Shirazi cook who prepares Tar Halva each Ramadan, says the essence of the sweet lies not only in its ingredients but in the process.
“Before it is a food, it is patience,” he explains.
The preparation begins with high-quality, sifted wheat flour. The flour is poured into a large pot or pan and toasted slowly over gentle heat. This stage is critical: the flour must not burn but gradually lose its raw aroma and turn a light golden-cream color.
Continuous stirring is essential. According to traditional wisdom, if the cook’s arm does not tire, the Tar Halva will not turn out properly.
Once the flour reaches the correct color, oil is added gradually while stirring continues to prevent clumping. Some use animal fat, others liquid oil, and some a combination of both.
The sweetness comes from strained grape syrup or date syrup, which is incorporated slowly. At this stage, the mixture darkens, and its aroma intensifies. Spices such as saffron and cardamom are added at the end to preserve their fragrance.
The sweet is ready when it thickens and begins to pull away from the sides of the pot — neither too soft nor too firm.
From a food science perspective, Tar Halva aligns with the nutritional needs of fasting.
Zahra Mohammadi-Nia, a senior food industry specialist, describes it as a simple yet purposeful snack suited to Ramadan. The toasted wheat flour not only improves flavor but also enhances digestibility. Gentle heat partially alters the starch structure, making it more accessible while removing the raw taste — a factor that significantly influences final quality.
Grape or date syrup serves as a natural source of simple, easily absorbed sugars. After hours of fasting, these sugars help restore lost energy quickly.
Unlike many sweets that contain refined sugars, artificial colors, and preservatives, homemade Tar Halva contains no additives. When prepared hygienically and with controlled amounts of oil and syrup, it can be considered a more natural alternative to processed desserts.
Moderate fat content also contributes to satiety and helps prevent rapid blood sugar drops.
The continued presence of Tar Halva on Ramadan tables reflects more than taste preference. It signals the preservation of culinary heritage at a time when processed foods dominate many markets.

Trump approves emergency declaration over massive Washington, DC, sewage spill

Trump approves emergency declaration over massive Washington, DC, sewage spill
Washington: President Donald Trump has approved an emergency declaration for the District of Columbia, permitting federal agencies to provide disaster assistance to tackle a massive sewage spill in the Potomac River.
The spill began in mid-January, when part of a major DC Water sewage pipeline called the Potomac Interceptor collapsed, flooding the Potomac River with about 886 megalitres of wastewater. The sewer line carries about 227 megalitres of wastewater daily from the Virginia and Maryland suburbs to DC for treatment. The cause of the spill remains under investigation.
The US Environmental Protection Agency will lead the federal response to the spill, according to a news release from the agency. The EPA is co-ordinating with DC Water to ensure measures are taken “to protect public health and prevent additional overflows until the pipe is repaired and the Potomac Interceptor is fully functional again”. Repairs are due to be completed by mid-March, before events in the region celebrating the 250th anniversary of the US are set to begin.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency will also be “deploying a team to support incident management” and “working directly with local officials and federal partners to co-ordinate federal resources”, a social media post from Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said.
FEMA said the assistance would be directed to DC and the area where the district has responsibilities in Maryland and Virginia.
Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser declared a public emergency on Wednesday (Washington time) and requested federal help with the clean-up. She also requested a presidential disaster declaration and asked the federal government to reimburse the DC government and DC Water for costs associated with the spill and recovery effort.
DC Water chief executive David Gadis estimated the repair and remediation would cost $US20 million ($28 million).
Trump, who previously criticised Bowser and other Democratic elected officials in the region over mishandling the spill, signalled on Thursday that the federal government would help with the recovery.
Bowser had faced questions over the timing of her emergency declaration, coming a month after the spill began. She said she took the actions, in part, after recent signals from the Trump administration that federal officials might support the request, and maintained that the response to the spill had been urgent from the start.
In his Truth Social post last week indicating that he would respond to Bowser’s request for aid, Trump continued to rail against Democratic governors Wes Moore (Maryland) and Abigail Spanberger (Virginia).
“Governors of Virginia and Maryland must get moving, quickly,” he wrote. “If they can’t do the job, all they have to do is call, be polite and respectful, and the federal government will handle it, and bill them for services rendered, at a later date.”
Authorities have advised against boating, fishing and touching the Potomac River since the spill, but DC officials said last week that they hoped to lift the guidance on March 2, subject to change based on water quality, as testing has shown the level of E. coli in the DC portion of the river consistently hovering under safe recreational limits.
There has not been sewage overflow into the river since February 8.
Officials with DC Water, the public utility responsible for water and sewage in the region, have said drinking water remains safe. But officials have issued warnings for people and pets to stay out of the water near the spill site and downstream in the district.

IDF celebrates new search and rescue unit amid growing tensions with Iran

Amid the rising tensions between the United States and Iran this week, the Home Front Command is set to receive major reinforcements, in the form of a brand new search and rescue unit. The first company of the Fifth Battalion of Home Front Command's Rescue Brigade completed its eight-month training course last week, while the second company began its advanced training last week and will soon follow suit in becoming fully operational.
Nicknamed "The Lion Battalion," the unit was originally formed in response to the October 7th attack. During routine operations, the battalion’s fighters serve as a light infantry unit, handling security tasks in one of the sectors. However, in an emergency, they transition to their role as the Home Front Command’s search-and-rescue unit, operating within IDF training zones or in civilian areas.
Although the battalion was not yet fully operational during the 12-Day War with Iran, its commanders were already deployed in disaster zones in Rishon Lezion, Bnei Brak, Bat Yam, and Ramat Gan, rescuing trapped civilians. In this way, the battalion began to accumulate a combat record, even before its official formation.
Capt. A, commander of the first company, has overseen the integration of the first recruits into the new battalion over the past eight months.
He explained that, if Israel faces missile attacks from Iran or other regions like Lebanon, Yemen, or Syria, and large-scale destruction requires rescue operations, a battalion like his could be called into action. "We are prepared starting this week for any rescue event," said Capt. A.
At just 23 years old, Capt. A grew up in Nahariya and enlisted in the IDF in August 2020 with the "Shahar" 498 battalion - the IDF's search-and-rescue battalion comprised of soldiers in their mandatory service. Throughout his service, he progressed through various command roles, including squad commander, platoon commander, and deputy company commander.
As part of preparations for leading the first company of the "Lion" battalion, Capt. A conducted search-and-rescue operations during the 12-Day War.
Ready to jump into action at any moment
Capt. A told Ma'ariv about the Home Front Command's Rescue Brigade's unique nature.
"We are capable of conducting rescue operations under rubble and saving the lives of civilians," he said, adding, "We are going to be holding a position in the West Bank. But the moment we are needed [elsewhere], we will leave the West Bank to carry out the mission." He continues, "Right after the war [with Iran] began, we were deployed as a rescue force. We left our houses and began the rescues."
Capt. A excitedly described the festive atmosphere and the historic significance within the unit: "The motivation here is sky-high. Yesterday, after more than seven months of intense, grueling training, the company received the orange beret during an emotional march – just before transitioning to operational status. Next week, we will go for training ahead of our operational deployment, and on Sunday, the new platoon commander will hold a ribbon-cutting ceremony.
"In addition to the final march of the training course, a company march will be held at Mt. Eitan to mark the battalion's inauguration and the unveiling of the company's official name, which will start with the letter 'A.'"

Israel Police arrested five suspects in an illegal crypto operation on Monday, along with the confiscation of weapons, drugs, and cash.
According to a police spokesperson, the National Cyber Crime Unit of Lahav 433 has been conducting a covert investigation over the last few months into an illegal cryptocurrency financial service, as well as suspected possession of illegal weaponry.
On Monday, police raided the homes and office of the suspects in Rishon Lezion. There, they arrested the five suspects, aged 30-50, and took them in for interrogation.
During the raid, police located around 80,000 shekels in cash, as well as guns, stun grenades, plastic explosives, ammunition, and a substance suspected to be cocaine.
The explosive materials were safely brought to a lab for further investigation.
Illegal business suspected of loaning cash to criminals
Police also announced on Monday that Lahav 433 had arrested seven people in Kafr Kassem for running an illegal change operation.
Police stated that the suspects were thought to have conducted financial services without a license, including an illegal money loaning business, which may have extended tens of millions of shekels in loans to criminals.
During raids on the change operation, police confiscated blank checks, seals, invoices, real estate documentation, high-end cars, a substance suspected to be cocaine, and around NIS 430,000 in cash.

Trump’s Carlson outreach was worth trying, but it did not end up working - editorial
Unknown

The Trump administration’s involvement in arranging an on-camera conversation between Tucker Carlson and US Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee was not a throwaway media gesture.
It was a recognition that a specific problem on the American Right has grown too large to ignore: the steady normalization of Israel-baiting conspiracies and antisemitic insinuations, pushed not only from the margins but by influential voices with massive audiences.
For an administration that owes much of its political energy to the Right’s media ecosystem, nudging one of that ecosystem’s biggest stars into a public exchange with its ambassador was a sign that the issue is very real and being taken seriously.
The Jerusalem Post has pointed out the Israel and antisemitism divide on the American Right time and time again. This paper has also criticized prominent Republicans, including JD Vance, for avoiding direct confrontation with right-wing antisemitic rhetoric, even as they posture as champions of moral clarity.
That avoidance has consequences: it tells activists, streamers, and opportunists that they can lace their arguments about Israel with familiar tropes and still be welcomed as part of a respectable coalition.
That is what made the Carlson-Huckabee meeting worth attempting. The hope was obvious: expose Carlson, in Israel, across from a Trump-appointed ambassador, to facts and context that could puncture the worst caricatures.
Carlson flew in for only a short visit, conducted the interview at Ben-Gurion Airport, and did not travel farther into the country. The idea seemed to be to create a clear, controlled moment of engagement, without theatrics and without the friction of a full trip.
Instead, the interview and what followed showed that good intentions alone won’t solve this problem.
Prosecutor with a pre-written indictment
Carlson arrived not as a curious interviewer but as a prosecutor with a pre-written indictment.
One of the starkest moments came when he insinuated that President Isaac Herzog “apparently was at Pedo Island,” a smear-by-association tied to Jeffrey Epstein. It was not presented with evidence, context, or restraint, just a baseless claim formulated from an AI photo that has been heavily debunked. Huckabee did not validate it, but the damage was in the act itself: a mainstream right-wing celebrity floating a defamatory insinuation about Israel’s president as though it were a responsible inquiry.
Carlson also pushed a claim about Christians in Israel that collapses under the most basic demographic reality. He asserted that Christians are “far fewer in absolute numbers” than at Israel’s founding, using the line to frame Israel as a place that shrinks and endangers Christian life.
The record shows something different: the Christian population has grown in absolute terms over the decades, while its percentage share shifted as other communities grew faster. The point is not to litigate a spreadsheet. It is to show a pattern: take a complicated reality, sand off the nuance, and present it as evidence of moral rot.
Then came the broader framing that has made Carlson a central node in the Right’s anti-Israel turn: the suggestion that American support is not a strategic partnership but a kind of civilizational subsidy, underwriting Israel’s “cultural and religious life” and, by implication, its internal social choices.
This is a familiar maneuver. It encourages viewers to see Israel not as an ally facing Iran, Hezbollah, and Hamas, but as an alien project extracting resources and imposing values. It is the gateway drug to the older insinuations that always follow: who benefits, who controls, who pulls the strings.
If the interview revealed the posture, the airport episode revealed the strategy. Just a few hours after the conversation was filmed, Carlson claimed he was “detained” at the airport for undergoing a routine security check that all passengers go through.
Footage spread on social media later showed what really happened: routine questioning in a private setting, Carlson smiling, signing paperwork, and posing for photos.
That sequence shows the bridge was never meant to hold. Even when offered a controlled, face-to-face conversation with the administration’s ambassador, Carlson always intended to provoke even further. That is not a failed conversation. It shows that the conversation was never the point.
The administration deserves credit for recognizing the seriousness of antisemitism on the Right and the Israel divide feeding it. But the Carlson–Huckabee experiment also taught a lesson: outreach to a bad-faith megaphone does not tame the megaphone. It sharpens it.
The intention was good. The experiment failed. The next step must be something firmer than another invitation.

Pakistan strikes Afghanistan targets after blaming attacks on Afghan terrorists

Pakistan said it carried out cross-border strikes on targets inside Afghanistan after blaming a series of recent suicide bombings - including attacks during the holy month of Ramadan - on fighters it said were operating from Afghan territory.
The strikes mark a sharp escalation in tensions between Pakistan and Taliban-ruled Afghanistan, days after Kabul released three Pakistani soldiers in a Saudi-mediated move aimed at easing tensions following months of border clashes along the rugged frontier.
In a statement dated February 21 that was released early on Sunday, the ministry said it had "conclusive evidence" the attacks were carried out by what it calls Khwarij, its term for the Pakistani Taliban, acting on instructions from "their Afghanistan-based leadership and handlers."
It said Pakistan carried out "intelligence-based selective targeting of seven terrorist camps and hideouts" belonging to the Pakistani Taliban as well as Islamic State Khorasan Province along the border with Afghanistan.
Reuters could not immediately reach Afghanistan's Taliban authorities for comment. Kabul has repeatedly denied allowing terrorists to use Afghan territory to stage attacks inside Pakistan.
Pakistan sees spate of terror attacks
The government said recent attacks included a bombing at a Shi'ite mosque in Islamabad and violence in the northwestern border districts of Bajaur and Bannu, where the military on Saturday said a suicide bomber targeted a convoy of security forces, killing five terrorists in a gun battle and two soldiers when an explosives-laden vehicle rammed into a military vehicle.
Tensions have repeatedly forced key border crossings to shut, disrupting trade and movement along the 2,600-km (1,600-mile) frontier.
Dozens were killed in clashes in October before the two sides agreed to a fragile ceasefire, but Pakistan continues to accuse Afghanistan's Taliban rulers of harboring terrorists who stage attacks inside its territory - a claim Kabul denies.

Where is Kim Ju Ae? Kim Jong-un’s daughter absent from key party congress amid succession rumours

Where is Kim Ju Ae? Kim Jong-un’s daughter absent from key party congress amid succession rumours
Kim Ju Ae’s presence at the conference was hotly anticipated after South Korean intelligence briefings suggested she had entered ‘successor-designate stage’
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
North Korean leader Kim Jong-un’s daughter was absent as the country opened its key party congress in Pyongyang this week, prolonging ambiguity over the state’s succession plans.
The ninth congress of the ruling Workers’ Party of Korea, convened only once every five years, is North Korea’s most important political gathering and is expected to steer policy on the economy, defence, and foreign relations through the end of the decade.
Kim Ju Ae, believed to be about 13 years old, has been seen regularly by her father’s side at major military parades, weapons tests, party celebrations, and high-profile construction projects since she first entered public view in November 2022.
Her non-appearance at the congress was significant because South Korea’s National Intelligence Service (NIS) told lawmakers earlier this month that Kim Ju Ae had entered what it described as a “successor-designate stage”.
Ju Ae has increasingly been viewed as Kim’s most likely successor, particularly after a high-profile trip to China in 2025.
The South Korean spy agency briefing raised expectations that the congress might offer the clearest signal yet on Kim’s succession.
The NIS was initially sceptical that Kim Ju Ae could be chosen as a North Korean leader, owing to the country’s deeply conservative culture and male-dominated leadership dated back to its founding under Kim Il Sung, Kim Jong Un’s grandfather.
But the sheer volume of high-profile appearances she has made since then alongside the North Korean leader has shifted that assessment, and Seoul now sees them as part of an effort to build a “narrative” paving the way for the country to accept its first female leader.
North Korean state media outlets have never published her name, referring to her as Kim Jong Un’s “respected” or “most beloved” child. The belief that she is named Kim Ju Ae is based on an account by former NBA champion Dennis Rodman, in which he recalled holding Kim Jong Un’s baby daughter during a trip to Pyongyang in 2013.
The party conference opened on Thursday, with Kim Jong Un delivering a speech in Pyongyang declaring that the last five years had been a “proud period” for North Korea, since the country had achieved its goals “in all realms such as politics, the economy, national defence, culture, and diplomacy”.
“In view of the external relations, too, the position of our state was firmly consolidated as an irreversible one, bringing about a great change in the global political landscape and in the influence on our state,” he said, according to the state-run Korean Central News Agency.
Those comments appear to reference Pyongyang’s growing ties with China, where Kim attended his first ever multilateral diplomatic talks alongside a military parade in Beijing last year, and Russia, where North Korea became the first third-party ally in the world to commit thousands of frontline troops to take part in the Russia-Ukraine war.
At least 5,000 members of the ruling party are attending the meeting, and congratulatory letters were sent from Russia, China, Vietnam, and Laos.
Kim’s regime presides over one of the most impoverished nations in the world, with more than 45 per cent of the population undernourished according to a 2023 UN report. Later data are not available due to a lack of access to a kingdom that is almost completely shut off from the outside world.
Kim blamed external factors for the challenges the country faces, citing “hostile forces [that] grew more reckless in their schemes for harsh blockades and sanctions against us”.
Natural disasters and the Covid-19 pandemic also “severely hindered the development of all our sectors, and it also seriously threatened the security of our state and the safety of our people,” he said.
On Saturday, Kim delivered to the congress a report on the work done by the party. The central committee, he said, “fulfilled its important mission and role as the vanguard of the revolution, ushering in a new era of unprecedented changes and upsurge in the scope and depth of struggle and speed of development”.
The report, according to KCNA, laid out longer-term objectives and the methods for achieving them, though specific targets were not disclosed.
The congress endorsed Kim’s report, and reportedly described it as a “revolutionary guideline” that will lead to “more rapid development, faster change, and greater progress”.
It is still possible that Kim Ju Ae could make an appearance in the latter stages of the conference, despite her father having delivered two major addresses already without her. It is not known exactly when the event will conclude, with the previous two party congresses lasting four and eight days respectively.

A long-acting HIV drug arrives in Zimbabwe for some at highest risk

A long-acting HIV drug arrives in Zimbabwe for some at highest risk
Zimbabwe is one of the world's first countries to roll out lenacapavir, a long-acting HIV prevention drug that is administered only twice a year
- Bookmark
Young women, mothers holding babies and some men lined up in a dusty field on the outskirts of Zimbabwe’s capital, Harare. They came for injections of a new HIV prevention drug launched in the country on Thursday, one that only needs to be administered twice a year.
Zimbabwe, where HIV has led to tens of thousands of deaths over the past two decades, is one of the first countries to roll out lenacapavir, a long-acting drug that authorities hope will slow new infections.
With clinical studies demonstrating near-total protection, the drug has been described by some health officials as a turning point for high-risk groups. Others warn that turning scientific promise into broad impact will require overcoming funding constraints, infrastructure gaps and the challenge of keeping patients engaged.
At the Zimbabwe launch, Constance Mukoloka stepped out of a mobile clinic, beaming with relief after receiving one of the first doses.
“I am safe, I can work with confidence now,” said the 27-year-old sex worker, describing how daily preventive preexposure prophylaxis, or PrEP, pills often created tension with clients and proved difficult to take consistently — putting her and others at risk.
Could reshape HIV prevention strategies
Mukoloka is among the first beneficiaries of a donor-supported rollout of lenacapavir across 10 African countries. Health officials and advocates say the drug could reshape HIV prevention strategies if governments can navigate barriers of cost and fragile health systems.
Developed by California-based Gilead Sciences, lenacapavir’s introduction in selected high-risk countries is being supported through the United States President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR, in partnership with the Global Fund.
The injection is offered for free in Zimbabwe to high-risk people such as sex workers, adolescent girls and young women, gay men and pregnant and breastfeeding women.
For Mukoloka, the drug represents more than convenience.
“When I took tablets, customers would see a container of pills and leave. They would never return due to fear,” she said. “They couldn’t tell the difference between PrEP and treatment drugs. With the work we do, that stigma costs you money.”
Daily oral PrEP has long been available in Zimbabwe alongside condoms, vaginal rings and shorter-acting injectables. Yet adherence has remained a challenge, particularly for people facing stigma or unpredictable schedules.
“I work in beer halls looking for clients. Sometimes I would get drunk and forget to take my drugs,” Mukoloka said. “Sometimes I would work all night and not have time. Some clients refuse protection. They say ... 'Why should I use protection when I have paid?’”
Extended duration an advantage
Health authorities see lenacapavir’s discreetness and extended duration as a critical advantage for key populations such as sex workers and therefore a boost in fighting the spread of HIV.
“Prevention must fit into real life. If a health solution is too complicated, too demanding, or too visible, people simply won’t use it,” Douglas Mombeshora, Zimbabwe’s health minister, said at Thursday's launch. “Lenacapavir represents a new way of doing things.”
The drug has been rolled out in other southern African nations like Zambia and Eswatini.
Zimbabwe, Eswatini and Zambia, once global HIV epicenters, have emerged in recent years as among the world’s most successful models in controlling the epidemic, achieving World Health Organization testing, treatment and viral suppression targets.
Yet despite these gains, new infections remain a concern, particularly among adolescent girls and young women.
According to the United Nations children’s agency, HIV prevalence among adolescent girls and young women aged 10-24 is “persistently” triple that of their male counterparts in sub-Saharan Africa, driven by gender inequality, poverty and uneven access to health services.
In sub-Saharan Africa, women and girls of all ages accounted for 63% of all new HIV infections in 2024, according to UNAIDS. In all other geographical regions, about 73% of new infections in 2024 occurred among men and boys.
In Zimbabwe, authorities say about 46,000 people across 24 sites are expected to benefit in the early phase of the lenacapavir rollout, a fraction of potential demand in a country of roughly 15 million.
High cost of mass rollouts
Details for the next phase are not clear. The government says it hopes the number of beneficiaries will increase as more donor-funded doses arrive. It also hopes to acquire its own doses for a mass rollout but, like many other African governments, lacks enough money.
Health officials, experts and activists warn that practical realities could tamper the drug's early promise in Africa, a continent of over 1.5 billion people, not least due to the high cost of mass rollouts for governments.
In Kenya, which received its first 21,000 lenacapavir doses this week, the government said the injectable would be offered at a negotiated price of about $54 per person per year, still a heavy cost for many.
Gilead Sciences has said it would sell its drug at no profit to low and middle-income countries heavily affected by HIV.
Bellinda Thibela, who works on health justice and access at Health GAP, an international advocacy organization, described the move as “a bit comforting” but hardly enough on its own on a continent where health systems have heavily relied on external funding that is diminishing, particularly after U.S. President Donald Trump’s foreign aid cuts.
Challenges will remain in countries that were "80% to 90% dependent on U.S. funding,” Thibela said. “What’s the point of having a reduced price if there is no staff and equipment in clinics?”
While many clinicians describe lenacapavir as a significant advance, they stress it must complement, not replace, prevention tools.
“Condoms remain key. They are cheap and they also prevent other sexually transmitted infections,” said Enerst Chikwati, Zimbabwe program director at AIDS Healthcare Foundation.
But for early recipients such as Mukoloka, the drug’s impact already feels profound.
“I am elated. I can go for a whole six months feeling safe,” she said.

Trump sends ‘great’ hospital boat to treat ‘sick’ people in Greenland
The move comes amid simmering US-Denmark tensions over the mineral-rich Arctic territory
US President Donald Trump said on Saturday he was sending a hospital boat to Greenland, an autonomous Danish territory that he has long coveted and threatened to seize by force.
Trump’s rhetoric has ratcheted up tensions between the United States and Denmark, while putting the global spotlight on the Arctic as he insists mineral-rich Greenland is vital for US and Nato security against Russia and China.
He said the boat would treat many “sick” people in Greenland, without providing any details on who he was referring to or the number of people the vessel would help.
“We are going to send a great hospital boat to Greenland to take care of the many people who are sick, and not being taken care of there,” Trump said in a social media post.
“It’s on the way!!!,” he added.
The post on his social media platform carried an apparent AI image that depicted the USNS Mercy – a 272-metre (894-foot) vessel that is typically stationed in southern California – sailing towards snowcapped mountains on the horizon.

HK$261 million of frozen crime funds may take 7 years to reach Hong Kong coffers
Trials and other legal procedures must first be completed before funds can be deposited into treasury, insider says
Hong Kong authorities froze HK$261 million (US$33.4 million) in suspected criminal proceeds linked to money laundering and drug trafficking last year, but experts say it may take as long as seven years for any of the funds to reach government coffers.
According to data from the Joint Financial Intelligence Unit, run by police and customs, HK$869 million in criminal proceeds was confiscated between 2018 and 2024, with the annual amount fluctuating from HK$284 million in 2018 to HK$18 million in 2024.
Last year, 927 people were convicted of money laundering, with the joint unit freezing HK$261 million.
“After we freeze suspected criminal assets upon arrest, we still have to investigate the case and bring it to court,” a source told the South China Morning Post.
The insider added that suspected criminal proceeds could be confiscated and deposited into the treasury after trials were wrapped up, but other legal procedures would have to be completed before any money could be channelled into government coffers.
The sum frozen last year did not include HK$2.75 billion in cash, stocks and funds allegedly linked to the network of Fujian-born Cambodian businessman Chen Zhi and his Prince Holding Group.

"Oh! The beautiful, the fond memories of my childhood. My earliest memories took place in the port of Mariupol, on the Sea of Azov. When I was just a little boy – 6 years old – I could recognize the ship that would appear far away on the horizon, heading for our port (...). The cab drivers with their horse-drawn carriages on the quays often asked me:
'Hey! Yossia! Is that the Maria, or is it the Ivan Demiakin coming in?'
'It's the Maria!'
I was never wrong (...). I knew all the particularities of 'my' ships, having seen them dock before my eyes so many times. We lived at the port (my father was a schoolteacher, and the Tsar's good rubles never filled our pockets). I loved those roughly cobbled quays, where I spent long and beautiful days playing, facing that southern Russian sea."
These lines, written in 1970, open a tawny faux-leather notebook that's now tucked away in the gentle clutter of a drawer near Porte Dauphine, in Paris's 16th arrondissement. Its cover bears the title Voici déjà l'hiver ("Already, Winter Is Here") − the winter of a life. The author, Joseph Ginsburg (little Yossia), died a year later. He was the father of Serge Gainsbourg and of his elder sister, Jacqueline, who is approaching her 100th birthday. She welcomed us into her home and let us read roughly 40 or so pages, filled with black and blue ink.
Through faded photographs, 25 years of the life of the man who passed on his passion for music to Serge Gainsbourg unfold – a quarter-century of travels through cities once unknown to the French, but which now resonate differently in their ears: Kharkov (Kharkiv), Mariupol, Lougansk (Luhansk), Ekaterinoslav (Dnipro)...

Chen Mo – the man behind Heroes of Jin Yong – on AI and making a blockbuster game
Creator of new incarnation of martial arts epic says connection to the game is more than commercial – it is personal
On the large screen, characters called Eastern Heretic, Western Venom, Southern Emperor and Northern Beggar appeared in exquisitely rendered martial arts duels. Rising above it all with a sinister smile was Dongfang Bubai, a martial artist who castrated himself to learn the secrets of the skills in the legendary Sunflower Manual.
The game brings characters from all 14 of the author’s wuxia novels, works that have been enjoyed by generations of people within China and in Chinese communities around the world.
The game is still in development and, with its billion-yuan price tag, already on track to be the most expensive ever made in China.
But just days after the trailer’s release in late January, its producer came under fire from fans, who queried elements of the storyline and whether the makers were using artificial intelligence (AI) – an accusation akin to plagiarism in the gaming world.
In an interview with the South China Morning Post, Chen Mo, the 42-year-old founder of CreateAI, the company behind the new incarnation of the game, defended the new venture and said that while AI was in the firm’s name, it was not in the animation process.

The U.S. is speeding up its preparations for a large-scale attack against Iran, and Israel is acting as if it's destined to be an active party in this operation. It's possible that the final decision hasn't been made yet, but the public discourse is happily lending itself to the possibility that a war is on its way.

WASHINGTON, February 22. /TASS/. The United States has dispatched a hospital vessel to the shores of Greenland to provide medical assistance to all local residents, "who are sick," US President Donald Trump stated.
"Working with the fantastic Governor of Louisiana, Jeff Landry, we are going to send a great hospital boat to Greenland to take care of the many people who are sick, and not being taken care of there. It’s on the way!!!" the US president stated on his Truth Social network account.
On December 21, 2025, Trump appointed Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry as the US special envoy for Greenland. Following his appointment, Landry said on the X media platform that he would seek to bring the island under US control. The statement triggered a diplomatic scandal in Copenhagen that prompted the Danish Foreign Ministry to summon US Ambassador Kenneth Howery.
On March 13, 2025, Trump stated that the United States would annex Greenland, a self-ruling territory of Denmark. On March 4, he said he would approve a decision by the island’s people to join the United States.
The US leader has repeatedly said that Greenland should become part of the United States. He threatened to impose high tariffs on Denmark if it did not give up the island. Even during his first term, Trump offered to buy Greenland. Denmark and Greenland rejected the idea.

Minnesota Vikings wide receiver Rondale Moore died Saturday in southern Indiana, according to officials. He was 25 years old.
New Albany police chief Todd Bailey said Moore was found in a garage with a suspected self-inflicted gunshot wound, according to local network WLKY. The Floyd County Coroner’s Office confirmed his death Saturday evening.
An autopsy will be performed, and his death remains under investigation, the network reports.
Moore, a star receiver at Purdue University, was drafted into the NFL by the Arizona Cardinals in 2021. He played with the team for three years before a series of knee injuries stalled his career for several seasons.
He signed with the Vikings before the 2025 season and tore his ACL in the first preseason game.
Tributes have poured in from across the NFL and from his alma mater.
University of Louisville head coach Jeff Brohm, who coached Moore at Purdue, said Moore was “a complete joy to coach.”
“The ultimate competitor that wouldn’t back down from any challenge,” he wrote. “Rondale had a work ethic unmatched by anyone. A great teammate that would come through in any situation.”
“We all loved Rondale, we loved his smile and competitive edge that always wanted to please everyone he came in contact with. We offer all of our thoughts and prayers to Rondale and his family, we love him very much,” he added.
“Bro ain’t no way brotha you just messaged me few hours ago,” wrote Kansas City Chiefs receiver Hollywood Brown, who played for the Arizona Cardinals with Moore.
New York Giants quarterback Russell Wilson said he’s “heartbroken” for Moore’s “family, friends, & teammates.”
Sauce Gardner, a cornerback for the Indianapolis Colts, re-shared a post about Moore’s death. He added: “Bro..... what is going on in the world right now?”
Purdue Football said the community is “deeply saddened by the news of Rondale Moore’s tragic passing.”
“An All-American with an infectious smile, Rondale was a joy on and off the field. Someone who left this world too soon, Rondale will be remembered as a legendary Boilermaker. Our thoughts and prayers are with Rondale’s family and loved ones during this difficult time,” the organization said in a statement.

North Korea’s Hollywood-style thriller unveils taboo plot against Kim’s father
‘Days and Nights of Confrontation’, which depicts a plot to kill Kim Jong-il, was released for the first time on state television last month
The film Days and Nights of Confrontation, which had been screened at cinemas in Pyongyang since last year, was released for the first time on state-run Korean Central Television in January.
The perpetrator of the plot to murder Kim Jong-il is a son of the man who attempted to kill Kim Il-sung. Both of the offenders are depicted as counter-revolutionary elements.
According to South Korean media, the new suspenseful thriller, which reportedly won three awards at the Pyongyang International Film Festival, features Hollywood-style action sequences, including train fights, car chases and explosions.
In 2024, the film 72 hours about lessons learned from the Korean war was released in North Korea. Kim Jong-un was closely involved in the production of the film featuring violent action scenes and computer graphics. He reportedly wrote the script and directed the acting.

Islamic State slams Syria's president as 'puppet without a soul,' urges new attacks

The Islamic State group has blasted Syria's interim president, Ahmad al-Sharaa, calling him a "puppet without a soul" controlled by Western countries, adding that his fate eventually will be similar to that of ousted leader Bashar Assad.
In an audio message released late Saturday by the group's spokesman, who identifies himself as Abu Huzaifa al-Ansari, he called on IS followers around the world to attack Jewish and Western targets as they have in past years.
Al-Ansari sent greetings to IS fighters from the group's leader Abu Hafs al-Hashemi al-Qurayshi, who was named as the head of the group in August 2023.
The audio is the first to be released by the group in months and comes after IS was blamed for attacks that left dozens dead or wounded in recent months in Syria, Iraq, Pakistan and other parts of the world.
In December, the group was blamed for an attack in central Syria that left three Americans dead and triggered intense U.S. airstrikes on the extremists' suspected hideouts in the country.
Despite its defeat in Iraq in 2017 and in Syria two years later, IS sleeper cells still carry out deadly attacks in both countries, where they once declared a caliphate.
The UN chief said earlier this month in a report on threats posed by IS that Syria's president, interior minister and foreign minister were the targets of five foiled assassination attempts last year.
In December 2024, insurgents led by now-interim President Ahmad al-Sharaa's Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, marched to Damascus and removed then-President Bashar Assad from power, striking a severe blow to Iran's influence in the war-torn country. Assad belonged to the minority Alawite sect in the predominantly Sunni Muslim country.
Since then, al-Sharaa, a former leader of al-Qaida's branch in Syria, has improved his relations with Western countries and last year became the first Syrian head of state to visit Washington since Syria's independence in 1946.
Al-Ansari said that Iran and Assad in Syria were replaced "with a regime that is subjected to American influence."
"Syria today is ruled by the Crusaders after they placed a leader who is a puppet without a soul," al-Ansari said. He vowed new attacks in the country, saying that "Syria has entered a new era of defense and the convoys of jihad will eventually march in Syria."
The audio, which is supposed to mark the beginning of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, did not mention the transfer of 5,704 suspected IS detainees from prisons in northeast Syria to Iraq in recent weeks. Al-Ansari only said that everyone is scared of the detainees, whom the Americans, Shiites and Kurdish fighters are doing all they can to make sure they don't escape.
Al-Ansari also did not mention the al-Hol camp that used to house more than 24,000 people, mostly women and children linked to IS, that is now almost empty after government forces took control of it last month from the U.S.-backed and Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces.
He acknowledged that IS lost fighters over the past two years because of attacks by the U.S.-led coalition against IS. The Syrian government officially joined the coalition in November.

Will the United States strike Iran? Who will win the Super Bowl? The Oscars? The municipal elections in Paris? These uncertainties can pay off big on Polymarket. With a rather austere appearance, the American website presents thousands of questions, allowing bettors to wager on the outcome of current events and collect winnings if they choose correctly.
In the United States, such prediction market platforms are booming. In November 2025, the volume of bets on Polymarket and Kalshi, the two leaders in the sector, was estimated at nearly $13 billion (€10.9 billion). By early 2026, Polymarket has claimed tens of millions of visitors and hundreds of thousands of active traders.
Molly White, a researcher and engineer from Northeastern University in Boston, Massachusetts, described "a powerful trend" in the United States, "where everything becomes an excuse for gambling." Nikos Smyrnaios, a professor of social sciences at the University of Toulouse, added that there are issues raised by "risk speculation," which he described as characterized by "a total absence of ethics."

Naive pacifism today promoting wars of tomorrow – Merz
He made the statement at a congress of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) in Stuttgart, Ukrinform reports, citing Tagesspiegel.
“We stand by the Ukrainian people without any ifs, ands, or buts. We will never accept how a criminal Russian regime systematically wages war against the civilian population of this country, against the elderly, against women, and against children.,” the Chancellor said.
Merz also strongly condemned Russian propaganda, which he said combines Russia’s aggression against Ukraine with “an almost unbearable Nazi propaganda against the Ukrainian people – a people who have suffered under German and Russian tyranny like almost no other in the world.”
According to him, Russia’s war against Ukraine is “a test of our values and our resolve.” Merz urged people to remember the lessons of history: “Appeasement does not create peace. It only emboldens the aggressor
The chancellor warned that “a naive pacifism today is promoting the wars of tomorrow.”
As reported by Ukrinform, Germany will provide Ukraine with more than €11.5 billion in direct military assistance this year.

We’re going to need a bigger park: Perth welcomes drum and bass icon
Perth is the home of drum and bass in the southern hemisphere so it’s no surprise when one of the genre’s icons - Sub Focus aka Nicolaas Douwma - brought his Circular Sounds tour here tickets were snapped up so feverishly organisers scrambled to find a new venue than the original Ozone Reserve.
We’re going to need a bigger park.
Thousands of dance music fans streamed into the bigger venue at Wellington Square on a cool Saturday evening and were treated to a smorgasbord of high BPM and deep wubs.
It’s the first time the English DJ and producer has played Perth since Wildlands Festival in 2023.
With the event bearing his name so this time, he came with plenty of audiovisual goodies to accompany his fast-paced set, including a large light ring that lowered above him at several points.
He opened his set with his breakout 2009 hit from his eponymous album Rock It and from there launched into hit after hit across his impressive 17-year discography.
Highlights were the air-punching Illuminate from his 2020 album Portals produced with his fellow UK drum and bass pal Wilkinson, which was mixed into a rework of 2000s dance anthem Toca’s Miracle by Fragma.
Sub Focus’ sound is driven heavily by big atmospheric female vocals.
Tracks like 2018’s Desire and Wildfire from his latest album Contact whipped the Wellington Square crowd into a heaving mess.
A personal favourite was the boppy earworm On & On with British singer bbyclose.
Earlier in the evening, dubstep royalty Nero started with a bang - dropping their heavy anthem Innocence from their iconic 2011 album Welcome Reality. What followed was a fairly subdued set with some standout bangers like Promises, Me and You and their remix of UK rapper Plan B’s The Recluse.
Wellington Square was a great venue and a smart choice to give a drum and bass evening like that the grandeur it deserved, but lost points for a lack of toilets resulting in some very desperate people spending more time looking at a closed portaloo door than their favourite artist.

It is one of the most popular tourism spots in Victoria, but locals face a deadly risk

It is one of the most popular tourism spots in Victoria, but locals face a deadly risk
When the dense fog rolls over the Wild Dog Valley obscuring the panoramic view of the Apollo Bay coastline below, Lindsay Grayson knows the mobile phone reception will be terrible. Even reliable spots within metres of his home might go blank or barely register.
In these conditions, Grayson depended on the landline that was his key connection to the outside world. That simple piece of technology, connected to the phone network by underground copper wire, could mean the difference between life and death.
When Grayson, an infectious disease expert, and his wife bought the farming property in the Apollo Bay hinterland about 25 years ago, there was no phone line connected. They decided to install a landline for safety in their shearing shed – in case of snake bites, fires or farming accidents.
“I know a copper landline may be an old-fashioned idea, but it was developed because it’s safe, and it works,” Grayson said.
Until recently, Grayson also had a landline to the house he bought in 2019 – a steep and windy two-kilometre drive from his shearing shed. But this year Grayson was told that NBN Co, which maintains the landline to his home, wanted to cease operating that phone service due to the cost of maintaining it.
“I’m not asking for a new copper line,” he said. “This copper line’s been here all along. All we’re asking for is maintenance in a high-risk bushfire zone. Here in bushfire zones, the copper line is absolutely vital because it works even when the power supply is cut off.”
Grayson said the landline to his house had been disconnected for the past three months and there were sections of wire lying on the ground and clearly damaged.
Throughout the region, the companies that operate and maintain the telecommunications infrastructure want to phase out copper landlines.
But local advocates for retaining them are urging the corporations to keep the copper wires amid fears replacement services are vulnerable to power failures and interference from smoke and fog.
As climate change increases the likelihood of more catastrophic events, communities are facing new challenges in how they communicate and receive information during disasters.
Early this year, Grayson’s family received a phone call from a Telstra representative notifying them that NBN Co did not want to repair the existing copper service to his home and seven other nearby properties as this would require 500 metres of new cable at a cost of $36,000 to the company.
While Grayson’s landline to his home is maintained by NBN Co, the landline to his farm shed nearby is maintained by Telstra. Despite the complexity of this arrangement, Grayson deals with Telstra to report faults and damage to both landlines.
He said losing the landline to his home could leave him dangerously isolated in an emergency because landline alternatives proposed by Telstra, including satellite-based services, were expensive and reliant on power, which often failed during fires and storms.
“I just need to be able to call the ambulance or CFA,” he said.
NBN Co is responsible for maintaining and restoring its network infrastructure, but the company insists its responsibility for copper assets does not extend to preserving or replacing ageing infrastructure indefinitely.
A spokeswoman for NBN Co said some properties in Apollo Bay continued to rely on “legacy” copper lines originally built and operated by Telstra.
She said NBN maintained some sections of this infrastructure to support the continuity of existing landlines provided by Telstra under arrangements established during the rollout of the NBN.
“NBN recognises the importance of reliable communications, particularly in regional and high-risk areas,” she said.
The spokeswoman said NBN Co was working with Telstra and its customers to explore alternative options where infrastructure, like degrading copper lines, could no longer be feasibly maintained.
Apollo Bay resident Jane Gross said she was aware of 31 households out of 55 in two main Apollo Bay valleys who still relied on their landlines, particularly when disasters threatened.
Although her landline is managed by Telstra, she said the company also wanted to phase out the service.
She said having a landline was critical when the electricity failed because the copper wires were powered independently.
“It’s reliable when everything else goes out,” Gross said.
She has poor mobile reception at her home and uses an internet connection to make calls over Wi-Fi from her mobile. But Gross said she and her neighbours still regularly shared information about bushfires via their landlines.
A Telstra spokeswoman said the copper network was ageing and increasingly prone to faults, with repairs becoming harder as parts were no longer available.
“Where copper is damaged beyond repair, we will work with customers to move to newer technologies,” she said.
The spokeswoman said a satellite-based service provided more reliable voice and data services.
But RMIT senior research fellow Daniel Featherstone said heavy rain, fog or smoke could interfere with satellite or microwave signals to mobile towers, contributing to the challenges disaster-prone communities already faced.
He said extreme weather also resulted in power outages, which could sever phone reception when batteries ran flat in mobile towers.
“The challenge is ensuring reliability of services through these periods, so people can access emergency information and contact emergency services,” he said.
Featherstone, who lives in Castlemaine, said his community lost mobile reception during the recent Harcourt fires.
“These issues are real,” he said. “People couldn’t communicate with family or get messages from the police or service providers during that period.”
For Lindsay Grayson, the landline remains the best back-up system during an emergency in his hillside community. “We all rely on it,” he said.
He is frustrated that NBN Co appears unwilling to maintain the landline.
“I think it’s incredibly lame. Pathetic, actually,” he said.
Grayson believes $36,000 is a reasonable price for the multibillion-dollar company to pay for maintaining the existing system.
Scrimping for savings in a fire zone, he said, was just not worth it.

IDF forces fatally shoot Palestinian teenager in West Bank, health officials say
A 17-year-old Palestinian who was shot in the head by Israeli soldiers in the West Bank on Saturday has died of his wounds, the Palestinian Health Ministry reported.

Witkoff says Trump 'curious' why Iran hasn't capitulated to demands amid massive U.S. military presence
U.S. Envoy Steve Witkoff said U.S. President Donald Trump is "curious" as to why the Iranian government has not acceded to U.S. demands in talks, in light of the mass mobilization of U.S. forces in the Middle East.
"I don't want to use the word 'frustrated,' because he understands he has plenty of alternatives, but he's curious as to why they haven't… I don't want to use the word 'capitulated,' but why haven't they capitulated?" Witkoff said on Fox News. "Why, under this pressure, with the amount of seapower and naval power over there, why haven't they come to us and said, 'We profess we don't want a weapon, so here's what we're prepared to do'? And yet it's sort of hard to get them to that place."
Arab, Muslim states slam Huckabee for saying 'fine' for Israel to take over Middle East
Eleven Arab and Muslim states issued a joint condemnation on Saturday of remarks by U.S. Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee, who said it "would be fine" if Israel controlled most of the Middle East.
The foreign ministers who signed the statement categorically rejected Huckabee's "dangerous and inflammatory remarks," which they said "directly contradict the vision put forward by U.S. President Donald J. Trump" for the region, which they claimed is "grounded in promoting tolerance and peaceful coexistence."
They said the statements "undermine these objectives, fuel tensions, and constitute incitement rather than advancing peace," adding that they "pose a grave threat to the security and stability of the region."
The ministers warned that the "continuation of Israel's expansionist policies and unlawful measures will only inflame violence and conflict in the region and undermine the prospects for peace and called for an end to these incendiary statements."
Signatories included the foreign ministers of the Palestinian Authority, Jordan, Egypt, Lebanon, Syria, the United Arab Emirates, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Qatar, Kuwait, Indonesia, Pakistan, Bahrain, as well as the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), the League of Arab States (LAS), and the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC).

Islamic State claims two attacks on Syrian army, announces new phase of operations
Islamic State claimed responsibility on Saturday for two attacks targeting Syrian army personnel in northern and eastern Syria, as the militant group signaled what it described as a new phase of operations against the country's leadership.
The militant group said on its Dabiq news agency that it had targeted "an individual of the apostate Syrian regime" in the city of Mayadin in Deir al-Zor province using a pistol, and attacked two other personnel with machine guns in the northern city of Raqqa.
Syria's Defence Ministry said in a statement that a Syrian army soldier and a civilian were killed on Saturday by "unknown assailants." A military source told Reuters the soldier belonged to the army's 42nd Division.
The attacks come amid a sharp escalation by IS against Syria's leadership under President Ahmed al-Sharaa, a former al Qaeda leader who broke with the group in 2016 before leading a coalition of Islamist factions that overthrew President Bashar al-Assad at the end of 2024.
On Saturday evening, IS released a recorded statement by its spokesperson, Abu Hudhayfa al-Ansari, who said Syria had "moved from Iranian occupation to Turkish-American occupation."
The group said it had begun a "new phase of operations" in Syria, describing Sharaa as a "watchdog" of the global coalition and vowing that his fate would be no different from that of Assad.
Israeli settlers declare new West Bank settlement deep inside Palestinian Hebron
Israeli settlers seized five Palestinian-owned buildings Thursday night, declaring a new settlement in the heart of a densely populated Palestinian neighborhood in the West Bank city of Hebron.
Residents of the neighborhood of Jabal Jalles, which is under IDF control, reported that on the eve of the settlers' entry, Israeli soldiers conducted a raid on locals, arresting dozens.
In Hebron, an Israeli settler enclave in the Old City is guarded by a fortified Israeli military presence, surrounded by a much larger Palestinian population.
Jabal Jalles, located between the settlement of Kiryat Arba and an outpost, saw its Jewish presence in Palestinian territory increase with the establishment of the new settlement, called Schunat Gvura, or "Neighborhood of Heroism."
The settler group behind the move, "Harchivi Makom Ohalech," whose name is a biblical passage meaning "expand the place of your tent," claims to have purchased the five buildings and described the seizure as a "redemption" operation.
Far-right agitator detained after arriving at home of Arab Israeli journalist
Far-right agitator Mordechai David was detained after arriving at the home of Arab Israeli journalist Lucy Aharish alongside several other right-wing activists.
Aharish has recently been threatened and targeted by a racially charged media campaign after she criticized two right-wing coalition lawmakers for demeaning families of Arab homicide victims and urged Israel's Arab citizens to vote in droves in the upcoming election.
David was filmed during his detention saying that he was arrested because he "went to protest against Lucy Aharish because she brought the one who kicked the goats to the studio," referring to Sigal Shukron from the anti-occupation group Looking the Occupation in the Eye.
Last month, David was issued a no-contact order after showing up at Shukron's home and harassing her on camera.
Other posts published by David on social media Saturday show how he attempted to block journalists Shai Golden and Raviv Drucker.
'PM worked to erase responsibility from narrative,' Shiri Bibas' cousin tells Tel Aviv demonstrators
The cousin of slain hostage Shiri Bibas told anti-government demonstrators in Tel Aviv that her family members could have been saved had a hostage deal been implemented sooner.
"I want to know what considerations delayed the first deal from being implemented immediately?" Yifat Zailer demanded of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, noting that the decision to begin an aerial bombardment campaign in the Gaza Strip was made while 251 hostages were held in unknown locations.
"It took you 49 long days and nights to sign a deal," Zailer said, addressing the prime minister. "I know that Shiri, Kfir, and Ariel could have been saved had it been implemented sooner." Zailer added that "at that exact same time, in the Prime Minister's Office, they were already working diligently on how to erase the word 'responsibility' from the narrative, from themselves."
'Our duty to demand a different reality': Standing Together co-leader tells demonstrators, as Arab citizens face lawlessness
Rula Daoud, national co-director of the Standing Together movement, warned that violence in the Arab community could spill over into the rest of society as the Netanyahu government "abandons the peripheries" and "incites against anyone who thinks differently."
"Twenty-one percent of the country's citizens live in a total absence of law and security," Daoud told protesters in Tel Aviv.
"Anyone who thinks this government will stop after harming Arabs is telling themselves stories. This government acts daily against all of us," the movement leader said.
"It abandons the peripheries, incites against anyone who thinks differently, encourages violence against protesters, and plans many more wars and much more blood for us all – as it seeks to return to war in Gaza, as it ignites the West Bank and allows violent settlers to carry out pogroms there, and as it quietly races toward annexation, according to the plan of the far-right."
"It is our duty to demand a different reality," Daoud concluded.

WASHINGTON - US President Donald Trump said on Feb 21 he was working with Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry to send a hospital boat to Greenland, a Danish territory that Mr Trump has said he wants to acquire.
Mr Trump announced the plan on social media moments before hosting a dinner for Republican governors at the White House, where he sat next to and chatted with Mr Landry.
“Working with the fantastic Governor of Louisiana, Jeff Landry, we are going to send a great hospital boat to Greenland to take care of the many people who are sick, and not being taken care of there. It’s on the way!!!” Mr Trump said.
Neither the White House nor Mr Landry’s office responded to queries about the post, whether the ship had been requested by Denmark or Greenland and which sick people needed help.
The Department of War had no immediate comment.
Danish King Frederik paid a second visit to Greenland
Greenland, Denmark and the US in late January held talks to resolve the situation following months of tensions within the NATO defence alliance.
Mr Trump’s post came hours after Denmark’s Joint Arctic Command said it had evacuated a crew member who required urgent medical treatment from a US submarine in Greenland’s waters, seven nautical miles outside of Greenland’s capital, Nuuk.
It was unclear what connection Mr Landry had with the matter or if the post had any connection to the evacuation.

Pakistan Launches Fresh Attacks Inside Afghanistan Amid Rising Tensions

Pakistan said it launched strikes on seven militant sites inside Afghanistan in a "retributive response” to recent suicide attacks it said were carried out by Afghan-based extremists, as tensions escalated between the two South Asian neighbors.
Pakistan "has carried out intelligence-based selective targeting of seven terrorist camps and hideouts," the Information Ministry said early on February 22.
Islamabad said it had "conclusive evidence" that recent attacks inside Pakistan were carried out by Afghan-based Pakistani Taliban extremists who were allegedly acting on instructions from "their Afghanistan-based leadership and handlers."
The Pakistani ministry said it targeted the Islamic State (IS) extremist group, along with the Pakistani Taliban, in the strikes. It did not immediately provide details of the attacks or describe the evidence it said its intelligence agencies had gathered.
But Afghan officials said that "dozens of people" had been killed and injured in the country's Nangarhar and Paktika provinces, "including women and children."
The claims from either side could not immediately be verified.
The renewed violence comes after hopes had been raised for an easing of tensions days earlier, when Kabul released three Pakistani soldiers in a Saudi-mediated move following months of border clashes in the remote regions.
Suicide Attacks Inside Pakistan
A least four suicide attacks have been carried out in recent weeks. Three were in Pakistan’s northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province and one was in the capital, Islamabad, killing dozens of civilians and security personnel.
Islamabad alleged that the extremist Taliban leaders of Afghanistan had failed to take "substantive action" against the militants despite repeated requests.
It urged Kabul to prevent the use of its territory for attacks against Pakistan by terror groups.
Afghanistan denies Pakistan's accusations that it is sheltering the Pakistani Taliban, which is an offshoot of the Afghan Taliban but appears to operate separately.
Tensions have escalated between the two countries since Pakistan conducted air strikes on Kabul in October 2025 and followed up with additional attacks on Afghan territory.
Dozens of soldiers from both sides were killed in artillery clashes and heavy gunfire last year before a cease-fire was agreed through Qatari mediation.
Lack Of Long-Term Solution
However, several rounds of talks mediated by Qatar and Turkey aimed at easing the tensions along the border have failed to bring about a long-term breakthrough.
Among the most serious attacks was a February 6 suicide bombing at a Shi'ite mosque in Islamabad that killed at least 32 people as they observed Friday Prayers.
The Islamic State claimed responsibility for that attack, which was the deadliest terror strike since 2008 in the Pakistani capital.
Fighting along the 2,600-kilometer frontier has forced the closing of several key border crossings and disrupted trade and movement.
Afghan's Taliban rulers have not been recognized by most of the world community as the legitimate government in the country and have been accused of extensive human rights abuses, especially against women and girls.

Ukraine explosions kill policewoman, wound 15 in 'terror' attack
Explosions in the western Ukrainian city of Lviv killed a policewoman and wounded at least 15 people overnight in what local authorities on Sunday called an "act of terror".
The blasts occurred shortly after police responded to a report of a break-in at a shop in the city centre around 12:30 am (2230 GMT Saturday), according to the Lviv regional prosecutor's office.
A first explosion struck as the initial patrol arrived, followed by a second blast moments later when another crew reached the scene.
Officials said a 23-year-old woman police officer was killed, while a patrol car and a civilian vehicle were damaged.
"This is definitely an act of terror," Lviv mayor Andriy Sadovy said in a Facebook post. "We have 15 people currently receiving medical aid, some of them are in very serious condition.
"One policewoman died. My condolences to the family and close ones," he added.
Lviv, close to the Polish border and far from the front line, has faced sporadic strikes and security incidents since Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022, but deadly explosions in the city centre remain rare.

Editor's note: This is a developing story and is being updated.
Several rounds of explosions have been reported in Kyiv overnight on Feb. 22 as authorities warn ballistic missiles are heading towards the city.
Explosions first took place in Ukraine's capital at around 4:00 a.m. local time, according to a Kyiv Independent journalist on the ground. More blasts were heard at approximately 4:30 a.m. local time.
"The enemy is attacking the capital with ballistic weapons. Please stay in shelters until the all-clear signal is given," Tymur Tkachenko, head of the Kyiv City Military Administration, said.
An air raid alert was first issued by authorities at 3:56 a.m. local time. The alert was later extended to all of Ukraine at 4:47 a.m. local time as Russian bombers took off, according to the Air Force.
Additional blasts were heard in Kyiv at around 5:13 a.m. local time, according to a reporter on the ground.
The roof of a residential building caught fire and was damaged as a result of the Russian attack, Tkachenko said.
Russia regularly strikes Ukrainian civilian infrastructure, including residential buildings and energy infrastructure, as it continues to wage its war.
A Russian drone attack in northeastern Ukraine's Sumy Oblast killed two brothers and a married couple, while a missile strike damaged a production facility belonging to U.S. multinational company Mondelez, authorities reported Feb. 21.
The two brothers were first injured by an explosive device dropped by a drone and taken to the hospital, Sumy Oblast Governor Oleh Hryhorov reported.
"On the way to the hospital, the Russians deliberately attacked the emergency vehicle with a strike drone," he added. The second Russian strike killed the two siblings.
Over the course of a day, at least five people were killed, and 30 others were injured in Russian attacks against Ukraine, local authorities said on Feb. 18.

CARACAS, February 22. /TASS/. Venezuela should assume the course of stability, national reconciliation, cohesion and the people’s unity, Venezuela’s authorized President Delcy Rodriguez said.
"The path to national stability stretches through the unity of the people, the protection of the homeland and the provision for the future of the younger generation," she said on air of Venezuela’s Venezolana de Television TV channel.
Rodriguez pointed out that the strategic importance of the Program of Democratic Coexistence and Peace was the main tool for the national reconciliation. According to her, this program is aimed at countering hate propaganda promoted by extremist circles both inside and outside Venezuela.
She stated that "those who call for the destruction of Venezuela with the help of fascism should know that this option is not suitable for our country."
On January 3, Washington announced a military operation in Caracas, as a result of which US servicemen captured Maduro and his wife. On January 5, they appeared before a federal court in the Southern District of New York. They are charged with involvement in drug trafficking. Neither Maduro nor his wife pleaded guilty.
Rodriguez, who served as executive vice president under Maduro, is currently acting as head of state in Venezuela. The US administration has stated that Washington will temporarily take over the administration of Venezuela.

Powerful explosions shook Ukraine's capital, Kiev, early Sunday, after officials warned of a possible ballistic missile attack and ordered residents into shelters.
The city's military administration issued the alert shortly before 0200 GMT, urging people to take cover immediately. Moments later, AFP journalists in Kiev heard several loud blasts.
"Attention! An air alert has been declared in Kiev due to the threat of the enemy using ballistic weapons," the administration said, calling on residents to remain in shelters until the alarm is lifted.
Regional authorities said air defence units were engaging drones detected over the wider Kiev region and reminded civilians not to film or post images of ongoing military activity.
There were no immediate reports of casualties.
Kiev, regularly targeted by Russian missile and drone attacks since February 2022, has faced waves of overnight strikes in recent weeks as Russia and Ukraine have intensified their winter assaults on each other’s energy and military infrastructure.
Last month, Russia agreed to a request from US President Donald Trump to halt air strikes on Kiev until February 1 amid harsh winter temperatures, and Ukraine said it was ready to reciprocate as Washington pushes for a diplomatic solution to end the war.
But after February 1, the two sides exchanged strikes and blame as talks mediated by the US have yielded little till now, except for occasional prisoner exchanges.

Rescue forces were sent to Nahal Amud Nature Reserve in the Upper Galilee on Friday after three teenagers encountered a dead body while hiking in the area, Maariv reported.
According to a post made on Facebook by Inbal Shoham, the mother of one of the teens who found the body, rescue forces refused to climb down the hiking path in order to reach the body. Instead, she wrote, they directed the teens remotely while a helicopter from the IDF search and rescue Unit 669 was en route.
"The gap... conduct of authorized bodies is simply disappointing," the mother wrote, describing how her son and his friends documented the body as instructed by police, directed the helicopter, and received contradictory instructions on how to handle the body.
"My son was asked to check its pulse," she wrote, "Afterwards he was instructed not to check, so that he wouldn't interfere with any evidence before a forensics team arrived - a logical decision on its own, but in the end forensics never came to the site, and the rescue was conducted."
Rescue forces label retrieval complex operation
Rescue forces announced that the operation had been complex, involving a series of rope systems in a difficult environment.
"Unfortunately, this is the fifth rescue in less than a week that the unit's volunteers have carried out, and two of them involved a person found dead," the unit stated.
N12 stated that the body had been present in the area for around 12 hours before being found, and that his car was found in a nearby parking lot.

Israeli Muay Thai (Thai boxing) fighter Ahavat Hashem Gordon beat his Turkish opponent on Saturday evening after the two had a tense face-off the day before.
On Friday after the weigh-in, Gordon, who wore an Israeli flag over his shoulders, faced Ali Konyuncu, and the two exchanged the customary threats before high-profile boxing matches.
During the heated exchange, Konyuncu lunged at Gordon's neck, and the two were both immediately restrained. Both tried to break free of the men holding them back, according to video of the event which circulated on social media. Despite the restraints, Konyuncu managed to kick Gordon in the midsection before the two were effectively separated.
The fight, held in Kaunas, Lithuania, on Saturday night, lasted only two rounds. The first round was inconclusive, with neither side able to gain a clear advantage.
In the second round, Konyuncu socked Gordon with an uppercut before Gordon knocked him to the floor with a blow to the head. When the two were pulled apart, Konyuncu was seen bleeding profusely from a wound on the side of his head, and the judges made the call to end the fight there, awarding the victory to Gordon.
Israel's Culture and Sports Minister Miki Zohar (Likud) responded to Gordon's win in a Twitter/X post late on Saturday night, saying: "Another brilliant victory for our Israeli fighter."
Israelis in combat sports
Israel has produced a number of excellent athletes in combat sports over the last several decades, including judokas Yael Arad and Oren Smadja, who won Israel its first two Olympic medals (silver and bronze, respectively), at the 1992 Summer Olympics. Since then, Israel has won several other Olympic medals in judo, and sent athletes - including world champion Muay Thai fighters Sarah Abraham and Nili Block - to a variety of high-level boxing competitions.
In November, the Israeli kickboxing delegation put on a strong showing at the World Championships in Abu Dhabi, returning home with 7 medals. The event featured around 2,000 athletes from approximately 85 countries.

Trump to raise US global tariff from 10 to 15% after Supreme Court ruling

Trump to raise US global tariff from 10 to 15% after Supreme Court ruling
Move comes as businesses seek repayment for the estimated $133bn the Trump administration has already collected.
United States President Donald Trump has doubled down on his new global tariffs, raising them from 10 to 15 percent, days after the Supreme Court struck down his sweeping levies on imports.
The move on Saturday came as businesses and governments around the world sought repayment for the estimated $133bn that Washington has already collected.

- list 3 of 4World reacts as US top court limits Trump’s tariff powers
- list 4 of 4Trump’s tariff regime has been ruled unlawful. What are the implications?
In a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump announced the raise “effective immediately” and said the move was based on a review of the “ridiculous, poorly written and extraordinarily anti-American decision” issued by the Supreme Court on Friday.
By a six-to-three vote, the court had ruled that it was unconstitutional for Trump to unilaterally set and change tariffs, because the power to tax lies with the US Congress.
The court’s decision struck down tariffs that Trump had imposed on nearly every country using an emergency powers law, known as the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA).
Trump railed against the majority justices as “fools and lapdogs” in a news conference after the ruling, calling them an “embarrassment to their families”. He quickly signed an executive order – resting on a different statute, Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974 – to impose the blanket 10 percent tariff, starting on Tuesday.
The 15 percent hike announced on Saturday is the highest rate allowed under that law.
However, those tariffs are limited to 150 days unless they are extended by Congress. No president has previously invoked Section 122, and its use could lead to further legal challenges.
It was not immediately clear whether an updated executive order was forthcoming.
The White House said the Section 122 tariffs include exemptions for certain products, including critical minerals, metals and energy products, according to the Reuters news agency.
Lawsuits
Trump wrote on Saturday that his administration will continue to work on issuing other permissible tariffs.
“During the next short number of months, the Trump Administration will determine and issue the new and legally permissible Tariffs, which will continue our extraordinarily successful process of Making America Great Again,” he said.
The president has already said his administration intends to rely on two other statutes that permit import taxes on specific products or countries based on investigations into national security or unfair trade practices.
Tariffs have been central to Trump’s economic agenda, which he has used as a tool to address a range of goals – from reviving domestic manufacturing to pressuring other nations to crack down on drug trafficking, and pushing warring countries toward peace.
He has also wielded tariffs, or the threat of them, as leverage to extract trade concessions from foreign governments.
Federal data shows the US Treasury had collected more than $133bn from the import taxes the president has imposed under the emergency powers law as of December.
Since the Supreme Court’s ruling, more than a thousand lawsuits have been filed by importers in the US to seek refunds, and more cases are on the way.
While legally sound, the path forward for such claims is not straightforward, especially for smaller firms, said John Diamond, director of the Center for Tax and Budget Policy at Rice University.
“It’s pretty clear that they will win in court, but it’ll take some time,” Diamond said. “Once we get the court orders in effect, I don’t think those refunds will be all that messy for larger firms. Smaller firms are going to have a much more difficult time getting through the process.”
But foreign governments are managing “the real mess”, Diamond said.
“What do you do if you’re Taiwan, or Great Britain, and you have this existing trade deal, but now it’s kind of been turned upside down?”
The US-Taiwan trade deal lowers the general tariff on Taiwanese goods from 20 percent to 15 percent, the same level as Asian trade partners South Korea and Japan, in exchange for Taipei agreeing to buy about $85bn of US energy, aircraft and equipment.
The US-United Kingdom deal imposes a 10 percent tariff on imports of most UK goods, and reduces higher tariffs on imports of UK cars, steel and aluminium.
‘Pickpocketing the American people’
After the Supreme Court’s decision, Trump’s trade representative, Jamieson Greer, told Fox News on Friday that those countries must honour their agreements even if they call for higher rates than the Section 122 tariffs.
Exports to the US from countries such as Malaysia and Cambodia would continue to be taxed at their negotiated rates of 19 percent, even though the universal rate is lower, Greer said.
Indonesia’s chief negotiator for US tariffs, Airlangga Hartarto, said the trade deal between the countries that set US tariffs at 19 percent, which was signed on Friday, remains in force despite the court decision.
The ruling could spell good news for countries like Brazil, which has not negotiated a deal with Washington to lower its 40 percent tariff rate but could now see its tariff rate drop to 15 percent, at least temporarily.
Governments around the world have reacted to the Supreme Court decision – as well as Trump’s subsequent tariff announcement – with a mix of cautious optimism, trepidation and frustration.
German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said he would coordinate a joint European stance before talks with Trump in early March, while Hong Kong’s secretary for financial services and the Treasury, Christopher Hiu, described the situation surrounding Trump’s new tariff moves as a “fiasco”.
With the November midterm elections in the US looming, Trump’s approval rating on his handling of the economy has steadily declined during his year in office.
A Reuters/Ipsos poll that closed on Monday showed 34 percent of respondents saying they approved of Trump’s handling of the economy, while 57 percent said they did not approve.
Democrats, who need to flip only three Republican-held seats in the US House of Representatives in November to win a majority, have blamed Trump’s tariffs for exacerbating the rising cost of living.
They were quick to condemn Trump’s new tariff threat on Saturday.
Democrats on the House Ways and Means Committee accused Trump of “pickpocketing the American people” with his newly announced higher tariff.
“A little over 24 hours after his tariffs were ruled illegal, he’s doing anything he can to make sure he can still jack up your costs,” they wrote on social media.
California Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom, a Trump nemesis, added that “he [Trump] does not care about you”.

Ancient Chinese astrology gets a Gen Z rebrand in Southeast Asia
Forget rituals and superstitions, today’s young professionals are using ‘bazi’ 10-year luck forecasts to plan their next career pivot
Yik Wai Chee doesn’t think of himself as a believer.
Yet for years, he has consulted bazi, the ancient Chinese system of elemental forecasting, as a kind of strategic gut check on his life.
“For me, it is just a long-term ‘luck check’ to see if there are general strategies I can adapt to get through some life challenges,” he said. “If it doesn’t cost me at all to adapt to new strategies, I will try it.”
He is careful not to overstate its influence. Bazi sits closer to tarot in its interpretive vagueness than to any hard forecast, he say. It doesn’t drive his decisions so much as occasionally inform them.
But in a region where young professionals are increasingly confronted with hectic schedules, rising living costs and the relentless pressure to get ahead, even interpretive vagueness has its appeal.
Across Southeast Asia, this ancient practice is finding a distinctly modern second life.

Hong Kong, UAE solidify financial links with deeper regulatory ties, digital assets focus
Transaction volume under Project mBridge surged over 2,500-fold from the early 2022 pilot levels to more than US$55 billion by November 2025
Deeper regulatory ties and a shared push for new growth sectors are expected to give fresh impetus to cross-border investment flows between China and the Middle East, according to industry players and a United Arab Emirates (UAE) regulator.
Hong Kong would benefit from the increased China-Middle East cooperation as the city develops into “a key hub for Middle Eastern capital to deploy in Asia and an important gateway for Chinese capital to go global to the Middle East,” said Linda Cai, inbound and outbound leader and head of China corporate finance at PwC China.
Transaction volume under Project mBridge, which makes settlements more direct and efficient between mainland China, Hong Kong, Thailand, the UAE and Saudi Arabia, surged over 2,500-fold from the early 2022 pilot levels to more than US$55 billion by November 2025, according to the US think tank Atlantic Council. Digital yuan, or e-CNY, accounted for over 95 per cent of the tally.
The January announcement to promote digital yuan’s cross-border payment role would “greatly facilitate bilateral economic and trade activities and personal exchanges”, according to Cai.
Combined with the mBridge project, China and the Middle Eastern countries would have formed a “multilevel financial cooperation framework of ‘currency-fund-digital assets’, laying a foundation for the mutual recognition of more cross-border products, such as exchange-traded funds and green bonds, in the future”, she said.

Tourists love this European paradise, but locals fear for its future
Valletta: Small boats are motoring across the grand harbour of Malta on a winter morning beneath a cloudless sky. The waves are low and the wind is down as the boatmen take their passengers, five or six at a time, across the gleaming blue water.
The only challenge for a tourist is to keep the balance in the traditional boat, known as a dghajsa tal-pass, and watch out for someone leaning out to take a selfie – a shift in weight that can tip the vessel on its side.
The conditions, in other words, are perfect. Malta looks like a nation free of troubles.
But this small part of Europe is showing the strain from years of strong growth, high migration, surging tourism and rapid cultural change. It also has a nagging problem that makes some of its citizens anxious about the future.
“I weep for my country,” says one business owner. He thinks it is too hard to find young Maltese workers to fill jobs, and he does not like the heavy reliance on migrant workers to run basic services.
Growth is good. The economy grew by about 4 per cent last year and is tipped to expand by 3.8 per cent this year, while major European countries drift. The national debt is 47 per cent of economic output; in France it is almost 120 per cent.
However, Kevin Cassar, a professor of surgery at the University of Malta and a regular commentator on national life, believes a shock is looming.
“The truth is that the lifestyles that people enjoy now cannot be sustained into the future unless there are radical changes,” he says.
“And those radical changes, with regards to income, will be painful changes. This is why no political party wants to go down that route.”
“People have become used to a certain quality of life, a certain level of earnings, and yet we have this bizarre situation where people are earning more, but the buying power of that income is significantly reduced.”
Malta is now having an urgent debate about family policies to make it easier for young couples to have children. Anna Borg, a professor at the University of Malta, is arguing for more paternity leave, extended maternity leave and greater action on gender equality.
“This can’t just be a responsibility for mothers. There must be opportunities for men to take an active role in caregiving,” she told The Times of Malta last year.
Housing is a key issue. Property prices have risen by about 75 per cent over the past decade, according to the Central Bank of Malta, and parents worry that their children will not be able to own their own homes.
Incomes are up, so the bank is not alarmed about affordability. The increase in migration, however, is a factor.
“Malta cannot rely indefinitely on population growth to maintain momentum,” the International Monetary Fund said this month. It noted that Malta’s population density was 15 times greater than the EU average and that this put a strain on housing.
From 2000 to 2023, the population grew from 391,000 to 563,000. One policy, a “golden passport” scheme to sell citizenship to foreign investors, rankled with the community and was stopped last year. But the biggest factor was the demand for workers to run essential services.
This means that 28 per cent of the population is of foreign nationality. From hospitals to hotels, the country relies heavily on its new residents.
Tourism keeps the demand strong. Malta hosted just over 4 million tourists last calendar year, up 13 per cent on the previous year. While the migrant intake in Malta is about the same as in Australia as a proportion of the population, the change feels too fast for some.
“It’s been a massive jump in a short space of time,” says Cassar. “So the main problem that we’re facing is the radical change.”
This kind of debate has fuelled the rise of the far-right in countries like Germany, but Malta has two major parties, Labour and the Nationalists, that dominate the parliament. Labour is in power. Cassar has family ties to the Nationalists, but his commentary in The Times of Malta criticises both sides.
Visitors can see how important migration has become. In Valletta, the capital, it is possible to eat at a restaurant serving Maltese food served by waiters from India who work for a manager from Albania and an owner from Malta.
As long as tourism grows, the demand for foreign workers will increase. As their society changes, some Maltese even worry about whether their language will survive in a digital world of artificial intelligence.
“The continuation of the country as a nation depends on the younger people,” says Cassar. “I think the measures that need to be taken need to be quite radical.”
He suggests restrictions on foreign investors buying property, tighter rules on short-term property rentals to tourists, a halt to the rapid migration of recent years and changes to inheritance rules so that grandparents can pass their assets to grandchildren, skipping a generation.
Malta is not alone in facing these challenges. Most countries in Europe are debating their welfare spending, education policies, migration settings and housing supplies. No EU nation has a fertility rate above the replacement rate, generally seen as 2.1 births per woman.
Australia is experiencing some of the same trends. The fertility rate in Australia is 1.5, also below replacement. Parents in Australia worry about housing affordability for their children, just as parents do in Malta.
The pressures, however, seem all the greater on these beautiful islands in the Mediterranean.
Malta is a small but tough nation that has defied conquering armies and navies for centuries. It will have to adapt to these changing times as well.

‘Technically British’: UK visa rule change unleashes confusion for dual citizens
Dual Australian-British citizens are discovering that nearly forgotten family links to the UK and Ireland may prevent them from entering the countries with a cheap online pass and instead require them to take out a foreign passport or certificate costing more than $1000.
The rule change, which could capture thousands of Australians of British parentage who don’t hold UK passports, comes into effect on February 25 has already upended itineraries. It affects anyone who is technically a British or Irish citizen, regardless of whether or not they have taken steps to claim that nationality in practice.
As a result, dual citizens are ineligible for the inexpensive £16 ($30.50) ETA that currently lets them travel to the UK. Instead, they will need a British or Irish passport.
“British citizens, including those who hold dual nationality, are not eligible to apply for an ETA, even if their other nationality (such as Australian) would normally require one,” the British High Commission stated. “This is because British citizens already have the right of abode in the UK.”
Dual citizens also have the option of obtaining a Certificate of Entitlement from the British government for a one-time fee of £589 ($1135), which can be used alongside a non-UK passport to enter the country. The Certificate of Entitlement can be applied for from within the UK or abroad.
The rule change has set off a string of panicked conversations between travel providers and Australians heading to the UK who may be unwitting British citizens by descent.
Lynton Jones, of the Sydney-based travel agency The Savvy Traveller, said he had one customer born in 1943 to a father from the UK who immigrated to Australia in 1913 as a toddler.
The customer “never had, nor thought he could have, nor wanted” a UK passport, Jones said. “Now in his 80s, it would seem that he is technically classed as British by the UK government.”
Over 1.1 million people who were born in the United Kingdom were living in Australia in 2023, which makes it the largest migrant community in Australia, according to ABS figures.
More than 2 million people in Australia have one or both parents born in the UK, according to the 2021 Census.
The UK government warns: “If you or your parents were born in the UK, you might automatically be a British citizen.” Irish-Australian dual citizens are also included the rule change because of the long-standing Common Travel Area which provides reciprocal arrangements and shared travel area between the UK and Ireland.
Although the man successfully applied for his ETA online, Jones noted that “his information is technically wrong”.
“If it was queried, he could be denied entry under the new rules upon arrival, even with his approved ETA in place.” With less than two months until departure, it is not clear what he should do.
“As a travel professional, I don’t want to give him wrong information, especially with the trip costing tens of thousands of dollars,” said Jones.
In another instance, a travel agent had to cancel and rebook a family’s long-awaited UK holiday when the travellers realised too late they required UK passports and could not obtain them in time. The postponement came at “considerable financial and emotional expense,” the Australian Travel Industry Association wrote.
One affected traveller posted on a UK visa forum that they were born in the UK but had lived in Australia for 15 years. They applied for British passports for their two sons at the start of the year but have seen no progress. “It has been nearly a month since any update on our applications after sending them every bit of supporting documentation they need. I’m starting to panic now,” they wrote.
A UK passport — which requires periodic renewal — costs £108 for an online adult application in Australia and £70 for a child, plus a £19.86 courier fee (about $380 all up). A typical four-week turnaround begins once initial documents are received. An Australian adult passport costs $422.
While the change affects 85 countries, it has sparked a firestorm among British and Irish Australians. “I think there is some confusion,” said Anthony Goldman, joint managing director of the Goldman Group, a travel agency focussing on corporate and luxury travel. “Not everyone is going to register the change.”
The changes will also affect Australians with no claim to British citizenship. While ETAs have been used since October 2023, the new rule will see them strictly enforced by British customs effective February 25. The ETA will become mandatory to board a plane for the UK.
Flight Centre notes: “Airlines will be legally required to verify an ETA before allowing travel for short visits, including tourism, business and transit.”
Despite the confusion, bookings remain strong. Flight Centre Corporate data shows bookings in January 2026 are up compared to a year ago. The British government maintains that “the introduction of ETAs is in line with the approach many other countries have taken to border security ... and helps prevent the arrival of those who present a threat to the UK.”
Goldman noted that Australians are generally “used to different visa entry requirements,” citing recent updates to European travel rules. “The difference is that this affects a lot of Australians because they’re British citizens by descent,” he said. “If someone has a father born in the UK 80 years ago, theoretically they will now need a UK passport.”
To clear up the confusion, the government has provided a “Check if you’re a British citizen” webpage, allowing travellers to confirm which documents they need and which queue they should join upon arrival.
Underscoring the complexity of citizenship rules, numerous Australian politicians were ejected from office in 2017-18 because they unwittingly were subjects of other countries. The Constitution requires parliamentarians to only hold Australian citizenship.

‘Unjustified’: Australia rejects Trump’s latest tariff hit
Trade Minister Don Farrell will press the case against US President Donald Trump’s decision to increase the tariff rate on Australian goods from 10 to 15 per cent when he visits the United States this week.
Farrell’s long-planned trip, beginning on Tuesday, has coincided with the aftermath of Trump’s decision to strike back against the Supreme Court’s rejection of his broader tariff regime by imposing a blanket 15 per cent tariff rate on the whole world.
Farrell said in a statement that Australia had “consistently advocated against these unjustified tariffs.”
“Australia believes in free and fair trade,” he said. “We are working closely with our embassy in Washington to assess the implications and examine all options.”
Trump’s late night announcement of the global tariff escalation, following the legal defeat of his first global tariff in a Supreme Court ruling that found the president did not have the power to impose import taxes unilaterally, has not moved past the stage of a social media post on Truth Social.
A second global tariff has not been issued as an executive order.
Farrell will depart on Tuesday for a previously scheduled trade mission to support the G’Day USA tourism event in Los Angeles, where he is expected to also meet with senior US government officials.
Australia had the lowest baseline tariff rate available under Trump’s previous regime at 10 per cent, though the administration had also negotiated varying deals on different types of imports with a range of countries.
Innes Willox, chief executive of industry representative group AiG, said the tariffs would have mixed consequences for Australian businesses.
“Some will get an immediate advantage, others will miss out, depending on how they trade and who they compete with,” Willox said. “But one experience will be universal, and that is dealing with the consequences of the uncertainty, which is cruelling investment, delaying purchasing decisions and creating unnecessary red tape.
“Almost 20 years ago, the top 20 economies came together to collectively respond to the Global Financial Crisis. The US is host of the G20 this year, and the rules-based trading system needs to be on the agenda. Businesses’ capacity to endure this kind of economic volatility is diminishing.”
CSL, one of Australia’s largest exporters to the United States, was contacted for comment, as were several mining and metal manufacturing companies.
More to come.

158 giant tortoises reintroduced to Galapagos island after more than a century

QUITO – More than 150 giant tortoises have been reintroduced to Floreana Island in Ecuador’s famed Galapagos archipelago where they disappeared more than a century ago, the Environment Ministry said on Feb 20.
Park rangers carried large crates containing the 158 tortoises on their backs, hiking 7km across volcanic terrain and hard-to-access areas before releasing them, the ministry said in a statement.
“For the first time in over a century, Floreana is once again home to giant tortoises, a species that plays a strategic role as ecosystem engineers: seed dispersers, vegetation regulators and promoters of natural habitat regeneration,” it said.
The Galapagos Islands, a World Heritage Site, are situated some 1,000km off the coast of Ecuador. They are famous for their unique flora and fauna and are where British scientist Charles Darwin developed his theory of evolution.
An NGO, Island Conservation, said it was the first time that giant tortoises have walked on Floreana since the native species, Chelonoidis niger niger, was driven to extinction there in the mid-1800s after the introduction of invasive mammals.
There are 13 living species of Galapagos tortoises on other islands in the archipelago, according to National Geographic. They can weigh more than 250kg. The oldest on record lived to be 175 years old.
The Ecuadoran ministry said the released tortoises come from a breeding centre of the Galapagos National Park, where a specialised programme was developed using tortoises with a high genetic load of the island’s endemic species that was found on Isabela island, which lies about 180km from Floreana.
Each tortoise underwent an extensive quarantine and was microchipped for identification before its release.
For a decade, researchers have been working to reintroduce 12 other endemic species to Floreana as part of a rewilding programme.
Floreana, covering 173 sq km, was the first to be inhabited by humans in the entire archipelago. AFP

Tehranis brace for ‘inevitable’ US-Iran war: ‘I am getting more scared’
‘I don’t want war to happen, but one should not fool around with the realities on the ground,’ a resident in the Iranian capital says
Tehran resident Hamid struggles to sleep as fears of renewed conflict haunt the Iranian capital after last year’s 12-day war with Israel.
“I don’t sleep well at night even while taking pills,” Hamid said, as he expressed concern for his “family’s health … my kids and grandchildren”.
The city woke up to blasts overnight from June 12 to 13 last year as Iran’s arch-enemy Israel launched an unprecedented military campaign.
The war erupted as Iran was preparing for another round of talks with the United States, which briefly joined Israel in attacking major Iranian nuclear sites.
The attacks prompted Iran to respond with drone and missile strikes, with thousands of people killed in Iran and dozens in Israel.
Iran has now resumed talks with Washington, with Iran insisting they be limited to the nuclear issue, though Washington has previously pushed for Tehran’s ballistic missiles programme and support for armed groups in the region to be on the table.

Investments expert explains ‘three pot’ method for building savings
As the new tax year approaches in April, some people may be considering starting a new habit to build a pot of cash.
- Bookmark
Some people who are considering starting a new savings habit or building on an existing one as the new tax year approaches in April may be able to get a clearer idea of their savings goals by grouping them into separate “pots”, according to an investments expert.
Lucy Smith, an investment manger at Killik & Co, said that a “helpful” way to consider structuring savings can be to consider building an emergency pot of cash that can be accessed easily if needed.
Some people may want to aim to build up at least three months’ worth of spending in it, depending on their own circumstances and what they feel comfortable with, she said.
A “planned spend” fund could be a second pot, with money put by for foreseeable goals in the next few years, such as a home purchase, a big holiday or any other life expense.
Longer-term “lifetime” savings that will not be needed for around five years or more could be put into a third pot, Ms Smith suggested.
She said: “This is your pot of money where investing can play a key role as you can benefit from compounding over time since it is not money that you will need over the next few years.”
Ms Smith also said a consistent approach can help with building a savings habit.
She said: “One of the simplest ‘set and forget’ behaviours is using your Isa allowance regularly.”
Some savers might feel comfortable gradually moving from a cash Isa towards a stocks and shares Isa over time, she said.
Investments may potentially grow more strongly than savings held in cash over time. But the value of stocks and shares can go down as well as up, so people may want to consider the risk level they feel comfortable with.
Ms Smith said of the potential for funds to fall in value: “It’s worth considering whether this is something that would keep you up at night or if you would see it as a buying opportunity – and what you’d do if markets fell further.”

Staying diversified when investing and avoiding “putting all your eggs in one basket”, may be a useful goal, she said.
Ms Smith added that some people may want to get financial advice.
The Government-backed MoneyHelper website also has tips and tools to help people build savings.
Ms Smith said: “The type of investment habit you build can also be adapted by life stages, such as buying a home, starting a family or approaching retirement.”
She said of building wealth: “It’s about developing good habits over time.”

Ofgem price cap – what is happening to my energy bill?

Ofgem price cap – what is happening to my energy bill?
Changes following a promised £150 average cut to domestic bills mean households should become familiar with how much they pay per unit of energy.
- Bookmark
Latest predictions suggest Ofgem will reduce the energy price cap by £117 to £1,641 a year for a typical dual fuel household from April 1 when it makes its announcement on Wednesday.
– What is Ofgem’s price cap?
The energy price cap sets a maximum price that suppliers can charge customers in England, Scotland and Wales for each unit of gas and electricity they use.
It also sets a maximum daily standing charge – the cost of having your home connected to the grid.
The headline price cap figure provided by Ofgem indicates what a household using gas and electricity, and paying by direct debit, can expect to pay if their energy consumption is typical.
It is important to note that it does not limit a home’s total bills because people still pay for the amount of energy they use – so if it is above the average they will pay more, and if it is below they will pay less.
Energy is regulated separately in Northern Ireland.
– What’s changing with my energy bill this time?
The next price cap, which will take effect from April 1, will be the first to reflect Chancellor Rachel Reeves’ promise last November that £150 would be cut from the average household bill.
She is achieving this by shifting 75% of the Renewables Obligation (RO) costs from household energy bills into general taxation, and scrapping the Energy Company Obligation (Eco) scheme introduced by the Tories in government which was funded by bills and designed to tackle fuel poverty by improving housing conditions, but which has been beset with delivery problems.
This will mainly translate through to customer bills by a cut to households’ electricity unit rates, with an expected reduction of around 3.37p per kilowatt hour (kWh) from the previous quarter.
– Why won’t I see a £150 discount on my bill?
The discount will be applied via a lower unit rate rather than a one-off amount.
It should also be stressed that the £150 figure is an average, and amounts will vary based on the size and type of household and how much energy they use.
Also, industry analysts Cornwall Insight have said the changes are likely to reduce the cap by about £145 a year once VAT and other pricing allowances are taken into account.
It added that increases in costs associated with the operation and maintenance of gas and electricity networks, which are paid for from customer bills, have offset part of these savings.
– Do I need to do anything?
Households should look out for information arriving from their suppliers after the price cut is announced, particularly around the rates they pay for each unit of gas and electricity.
This information will be important for those considering switching away from the price cap to a cheaper fixed tariff, and those looking for a new fixed tariff, as comparing unit prices is key to finding a good deal.
– Is now a good time to switch?
It is always worth investigating fixed deals, taking into account any length-of-time obligations that could result in exit fees.
As a rule of thumb, Which? recommends looking for deals cheaper than the price cap (this is where comparing gas and electricity unit rates is important, rather than looking at headline figures), not longer than 12 months and without significant exit fees.
However, the End Fuel Poverty Coalition said it understood that some fixed tariffs will include announced cuts from February 25, and some will not.
It warned that this could make switching and fixing – that is already confusing – “even more difficult to gauge”.
It said households may prefer to wait for the dust to settle on Wednesday’s announcement before signing up to a fixed term deal or changing supplier.
– Are prices going to keep going down, or should we expect increases in the future?
Cornwall Insight currently expects the price cap to remain relatively steady throughout 2026, with a small fall forecast in July.
However, it said these predictions may shift as wholesale markets change and potential policy cost announcements happen.

Households set for lower energy bills amid price cap shake-up
Chancellor Rachel Reeves said last November that £150 would be cut from the average household bill from April.
- Bookmark
Households are set to learn their energy bills will fall by around 7% from April in a shake-up of costs after the Government promised they will receive an average £150 cut.
Latest predictions suggest Ofgem will reduce the energy price cap by £117 to £1,641 a year for a typical dual fuel household from April 1 when it makes its announcement on Wednesday.
Chancellor Rachel Reeves said in November that £150 would be cut from the average household bill from April by scrapping the Energy Company Obligation (Eco) scheme introduced by the Tories in government.
Customers have been warned not to expect a straight £150 discount on their bills, and that the cut will depend on the size and type of household and how much energy it uses.
The reduction is expected to be primarily applied through a lower price per unit of electricity used, with households advised to look out for information from their supplier explaining this after the price cap announcement.
Cornwall Insight said the changes will reduce the cap by about £145 a year once VAT and pricing allowances within the cap methodology are taken into account.
It added that increases in charges associated with the operation and maintenance of Britain’s energy networks have offset part of the savings.
Wholesale prices had also risen slightly since its last forecast in December, with the cost of gas particularly volatile due to “geopolitical factors”.
Looking further ahead, Cornwall said wholesale costs were still lower than when Ofgem set the January cap level and it expected the cap to remain “relatively steady” throughout 2026, “with only a small rise forecast in July”.
Ned Hammond, deputy director of customer policy at Energy UK, which represents firms, said: “At a time when many households are struggling with their bills, action taken by the Government to provide a considerable discount on energy bills is hugely welcome.
“While the saving will be £150 for the average household, it is important to note that the discount is applied to the unit rate. Therefore, households will experience significantly different savings depending on their energy consumption, some much higher and others substantially lower than £150.
“In addition, other moving parts, such as network charges and wholesale costs, mean energy bills will not necessarily fall in line with the saving provided. Indeed, the price cap is projected to drop by around £115 from 1 April.”
Which? energy editor Emily Seymour said: “Households can expect a significant cut to their energy bills in April, which will come as a relief to millions of people struggling with cost-of-living pressures.
“The bulk of this change is expected to be applied to your electricity price per unit, so your exact savings will depend on your usage; look out for communications from your energy provider in the coming weeks to see how it will affect your bills.”
Simon Francis, co-ordinator of the End Fuel Poverty Coalition, urged households to note the changes in unit costs and standing charges, rather than focus on the headline “average energy bill”.
He said: “We know that energy bills can be confusing and trying to decide when to switch tariffs or change supplier is a big decision which can overwhelm people.
“As well as setting the price cap, Ofgem should play a greater role in ensuring that the tariffs reaching the market are fair and don’t discriminate against specific customer groups.
“Sadly the responsibility currently falls to households to pay careful attention to any changes in their unit costs and standing charges.”

Man charged with driving forklift through Perth shopping centre, attempting to steal ATM
A Perth man who stole a forklift and drove it through a local shopping centre in a bid to steal an ATM has been charged with dozens offences.
Detectives from Mirrabooka and Joondalup said on Sunday they had jointly charged the man after finding him allegedly responsible for a number of incidents in Balcatta and Greenwood earlier this month.
Police said detectives from both districts realised they were looking for the same man after he broke into a shopping centre on Calectasia Street in Greenwood on February 11.
It is alleged he used power tools to break in to an ATM, and stole a “large sum of money”.
Five days later, police say he stole a forklift from a Balcatta business before he drove it to Centuria Northlands on Wanneroo Road.
It is alleged he drove through the centre and tried to remove an ATM, but was ultimately unsuccessful. There was significant damage to both the shopping centre and the teller machine.
Police said they worked together and soon determined the same man was wanted over both of the incidents, and they executed a search warrant at a home in Alexander Heights this week.
The man was staying at the property and he was arrested, and a search of the house found an allegedly stolen truck, drugs and cash.
“Further inquiries identified the truck had been stolen from a business in Balcatta in early January 2026
and had been used in a series of commercial burglary offences,” a WA police spokesperson said.
The 52-year-old man has been charged with more than a dozen offences, including drug possession, aggravated burglary and theft.
WA police metropolitan assistant commissioner Martin Haime said the arrest showed good work by the detectives involved.
“If you choose to offend, understand this clearly: our squads work together, we share intelligence, and we will find you,” he said.
“If you target our community, expect to be caught.”

Migraine is more than just a headache. A neurologist explains the four stages

Migraine is more than just a headache. A neurologist explains the four stages
A migraine attack is not just a "bad headache".
Migraine is a debilitating neurological condition that can cause nausea, vomiting, and sensitivity to light or sound, in addition to severe headaches.
Migraine affects roughly five million Australians, but few people understand the different stages of a migraine attack.
Knowing the four distinct phases can help you recognise the symptoms and manage pain at each stage.
Phase 1: Premonitory
The first phase of migraine development is the "premonitory" or "prodrome" phase. It functions like a warning period, which begins 24 to 48 hours before a migraine attack fully sets in.
The premonitory phase has a lot to do with the hypothalamus. The hypothalamus is the part of the brain that regulates key functions such as body temperature, appetite, mood and sleep.
When a person experiences a migraine attack, their hypothalamus becomes abnormally activated. The hypothalamus is connected to other parts of the brain with different functions, so this abnormal activation can also disrupt how those parts function.
This can lead to symptoms such as poor concentration, food cravings, irritability and insomnia. If you notice these early signs, you're more likely to "catch" the start of a migraine attack and be able to treat it early.
Phase 2: Aura
The second phase of a migraine attack is called "aura". Aura refers to various neurological symptoms that affect your vision, speech or ability to feel sensations. Visual auras, which mainly affect your vision, are the most common kind.
Visual aura symptoms can include seeing flashing lights, swirling shapes or blind spots. A sensory aura can lead to numbness or tingling in your face or limbs. In severe cases, people may even have trouble speaking.
Research suggests a process called cortical spreading depression contributes to aura symptoms. During this process, a wave of electrical activity spreads very slowly through the brain and can impact how certain brain regions function.
Only 30 per cent of people experience migraine with aura.
Phase 3: Headache
The third phase of a migraine attack is the headache. This is when people typically experience a throbbing or pulsating headache, alongside other symptoms like nausea and sensitivity to light and sound.
This phase usually lasts between four and 72 hours if untreated.
When different brain networks become activated during a migraine attack, other symptoms can develop in addition to headache.
When the medulla or "vomit centre" of the brain is abnormally activated, it can lead to nausea and vomiting.
The trigeminal nerve, the nerve, which allows you to feel sensations on your face, can also become abnormally activated. This causes the release of chemicals that may be perceived by the brain as pain.
One of these chemicals is a protein called calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). Some injectable types of migraine medication block this protein to reduce pain.
Phase 4: Postdrome
The fourth and final phase is the "postdrome". It is also known as the "migraine hangover".
During this recovery phase, your brain is working hard to return to its normal functioning. That is why you may feel even more fatigued or have difficulty concentrating after a migraine attack.
So, how can I manage a migraine attack?
It helps to know the symptoms and stages of migraine development.
If you have predictable symptoms, particularly during the premonitory phase, it's best to carry pain medications or anti-nausea tablets with you. That way you can treat early symptoms as soon as they arise. It can also be a sign to rest, ideally before the headache phase sets in.
In the aura phase, taking migraine-specific pain medications such as triptans, aspirin or anti-inflammatory pain killers may stop the headache phase from starting.
If you have more than four migraine attacks each month, you may also consider taking preventive medications. These are usually daily tablets that help control the baseline level of head pain you experience. Injectable options are also available.
Finally, don't ignore the postdrome phase. If you push yourself too hard during this recovery period, you may experience overlapping migraine attacks. This is when one migraine attack starts before the last one resolves itself. Overlapping migraine attacks are much harder to treat.
You may also experience other symptoms related to the migraine attack. These can include dizziness, neck pain, or ringing in the ears. If you have any of these additional symptoms, you should consult your neurologist to check they are not caused by a more serious underlying condition.
And if you are a woman who experiences migraine with aura, speak to your doctor before starting hormone-based contraception. This is because you may need different treatment to someone who does not experience aura symptoms.
By understanding the different phases and symptoms of migraine, you will be better equipped to tackle any future attacks.

Now that the third branch of the US government has explained to the second branch that the first branch matters, President Donald Trump is in a pickle.
He may need a distraction even bigger than bombing Iran and releasing secret files on UFOs and aliens. He may need to produce Marvin the Martian for an Oval Office meeting and install him on the “Board of Peace”. (Maybe it should be spelled “Bored of Peace,” since Trump seems itchy to attack Iran, and security guards protecting the Azerbaijani president, who’s on the board, were apparently beating up protesters outside the Waldorf Astoria Hotel in Washington.)
Friday was a landmark day in the Trump reign. It was refreshing to finally see someone tell this petulant man-child: “No, you can’t do that!” And it was especially refreshing that the Supreme Court, which has been awash in its own ethics crises and acting subservient to the megalomaniac in the White House, suddenly found a spine.
The highest court firmly instructed the Emperor of Chaos on why his tariffs were unconstitutional without the blessing of Congress. And the president responded in the way he always does when he doesn’t get his way: with a Regina George hissy fit.
In a news conference on Friday afternoon, with the lights dimmed to be more flattering, Trump made clear that he was “absolutely ashamed” of Chief Justice John Roberts, Justice Amy Coney Barrett, Justice Neil Gorsuch and their three brethren-sisters on the left who shut down his erratic, perverse — sometimes personally vindictive — tariff antics.
Trump railed that the court’s liberals were “a disgrace to our nation” and that the conservatives who joined the majority opinion were merely “fools and lapdogs for the RINOs (Republicans in name only) and the radical left.” He whined that the majority did not have “the courage to do what’s right for our country.” The man who expects fealty singled out two of his picks, Gorsuch and Barrett, calling their decision “an embarrassment to their families”.
As usual, Trump absurdly conflated what he wants with what’s best for the country. And as usual, he projected, charging that the justices who blocked his tariffs were “unpatriotic and disloyal to our Constitution” — and controlled by foreign interests. Actually, that critique is probably more applicable to the president, not the Supreme Court justices who put the brakes on Trump’s mad careening.
And Trump was barking up the wrong tree on lapdogs. Until now, Justices Roberts, Gorsuch and Barrett have been lapdogs for Trump, helping to upend Roe, giving him immunity for nearly all official acts, weakening the Voting Rights Act, letting DOGE get its grimy little hands on private data and allowing Elon Musk’s backpack wolf pack to slash the federal workforce.
The Constitution is vague on so much, and that has allowed Trump to shimmy through wormholes and do things we assumed he would be barred from doing — like tearing down the East Wing without checking with anyone and letting foreign oligarchs enrich him, his family and his cronies. But the Constitution is clear on tariffs: They are the purview of Congress.
Trump has called tariffs “the most beautiful word to me in the dictionary.” And having his toy yanked away — even for the time it took him to figure out some other ploy to punish countries — brought out his fiendish side. After his unhinged news conference, he let fly a couple of long, unhinged Truth Social posts.
No sooner did moderate Republicans exhale, because they would no longer have to defend Trump’s mercurial tariff scheme — essentially a tax on consumers — than the president signed an executive order on Friday night invoking the Trade Act of 1974, imposing a “Global 10% Tariff on all Countries.” (On Saturday morning, he said he was upping it to 15 per cent.) He had crowed earlier at the news conference that he can not only destroy the trade of any country but also “can destroy the country”.
“I’m allowed to destroy the country,” he pouted to reporters, “but I can’t charge them a little fee.”
With Trump’s power grabs, the court finally provided some accountability. Meanwhile, the awful wait to assign blame in the Jeffrey Epstein case, involving powerless young women, continues. The only real justice so far, in this lurid saga of bad, bad men from all around the globe, is that a predatory woman is in jail.
Sure, Les Wexner, the former Victoria’s Secret’s mogul who gave Epstein power of attorney over his vast fortune, was deposed by the House Oversight Committee this past week. But he played Mr Magoo, crying that Epstein had “conned” him. It was totally unbelievable. Clearly, Wexner was infatuated with Epstein and enabled the monster to acquire the private plane and private island that lured so many famous people into his web.
King Charles, too, gave us a rare blast of accountability this past week. He didn’t stand in the way when British police arrested his brother, the former Prince Andrew, for reportedly passing confidential information to Epstein. It was gratifying to see the stunned, slack look on Andrew’s face as police took him away from his mansion in Norfolk. He is still, however, dodging accusations that he committed sex crimes.
Trump has been madly deflecting from his friendship with Epstein, acting as though he barely knew him, even though it’s clear that hound recognised hound. Trump, Melania, Mar-a-Lago and other related words or phrases are mentioned over 38,000 times in the Epstein files.
And now, the president will also have to distract from his humiliation at being slapped back by a conservative Supreme Court. He’s no doubt going to spend the weekend rewriting his State of the Union address and thinking of more nasty jibes for the justices who choked his leash.
And who knows? We may even see Marvin the Martian show up in the Oval, carrying a cookbook titled How to Serve Man.

US govt probes Netflix’s power over filmmakers in Warner deal review
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
WASHINGTON – The US Justice Department’s (DOJ) investigation of Netflix’s proposed US$72 billion (S$91.1 billion) takeover of Warner Bros.
Discovery includes scrutiny of the streaming giant’s behavior and whether it wields anticompetitive leverage over creators in negotiations for acquiring programming.
The department is seeking to determine whether the deal “may substantially lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly in violation of Section 7 of the Clayton Act or Section 2 of the Sherman Act”, according to a copy of a civil investigative demand reviewed by Bloomberg News that was sent on Feb 20. It went to an independent movie studio, according to people familiar with the matter.
The language in the demand, an administrative subpoena that has not been previously reported, is the clearest sign yet that the Trump administration is going beyond a standard deal review as it investigates the merger, refuting an argument by Netflix in recent weeks that the government is not engaged in anything beyond the typical process.
The broad scope of the review is also a strong indication that it will take many more months before the government decides whether to challenge the Netflix-Warner Bros. deal in court – a delay that may benefit rival bidder Paramount Skydance.
“Netflix operates in an extremely competitive market. Any claim that it is a monopolist, or seeking to monopolise, is unfounded,” Netflix Chief Legal Officer David Hyman said in a statement. “We neither hold monopoly power nor engage in exclusionary conduct and we’ll gladly cooperate, as we always do, with regulators on any concerns they may have.”
The application of both laws has precedent, and the investigation may not result in any federal action. But deal reviews are typically conducted by US antitrust enforcers using just the Clayton Act, which is specifically for merger investigations. The Sherman Act is a statute more typically used to target illegal monopolization by a single company such as Alphabet’s Google, Live Nation Entertainment and Visa.
The DOJ is asking questions about Netflix’s ability to leverage its market power in negotiations with independent content creators such movie studios and filmmakers, according to the people. Netflix operates the largest paid video streaming service in the world and is one of the largest buyers of film and TV programming in the world.
Netflix is spending about US$20 billion on programming in 2026, which is split between original series and licensed reruns. Many of its most popular original programs, including Wednesday and Nobody Wants This, are produced by third-party studios. In buying HBO and Warner Bros., Netflix would acquire one of the largest studios as well as a major competitor in streaming.
The Wall Street Journal first reported that the DOJ’s review includes Netflix’s business practices and whether the deal would give the streaming giant monopoly power in the future.
“We have not been given any notice or seen any other sign that the DOJ is conducting a monopoliaation investigation,” Mr Steve Sunshine, head of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP’s global antitrust/competition group representing Netflix, said in a statement.
The Justice Department did not immediately respond to request for comment outside of normal business hours. Warner Bros. declined to comment.
Monopoly cases can require market concentration of more than 50 per cent, a number that exceeds Netflix’s share with or without Warner Bros. Netflix accounts for about 9 per cent of TV viewing in the US and a larger share of the streaming market, and its spending on programming is comparable to peers such as Disney and Comcast.
Warner Bros. earlier this week committed to resume talks with Paramount after a representative of the company indicated a willingness to raise its offer price by US$1 per share to US$31. Warner Bros. has given Paramount a deadline of Feb 23 to submit its “best and final” offer.
Paramount, which launched a hostile bid for Warner Bros.
However, the offer could still be slowed down by an ongoing review in the EU, and US enforcers in the past have sued to block deals that they had initially waved through. Paramount could also face a gauntlet of US state attorneys general. BLOOMBERG

Arab, Muslim countries slam US ambassador's Israel remarks
Arab and Islamic countries issued a joint condemnation on Sunday of remarks by US ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee, who suggested Israel had a biblical right to a vast swath of the Middle East.
Huckabee, a former Baptist minister and a fervent Israel supporter, was speaking on the podcast of right-wing political commentator and Israel critic Tucker Carlson.
In an episode released Friday, Carlson pushed Huckabee on the meaning of a biblical verse sometimes interpreted as saying that Israel is entitled to the land between the river Nile in Egypt and the Euphrates in Syria and Iraq.
In response, Huckabee said: "It would be fine if they took it all."
When pressed, however, he continued that Israel was "not asking to take all of that", adding: "It was somewhat of a hyperbolic statement."
The backlash widened sharply on Sunday as more than a dozen Arab and Islamic governments - alongside three major regional organisations - issued a joint statement denouncing the US diplomat's comments as "dangerous and inflammatory".
The statement, released by the United Arab Emirates' foreign ministry, was signed by the UAE, Egypt, Jordan, Indonesia, Pakistan, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Kuwait, Oman, Bahrain, Lebanon, Syria and the State of Palestine, as well as the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, the Arab League and the Gulf Cooperation Council.
They said the comments contravene the UN Charter and efforts to de-escalate the Gaza war and advance a political horizon for a comprehensive settlement.
Earlier, several Arab states had issued unilateral condemnations.
Saudi Arabia described the ambassador's words as "reckless" and "irresponsible", while Jordan said it was "an assault on the sovereignty of the countries of the region".
Kuwait decried what it called a "flagrant violation of the principles of international law", while Oman said the comments "threatened the prospects for peace" and stability in the region.
Egypt's foreign ministry reaffirmed "that Israel has no sovereignty over the occupied Palestinian territory or any other Arab lands".
The Palestinian Authority said on X that Huckabee's words "contradict US President Donald Trump's rejection of (Israel) annexing the West Bank".
On Saturday, Huckabee published two posts on X further clarifying his position on other topics touched upon in the interview, but did not address his remark about the biblical verse.
The speaker of the Israeli parliament, Amir Ohana, praised Huckabee on X for his general pro-Israel stance in the interview, and accused Carlson of "falsehoods and manipulations".
Carlson has recently found himself facing accusations of antisemitism, particularly following a lengthy, uncritical interview with self-described white nationalist Nick Fuentes - a figure who has praised Hitler, denied the Holocaust and branded American Jews as disloyal.

Berlin International Film Festival winners blast Israel in award speeches, ignore Iran

The 76th Berlinale, the Berlin International Film Festival, which opened with a press conference in which the International Jury, headed by master director Wim Wenders, was blasted for refusing to condemn Israel, ended Saturday night with an awards ceremony in which multiple winners had harsh words about the war in Gaza.
Abdallah Al-Khatib, who won the Best Feature Debut prize for his film Chronicles From the Siege, criticized the German government, saying it was complicit in Israel’s conduct in the war against Hamas.
“People have told me to be careful… but I don’t care,” he said. “You are partners in the genocide of Gaza by Israel, but you choose not to care. Free Palestine from now until the end of the world.”
He went on to say, “I’m happy to be here to get this prize, but I’m Palestinian, so I have to use this moment to speak about Palestine. I was under a lot of pressure to participate in the Berlinale for one reason only, to stand here and say that Palestinians will be free and one day, we will have a great film festival in the middle of Gaza, in the middle of other Palestinian cities… Our festival will stand in solidarity with the people living under siege, under occupation and under dictatorships around the world. We will speak about politics before cinema. We will speak about resistance before art, about freedom before beauty, and about a human being before culture, the long-awaited day is coming.”
Given the persecution of the LGBT community in Gaza, though, it is hard to imagine the film festival Al-Khatib envisioned welcoming such movies as What Will I Become?, a movie that explores “the vulnerability of their transmasculine community” and that won the Amnesty International Award at the Berlinale.
Co-director Logan Rozos said, accepting the award, “Thank you to trans women all over the world for being the model and the blueprint for how to destabilize the patriarchy.” It would seem that the “long-awaited day” that a film like Rozos’s will be shown in Gaza will not be coming anytime soon.
Few film festival winners mention Iran
Not surprisingly, many fewer prizewinners chose to criticize the Iranian government, where numerous filmmakers have been arrested, harassed, and killed in recent weeks as they took part in recent demonstrations against the regime.
Among the few who did mention Iran was Emin Alper, whose movie, Salvation, set in the Kurdish region of Turkey, won the Grand Jury Prize. In his acceptance speech, he spoke about, “People in Iran suffering under the most terrible tyranny,” and also about “the genocide in Palestine.”
The movie that won the Golden Bear, the festival’s highest profile award, was German-Turkish filmmaker İlker Çatak's Yellow Letters, about a playwright and actress engaged in political theater in Turkey who find themselves targeted by the state.
At the awards ceremony, Wenders addressed the controversy sparked by his refusal to speak out politically at the beginning of the festival, by saying, “The language of cinema is empathetic, the language of social cinema is effective. The dignity and protection of human life - these are our causes as well. You do necessary and courageous work, but does it need to be in competition with ours? Do our voices need to clash?”
The Berlinale’s director, Tricia Tuttle, also brought up the issue at the awards ceremony, saying, “Criticism and speaking up is part of democracy, and so is disagreement. If this Berlinale has been emotionally charged, that’s not a failure of the Berlinale, and it’s not a failure of cinema. That’s the Berlinale doing its job, and that’s cinema doing its job.”

China may be in work on development of nuclear weapons’ new generation — CNN

NEW YORK, February 22. /TASS/. US intelligence agencies believe that China is developing a new generation of nuclear weapons and has already conducted at least one test as part of the process to upgrade its nuclear arsenal, CNN reported citing its unnamed sources.
According to the sources, granted investments in the nuclear arsenal will enable China to be allegedly able to have technical capabilities that none of the dominant nuclear powers currently possess.
"China secretly conducted an explosive nuclear test in June 2020 at the Lop Nur facility, in the country’s northwest - despite a self-imposed moratorium on such activity that has been in place since 1996 - and was planning to do more in the future, according to the sources and recent statements from US officials," CNN stated in its report.
"Evidence collected as part of a subsequent review of the June 2020 event, has led US officials to conclude the test was motivated by China’s pursuit of next-generation nuclear weapons," the US-based broadcaster continued citing sources familiar with the situation.
"That includes efforts to develop additional weapons systems capable of delivering multiple, miniaturized nuclear warheads from a single missile… China also appears to be developing low-yield, tactical nuclear weapons - something the country has never previously produced…," CNN added.
Earlier, Russian envoy to international organizations in Vienna Mikhail Ulyanov pointed out at his meeting with CTBTO (Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization) Executive Secretary Robert Floyd that US attempts to accuse China of conducting nuclear tests are groundless.

Huckabee fires back at Tucker Carlson after interview descends into Israel-smearing

US Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee responded to conservative commentator Tucker Carlson in a series of posts on X/Twitter, after an interview at Ben-Gurion airport on Wednesday resulted in several unverified claims and assertions made by Carlson to discredit Israel.
"If Tucker was really a 'journalist,' he could have found out what I easily did later," Huckabee stated on Friday evening in response to one claim by Carlson that Israel had sheltered accused sex offender Tom Alexandrovich.
Carlson used Alexandrovich as an example of what he claimed were “dozens and dozens” of accused sex offenders in the United States who had fled to Israel. Huckabee, however, accused Carlson of intentionally misleading the public on the issue.
According to Huckabee's post, Alexandrovich, an Israeli citizen, had not violated any court orders by returning to Israel after his arrest in Nevada in August 2025 - he had been released on bail, and appeared before the court as scheduled via Zoom, pleading not guilty.
"Tucker's question wasn't because he was concerned about a child being solicited for sex," Huckabee accused, "He was playing 'gotcha.'"
Carlson also claimed that President Isaac Herzog had visited Epstein Island and challenged the ambassador to check for himself. Huckabee refuted Carlson's claims, adding that, "Tucker may need to talk to his lawyers. Libel & defamation of a good & honorable man is reckless."
In a video posted on X/Twitter in the early hours of Sunday morning, Carlson backtracked his claims about Herzog, stating that he had received a letter from the president's office claiming unequivocally that Herzog had never had any interaction with Epstein. Carlson issued a formal apology for stating otherwise and admitted to having acted without concrete information on the accusation.
Huckabee also reacted to a conversation the two had over the meaning of Zionism, describing the discussion as "very twisty and frankly confusing."
Carlson, Huckabee said, insisted on inserting topics which "have nothing to do with theology and certainly not with Israel, Zionism, or anything else." In his response on X/Twitter, Huckabee provided Carlson with what he believed to be a straightforward definition of Zionism: "Zionism is the belief that Israel has a right to exist in safety and security."
"Why can't you just say that?" Huckabee asked Carlson, claiming that he'd asked the commentator the question several times during the interview without receiving a clear answer. "You refused to say whether or not Israel has a right to exist. I hope you will state your answer to that simple question soon."
Huckabee accuses Carlson of spreading antisemitic conspiracy theories
Huckabee accused Carlson of muddying the waters of their conversation with the so-called "Khazar theory" of modern Jewish origin, a debunked idea that claims that most Ashkenazi Jews today trace their lineage to the population of Khazaria.
"This odious conspiracy theory is peddled by the likes of Candace Owens and Nick Fuentes and by people who love David Duke," Huckabee stated, "as well as Islamist accounts that make up false smears about Israel non-stop and are run out of countries like Pakistan and Turkey."
Huckabee also commented on Carlson's history of interviewing Nazis, saying, "I was expecting a thoughtful conversation and that he would ask questions and give me the opportunity to actually respond - just like he did with the little Nazi sympathizer Nick Fuentes or the guy who thought Hitler was the good guy and Churchill the bad guy."

Crutches in hand and her left foot in a brace, Chloé Harrouche, founder and artistic director of Loulou de Saison, quickly brushed aside the inconvenience when she met M Le magazine du Monde a few days before Christmas at her women's ready-to-wear brand's headquarters.
With its majestic wrought-iron staircase, herringbone parquet flooring, moldings, tasteful furniture and bright spaces, the Parisian offices where she set up her design studio in July 2024 reflect the style of the clothes she designs; elegant and minimalist. Still, they are far from austere, despite what the succession of black, white or gray pieces lined up in the showroom might suggest.
Before making its way into wardrobes, Loulou de Saison was the name of an Instagram account like hundreds of others. The page was run by a young Parisian passionate about fashion, showcasing her sense of style. But unlike many influencers who try, often unsuccessfully, to turn their dream into reality – namely, designing a wardrobe and building a lasting brand – Harrouche appears to have achieved her goal.

Australia denies it is working to repatriate Islamic State family members

Australia's center-left government on Sunday rejected a local media report that said it was working to repatriate Australians in a Syrian camp holding families of suspected Islamic State terrorists.
The 34 women and children were released on Monday from the camp in northern Syria, but returned to the detention center due to technical reasons. The group is expected to travel to Damascus before eventually returning to Australia, despite objections from ruling and opposition lawmakers.
On Sunday, Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke rejected claims made in a report in the Sunday Telegraph, asserting that official preparations were under way for the cohort’s return.
"In that report, it makes a claim that we are conducting a repatriation. We are not," Burke told Australian Broadcasting Corp television.
"It claims we have been meeting with the states for the purposes of a repatriation. We have not," Burke added.
Albanese says government will not help Islamic State family return to Australia
Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, who leads Australia's Labor Party, said this week his government would not help the group return to Australia.
The return of relatives of suspected IS terrorists is a political issue in Australia, which has seen a surge in popularity of the right-wing, anti-immigration One Nation party led by Pauline Hanson.
Islamic State, the Sunni Muslim terrorist group, is listed as a terrorist organization in Australia, with membership of the group punishable by up to 25 years in prison. Australia also has the power to strip dual nationals of citizenship if they are an Islamic State member.

Market hall, light rail and cable cars: How the City of Perth could shed the “dull” tag
A new report to be presented to Perth city council recommends making the central business district home to light rail, a market hall, more bikes lanes and introducing a cable car to bring tourists down from Kings Park.
The report Shaping Perth city centre: towards 2036 and beyond was developed by urban design and strategy firm Ghel throughout last year and will come before council on Tuesday for consideration.
It highlighted a number of challenges currently being dealt with by the city - including its well known “dull” moniker.
“Many Perthlings still view it as quiet and dull and this study aims to change that, creating a city centre that is lively, exciting, and the most attractive place to live, work, and visit in the metropolitan area,” the report said.
It found there had been a 390 per cent growth in the City of Perth’s residential population between 2009 and 2023, with the number expected to climb after Edith Cowan University opened its city-based campus this year.
“Despite recent growth in the number of people calling the city centre home, residential density remains relatively low compared to other Australian cities,” the report said.
“This lack of a critical mass of residents combined with changing retail trends means the 24/7 energy expected from a city centre is often missing.”
Researchers said Perth should aim to draw inspiration from shopping malls in Berlin, main pedestrian thoroughfares in Sydney, opportunities to embed Indigenous culture from Auckland, street design from Vienna and cycling paths from Copenhagen.
The report said one of Perth’s biggest challenges was the continued over-reliance on private transport. It found the CAT bus system was hard to navigate, fragmented cycling paths and key thoroughfares being used as freeway on and off ramps.
It suggested on-street parking should be mainly for short-users or loading docks, the speed limit should be lowered to 30 kilometres an hour and potentially sink the freeway under tunnels to “reconnect the urban fabric”.
The report’s authors also said light rail - such as trams - could be put on St George’s Terrace and Wellington Street to ease traffic, and recommended a cable car from Kings Park down to the city for tourists.
It also acknowledged Perth’s long-maligned retail spaces, and recommended a market hall be established in the city.
“Hay Street Mall has struggled as a retail-only precinct and should evolve into a vibrant street centred around food and beverage offerings, and entertainment-based offerings,” the report said.
“This transition should be actively curated, with a focus on small-scale independent operators offering unique WA culinary and artisan products.”
Specific plans to help Perth’s homeless population were only mentioned once in the report, saying the city should “collaborate with relevant agencies to ensure vulnerable groups, including people experiencing homelessness, are supported through well-resourced public amenities and visible services, particularly around transport hubs and the malls.”

Ukraine war briefing: Kyiv condemns ‘blackmail’ by Hungary and Slovakia in energy supplies dispute

-
Ukraine’s foreign ministry has condemned what it describes as “ultimatums and blackmail” by Hungary and Slovakia on Saturday, after both governments threatened to stop electricity supplies to Ukraine unless Kyiv restarts flows of Russian oil. Hungary has also threatened to block a €90bn Ukrainian war loan.
-
Shipments of Russian oil to Hungary and Slovakia have been cut off since 27 January, when Kyiv says a Russian drone strike hit pipeline equipment in western Ukraine. Hungary and Slovakia both accuse Ukraine of delaying the restart, without evidence. The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry said in a statement the country “rejects and condemns the ultimatums and blackmail by the governments of Hungary and the Slovak Republic regarding energy supplies between our countries”. “Ultimatums should be sent to the Kremlin, and certainly not to Kyiv.”
-
Slovakia and Hungary are the only two EU countries that still rely on significant amounts of Russian oil shipped via the Soviet-era Druzhba pipeline over Ukraine. The issue has become one of the angriest disputes yet between Ukraine and two neighbours that are members of the EU and Nato but whose leaders have bucked the largely pro-Ukrainian consensus in Europe to cultivate ties with Moscow. The Slovak leader, Robert Fico, has accused Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy of acting “maliciously” towards his country.
-
Powerful explosions shook Ukraine’s capital Kyiv early on Sunday, after officials warned of a possible ballistic missile attack and ordered residents into shelters. The alert, made shortly before 4am local time, urged people to take cover immediately. Moments later, several loud blasts were heard, according to reports. Regional authorities said air defence units were engaging drones detected over the wider Kyiv region and reminded civilians not to film or post images of ongoing military activity. There were no immediate reports of casualties.
-
The Kyiv explosions follow explosions in the western Ukrainian city of Lviv which killed a policewoman and wounded at least 15 people overnight in what local authorities on Sunday called an “act of terror”. The blasts occurred just after police responded to a report of a break-in at a shop in the city centre at about 12:30 am, according to officials. A first explosion struck as the initial patrol arrived, followed by a second blast moments later when another crew reached the scene. “This is definitely an act of terror,” the Lviv mayor, Andriy Sadovy, said in a Facebook post. “We have 15 people currently receiving medical aid, some of them are in very serious condition. One policewoman died.”
-
Former British prime minister Boris Johnson says the UK and its European allies should immediately deploy noncombat troops to Ukraine to show the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, that western nations are committed to the nation’s freedom and independence. Speaking ahead of the fourth anniversary of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Johnson told the BBC that the troops should be sent to peaceful regions in non-fighting roles. The comments from Johnson, who was one of Ukraine’s staunchest supporters as Britain’s leader during the first months of the conflict, were contained in excerpts of an interview that will be broadcast on Sunday.
-
A strike by Ukraine against a major missile factory deep inside Russia wounded 11 people, officials in Russia’s Udmurt Republics said on Saturday. Meanwhile, Ukraine’s General Staff confirmed it used Ukrainian-made FP-5 “Flamingo” cruise missiles against the Votkinsk plant. Unofficial Russian Telegram channels also pointed to that site. Russia suspended flights at airports in and near the region. Ukraine also reported a strike on a gas plant in Samara, Russia.
-
About 2,000 people marched in Paris on Saturday, according to police, to show their support for Ukraine days before the fourth anniversary of Russia’s invasion. Demonstrators marching through the French capital chanted: “We support Ukraine against Putin, who is killing it”, and “Frozen Russian assets must be confiscated, they belong to Ukraine”. European parliament member Raphael Glucksmann told Agence France-Presse there was “massive” support for Ukraine in France which “has not wavered since the first day of the full-scale invasion”. “On the other hand, in the French political class, sounds of giving up are starting to emerge. On both the far left and the far right, voices of capitulation are getting louder,” he said.
-
Volodymyr Zelenskyy says “real opportunities to end war with dignity still exist”, calling for another round of talks, and hinting at a fresh leaders’ meeting. After he was debriefed on this week’s peace talks with Russia and the US in Geneva, Zelenskyy called for another round of talks to be held “very soon, as early as this February”. He said “Ukraine’s responses to the most difficult questions ahead of the next meeting are ready,” and that they still want to raise some issues at the leaders’ level with Trump and Putin. “It is the leaders’ format that could prove decisive in many respects, and Ukraine is ready for such a format,” he said.

Mark Bailey on his brushes with death, cabinet dumping, and plans to win back Queensland voters
Mark Bailey doesn’t think he’s been handed a poisoned chalice, despite being given a portfolio historically perceived as a burden reserved for political rivals.
Following the late 2023 resignation of former premier Annastacia Palaszczuk, who had loyally stuck by Bailey through periods of intense scrutiny, the former transport minister quit cabinet before almost certainly being dumped by incoming leader Steven Miles.
But less than 12 months later, he was back on the frontbench as the shadow health spokesman following Labor’s election loss.
“I took it on the chin,” Bailey said of his cabinet resignation, in a wide-ranging interview with this masthead in his electoral office in Yeerongpilly.
“That’s politics. Sometimes things happen.”
Bailey says his promotion to the health portfolio shows Miles “has a lot of faith in me” – and he’s adamant the role is an opportunity.
“[Health is] something that does touch everybody’s lives in so many ways.
“Sure, [it’s] one of the hardest portfolios … but that should be something to aspire to.
“It’s not something to complain about. It’s something to get results in.”
The LNP, meanwhile, have based their health sector “results” on Labor’s failures, as they pledge to reduce ambulance ramping rates, cut long elective surgery waitlists, and deliver infrastructure within budget.
With near-weekly regularity over the past year, Premier David Crisafulli and Health Minister Tim Nicholls have said these undertakings are needed to “heal Labor’s health crisis” and revive services after a “decade of decline”. And a large number of voters agree.
Polling in the lead-up to the 2024 state election showed healthcare and aged care ranked as one of the top issues influencing Queenslanders.
Despite a misstep on abortion that nearly saw Crisafulli’s campaign come unstuck, voters ultimately entrusted the LNP to manage the state’s health system for the next four years.
It leaves a long road ahead for the shadow health spokesman, who now has three years to convince Queensland that Labor can return to the driver’s seat in a portfolio that has traditionally been an area of strength. But Bailey is confident he’s got the gumption for it.
“We are going back to the grassroots, reconnecting with the community, and we intend to earn that trust by the next election,” he says.
Bailey’s office sits on the corner of King Arthur Terrace in Yeerongpilly’s Green Riverside Village, a short ride from his home on Brisbane’s southside, an area in which he’s lived since moving with his family from the Gold Coast at the age of six.
His parents divorced seven years after relocating, leaving his mum to raise the household as a single parent. “That was a bit more challenging, but my mum always provided,” he says.
Bailey’s interest in politics – “the contest of ideas” – was stirred during his time at Cavendish Road State High School. By his final year, he was meeting with a group of students in the library every day before school to “dissect The Courier-Mail and debate the issues of the day”.
“We realised we were progressive people, so we all joined the Labor Party the year after,” he says.
Two brushes with death during adolescence have lent extra weight to Bailey’s current political ambitions.
While riding to school along Logan Road, aged 15, he was struck by a car door and “catapulted” into oncoming traffic. In an ambulance to the Princess Alexandra Hospital, paramedics were only convinced that the teen had been run over after seeing black tyre marks on the back of his legs.
Two years later, Bailey spent more than a week in the Mater Hospital’s intensive care unit with salmonella food poisoning.
“The health system saved my life twice,” he says. “I’m not from a wealthy background, it was [because of] a strong public health system and fantastic staff and doctors.”
After high school, Bailey studied at the University of Queensland. Despite graduating with a teaching degree, he spent the next nine years as the deputy chair of Brisbane City Council’s planning committee.
He left council after almost a decade to spend time out of the “political bubble”, moving briefly to Byron Bay before relocating to New York City to pursue acting.
“I kind of felt it in my bones that I wanted to be in a major city,” Bailey says of his 2½-year sabbatical. “It was a great experience … I don’t regret a single day.”
But politics eventually lured him back to Australia. “In the world, there are a lot of actors [but] there aren’t enough activists … there are not enough people getting progressive change done. I thought that’s where I’m most needed.”
He returned to Queensland during the height of Campbell Newman’s reign as LNP premier. “We rapidly went back to the 1980s almost overnight in terms of the meanness [and] the disrespect for people,” Bailey says.
“That made me riled up … and then I decided I’d come back and run for state politics again.”
Bailey won the seat of Yeerongpilly and was given the roads, ports and energy portfolios after Labor ousted Newman in 2015.
Two years later, he replaced Jackie Trad as minister for transport and main roads.
He cites efforts under those portfolios – accelerating the Gold Coast’s light rail project and the Coomera Connector – as some of his proudest political achievements. But the years were not without controversy.
During his time as transport minister, Bailey faced criticism for cost blowouts on key projects, notably a $960 million excess on Brisbane’s Cross River Rail.
He was briefly stood aside from cabinet during a Crime and Corruption Commission investigation into his use of a personal email address in 2017, though was later cleared of corruption.
Last week, he was named in the ongoing CFMEU inquiry, accused of directing his department and its contractors to negotiate with the embattled union, and of running a “sham” consultation on the government’s Best Practice Industry Conditions policy.
When asked about the recent scrutiny, Bailey said it wouldn’t be appropriate to comment at this early stage. “I’m obviously watching, as many people are, the inquiry closely.”
Bailey was among the crowd on Tuesday when Nicholls delivered a keynote speech outlining the LNP’s Hospital Rescue Plan, drafted after a review of Labor’s Hospital Expansion Program found significant budget blowouts and delays.
Such critique, Bailey says, overlooks the challenges wrought by the COVID-19 pandemic. “The criticisms were politically convenient, but the reality was, the pandemic had huge impacts on construction costs, both public and private,” he says.
“We said the criticism was code for cuts and costs. What’s the first thing [the LNP] did? They did a review and cut a whole lot of the hospital expansion programs.”
If Bailey sees his current portfolio as a redemption arc for past misgivings, he’s not wasting time pitching his case to Queenslanders.
Returning serve on the LNP’s “decade of decline” claim, he’s been vocal about the Crisafulli government’s mishandling of last year’s flu season, its ban on pill testing and gender services for children, and its wage negotiations with public healthcare workers.
“You need a government where, from the top down, public health is the first priority that drives every single decision,” he says. “That’s not happening [in Queensland] right now.
“And you need a premier and health minister on the same page … and a health minister who will back best-practice medicine over ideology.
“In opposition, there are a range of things you can achieve through pressure and advocacy … and [the LNP] will get maximum pressure from me.”

China’s vocational degrees rising as students seek skills over prestigious universities
Job-placement rates for vocational undergraduate colleges now outpace traditional universities, as youth unemployment drives pivot to more reliable employment path
When the results of China’s gruelling National Higher Education Entrance Examination – or gaokao – were released last summer, Lin Gangming was surprised to learn that he had scored high enough to attend some of the country’s top universities.
But instead of chasing prestige, the student from Yangjiang, a small coastal city in Guangdong province, chose a different path: Shenzhen Polytechnic University – a public undergraduate vocational college in the province.
Stories like Lin’s, covered by the Shenzhen Special Zone Daily and other publications last year, have become increasingly common in domestic media. Lin was quoted while speaking at a symposium in July for the university’s incoming freshmen.
Amid an oversupply of traditional college graduates, China’s undergraduate vocational track – once seen as a backup plan for underperforming exam-takers – is now a strategic choice for some.
While these institutions grant bachelor’s degrees, their curriculum is geared towards equipping students with technical skills – a major draw for students seeking a more reliable pathway to employment.
“China is making an effort to integrate rather than segregate the academic and vocational-technical components of higher learning,” said Gerard Postiglione, a professor specialising in education in China at the University of Hong Kong. He noted that the recalibration follows economic diversification and accelerating technological development.

Up close and personal: Brisbane clubs commit to getting Gen Z offline
The 20-somethings and late teens of Generation Z often get a bad rap for being addicted to their phones. But these groups are proving young people want to get off the apps to connect face to face.
When Magnus Murray-Douglass felt social media had let him and fellow members of Generation Z down, he turned to something else he thought could bring people together: Brisbane’s rubbish.
Technology has been claimed to connect people, but Murray-Douglass believes it actually drives young people further apart.
He isn’t alone in feeling that way.
About 91 per cent of Gen Zers polled for the Foundation for Social Health in 2025 believed social media adversely affected the strength of their real-life interactions.
The same poll found more than half said their social media usage left them feeling distressed and distracted, and seriously impacted their mental health.
That was one big reason that Murray-Douglass founded Rubbish Club.
“Dating apps claim to have solved that problem [of connection]. Social media claims to bring us closer together,” he says. “But we feel like Rubbish Club is the place that actually brings people closer together.”
His social club is just one of many popping up throughout Brisbane, getting Generation Zers offline and bringing them together.
Here are the stories of a few more.
Three sisters open to a new chapter
Sisters Tayler, Miller and Sienna Kerta are behind the popular BNE Chapters book club.
With monthly events attracting up to 180 attendees and an online community of more than 6000 people on Instagram, the club has become an institution for Brisbane ladies who love reading.
Or as Miller puts it, “every BNE Chapters event is simply chaotic but fun, inviting and relaxing”.
“When we kicked off BNE Chapters, there weren’t many places or social clubs in Brisbane for people to make new friends,” she says.
“The turnout and engagement we receive each month just shows the strong demand for communities and spaces such as BNE Chapters.
“We have absolutely loved watching girls connect at our events.”
The sisters have also started social community We Are WMN, a nod to their Balinese heritage standing for Wayan, Made and Nyoman, which translates to first, second and third born.
The community has hosted bathhouse, Pilates, breath work, trivia and formal ball events.
“We are always trying to include other small businesses and venues in Brisbane, so love to curate events to work alongside these opportunities when they arise,” Miller says.
Tickets are $35 and include a drink on arrival.
Bonding over trash talk
Murray-Douglass, the founder of Rubbish Club, remembers growing up in a school environment where collecting rubbish was punishment for doing something wrong.
He’s hoping to change that script with his Saturday morning meet-ups, which start with a coffee and offer a chance to meet new people while cleaning up Brisbane suburbs in a casual and low-commitment way.
“If we live in such a beautiful landscape and have amazing waterways, why wouldn’t you want to keep those looking amazing?” he says.
“If you can be yapping to your friends while doing it, why wouldn’t you?”
Each week the club wanders around a different suburb and collects rubbish, with plastics being recycled at Murray-Douglass’ company Boe Design – a recyclables company that manufactures furniture.
Attendance is free and members often get a discount at the coffee shop where they meet beforehand.
It’s on the cards
As more young people experience disenchantment with dating apps, 22-year-old Sarah Ellis was inspired to create a card game that connects singles in real life.
“Most single people I speak to are experiencing serious dating app fatigue,” Ellis says.
“The constant pressure to curate the perfect profile, keep conversations interesting and compete for attention has made dating feel more like a chore than something exciting.”
Her game, WE MET AT A BAR, aims to reignite the dating process – the initial spark, the body language – to create opportunities for spontaneous interactions.
It is designed to be played in a bar with prompts such as: “go and compliment a stranger” and “compliment someone’s smile, then walk away”.
Beyond the bar, WE MET AT A BAR has resulted in lasting connections.
“People regularly DM us with stories and photos of the people they’ve met through the game, which is incredibly rewarding to see,” Ellis says.
The game can be bought online for $49.99.
Drop the phone, raise a glass
Another Brisbane-based club aiming to foster face-to-face relationships and allow Generation Zers to explore the city is Social Sips, created by Sasha Kratzmann and Emma Fitzgerald.
The club was inspired by Kratzmann’s time studying abroad in Dublin.
“When I came back to Brisbane, I noticed we were all going to the same familiar spots, and it made me realise that we tend to explore so much when we travel, but rarely do the same in our own city,” she says.
This sparked the creation of the low-commitment social club.
Each month attendees meet at a Brisbane bar with the goal of getting outside their comfort zones and off their phones.
“We’ve had people tell us they’ve met lifelong friends, found housemates, and even met their partners through Social Sips,” Kratzmann says.
She says Gen Z’s shift away from being online is playing a big role in the success of the club.
“I think that’s why we’re seeing more social clubs pop up – people are craving real-life interaction without a screen involved,” Kratzmann says.
Social Sips events are $25 and include a drink on arrival and nibbles.

Deadly explosions rock Ukraine's Lviv city

Explosions in the western Ukrainian city of Lviv have killed a policewoman and wounded at least 15 people overnight in what local authorities on Sunday called an "act of terror".
The blasts occurred shortly after police responded to a report of a break‑in at a shop in the city centre around 2230 GMT Saturday, according to the Lviv regional prosecutor's office.
A first explosion struck as the initial patrol arrived, followed by a second blast moments later when another crew reached the scene.
Officials said a 23‑year‑old woman police officer was killed, while a patrol car and a civilian vehicle were damaged.
"This is definitely an act of terror," Lviv mayor Andriy Sadovy said in a Facebook post. "We have 15 people currently receiving medical aid; some of them are in very serious condition.
"One policewoman died. My condolences to the family and close ones," he added.
Lviv, close to the Polish border and far from the front line, has faced sporadic strikes and security incidents since the Russia-Ukraine war started in February 2022, but deadly explosions in the city centre remain rare.

Huckabee’s Israel land remarks condemned as ‘dangerous’ as controversy rumbles on

10:46:23 KST

Arab and Islamic countries jointly condemned remarks by the US ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, who suggested Israel had a biblical right to a vast swath of the Middle East.
Huckabee, a former Baptist minister and a fervent Israel supporter, was speaking on the podcast of Tucker Carlson.
In an episode released on Friday, Carlson pushed Huckabee on the meaning of a biblical verse sometimes interpreted as saying that Israel is entitled to the land between the Nile River in Egypt and the Euphrates in Syria and Iraq.
In response, Huckabee said: “It would be fine if they took it all.”
When pressed, however, he continued that Israel was “not asking to take all of that”, adding: “It was somewhat of a hyperbolic statement.”
The backlash widened sharply on Sunday as more than a dozen Arab and Islamic governments – alongside three major regional organisations – issued a joint statement denouncing the US diplomat’s comments as “dangerous and inflammatory”.
The statement, released by the United Arab Emirates’ foreign ministry, was signed by the UAE, Egypt, Jordan, Indonesia, Pakistan, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Kuwait, Oman, Bahrain, Lebanon, Syria and the State of Palestine, as well as the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, the Arab League and the Gulf Cooperation Council.
They said the comments contravene the UN Charter and efforts to de-escalate the Gaza war and advance a political horizon for a comprehensive settlement.
Earlier, several Arab states had issued unilateral condemnations.
Saudi Arabia described the ambassador’s words as “reckless” and “irresponsible”, while Jordan said it was “an assault on the sovereignty of the countries of the region”.
Kuwait decried what it called a “flagrant violation of the principles of international law”, while Oman said the comments “threatened the prospects for peace” and stability in the region.
Egypt’s foreign ministry reaffirmed “that Israel has no sovereignty over the occupied Palestinian territory or any other Arab lands”.
The Palestinian Authority said on X that Huckabee’s words “contradict US President Donald Trump’s rejection of (Israel) annexing the West Bank”.
On Saturday, Huckabee published two posts on X further clarifying his position on other topics touched upon in the interview, but did not address his remark about the biblical verse.
The speaker of the Israeli parliament, Amir Ohana, praised Huckabee on X for his general pro-Israel stance in the interview, and accused Carlson of “falsehoods and manipulations”.

Ukraine calls on European partners to boost anti-ballistic missile production
According to Ukrinform, this was reported by the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine.
Participants in the meeting discussed priorities for strengthening missile defense.
The conference was attended by Polish Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of National Defense Władysław Kosiniak-Kamysz, German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius, French Minister of the Armed Forces Catherine Vautrin, EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Kaja Kallas, and NATO Deputy Secretary General Radmila Shekerinska.
Fedorov emphasized that Europe’s defense industry must urgently increase production capacity for ballistic missile defense systems, as current output levels remain critically low.
He proposed launching joint projects with European countries to develop and manufacture anti-ballistic solutions, adding that Ukraine is already implementing its own initiatives in this area.
Fedorov also stressed the need to continue funding the PURL program, which he described as a key mechanism for obtaining PAC-3 interceptor missiles for Patriot air defense systems.
He thanked partners for the concrete decisions taken during the Ramstein-format meeting.
Separately, Fedorov expressed gratitude to Pistorius for initiating additional deliveries of PAC-3 missiles, noting that Ukraine has already begun receiving them under these agreements.
“Implementation of agreements within hours is an example of how we should work,” Fedorov stressed.
In addition, he said Ukraine is preparing proposals to increase economic pressure on Russia, including asymmetric measures targeting Russia’s shadow fleet.
According to Fedorov, Ukraine is counting on European leadership to implement these measures.
The minister also emphasized the importance of fast and flexible use of the EU defense credit for Ukraine, noting that the funds must serve the primary goal – bringing the war to a successful conclusion for Ukraine.
As Ukrinform previously reported, the goal of E5-format defense ministers’ meetings is to reaffirm Europe’s unity and shared responsibility for security in the Euro-Atlantic area.

Israel prepared for imminent US strike on Iran, but now it’s on hold
Unknown

10:35:17 KST

After a postponement Thursday, the Security Cabinet is set to convene Sunday to discuss preparations for a possible U.S. strike on Iran, addressing both defensive readiness and potential offensive coordination.
Israeli officials are operating under the assumption that Israel would assist the United States in the event of an attack, with responsibilities divided between the two countries.
Israel had prepared for possible action over the weekend, but by Thursday it became clear that any strike had been delayed to an unspecified — though likely near-term — date.
While a diplomatic arrangement between Washington and Tehran remains on the table, officials say the prospects for military escalation currently appear higher.
Deep gaps in the sides’ fundamental positions have complicated efforts to bridge differences. Some officials in Washington view Iran’s leadership as weakened and under economic and political pressure, potentially vulnerable to substantial concessions. Iranian leaders, however, appear reluctant to risk being seen domestically as yielding to U.S. demands, even at the cost of military confrontation.
Ultimately, whether any Iranian compromise proposal is deemed sufficient to avert conflict may rest largely with President Donald Trump. If he concludes that proposed concessions fall short, options ranging from a limited agreement to a broad military strike remain under consideration.
Hoping for the best, preparing for the worst
Should a military confrontation ultimately materialize, Iran’s capacity to inflict significant damage on Israel, U.S. forces in the Middle East and Gulf states should not be underestimated. Iran’s arsenal of ballistic missiles, drones and allied proxy forces could enable Tehran to mount a painful response.
Meanwhile, public discourse in recent years has at times overstated the strength of Iran and allied terrorist groups such as Hezbollah, while downplaying Israeli and U.S. offensive and defensive capabilities.
A confrontation, if it occurs, would not necessarily develop into a prolonged war of attrition without clear outcome. Israel and the United States maintain significant advantages in airpower, intelligence and technology, which could allow for relatively short and focused operations targeting missile and nuclear infrastructure, even if such strikes do not immediately bring about regime change.
The U.S. decision-making process has also drawn scrutiny. It began with public expressions of support for protesters in Iran, continued with sustained negotiations and was accompanied by simultaneous military threats and operational preparations. In previous years, Iran’s missile and nuclear programs were not broadly treated by Washington as sufficient grounds for an all-out war.
From Israel’s perspective, officials see the current moment as a potential opportunity. Jerusalem's concerns extend beyond Iran’s nuclear program to the expansion of its precision-guided missile capabilities. Close coordination with the United States could enable strikes on production, storage and launch infrastructure, and potentially undermine regime stability by targeting centers of power and mechanisms of repression.
A strategic shift — and the possibility of targeting Khamenei
The clearest sign of a strategic shift is the move away from plans for a “short, decisive strike” toward a more prolonged campaign aimed at sustained pressure, military analyst Ron Ben-Yishai wrote Saturday.
The expected arrival of the USS Gerald R. Ford aircraft carrier to the region, capable of launching up to roughly 150 combat sorties per day, underscores the depth of the buildup. Significant additional naval and air forces are also expected to operate alongside it.
Unlike a limited strike, a campaign of attrition would aim at the systematic degradation of regime assets: nuclear facilities, Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps bases, missile arrays and command centers. According to this approach, only sustained military pressure — rather than a one-time strike — could compel Iran’s leadership to consider far-reaching concessions, or at least sharply reduce its strategic capabilities.
At the same time, a broad military operation would not guarantee the collapse of Iran’s government. History shows that ideological regimes can survive severe blows. Still, sustained targeting of senior leadership, security apparatuses and key repression mechanisms could undermine stability and weaken the regime’s hold on the public. Some assessments do not rule out the possibility of targeting Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei or his son, who is widely viewed as a potential successor.
Iranian society has been experiencing an unprecedented level of unrest since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. A combination of heavy external pressure and growing internal instability could create a new dynamic, though its outcome would be unpredictable.
Iranian concerns were reflected in remarks broadcast Saturday on Al Mayadeen, a network aligned with the pro-Iran axis. A source described as close to decision-making circles was quoted as saying: “Any war against Iran would mark the beginning of an inevitable unraveling of the global order. It would open the door for other powers to exploit the change to implement their geopolitical agendas. Such a war would alter the calculations of China and Russia. Fundamental shifts could push China and Russia to impose new geographic realities that serve their interests. Any military confrontation with Iran would not remain confined to its borders but would affect the entire international balance.”
Timing of a potential strike
The timing of any action would depend on military readiness as well as political and regional considerations, including religious sensitivities during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, concerns about potential disruption to shipping through the Strait of Hormuz and pressure from regional governments.
There is also the risk of unintended escalation, including a possible Iranian preemptive move or a miscalculation that could ignite hostilities.
President Trump may prefer to wait until mid-March, after the end of Ramadan. At the same time, he has publicly referenced a timeframe of 10 to 15 days, raising the possibility that action could come sooner.
The arrival of the USS Gerald R. Ford in the eastern Mediterranean toward the end of the coming week also factors into the decision. Its deployment effectively signals the completion of the U.S. force buildup, aside from the possible dispatch of B-2 strategic bombers, which the United States could send directly toward Iran in an effort to surprise its leadership.
Seizing a historic opportunity
Israeli officials are preparing for the possibility that a U.S.-Iran confrontation could provide an opportunity to significantly weaken Tehran’s missile capabilities and those of its regional allies.
Potential targets include ballistic missile stockpiles and production facilities, as well as missile infrastructure linked to Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthis in Yemen. Senior Israeli officials have spoken of removing what they describe as long-term strategic threats to Israel.
Ultimately, options remain under consideration: a limited agreement allowing each side to claim an achievement, a restrained strike or a broad and sustained campaign. The decision will be made in Washington, but its consequences will be felt in Jerusalem, Tehran and capitals across the region.

Pakistan says militant hideouts struck along Afghan border

Pakistan says militant hideouts struck along Afghan border
February 22, 2026Pakistan said Sunday it had carried out strikes against multiple militant hideouts along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border region.
Islamabad did not say precisely which areas it targeted or provide additional details.
The Taliban authorities in Kabul said the Pakistani strikes had killed and wounded "dozens of people."
"Last night, they bombed our civilian compatriots in Nangarhar and Paktika provinces, martyring and wounding dozens of people, including women and children," local media quoted Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid as saying.
What did Pakistan say about the strikes?
Pakistan "has carried out intelligence-based selective targeting of seven Terrorist camps and hideouts," a statement by the country's Ministry of Information and Broadcasting said.
It noted that the camps belonged to the Pakistani Taliban, also known as Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan, or TTP, and its affiliates.
Pakistan said the strikes were carried out in response to recent security incidents in the country, including asuicide blast at a Shiite mosque in Islamabad two weeks ago and other more recent suicide bombings in northwest Pakistan.
The mosque bombing killed at least 31 people and wounded more than 160.
It was the deadliest attack in Pakistan's capital since the 2008 Marriott hotel bombing.
An affiliate of the so-called "Islamic State" group had claimed responsibility for the bombing.
After the latest suicide bombings, Pakistan's military warned that it would not "exercise any restraint” and that operations against those responsible would continue "irrespective of their location."
What's behind tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan?
Pakistan has seen a surge in militant violence in recent years.
Islamabad blames Afghan-based elements for the attacks and has accused the Taliban of allowing Afghan soil to be used to harbor militants.
Pakistan wants Kabul to clamp down on the TTP, which is a separate group but closely linked to the Afghan Taliban.
The TTP seeks to impose a hard-line interpretation of Islam, particularly on Pakistan's northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, which borders Afghanistan.
According to Pakistan's government, the group operates from Afghan soil with impunity.
The Afghan Taliban deny the allegations and say they cannot be held accountable for security incidents inside Pakistan.
Fierce fighting erupted between the Pakistani military and Afghan Taliban forces last October, marking the deadliest conflict between the neighbors since the Taliban seized power in Kabul in 2021.
The clashes killed dozens of soldiers, civilians and suspected militants.
Relations between the neighboring countries have remained tense ever since.

WASHINGTON -- Four years after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of its neighbor, hundreds of Ukraine's supporters gathered on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, transforming the heart of the US capital into a sea of blue and yellow.
What began in 2022 as a spontaneous outpouring of shock and solidarity has evolved into what participants on February 21 described as a “heartbreaking tradition.”
For the fourth consecutive year, Ukrainians and their supporters assembled in the US capital to mark the anniversary of the war with prayer, song, and defiant chants before marching toward the Russian ambassador’s residence.
Organizers said the aim was to demonstrate a united front in Washington and to urge continued US engagement in efforts to end the largest armed conflict in Europe since World War II.
For many Ukrainians in attendance, the rally was more than a symbolic gesture; it was a painful reminder of the destruction still unfolding at home.
One woman, who relocated her family to the United States during the war, said it remains vital to remind the American public of the daily hardships and existential threats Ukrainians endure.
The message repeated throughout the afternoon was clear: The war is about more than territory -- it is about survival.
‘A Heartbreaking Tradition’
The rally was organized by leading Ukrainian-American organizations in cooperation with the Ukrainian Embassy in Washington.
Maryna Baydyuk, president of United Help Ukraine, which has held annual events to mark the invasion’s anniversary, argued that Ukraine must be viewed not as a supplicant but as a strategic partner.
“We need the support of Americans, but we also need the support of the US government and the current administration,” she told RFE/RL.
“We should see Ukraine not just as a country at war, a beggar. We should see Ukraine as an ally…standing in front of a massive Russian army, holding the line -- not just for Ukraine, but for the rest of Europe and for the rest of the free world.”
Nova Ukraine, one of the largest US charities providing humanitarian aid to the country, also participated.
Its chief executive officer, Ambassador Erin McKee, told RFE/RL that its goal was to highlight urgent winter needs on the ground -- ranging from basic humanitarian assistance to amplifying the voices of children, teachers, and doctors living through the conflict every day.
Since 2014, the organization says, it has disbursed approximately $150 million in assistance.
European Support on Display
European diplomats joined the rally, underlining what speakers described as essential transatlantic unity.
Jovita Neliupsiene, the EU’s ambassador to Washington, echoed the sentiment that the annual gathering has become a “heartbreaking tradition.”
“Sometimes we forget that this war is really happening,” she told RFE/RL, warning that Moscow continues to “weaponize the winter.”
She urged a sustained effort to “push back” and ensure that international voices remain united in support of Kyiv.
Asked about the state of Western unity, Neliupsiene noted that while no one wants the war to persist, the challenge lies in achieving a “sustainable, long-lasting, and fair peace.”
“If we continue to support Ukraine, if we continue to put massive pressure on Russia via sanctions and other economic measures…and if the aggressor knows that aggression cannot just go away without accountability for war crimes, that would be the right message and the show of unity,” she said.
Her message to Russian President Vladimir Putin was direct: “This war can actually stop right now if Russia stops the aggression.”
Calls for Peace -- And Accountability
Among the speakers was Pastor Mark Burns, a prominent spiritual adviser to President Donald Trump. Addressing the crowd, Burns questioned how Russia’s leadership could justify attacks on civilians and houses of worship while claiming to uphold Christian values.
“How can you be a Christian when you bomb little children who are just walking to church to worship the name of the Lord Jesus?” Burns asked.
“How can you be a Christian when you allow Russian soldiers to rape women? How can you be a Christian when you bomb more than 700 churches in Ukraine?.… That’s not the kind of Christianity that I believe in.”
Speaking to RFE/RL, Burns said he had visited Ukraine and shared his firsthand accounts of the atrocities he witnessed -- including in Bucha -- with Trump.
“The last conversation I had with the [US] president was a couple of days ago, and he said to me, ‘We are very, very close to having a cease-fire,’” Burns said.
He rejected suggestions that Trump favors Moscow, calling such claims false, and asserted that the president is working toward a resolution.
“President Trump wants peace,” Burns emphasized. “He knows you cannot trust Russia.”
Denys Sienik, deputy chief of mission at the Ukrainian Embassy in Washington, said Kyiv seeks a “credible, lasting, and just” peace backed by clear security guarantees.
“That’s all Ukrainians want,” he told RFE/RL, while accusing Russia of continuing to wage a campaign of terror against civilians.
Sienik stated that Ukraine remains committed to negotiations and expressed gratitude to the Trump administration and other partners involved in peace efforts. However, he stressed the necessity of strengthening Ukraine’s defenses to save lives while talks proceed.
‘Washington Should Not Look Away’
Some demonstrators expressed fears that American attention is waning as the war enters its fifth year. Others argued that Ukraine’s fate has implications reaching far beyond its borders.
Sienik pointed to the size and diversity of the crowd as evidence of enduring support in the United States. “I’m really proud to see not only Ukrainians, but Americans, with us today, as well as Europeans and nationals from other countries,” he said. “Every word matters.”
As the sun set over the National Mall, thousands began their march from the Lincoln Memorial toward the Russian ambassador’s residence -- a visible show of unity tinged with grief.
Four years ago, few in this crowd imagined they would be standing there again, pleading for the world’s attention.

Investment gold retailers move into vacant Hong Kong high-street shops on metal’s rise
‘We see overwhelming demand for investment gold coins and bars,’ retailer San Gold Coins’ Sophia Chen says
These retailers – which sell gold coins and bars, rather than ornamental pieces – have taken up ground-floor store spaces that were left vacant during the city’s post-pandemic recovery.
Their rapid expansion has been followed by the return of high-end jewellery vendors, a development that has helped stabilise rents in some of the city’s most expensive districts.
San Gold Coins, a mainland Chinese bullion retailer with about 100 stores across its home market, has expanded quickly in Hong Kong over the past 18 months. It opened three street-level stores in Central, Causeway Bay and Tsim Sha Tsui, and planned to add up to three more shops this year.
“We see overwhelming demand for investment gold coins and bars, that’s why we decided to ramp up [store expansion],” said Sophia Chen, the retailer’s sixth-generation heir and general manager overseeing overseas business.
While jewellery merchants are common in both Hong Kong and mainland China, investment gold retailers like San Gold Coins remained relatively rare, she said.

Opinion | Executive-led governance in Hong Kong must start by listening to the people
As the head of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office has stressed, an executive-led system must be coherent to be effective, and this requires building consensus
Under the Basic Law, the chief executive is the head of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and the head of the SAR government. Standing at the apex of the executive, legislative and judicial branches of government, the chief executive bears dual accountability – accountable to both the central people’s government and to Hong Kong.
This dual responsibility is central to the governance philosophy. A sound structure does not automatically produce good governance; the governance philosophy of engaging the governed is vital.
If the chief executive is the head of the system, the civil service is its backbone and operational limbs. Hong Kong’s civil servants have long been admired for their efficiency and competence. They are one of Hong Kong’s most valuable governance assets.
Yet given Hong Kong society’s sophistication and rising expectations, administrative competence alone is insufficient. A system may still falter if it does not embed effective channels for aggregating public opinion and building consent in policy formulation and implementation.

The bodies of nine backcountry skiers killed earlier this week were recovered Saturday after an avalanche struck the California side of Lake Tahoe, according to officials.
Authorities said the group was on a day-trip skiing expedition on Tuesday when the avalanche struck.
Six of those killed were close friends described as “passionate, skilled skiers", along with three professional guides.
Relatives identified the victims as Carrie Atkin, Liz Clabaugh, Danielle Keatley, Kate Morse, Caroline Sekar and Kate Vitt.
The Nevada County Sheriff’s Office confirmed that three employees from the Blackbird Mountain Guides, Michael Henry, 30, Andrew Alissandratos, 34, and Nicole Choo, 42, also died in the avalanche.
“We are grateful that we can bring them home,” said Shannan Moon, the sheriff of Nevada County, California, as reported by NBC News.
Five of the victims were recovered and airlifted on Friday by helicopter.
Fifteen skiers were caught in the avalanche. Six survived, including two who sustained non-life-threatening injuries.
Multiple agencies have launched investigations into the avalanche.
The Sierra Avalanche Centre will prepare an incident report and is examining possible workplace safety violations, and the sheriff’s office is conducting its own inquiry.
The storm has dumped 1.7 metres of snow in the past week alone, with wind gusts reaching 90 kilometres per hour.
The Colorado Avalanche Information Centre noted that this season has already seen six other avalanche fatalities in the US.

Ex-PM Gordon Brown tells police to investigate Andrew’s use of jets and bases

Ex-PM Gordon Brown tells police to investigate Andrew’s use of jets and bases
Former British prime minister Gordon Brown has demanded a police investigation into whether Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor used taxpayer-funded jets and RAF bases to meet paedophile Jeffrey Epstein.
The Telegraph can reveal that Brown wrote letters to six police forces suggesting that civil servants be questioned about Mountbatten-Windsor’s time as a trade envoy. The royal was an envoy from 2001 to 2011, including almost three years when Brown was in No. 10.
He has also demanded a full investigation into the trade envoy role, its cost to taxpayers and any evidence that links Mountbatten-Windsor’s government work to Epstein.
His five-page letters were sent individually to police in London, Surrey, Sussex, Thames Valley, Norfolk and Bedfordshire this week, but their contents were not publicly disclosed. Brown said only that they contained “new and additional information”.
The Telegraph can now reveal that they show his deep concern that Mountbatten-Windsor had used chartered RAF flights to transport him to personal engagements that could have involved Epstein, and that the former prince might have leaked confidential information from the trips in a “wholly unacceptable” use of public money.
At the time, Mountbatten-Windsor was nicknamed “Airmiles Andy” for using taxpayer-funded flights to make private leisure or business trips, usually on the way back from a government engagement.
Brown believes that given the close relationship between the two men, the planes may have been used to facilitate meetings with Epstein.
Mountbatten-Windsor has been accused of sexually abusing Virginia Giuffre, who was then 17, after she was introduced to him by Epstein – a claim the former prince has always denied.
Brown wants police to interview officials at four government departments – the Ministry of Defence, the Department for Transport, the Foreign Office and the Treasury – over Mountbatten-Windsor’s trade envoy role, in an attempt to uncover any link to the disgraced financier.
The former prime minister is also understood to be concerned about a flight the convicted paedophile took on a Gulfstream jet that landed at RAF Marham air base in Norfolk in December 2000, which The Telegraph revealed more than a decade ago.
Emails and flight logs that the US Justice Department have disclosed show that the jet, carrying Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, initially landed at Luton Airport on December 6. The following day, it made the 129-kilometre hop to RAF Marham, this time with two additional passengers, one of whom is listed only as an unnamed “female”.
It reported that after landing at a Ministry of Defence base, Epstein and Maxwell travelled the 32-kilometre journey to the Queen’s Sandringham Estate, where they were entertained by Mountbatten-Windsor, who is alleged to have arranged their access to the base.
The public only learned of Mountbatten-Windsor’s alleged role in facilitating the use of the military airbase after the release of the Epstein files.
Emails show Maxwell raising queries from a Telegraph reporter with Epstein, telling him: “I think that’s crap and not true and you should say so”. He replied: “Just spoke to Larry [Visoski, his pilot], it’s true”.
“S--t..,” Maxwell responded.
In light of the apparent use of British military facilities, Brown has requested that police examine whether Epstein was given access to RAF bases after his conviction for soliciting child prostitution in Florida in 2008.
His letter to police makes reference to a photograph of the former prince lying on the laps of unnamed guests at Sandringham, flanked by Maxwell, Epstein’s “lieutenant”.
The Epstein files revealed how deeply enmeshed the House of York had become with the convicted paedophile. Emails show Epstein and his associates sought to exploit the former prince’s “aura and access” as UK trade envoy, while also dazzling him with offers of female company and lucrative business deals.
Mountbatten-Windsor was arrested on Thursday night (AEDT) on suspicion of misconduct in a public office, after the release of emails that are alleged to have shown he passed sensitive information to Epstein while working for the government.
Brown believes that Mountbatten-Windsor’s use of hundreds of thousands of dollars of taxpayers’ money to fly to the trade envoy meetings may exacerbate the seriousness of his conduct.
In this week’s letters, he gave an extensive list of runways used by Epstein in the UK, including those at commercial airports in Edinburgh, Belfast, Liverpool, Birmingham, Norfolk, Gatwick, Heathrow, Luton and Stansted.
He believes airline employees and staff at the nine airports should be questioned about Epstein’s flights to the UK, after his own analysis of the Epstein files released by the US Department of Justice uncovered emails between Epstein’s pilots and other members of staff discussing flights.
He has called for any records held by the UK Ministry of Defence to be handed to the police, and for a thorough investigation establishing what diligence checks were carried out on Epstein before he was cleared to land.
Brown has said publicly that he is concerned about the complicity of the British state in Epstein’s offences, arguing that Britain’s “unacknowledged role” in the Epstein saga “is by far the biggest scandal of all”.
Mountbatten-Windsor is under investigation for misconduct in public office. The King stripped him of his titles last year, and he now also faces losing his position in the line of succession, following an unprecedented intervention from Downing Street on Friday.
On Saturday, police continued to search Mountbatten-Windsor’s former home, Royal Lodge.
Two of his private bodyguards were photographed stocking up on supplies in King’s Lynn, close to his new Sandringham home, carrying boxes of beer under their arms.
A Ministry of Defence spokesman said it was “standard practice” for private or commercial aircraft to use RAF airfields, “subject to fees which cover all costs”.
The spokesman added: “Such use is not automatic and will only be approved when there is no adverse impact to military aircraft and where approval would not interfere with the security or smooth running of the airfield.”
Mountbatten-Windsor was approached for comment.

Pakistan strikes seven militant camps in Afghan border region
Islamabad said Sunday it had carried out strikes on seven sites along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border region targeting Afghan-based militant groups it blames for recent suicide attacks.
Citing three attacks since the start of Ramadan last week, Pakistan "has carried out intelligence-based selective targeting of seven Terrorist camps and hideouts belonging to Pakistani Taliban" and its affiliates in the border region, a statement by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting said.
The statement posted on X by Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said Pakistan had also targeted an affiliate of the Islamic State group.
It did not indicate where the strikes were carried out or give further details on them.
The ministry said they were carried out in response to a suicide blast at a Shia mosque in Islamabad two weeks ago and other more recent suicide bombings in northwest Pakistan.
The Islamic State group had claimed responsibility for the mosque bombing which killed at least 31 people and wounded more than 160 in the deadliest attack on Islamabad since the 2008 Marriott hotel bombing.
Pakistan has accused Afghanistan's Taliban authorities of allowing Afghan soil to be used to harbour militants and the relationship between the two countries has deteriorated sharply with deadly border clashes in recent months.

Finnish top diplomat Valtonen says resumption of dialogue with Russia still possible

STOCKHOLM, February 22. /TASS/. A dialogue between Russia and Finland is still possible, Finnish Foreign Minister Elina Valtonen said in an interview with Finland’s television and radio broadcaster Yle.
"Well, definitely, at some point... However, we need to come to terms regarding what we want to achieve via this dialogue and determine the responsibilities," Valtonen said in response to a question whether a dialogue with Moscow is still possible in the future.
The Finnish top diplomat said she believed that Europe should play a more significant role in the peace process.
Valtonen also noted that Finland was considering at the moment the possibility of involving former President Sauli Niinisto in negotiations with Russia.
"We have experienced negotiators, and Niinisto is certainly one of them. However, it's not relevant at the moment," she stated.
The Finnish foreign minister also pointed out that it was important to launch a European Union aid package for Ukraine worth 90 billion euros ($106.03 billion), which was previously blocked by Hungary.
According to her, Finland has already helped Ukraine having allocated from its reserves "everything possible, including defense materials and assistance to overcome the energy crisis."
Finnish Prime Minister Petteri Orpo stated in late January that he was ready to sit down at the negotiating table with Russian President Vladimir Putin, however, according to him, the time for such talks has not yet come.
Earlier, Politico reported, citing sources, that European Union countries are discussing the possibility of appointing a special envoy for negotiations on a Ukrainian settlement, who would engage in dialogue with the Russian side on behalf of the bloc. Finnish President Alexander Stubb has been mentioned as a potential candidate for the role.

Pakistan carries out strikes in Afghanistan, ‘killing and wounding dozens’
Afghan Defence Ministry says the strikes hit a school and homes, killing and wounding dozens of people.
Pakistan’s military has carried out air strikes in Afghanistan, targeting what it called “camps and hideouts” belonging to armed groups behind a spate of recent attacks, including a deadly suicide bombing at a Shia mosque in Islamabad.
The Afghan Ministry of Defence condemned Sunday’s attacks, saying they “hit a religious school and residential homes” in the border provinces of Nangarhar and Paktika, “resulting in dozens of deaths and injuries, including women and children”.

Afghan sources told Al Jazeera that at least 17 people were killed in Nangarhar.
The attacks threaten a fragile ceasefire between the South Asian neighbours, negotiated following deadly border clashes that killed dozens of soldiers, civilians and suspected fighters in October last year.
Pakistan’s Ministry of Information and Broadcasting said in a statement on X that the country’s military conducted “intelligence-based, selective operations” against seven camps and hideouts belonging to the Pakistan Taliban, also known as Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), and its affiliates.
An affiliate of the Islamic State group was also targeted in the border region, it said.
The ministry said it had “conclusive evidence” that recent attacks in Islamabad, as well as in the northwestern Bajaur and Bannu districts, were perpetrated by fighters “on behest of their Afghanistan-based leadership and handlers”.
It said Pakistan has repeatedly urged Afghanistan’s Taliban government to take action to prevent armed groups from using Afghan territory to launch attacks, but that Kabul has failed to “undertake any substantive action”.
Pakistan “has always strived to maintain peace and stability in the region”, it added, but said the safety and security of Pakistani citizens remained its top priority.
The Pakistani air strikes on Afghanistan came hours after a suicide bomber targeted a security convoy in the Bannu district of the northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, killing two soldiers, including a lieutenant colonel.
On Monday, a suicide bomber, backed by gunmen, rammed an explosives-laden vehicle into the wall of a security post in the nearby Bajaur, killing 11 soldiers and a child. Authorities later said the attacker was an Afghan national.
On February 6, another suicide bomber detonated his explosives during noon prayers at the Khadija Tul Kubra mosque in Islamabad’s Tarlai Kalan area, killing at least 31 worshippers and wounding 170 others.
The Islamic State group claimed responsibility for the Islamabad attack.
While bombings are rare in the heavily guarded capital, the attack on Khadija Tul Kubra was the second such attack in three months, raising fears of a return to violence in Pakistan’s major urban centres.
At the time, the Pakistani military said the “planning, training, and indoctrination for the attack took place in Afghanistan”.
In its statement on Sunday, the Pakistani Information Ministry reiterated its call for the international community to press the Taliban to uphold its commitments under the agreement it signed with the United States, in the Qatari capital, Doha, in 2020, to prevent the use of Afghan territory for attacks against other countries.
The ministry said the move was “vital for regional and global peace and security”.
For its part, the Afghan Ministry of Defence condemned the Pakistani attacks as “a breach of international law and the principles of good neighbourliness”.
It promised to respond.
“We hold the Pakistani military responsible for targeting civilians and religious sites. We will respond to these attacks in due course with a measured and appropriate response,” it said.
Pakistan has seen a surge in violence in recent years, much of it blamed on the TTP and outlawed Baloch separatist groups. Islamabad accuses the TTP of operating from inside Afghanistan, a charge the group denies.
The Taliban government has also consistently denied sheltering anti-Pakistan armed groups.
Relations between the neighbouring countries have remained tense following the deadly clashes in October. The fighting followed explosions in Kabul, which Afghan officials blamed on Pakistan.
A ceasefire mediated by Qatar on October 19 has largely held, but subsequent talks in Turkiye’s Istanbul failed to produce a formal agreement.

Karyna Shuliak was Jeffrey Epstein's last partner and main heiress. She won't benefit from his will

A loyal companion of sexual predator Jeffrey Epstein, Karyna Shuliak was the last person to speak to him on the phone shortly before his suicide in prison on August 10, 2019. Close to the disgraced financier, to whom she was simultaneously a lover, manager and dependent, she appears as his main beneficiary in the will he wrote in his cell before his death.
According to that document, Shuliak was supposed to inherit $100 million (€85 million) and the criminal's properties: his Manhattan townhouse, his apartment on Avenue Foch in Paris, his private islands, his ranch in New Mexico, as well as a 32-carat ring purchased for $1.2 million. Despite this lavish inheritance, the 36-year-old, who currently lives in New York, will not see a penny, as American and French authorities have decided to freeze the estate to allocate it to a victims' compensation fund.
It all began in 2009. Shuliak, then a 20-year-old student of dental medicine at Minsk University, started corresponding with the billionaire, who was 36 years older than her. Known for his preference for women from Eastern Europe, Epstein invited her – all expenses paid – to the United States, promising help with her studies and support for her visa application. Arriving in New York in August of that year, the young woman became part of the financier's life, just after he had served his first prison sentence for procuring minors for prostitution. He liked her, and he kept his promises.

Hong Kong budget 2026-27: what’s holding back the city’s tech and talent schemes?
Finance chief’s blueprint seen as gauge for officials’ ‘reform mindset’ following Beijing’s 15th five-year plan recommendations
Hong Kong’s coming annual budget must address critical bottlenecks in technology and talent attraction to pave the way for the city’s first five-year development framework in line with national priorities, according to observers.
Against a backdrop of geopolitical tensions, the plan – expected to be officially endorsed next month – prioritises technological self-reliance, “new quality productive forces” and expanding domestic consumption, with “comprehensive reform” as a guiding principle.
The framework outlines Beijing’s support for transforming Hong Kong into an international innovation and technology centre and a global destination for top talent, while consolidating the city’s role as an international financial, aviation and trade hub.
While Chief Executive John Lee Ka-chiu recently said he had instructed all policy bureaus to work “in full force” to devise a “Hong Kong five-year plan” within this year, Chan hinted the budget would include measures to help mainland Chinese innovation and technology enterprises “go global” and promote the clustering of key businesses in the city.
Observers said the government should address critical bottlenecks in Hong Kong’s own tech ecosystem first, as its slowdown did not just affect the city’s competitive edge but extended more broadly to the Greater Bay Area, which covers Macau and nine mainland cities.

No advice from ASIO to block passports of women with alleged IS links, Burke says

Australian officials don't want women and children allegedly linked to the self-proclaimed Islamic State (IS) group to return to the country, but the threshold hasn't been reached to bar them from receiving passports.
Some 34 women and children tied to Australians who travelled to the Middle East to fight for the terrorist group have been trying for days to travel home from a Syrian refugee camp.
The cohort has been issued with Australian passports, a right afforded to citizens, but one of the women has been given a temporary exclusion order, barring their re-entry for up to two years.
Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke said security agencies had not passed on any advice that would block the group from receiving the required travel documents to return to Australia.
"There's been no advice from ASIO that the Passports Act provisions have been activated," he told ABC's Insiders program on Sunday.
"On the information that we have, the best way to protect Australians has not involved any further temporary exclusion orders.
"We don't want them to come back ... we're actively making sure we do nothing to help them."
The 34-strong cohort was not a coherent group, Burke added, but enough information was available to issue the single exclusion order.
"We know the different individuals, we know the state of mind and effective ideology of different individuals," he said. "Our agencies have been following them for a long time."
The minister noted a majority of the cohort were born in Australia and he confirmed state and federal agencies had been working together to mitigate any potential risks from their return.
Burke also rejected claims made in a report in the Sunday Telegraph asserting that official preparations were underway for the cohort’s return.
"In that report, it makes a claim that we are conducting a repatriation. We are not," Burke said.
"It claims we have been meeting with the states for the purposes of a repatriation. We have not," Burke added.
Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said the government was not in contact with any member of the cohort, but he threatened charges would apply if they came back to Australia.
"Australian citizens have rights and they also have responsibilities, and those responsibilities mean that the Australian government, like with anyone else, will apply the full force of the law to anyone who has broken Australian law," he told Sky News.
"Is Australia providing repatriation, which did occur in 2019 and 2022? No is the answer to that."
Labor has been under pressure from the opposition to block the entire group from entering Australia, however Albanese said his government was operating under laws introduced by the Coalition.
"When it comes to the issue of citizenship, that has rights as well under our constitution," the prime minister said. "There are issues there and the Coalition know that is the case."
Opposition defence spokesman James Paterson reiterated that the government should do more to stop the cohort's arrival.
"It is very clear that the government can refuse a passport to an Australian citizen if they receive advice from a competent authority like ASIO or the AFP if a person is a threat to security," he said. "Denying their passport would deal with that threat to security."
The granting of a temporary exclusion order to one of the cohort meant further orders could be granted, Paterson added. "Those powers need to be used and this government seems very reluctant to use them," he said.

Teens find body in northern Israel ravine during climb

Three teenage boys on a rock-climbing training hike in northern Israel made a grim discovery Friday when they found the body of a man in his 20s in the Amud Stream nature reserve.
The teens, residents of the Galilee community of Kahal, spotted the body among rocks and dense vegetation in the early afternoon. Authorities said a preliminary assessment indicates the man fell to his death from a significant height roughly 12 hours before he was found.
Security forces rushed to the scene despite the initial report that a body had been located, holding out hope that the man might still be alive. An Israeli Air Force helicopter carrying a team from the elite 669 search-and-rescue unit was dispatched to the area. A physician who was lowered to the rugged site pronounced the man dead at the scene.
The victim’s car was later located in a nearby parking lot at the Moshel Kahal area, and his family was notified. The body was transferred from the Upper Galilee to the National Center for Forensic Medicine in Tel Aviv for examination to determine the precise cause of death. Police said they are investigating the circumstances.
The task of recovering the body was assigned to volunteers from the Galil-Golan police search-and-rescue unit, who were responding to their fifth life-saving callout in the past week. Working in difficult and complex terrain, rescuers used rope systems in an operation that required advanced technical skill. The unit said the mission was carried out under real risk to volunteers, reflecting their commitment to retrieving every person from the field, even when rescue is no longer possible.
Behind the scenes, the operation sparked controversy. Inbal Shoham, the mother of one of the teenagers who found the body and a candidate in the Democrats party primary, criticized the conduct of authorities at the scene.
In a social media post, Shoham alleged that her son and his friends were left alone at the site for hours and were instructed by police and the Magen David Adom emergency service to photograph, document and help guide responders. She said the teens were required to repeatedly climb up and down the ravine to assist arriving forces and claimed that adult hikers in the area refused to help. “They stayed there and managed the incident until forces arrived,” Shoham wrote.
Speaking to ynet, Shoham clarified that her criticism was not directed at the volunteer rescue unit but at police officers who she said did not immediately descend to the rocky, brush-covered ravine where the body lay. She said the teens found themselves near the scene for about two hours, effectively “managing” the situation while assisting search and rescue teams who had difficulty accessing the site. She also alleged that forensic investigators did not descend to collect documentation or investigate the fall and instead relied on photographs the teens were asked to take.
Israel Police and the Galil-Golan rescue unit rejected Shoham’s claims, saying management of the scene and the recovery operation were conducted in accordance with established operational protocols for such complex terrain. Volunteers from the unit said rescue and recovery personnel were alongside the body at all stages, from the arrival of Unit 669 and the police rescue team until the body was extracted.

Artist creates ‘Latin American Mona Lisa’ with plastic bottle caps

SAN SALVADOR - Call it a Renaissance in recycling.
A massive mural made of plastic bottle caps depicts Latin America’s version of the famed Mona Lisa, adorning a modest apartment building in a working class neighbourhood outside the capital of El Salvador instead of the walls of the Louvre.
Using a rainbow of colours and various sizes of caps, Venezuelan artist Oscar Olivares’s latest installation is 13m tall and takes inspiration from Renaissance master Leonardo da Vinci as well as the pointillist paintings of French artist Paul Signac.
“I wanted to portray a Latin American Mona Lisa,” Mr Olivares told AFP.
The mural is in Zacamil, in the Mejicanos suburb of San Salvador – an area that was once controlled by violent gangs, whose activity has been curbed by President Nayib Bukele’s controversial security crackdown.
“The Mona Lisa is an ordinary woman, and she’s an icon of the Italian Renaissance” – and now “we are living through a new Renaissance, both in El Salvador and the world,” Mr Olivares said.
Completed in three weeks, the composition is made of more than 100,000 recycled bottle caps, after they were gathered by local residents over several months, washed and sorted.
Instead of the muted palette of the Italian countryside, Mr Olivares replaced da Vinci’s pastoral background with bright depictions of homes, a bold blue mountain and a colorful checkerboard sky.
And it wouldn’t be the Mona Lisa without her penetrating gaze and that ever-elusive smile, this time seen on a sun-kissed face rendered with red, orange and yellow caps.
Her jewelry, hairstyle and colorful dress evoke a modern Latina woman’s graces.
Mr Olivares has created murals using plastic caps in Venezuela, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, France and Italy, finding use for over 2 million caps in more than two dozen murals.
He hopes his work will give viewers “a completely different view of plastic waste.” AFP

Nine bodies recovered in deadly California avalanche, officials say
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
LOS ANGELES - The bodies of nine skiers who were killed in an avalanche in the mountains near Lake Tahoe
A ninth victim who had been missing was found and recovered along with four other victims on Feb 20, Lt. Dennis Haack of the Nevada County sheriff’s office said at an afternoon news conference.
Four other victims were recovered on the morning of Feb 21, according to the sheriff’s office.
“While we wish we could have saved them all, we are grateful that we can bring them home,” said Ms Shannan Moon, the sheriff.
The avalanche on Feb 17 was the deadliest in modern California history. The victims were part of a group of 15 people, including four professional guides, finishing up a three-day backcountry trek through Castle Peak, a remote part of the Sierra Nevada.
The group had set out on its expedition on Feb 15 even as the region anticipated its first big blizzard of the year and an avalanche prediction center had warned of a “high” danger level for travel in avalanche-prone areas.
Officials for the first time identified the victims, including a group of six women and three of the group’s guides, two men and one woman. The six women were Carrie Atkin, 46; Liz Clabaugh, 52; Danielle Keatley, 44; Kate Morse, 45; Caroline Sekar, 45; and Kate Vitt, 43.
Family members, who had previously identified the women, said they were a friend group, including two sisters, who regularly took trips to the Lake Tahoe area. Several were from the Bay Area. The three guides, who worked for Blackbird Mountain Guides, were Andrew Alissandratos, 34; Michael Henry, 30; and Nicole Choo, 42.
Officials said on Feb 21 that the recovery operations began on Feb 20, after they took steps to reduce the threat of further avalanches in the area and deemed conditions safe enough to send in rescuers. A storm that passed on Feb 19 also had complicated recovery efforts.
All of the bodies were hoisted out using helicopters and taken to a staging area near Frog Lake huts, where the group of skiers had been lodging before their trip, officials said. The ninth victim, who had been missing, was found “relatively close to where everyone else was located”, Mr Haack said.
Officials had previously said the ski group had been caught in an avalanche about the size of a football field around 11.30am on Feb 17. Six survivors, four men and two women, were rescued after using avalanche beacons and the SOS satellite function on their iPhones.
Rescuers had travelled for several hours in a snowcat, a treaded vehicle, over difficult terrain before finally reaching the survivors around 5.30pm on Feb 17, according to the county sheriff’s office. The survivors led the rescue team to the remains of three people, and rescuers later located five other victims. NYTIMES

Epstein survivor slams Les Wexner’s ‘abhorrent’ testimony
Maria Farmer says she ‘suffered abuse at the hands of Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell’ at Wexner’s estate
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
A survivor of Jeffrey Epstein’s abuse has spoken out against billionaire Leslie Wexner, describing his recent deposition to members of Congress as “abhorrent.”
Wexner, the 88-year-old founder of retail conglomerate L Brands, sat for a nearly five-hour deposition Wednesday with members of the House Oversight Committee. Lawmakers subpoenaed Wexner after the latest release of the so-called Epstein files by the Department of Justice revealed new details about his relationship with the dead sex offender, who once worked as his financial adviser.
Appearing in the Epstein files does not imply wrongdoing, and Wexner has never been charged with a crime. Wexner has also denied knowing about Epstein’s criminal activity.
“I was naive, foolish, and gullible to put any trust in Jeffrey Epstein,” Wexner said in a statement ahead of the interview. “He was a con man. And while I was conned, I have done nothing wrong and have nothing to hide.”
Maria Farmer, who said she was abused by Epstein and his convicted co-conspirator Ghislaine Maxwell at Wexner’s estate decades ago, has now accused the retail mogul of “downplaying his relationship with Epstein” during his deposition.
“I am glad Wexner’s deposition, this lever of power, is being used to try to achieve some accountability and justice for the many survivors whose trauma has for so long been ignored, dismissed, or discounted,” Farmer said in a statement shared with The Independent Saturday.
“Wexner’s reported downplaying of his relationship with Epstein is abhorrent, particularly given Maxwell’s own description of him as Epstein’s closest friend. I am also troubled by Wexner’s stated lack of knowledge about my abuse and suffering on his property,” she added.
Farmer said the abuse began 30 years ago.
“In the summer of 1996, I served as the artist-in-residence at Les Wexner’s estate. I was instructed to obtain a driver’s license using the address of Wexner’s home,” she said. “Later that summer, while working and living on Wexner’s estate, I suffered abuse at the hands of Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell.”
Farmer’s statement included a photo of her driver’s license at the time, which appears to list an Ohio address.
She also said Epstein stole photographs of her and her minor sisters, which she described as “private anatomically-revealing photographs I used for artistic reference and kept numbered in a lockbox.”
“When I attempted to escape Wexner’s estate, I was threatened by his employees and associates, sharpshooters, guns and guard dogs, and held against my will,” she added.
Farmer said she eventually escaped and reported Epstein and Maxwell to law enforcement.
“I told the FBI about Epstein and Maxwell’s sexual abuse of me on Wexner’s estate, the theft there of the images, and being held on Wexner’s estate,” she said.
Farmer’s report to the FBI was included in a trove of Epstein-related files released late last year. The document reveals Farmer told the agency Epstein stole photos she had taken of her 12- and 16-year-old sisters. Farmer later said in an interview this included nude photos, according to The New York Times
A spokesperson for Wexner directed The Independent to his opening statement to the committee, during which he acknowledged “the survivors of Epstein’s terrible crimes and the devastation that each of them has endured as a result,” and said his “heart goes out to each of them.”
“As Mr. Wexner testified, he never even heard of Maria Farmer until her account surfaced in the media,” the spokesperson told The Independent. “Ms. Farmer’s statement is incorrect in many respects. Contrary to her statement, Epstein’s house, where the abuse is said to have occurred, was not on land owned by the Wexners, was nearly one half mile away from the Wexner home, and was accessed through a separate driveway not controlled by Wexner security. There were no sharp shooters or guard dogs policing Epstein’s property.”
The Independent has requested additional comment from a representative for Farmer.
Wexner, the former CEO of Victoria’s Secret, has said he cut ties with Epstein in 2007 after discovering the financier was stealing from him. Epstein pleaded guilty to state-level charges of soliciting prostitution in Florida in 2008.
He told lawmakers Wednesday he was “conned by the World Olympic, all-time con artist.”
“As far as I was concerned, once we knew how bad he was, he was dead,” he said.
When asked about Farmer, Wexner replied: “I never met her, didn’t know she was here, didn’t know she was abused.”
The deposition also made headlines after Wexner’s attorney, Michael Levy, was caught on a hot mic telling him, “I will f***ing kill you if you answer another question with more than five words.”
The Independent has contacted Maxwell’s attorney for comment.

Huckabee draws backlash over claim Israel has right to much of Middle East

Muslim and Arab nations on Saturday condemned remarks by U.S. Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee, who said in an interview that Israel has a biblical right to control territory described in the Bible as the “Promised Land,” an area that would encompass much of today’s Middle East.
In the interview with conservative commentator Tucker Carlson, Huckabee was asked about the biblical promise to Abraham that his descendants would inherit land stretching “from the Nile to the Euphrates,” a territory spanning from Egypt through parts of modern-day Syria and Iraq. Carlson asserted that such a description would effectively include most of the Middle East and asked whether Israel was entitled to that land.
“That would be the Levant. So that would be Israel, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon. It would also be big parts of Saudi Arabia and Iraq,” Carlson said. “It would be,” Huckabee replied, appearing somewhat uncomfortable.
“Israel is a land that God gave through Abraham to a people that he chose. It was a people, a place and a purpose,” added Huckabee, an evangelical Christian. Pressed again by Carlson on whether the Jewish people have a right to all the territory mentioned in the Bible, Huckabee responded: “It would be fine if they took it all.”
Huckabee emphasized that Israel has no intention of expanding into those areas, but the comments quickly drew backlash.
Saudi Arabia called the ambassador’s remarks “dangerous” and “irresponsible.” In a statement, the Saudi Foreign Ministry said it “strongly condemns the statements of the U.S. ambassador to Israel, in which he recklessly suggested that Israeli control over all of the Middle East would be acceptable.” The ministry said the comments violated international law, the UN Charter and diplomatic norms.
“This extremist rhetoric portends grave consequences and threatens international peace and security by antagonizing the countries and peoples of the region and undermining the foundations of the international order,” the statement said.
“In this regard, the Kingdom reiterates its firm and longstanding position rejecting any actions that undermine the sovereignty, borders, and territorial integrity of states. It stresses that the only path toward a just and comprehensive peace is ending the occupation based on the two-state solution and the establishment of an independent Palestinian state along the 1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as its capital.”
Jordan described the remarks as “an infringement on the sovereignty of the countries of the region.” Egypt’s Foreign Ministry said Israel “has no sovereignty over the occupied Palestinian territory or other Arab lands,” calling the statement a “blatant violation of international law.”
The Palestinian Foreign Ministry protested Huckabee’s agreement with the idea that Israel has a biblical right to rule from the Nile to the Euphrates, saying the remarks contradict religious and historical facts, international law and the declared position of President Donald Trump opposing annexation of the West Bank.
The Arab League and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation also issued condemnations, saying the comments were extreme and provocative and do not reflect official U.S. policy. The Arab League said such statements “serve only to inflame sentiments and stir religious and national emotions.”
Later, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, Indonesia, Pakistan, Turkey, Qatar, Kuwait, Oman, Bahrain, Lebanon, Syria and the Palestinian Authority, along with the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, the Arab League and the Gulf Cooperation Council, released a joint statement expressing “strong condemnation and deep concern” over Huckabee’s remarks. The statement said it would be unacceptable for Israel to exercise control over territories belonging to Arab states, including the West Bank.
The interview also drew attention for additional controversial comments by Carlson. During the exchange, Carlson questioned whether Jews are truly descendants of Abraham and suggested conducting DNA tests on all residents of the land to determine who the “real” descendants are.
Neither the Israeli government nor the Trump administration immediately responded to the criticism.
The interview gained additional attention after Carlson claimed that members of his team had been detained for questioning at Israel’s Ben Gurion Airport, an assertion denied by both Israeli authorities and the U.S. administration.
Carlson, who for years hosted a popular prime-time program on Fox News and was once considered relatively mainstream within the U.S. conservative movement, was dismissed by the network in 2023 following a defamation lawsuit tied to false claims about the 2020 presidential election. Since then, he has become a prominent podcaster whose videos on the social media platform X draw tens of millions of views.
In recent years he has adopted a more hard-line and isolationist stance within the pro-Trump MAGA movement and has frequently criticized Israel, at times promoting conspiracy theories, including allegations that Israel’s Mossad intelligence agency operated disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein.

Islamic State claims two attacks on Syrian army, announce new operations
Islamic State claimed responsibility on Saturday for two attacks targeting Syrian army personnel in northern and eastern Syria, as the militant group signalled what it described as a new phase of operations against the country's leadership.
The militant group said on its Dabiq news agency that it had targeted "an individual of the apostate Syrian regime" in the city of Mayadin in Deir az-Zour province using a pistol, and attacked two other personnel with machine guns in the northern city of Raqqa.
Syria's Defence Ministry said in a statement that a Syrian army soldier and a civilian were killed on Saturday by "unknown assailants." A military source told Reuters the soldier belonged to the army's 42nd Division.
The attacks come amid a sharp escalation by IS against Syria's leadership under President Ahmed al-Sharaa, the former leader of an al Qaeda affiliate who broke with the group in 2016 before leading a coalition of Islamist factions that overthrew President Bashar al-Assad at the end of 2024.
On Saturday evening, IS released a recorded statement by its spokesperson, Abu Hudhayfa al-Ansari, who said Syria had "moved from Iranian occupation to Turkish-American occupation."
The group said it had begun a "new phase of operations" in Syria, describing Sharaa as a "watchdog" of the global coalition and vowing that his fate would be no different from that of Assad.
Sharaa signed Syria's accession to the global coalition to defeat IS during a visit to the US last November, when he met President Donald Trump.
The latest incidents come two days after IS claimed responsibility for another attack in Deir az-Zour that killed a member of the Interior Ministry's internal security forces and wounded another.
Several social media accounts and Telegram channels supporting IS have in recent hours called for intensified attacks using motorcycles and firearms.
IS has carried out six attacks against Syrian government targets since the fall of Assad.
A report by the UN Office of Counter-Terrorism released last week said Sharaa and two senior cabinet ministers had been targeted in five foiled assassination attempts by IS.

Is it time for the EU to stop funding the Palestinian Authority?

Is it time for the EU to stop funding the Palestinian Authority?
The European Union and its member states have long presented themselves as supporters of the Palestinian people, mainly through their backing of the Palestinian Authority (PA). But is this actually ‘solidarity’ with Palestinian aspirations, or a tool to perpetuate the Israeli occupation?
In reality, the consistent support that the EU has given the PA is more of a token gesture, rather than a true effort toward Palestinian liberation and justice. Rather than challenging and confronting the Israeli occupation and its complicity through sanctions, the EU’s support has become a tool for managing it.
In 1980, the EU’s position on Palestine was officially formed in the Venice declaration. That declaration articulated the “two-state” logic by recognising Israel’s “right to exist” along with other vague statements around “justice for all the people” and Palestinian rights to self-determination and right to return.
In the 1990s, during the negotiations leading to the Oslo Accords, the EU solidified its position. It viewed this period as a key opportunity to position itself as a champion of Palestinian statehood, invoking “international law and the principles of Oslo.” However, at its core, the EU understood the creation of the Palestinian Authority (PA), established as a temporary administrative body under Israeli occupation, as a mechanism to ensure the continuity of the Zionist project, with little or almost no regard for Palestinian rights.
Former Israeli foreign minister Shlomo Ben-Ami described the role of the Palestinian Authority following Oslo as “Israel’s collaborator”, tasked with oppressing any political or social uprisings against the Israeli occupation and reducing the Palestinian struggle to economic reforms and security issues.
In 1997, the EU signed the Interim Association Agreement on Trade and Cooperation with the PA. This agreement has served as the legal basis of the EU-PA relations. Since then, the EU started offering up to €300 million a year to the PA, focused on projects related to economic development and infrastructure - a code for PA stability amidst Israel’s occupation.
Doubling down
Under Ursula von der Leyen’s leadership, the European Commission has understood that the Zionist project, realised through the state of Israel, faces existential threats.
As European public opinion and civil mobilisation grow increasingly critical of the EU–Israel strategic alliance, Brussels has doubled down on sustaining that project by further instrumentalizing the Palestinian Authority (PA). It has increasingly presented the PA as the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people.
Almost two months into Israel’s genocide in Gaza, in late November 2023, former EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell argued that a Palestinian state offers Israel's best security guarantee, linking it to the stability of the PA. December 2023 saw €118 million provided for PA stability; July 2024 brought €400 million in emergency grants and loans tied to governance reforms, anti-corruption, and education.
On April 14, 2025, the EU hosted its first high-level dialogue with the PA in Luxembourg, proposing a €1.6 billion 2025-27 program - €620 million as direct PA budget support - for recovery and resilience. June 2025 added over €150 million, channelled via mechanisms like PEGASE for salaries and fiscal gaps. In 2025 alone, the PA has received €172 million in financial assistance from the EU.
In doing so, the EU seeks to mislead millions of Europeans who have taken to the streets demanding an end to EU-Israel relations. It attempts to convince audiences that the EU’s support for the Palestinian Authority (PA) equates to backing the Palestinian struggle.
In reality, the PA has long lost its legal and moral legitimacy. Its president has remained in power since 2005 without elections, and the institution is widely seen by Palestinians as a symbol of corruption, nepotism, clientelism, and the repression of dissent.
A staggering 87% of Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza believe that the PA is corrupt.
To sympathetic observers abroad, it may appear as a government-in-waiting, steadily building the institutions of a future state. But on the ground, and for the majority of Palestinians, it is widely perceived as an elite clinging to power, serving Israel’s interests (and its Western allies), and maintaining a façade of economic progress under an ever-expanding settler-colonial project that devours the West Bank, Gaza, and Jerusalem piece by piece, day after day.
Under Israel’s control at all times
Following the US‑backed peace plan, supported by Israel and allies like the EU, which identified education reform as a central element, the PA recently introduced major changes to the national school curriculum. The revisions remove much of the national content and adjust historical and cultural narratives, softening or eliminating references to the occupation, expulsion, and injustice while promoting narratives of peace and coexistence.
Lessons that previously focused on Palestinian political prisoners have been replaced with topics on extremism and broader social issues.
As Israel deepens its de facto annexation of the West Bank, the European Union’s billions in aid, taken from European taxpayers and given to the PA, are being wasted. Stripped of any real political or sovereign authority, the PA is only a local administrator of services under Israeli military control.
The EU, including its left-leaning parties, must face an uncomfortable truth: the Palestinian Authority represents no one but itself. It wields no power on the ground and cannot gain any while Israel’s military occupation endures and corruption eats its institutions.
Equally, the EU must confront reality: the so‑called two‑state solution, long used to justify political and financial support for the PA, is no longer viable. Decades of impunity for Israel’s settler‑colonial and apartheid regime have rendered it obsolete. Moreover, allowing anyone other than Palestinians to determine their future denies them their fundamental right to self‑determination, a right that belongs to them alone.
Instead of clinging to a failed model that entrenches injustice, the EU must first end its complicity in Israel’s occupation and then support the emergence of new, accountable Palestinian leadership. Only when the occupation ends can a truly representative leadership, reflective of people’s realities and wishes, arise to lead the struggle for justice, and ultimately lasting peace.

Kemi Badenoch pledges to cut interest paid on student loans
The Tories have promised to limit the rate on Plan B loans
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
Kemi Badenoch has pledged to cut the amount of interest paid on some student loans amid widespread concerns over costs.
The Tories have promised to limit the rate on Plan B loans to the retail price index (RPI) in a move that will heap further pressure on the Treasury.
Following Chancellor Rachel Reeves' November budget, the salary threshold at which repayments kick in under the system will be frozen at £29,385 for three years, leading to many having to pay more.
Interest on Plan 2 loans is charged at the rate of RPI inflation plus up to 3%, depending on how much a graduate earns.
The Conservative leader has announced plans to restrict this to RPI only, which the Tories argue would help higher numbers of graduates pay off their debt.
Ms Reeves has suggested the Government will be able to cut repayments on student loans by bringing down inflation, after a backlash to last November's budget announcement.
She said earlier this month: "By getting inflation down, we can also reduce the interest on student loans and I think that will make a big difference in making that more affordable."
Campaigners have accused the Treasury of acting like a loan shark, while Labour's deputy leader, Lucy Powell, described existing interest rates on Plan B loans as egregious and suggested the burden was unfair.
The Conservatives want to cut the number of university entrants by 100,000, which they say would save the Government £3.6 billion, and fund the same number of extra apprenticeships for 18 to 21-year-olds, as part of a "new deal for young people", the Sunday Times reported.
Young UK citizens starting their first full-time job would also see the first £5,000 of national insurance they pay put into a personal savings account, which could be used to buy a home.
Writing for the Telegraph, Mrs Badenoch said: "I am horrified at what graduates today are dealing with, and this is one of the reasons millions of young people feel they've been stitched up.
"Plan 2 student loans, the system most people who started university from 2012 to 2023 are on, increasingly feel like a scam."
She added: "If we want a country that rewards work, builds skill, and restores pride in practical achievement, we have to stop looking down on the very training routes that build the country."
The Treasury has been contacted for comment.

BERLIN, February 22. /TASS/. The United States may play a key role in the potential resumption of the Nord Stream pipelines’ work, German daily Berliner Zeitung reported citing its sources.
According to the daily, Washington may start delivering the Russian natural gas to Europe again, hoping to expand the United States' control over the energy infrastructure in the region. The German daily reports that negotiations, which are closed to the public and media, are allegedly underway on the possible resumption of the Nord Stream pipelines’ work.
French daily Le Monde diplomatique also reported earlier that informal contacts regarding the possible resumption of Nord Stream work are held without the participation of international institutions and are closed to the public. The daily called it "behind-the-scenes diplomacy."
Unprecedented damage to three strings of the Nord Stream 1 and Nord Stream 2 offshore gas pipelines was recorded on September 26, 2022. The Russian Prosecutor General’s Office opened a criminal case into an act of international terrorism.

NYC nursing walkout ends as last striking nurses approve new contract
Thousands of nurses at a major New York hospital system have approved a new contract, voting to end a strike after more than a month
- Bookmark
Nurses at a big New York hospital system approved a new contract Saturday, voting to end a major nursing strike after more than a month.
More than 4,000 nurses in the privately run NewYork-Presbyterian system went on strike Jan. 12. They are now due to start returning to work in the coming week. The union, called the New York State Nurses Association, said 93% of its members at NewYork-Presbyterian voted to ratify the three-year contract.
Two other big private hospital systems, Montefiore and Mount Sinai, ended their nurses’ walkout earlier this month by inking contract agreements with the same union.
“We are so happy with the wins we achieved, and now the fight to enforce these contracts and hold our employers accountable begins,” union President Nancy Hagans said in a statement Saturday.
NewYork-Presbyterian said that it looked forward to its nurses' return and that the contract "reflects our respect for our nurses and the critical role they play as part of our exceptional care teams.”
Both sides had said Friday that they had reached a tentative deal. Union members voted on it Friday and Saturday.
Provisions included staffing improvements, raises topping 12% over three years and safeguards on the use of artificial intelligence, according to the union.
The union has said the strike initially involved about 15,000 nurses overall at Montefiore, Mount Sinai and NewYork-Presbyterian. It affected only some facilities within the three systems and didn't involve any city-run hospitals.
During the strike, Montefiore, Mount Sinai and NewYork-Presbyterian brought on thousands of temporary nurses, transferred some patients and canceled some procedures. The hospitals insisted they were smoothly delivering care, including complex surgeries. But some vulnerable patients and their families said some routine tasks took longer.
The strikers complained of unmanageable workloads and accused the hospitals of trying to chip away at health benefits. The hospitals contested those claims and said the union’s demands were exorbitant.
Nurses at some Mount Sinai and Montefiore hospitals also walked out in 2023. That strike ended in three days.

Minister reveals process has started to ban Hizb ut-Tahrir under new hate laws
In short:
Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke says ASIO has determined the Islamist group Hizb ut-Tahrir meets the threshold to be banned under new hate group laws.
This is the first of two steps to ban the group under the laws passed last month.
Mr Burke also gave an update on the 34 Australians in Syria, saying the one woman he had temporarily blocked from entering the country was "very different" to the others.
The first step towards banning the Islamist group Hizb ut-Tahrir under new hate laws is complete, Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke has revealed.
The minister has also defended the government's handling of the group of Australians with links to Islamic State, saying it had been guided by the advice of ASIO.
Mr Burke told the ABC's Insiders he had been advised by ASIO that Hizb ut-Tahrir met the threshold to be listed under the new legal regime, which was established after the Bondi attack to capture those deemed to spread hate but not captured by existing laws.
Hizb ut-Tahrir was one of two groups the government had named as its main targets. The other, neo-Nazi group the National Socialist Network, disbanded in January.
Mr Burke said the next stage was a departmental briefing to satisfy him that the group increased the risk of hate-motivated violence, after which the opposition leader would be briefed and the attorney-general could sign off on a ban.
"The ASIO advice is now in. This is the first time we have been able to ban, potentially, a group which falls short of a terrorist listing," he said.
"It says you don't have to be specifically calling for, but you do have to be acting in a way that increases the risk of communal violence or politically-motivated violence."
The laws were passed in January with the support of the Liberal Party, but were opposed by the Nationals and the Greens who argued the scope was too broad.
Jonathon Duniam, the Coalition's home affairs spokesperson, welcomed the news, describing Hizb ut-Tahrir as a "hideous and insidious organisation".
"We've talked about it long enough … We are pleased this is happening, this is what we wanted to see with the laws," he said.
One member of Syria cohort a higher risk than others, Burke says
Mr Burke also responded to criticism from the Coalition that the government should be doing more to prevent a cohort of Australian citizens from leaving a refugee camp in Syria and returning to Australia.
The group of 34 women and children with links to former Islamic State fighters made a first, unsuccessful, attempt to leave Syria last week. A group of Australians has travelled to assist them and has Australian passports for them.
On Monday, Mr Burke issued one of the women with a temporary exclusion order, an effective blocker on an Australian return which he has the power to impose when an individual is deemed to pose a security threat.
But the opposition has questioned whether further exclusion orders should apply, and whether the government should have used its powers under the Passport Act to deny passport applications on security grounds.
"It's very clear… that the government can refuse a passport to an Australian citizen if they receive advice from a competent authority like ASIO or the AFP [Australian Federal Police] that that person is a threat to security," shadow defence spokesperson James Paterson told Sky News.
Mr Burke said none of the other 33 members of the group had been assessed by ASIO as meeting the bar for a temporary exclusion order.
"The cohort is not consistent," he said. "There are very different people in that cohort with different histories, and different states of mind if I put it in those terms.
"They are quite different, but our agencies have been following them for a long time. The fact that one person has been pulled out… for a temporary exclusion order is because, quite specifically, of what we know about that individual."
Mr Burke said the last time Australian officials had been on the ground in Syria and able to interview members of the cohort was in 2022, but that agencies "never stopped collecting information on people" and he would be guided by their advice.
While the minister does have powers to impose a temporary exclusion order without advice from ASIO, Mr Burke noted his decisions were subject to independent review and would be "thrown out" if he did not have sufficient grounds.
He added that the threshold for blocking a passport was higher than the threshold for imposing a temporary exclusion order and suggested none of the 34 met the bar, but did not elaborate on the difference.
Mr Burke denied a report in The Australian suggesting the government had written to Kurdish authorities overseeing the al-Roj camp, where the group remain, describing them as "terrorists", suggesting this was a misunderstanding due to "language issues".
He also denied a report in the Daily Telegraph that the federal government had held meetings with state governments to discuss repatriating the group.
Mr Burke said federal and state authorities had met to discuss security arrangements when it became apparent the group might return, but that the government was not assisting with repatriation.
Senator Duniam said the government was "not doing enough" and that the opposition was willing to work with the government to pass new laws to stop the return of the cohort.
"They are coming and this government is letting it happen … The best outcome here would be for these people not to come back to Australia," he said.
Senator Duniam said Mr Burke should "not hide behind advice" if his view was that the other members of the cohort were not a security threat.
"If he's so confident … he should say so," he said.

Kuwait summons Iraqi diplomat over Baghdad’s filing of maritime coordinates with UN

Kuwait has summoned Iraq’s chargé d’affaires to protest Baghdad’s submission to the UN of maritime coordinates and a map, saying the submission “infringes on Kuwaiti sovereignty” over established maritime areas.
The Kuwaiti Foreign Ministry said on Saturday that Iraq “had deposited a list of coordinates and a map with the UN that included claims regarding Iraqi maritime domains.”
It said the coordinates and map affect its sovereignty over maritime areas and fixed water elevations, including Fasht Al-Qaid and Fasht Al-Aij, which it described as not subject to any dispute regarding Kuwait’s full sovereignty.
The ministry said Acting Deputy Foreign Minister Aziz Rahim Al-Daihani summoned Zaid Abbas Shanshal “to deliver a formal protest note over Iraqi claims affecting Kuwait’s maritime sovereignty and related water elevations.”
Kuwait urged Iraq to take into account the historical ties between the two countries and to act responsibly in accordance with international law, including the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and bilateral understandings and agreements.
The UNCLOS entered into force in 1994 and establishes a comprehensive legal framework governing the world’s oceans, setting rules for the allocation of states’ rights and jurisdiction in maritime zones, the peaceful use of seas and oceans, and the management of marine resources.
Earlier Saturday, Iraq’s Foreign Ministry said it had deposited updated lists of coordinates for Iraq’s territorial sea baselines and maritime zones with the UN secretary-general on January 19 and February 9, in accordance with UNCLOS provisions.
It said the submission includes the determination of straight baselines and baselines drawn along the low-water line for measuring the breadth of the territorial sea, as well as the delimitation of the territorial sea, the contiguous zone, the exclusive economic zone and the continental shelf of Iraq, in accordance with the internationally recognised World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS-84).
Baghdad said the deposit replaces previous submissions dated December 7, 2021, and April 15, 2011, and aims “to update Iraq’s maritime data in line with the provisions of international law and enhance the legal clarity of the boundaries of maritime zones subject to Iraq’s sovereignty and sovereign rights.”
Iraq also said the coordinates and chart have been published on the website of the UN Division for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea and reiterated its commitment to international law and regional stability.

All nine bodies of skiers killed in California avalanche recovered

Officials announced on Saturday that the bodies of all nine missing skiers who were killed in a devastating avalanche in California had been recovered, following days of search efforts.
The avalanche happened in the Sierra Nevada mountains in northern California near Lake Tahoe, a popular skiing and winter sport destination. No more people are left missing after Tuesday’s deadly avalanche.
“While we wish we could have saved them all, we are grateful that we can bring them home,” said Nevada county sheriff Shannan Moon during a news conference on Saturday afternoon.
Moon praised the collective efforts of the numerous agencies that helped recover the bodies – from the California Highway Patrol to the National Guard to the Pacific Gas and Electric utility company – and 42 volunteers who helped on the last day of the operation.
“We are fortunate in this mountain community that we are very tight-knit, and our community shows up in times of tragedy,” Moon said.
The sheriff named for the first time the three guides from Blackbird Mountain Company who died: Andrew Alissandratos, 34, Nicole Choo, 42, and Michael Henry, 30.
Saturday’s recovery of the bodies marked the end of a five-day effort to locate nine missing skiers after one of the deadliest avalanches in recent history.
On Saturday morning, officials and agencies were able to finish the rescue operations with the assistance of a Black Hawk helicopter in the snowy region. Earlier in the week, six survivors were rescued, with eight others discovered dead and one declared missing and presumed dead. Four of the bodies were recovered on Friday evening and the last five were recovered on Saturday morning.
Among those dead were six women and three professional guides. More than 40 rescuers from various local and federal agencies took part in the effort on Saturday, including the Nevada county sheriff’s office and the California highway patrol, along with the Pacific Gas & Electric Company. Difficult weather and snowy conditions prevented the crews from rescuing the bodies earlier this week.
The avalanche has been the deadliest since 1981, with experts estimating the slide path was roughly the size of a football field, the AP reported.
In calls to dispatchers on Tuesday, it was reported that multiple skiers were reportedly buried by the avalanche. Later that night, rescuers and teams made contact with the six survivors and discovered others who had died. The teams were unable to recover the bodies due to brutal snowy conditions. The snow lab near Donner Pass had recorded 28in of snow that day with more expected and more avalanche risk warnings.
“I want to recognize the strength in the volunteers of all the search-and-rescue units that our agencies truly rely on,” Moon said. “They are pretty amazing people, and it’s an honor to work with them.”
The skiers had come from different parts of the US to enjoy a guided skiing tour last weekend. Their families said they were a close-knit group of friends who were experienced backcountry skiers and knew how to navigate the Sierra Nevada wilderness. The group had skied out to cabins near Frog Lake, where they stayed for two nights before starting on their return trip when the avalanche hit.
They were identified as Carrie Atkin, Liz Clabaugh, Danielle Keatley, Kate Morse, Caroline Sekar and Kate Vitt, all in their 40s. They lived in the San Francisco Bay Area, Idaho and the Lake Tahoe area.
“We are devastated beyond words,” the families said in a statement. “Our focus right now is supporting our children through this incredible tragedy and honoring the lives of these extraordinary women. They were all mothers, wives and friends, all of whom connected through the love of the outdoors.”
The terrain will be off-limits to visitors until mid-March, said Chris Feutrier, forest supervisor for the Tahoe national forest. Officials intended to restore public access once the investigation is complete.
“We are investigating the incident to determine if there were any factors that would be considered criminal negligence,” said a spokesperson for the sheriff’s office. “It is too early to know if criminal charges will be applicable, as the investigation is preliminary and remains active and ongoing. The district attorney’s office would ultimately be the determining authority for any criminal charges to be filed.”

Ukraine accuses Hungary, Slovakia of ‘blackmail’ over threats to cut electricity
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
KYIV - Ukraine’s Foreign Ministry condemned what it described as “ultimatums and blackmail” by the governments of Hungary and Slovakia on Feb 21, after they threatened to stop electricity supplies to Ukraine unless Kyiv restarts flows of Russian oil.
Shipments of Russian oil to Hungary and Slovakia have been cut off since Jan 27, when Kyiv says a Russian drone strike hit pipeline equipment
Slovakia and Hungary say Ukraine is to blame for the prolonged outage.
Slovakia’s Prime Minister Robert Fico said on Feb 21 that he would cut off emergency electricity supplies to Ukraine within two days unless Kyiv resumes Russian oil transit to Slovakia over Ukraine’s territory.
Hungary’s Viktor Orban made a similar threat days earlier.
The issue has become one of the angriest disputes yet between Ukraine and two neighbours that are members of the EU and NATO but whose leaders have bucked the largely pro-Ukrainian consensus in Europe to cultivate warm ties with Moscow.
Slovakia and Hungary are the only two EU countries that still rely on significant amounts of Russian oil shipped via the Soviet-era Druzhba pipeline over Ukraine.
“Ukraine rejects and condemns the ultimatums and blackmail by the governments of Hungary and the Slovak Republic regarding energy supplies between our countries,” the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
“Ultimatums should be sent to the Kremlin, and certainly not to Kyiv.”
Between them, Hungary and Slovakia have been providing around half of European emergency electricity exports to Ukraine, which Kyiv increasingly relies on as Russian attacks have damaged its grid.
“If oil supplies to Slovakia are not resumed on Monday, I will ask SEPS, the state-owned joint-stock company, to stop emergency electricity supplies to Ukraine,” Mr Fico said in a post on X.
Kyiv said that such actions were “provocative, irresponsible, and threaten the energy security of the entire region.”
Throughout the war that began with the full-scale Russian invasion whose fourth anniversary falls on Feb 24, Ukraine has allowed its territory to be used for Russian energy exports to Europe, which have been sharply curtailed but not halted.
Ukraine has proposed alternative transit routes to ship oil to Europe while emergency pipeline repair works are under way.
In a letter seen by Reuters, the Ukrainian mission to the EU proposed shipments through Ukraine’s oil transportation system or a maritime route, potentially including the Odesa-Brody pipeline linking Ukraine’s main Black Sea port to the EU.
Since October 2025, Russia has intensified its drone and missile attacks on the Ukrainian energy system, knocking out electricity and heat and plunging millions of Ukrainians into long blackouts during bitterly cold winter temperatures. REUTERS

The U.S.’s Olympic Legacy in Figure Skating Will Be More Profound Than Medals

In the end, Ilia Malinin chose to rely on the medium he knows best to express his deepest thoughts. And despite his struggles at the 2026 Milano Cortina Olympics, his skate at the Feb. 21 exhibition gala helped him to address those challenges and speak directly with the audience who had supported him along the way.
Malinin had been the heavy favorite to win gold at his first Olympics Games. During the men’s figure skating free program, he set out to make Olympic history by planning to land seven quadruple jumps in a single program—a technical feat that would have underscored his dominance in the skating world and landed him on top of the podium. He popped the first one he intended, the quad axel, which only he has landed in competition, but wasn’t able to muster enough of his remaining skills to stay ahead of his competitors. The self-styled “Quad God,” thought to be one of the sure things in the always unpredictable Olympics, finished eighth overall.
How Malinin skated that program, it turns out, was a message to the world—one that grappled with the weight of expectations that Malinin was dealing with. He hadn’t spoken publicly about the pressure he has been feeling, he says, throughout this Olympic season. Touted as the next Olympic champion, Malinin experienced extraordinary demands on his time and mental energy that eroded his confidence and led to his first loss in nearly two years.
More than a week later, skating in the Olympic exhibition gala, Malinin again chose to speak on the ice, with a program he has been working on for a few months with a friend who cut the music, called Fear, from one of his favorite artists, NF. The program is a sober representation of the loss of control Malinin says he’s been feeling as the hype and expectation around his Olympic debut built. He teased the routine following his free program, posting on his account a clip that depicts an overwhelming cascade of pinging social media alerts. He opened the program with the sounds of that flood of messages, and mimed scrolling through them before putting his hands to his head and flipping the hood of his grey sweatshirt, stamped with the word ‘Fear,’ over his head.
“I really just wanted to share an extension of my thoughts and something that I’ve been feeling for this whole Olympic season,” he says. “There’s been so much pressure, so much doubt, and everything around me, the noise, the media, the people, the environment—it’s been so overwhelming.”
The lyrics are especially poignant for Malinin: “Like a puppet, with strings, I just don’t have the choice. What’s the truth? What’s a lie? … “On the verge, on the edge, Is this what you wanted? Petrified, scared to death, Is this what you wanted?...Breakin’ down, spiralin’, Is this what you wanted? What you wanted? Is this what you wanted?”
The program was an emotional appeal to the public to see him as “a human being,” he said. “We also have real thoughts, real feelings, even though it looks like we’re completely like robots and [have] superhuman abilities. But in the end, deep inside, we’re still similar [to] all of you.”
Malinin, of course, isn’t the first to address the nearly impossible expectations that people put on celebrities or elite athletes, in particular Olympians. Gymnast Simone Biles has used similar words in describing the dangers of forgetting that athletes are people too—individuals who experience the same pressure, anxieties, and pain from hurtful remarks and uninformed criticism as anyone else.
But perhaps more than any previous Olympics, these Games, and this U.S. figure skating team in particular, have taken up the mantle of mental health, making it a priority, rather than an afterthought. The U.S. women’s squad of Alysa Liu, Amber Glenn, and Isabeau Levito has been making headlines for its uniquely close relationship, and questioning why they can’t successfully balance friendship and competition. When asked after making the Olympic team about the novelty of the strong bond between them, Liu seemed baffled, apparently not understanding why it was considered so unusual for them to be so close and supportive of one another.
But in skating—and among women in particular, such camaraderie hasn’t been the norm. Young girls are taught from early in their careers to hide their feelings, smile no matter what they’re experiencing inside, and never allow their rivals to see their weaknesses. The rigidity of that system is one of the reasons Liu quit the sport at 16, before deciding to return, on her own terms, two years later.
When Glenn missed a jump combination in the short program that put her in 13th place going into the final, it was Liu who was among the first to give her a hug and comfort her. She helped Glenn put the mistake behind her and skate a strong free program to pull up to fifth. And that supportive instinct extends beyond just her teammates. When Japan’s Kaori Sakamoto missed a jump in the free program and realized she would miss earning gold, her emotions overtook her and couldn’t stop the tears. Glenn stepped in to hug her and shield her from prying cameras that had zoomed in on the distraught Sakamoto.
To Glenn, Liu, and Levito, such expressions take precedence over medals or standings. “I’m thankful for the amount of success that we’ve had with that, because it’s not made us less competitive, it’s not led to any falters on the ice,” Glenn said. “That’s one of the most beautiful things about sport, it’s not just what we do out there when we perform, but the journey and the people who surround us during it. I think that is something that will improve so many athletes’ lives, and that’s what I’ve wanted to do.”
One of them will be Malinin, who will leave Milan “learning to get back up and keep going,” he says. “It’s still just figure skating. And sometimes the medals don’t mean as much as who you are as a person and what you truly bring to the world around you.”

‘We are not’: Burke rejects claims government repatriating IS brides
Updated ,first published
Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke says national security and counterterrorism agencies have met to discuss any risks to security posed by the potential return of 34 women and children linked to Islamic State, but he denied the government was helping them come back to Australia.
Burke said one woman would be prohibited from returning from the al-Roj camp in north-east Syria, but intelligence agencies had not determined the remaining members of the so-called IS brides group posed a threat. The women and children have been issued Australian passports, which the government says is a legal requirement.
The minister denied that those moves amounted to assistance or repatriation, after a News Corp article reported that high-level briefings had been ongoing for months between NSW, Victoria and federal agencies to repatriate the group and make arrangements for their return.
“In that [News Corp] report, it makes a claim that we are conducting repatriation. We are not. It claims we have been meeting with the states for the purposes of a repatriation. We have not,” Burke said on the ABC’s Insiders program on Sunday morning.
“Our authorities meet with the state authorities to make sure that we are prepared if there is any chance of there being a heightened risk to national security.
“As soon as the conditions of the camp started to deteriorate, and there was a possibility some people would be getting out, which has happened … the national security teams, the joint counterterrorism teams, meet, as they did under the previous government, as they do now, as is essential for public safety.”
A NSW Premier’s Department spokesperson said state agencies were working with the federal government on law enforcement and security arrangements.
“NSW will continue working with Commonwealth agencies to manage any security risks. Any matters relating to warrants or arrests will be handled by NSW Police,” they said.
“NSW has well-established arrangements in place to manage any returnees, with community safety as the overriding priority. These arrangements were successfully implemented in 2019 and 2022 [when other cohorts returned to Australia].”
Former home affairs head Mike Pezzullo told a parliamentary inquiry in 2022 that the states and the federal government worked collaboratively on these issues.
“The joint counterterrorism teams in each of the states have a view about what needs to be done to mitigate the most egregious risks,” he said.
“If a state government chose to say, ‘We don’t want to proceed’, then I would have thought the Commonwealth would take that pretty seriously, because we have to rely on them for schooling, trauma support, counselling, public health support and the like. So it’s done consensually. All that information is put to them, and then they’ll give us the authority to proceed or otherwise.“
The Albanese government has taken a hard line against the group of Australian women and children who are attempting to leave the al-Roj camp, saying it is not assisting their return.
On the issue of them receiving passports, Burke said: “The process has happened as a bureaucratic process of officials obeying the law, and doing what they’re obliged to do by law, with nothing coming from any ministerial level encouraging that process along.”
But the Coalition is pressuring the government to deny the group re-entry to Australia with temporary exclusion orders, which are designed to protect Australians from national security risks.
One of the group of 34 has been prevented from returning to Australia under an exclusion order.
Burke said that woman had been deemed by intelligence agencies to pose a higher risk. He said the rest of the group had not met the threshold for exclusion orders, according to advice.
“Other than a temporary exclusion order, there isn’t a legislative power to stop an Australian citizen from entering Australia,” he said.
“One of my concerns with how the opposition have handled this, is they have effectively said the minister [should] be able to make it up ... as though somehow in national security portfolio you should ignore your national security intelligence and law enforcement agencies.”
Burke said agencies had been following the group of women and children for a long time, and each had different histories and states of mind. “The cohort is not consistent,” he said.
Asked whether the remaining 33 people did not pose a threat to Australia, Burke said: “That’s right.”
He said he would take seriously any advice to the contrary, but that “on the information we have, the best way to protect Australians has not involved any further temporary exclusion orders”.
Coalition home affairs spokesman Jonno Duniam accused Burke of hiding behind advice.
“We haven’t seen that advice, and again it should be straightforward enough for the minister to allay concerns. If he is so confident that these people aren’t a risk, he should just say so, not hide behind advice,” Duniam said.
“These are people we don’t think should be back in this country and that pose a risk to our country. Now if the government are serious, and the minister himself said it again today, ‘we don’t want them back here’, do something about it.
“The Coalition have said that they would work with the government on laws to prevent re-entry of this cohort back into Australia, strengthen arrangements around temporary exclusion orders, strengthen arrangements around passport laws. There are ways of doing this.”

Maccabi Tel Aviv fan ban may have been politically influenced, say MPs
New report on the row also criticises Keir Starmer for heightening tensions
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
Local political pressure may have influenced the decision to prohibit Maccabi Tel Aviv football fans from attending a match against Aston Villa, a parliamentary committee has concluded.
The Home Affairs Committee said that Birmingham councillors had a “disproportionate opportunity to exert influence”, which undermined confidence that the decision was based on evidence and safety.
Supporters were barred from the 6 November game at Villa Park by the local safety advisory group (SAG), citing safety concerns based on advice from West Midlands Police (WMP).
A subsequent review revealed an "AI hallucination" generated by Microsoft Copilot had helped police to justify the ban.
Copilot erroneously referenced a non-existent match between Tel Aviv and West Ham.
Chief Constable Craig Guildford has since resigned from his position amid significant pressure following the controversy.
In a new report on the row, the Home Affairs Committee said it could not rule out that political pressure had played a part in the decision.
The report said WMP’s concerns about disorder “combined with local political pressure and community tensions related to the international situation” led to the move.
The report continued: “While we cannot conclude that the Safety Advisory Group’s decision was made because of political pressure, on the basis of the evidence we have seen we also cannot conclude with any confidence that the decision was not politically influenced.
“It is clear that on this occasion councillors, with a stated political aim, had a disproportionate opportunity to influence Safety Advisory Group decision-making on a deeply divisive political issue.
“While the presence of elected politicians on Safety Advisory Groups has potential benefits in terms of local representation, it also risks decision-making becoming politically motivated, undermining trust in the process.”
The Cabinet Office should ban local councillors from sitting on SAGs, the group of MPs said.
Chair of the Home Affairs Committee Dame Karen Bradley said: “It is an extraordinary measure to decide to ban fans from attending a fixture, particularly in the cultural and political climate that this occurred in.
“It is vital that trust is rebuilt. West Midlands Police must repair the damage that has been done by working hard to reach out to local communities, particularly Jewish communities.
“They must also ensure that there is a cultural shift around decision making where assumptions are tested and evidence fully checked.”
Elsewhere, the committee criticised ministers, including the prime minister and home secretary, for heightening tensions by criticising the move too late.
By intervening after the decision to ban away fans had already been publicly announced, the Government escalated the situation and was “ineffectual” in enabling the Israeli fans to attend, it said.
The Home Office and the Department for Culture, Media and Sport were told on 8 October 2025 that Maccabi fans were likely to be barred – a week before the decision was announced.
The Israeli team’s fans could still have been able to come “if the Government had intervened privately at this point”, the committee concluded.
On the day the decision was made public, Sir Keir Starmer posted on X calling it “the wrong decision” and saying the Government “will not tolerate antisemitism on our streets”.
The same day, Shabana Mahmood posted on X that the Government “is doing everything in our power to ensure all fans can safely attend the game”.
The public interventions increased the profile of the subsequent fixture, “which in turn increased risk”, the report concluded.

Malaysia’s vape ban plan leaves 1.4 million users in regulatory limbo
An estimated 1.4 million Malaysian adults vape, despite existing curbs. Many say new laws will simply push them back to cigarettes
The vapes used to be obvious. Bright displays of flavoured liquid, a shop just down the road, a transaction as unremarkable as buying shampoo. Batrisyia, 28, remembers how easy it was.
Those days are gone. Or rather, in Malaysia at least, the trade has moved under the table.
“It’s definitely less open now,” said Batrisyia, a Johor native who asked to be identified by a pseudonym for fear of backlash. “You don’t see big vape displays like before, and we can’t buy online any more. But it hasn’t disappeared. Some shops sell quietly behind the counter or in the back.”
She paused, holding a slim, pen-like device in her hand. “You just have to ask for it.”
The device is almost elegant in its simplicity: swap out the small pod cartridge, pick a flavour, inhale the vapour. It leaves no lingering smell on clothes or hands, none of cigarettes’ telltale signs. For Batrisyia, discretion was always part of the appeal.
In her small town of Pontian, at the southern tip of Peninsular Malaysia, that discretion has taken on a new dimension.

British submarine arrives for ‘extraordinary’ AUKUS visit

British submarine arrives for ‘extraordinary’ AUKUS visit
A British nuclear-powered submarine has arrived in Australia for an unprecedented month-long visit despite the well-chronicled problems plaguing the British navy’s ability to send its vessels to sea.
The British and Australian governments are holding up the visit as a sign of the countries’ commitment to the AUKUS pact, even as the United Kingdom views Russia as its most pressing security threat.
HMS Anson, an Astute-class nuclear-powered submarine, arrived on Sunday at the HMAS Stirling naval base in Perth for a month-long maintenance visit.
Defence Minister Richard Marles and Defence Industry Minister Pat Conroy described the first such visit by a UK nuclear‑powered submarine in Australia as a “historic step in our nation’s readiness to operate and maintain conventionally armed, nuclear‑powered submarines”.
HMS Anson, which was commissioned in 2022, is reportedly the only available submarine in the British navy’s fleet of five Astute-class boats, highlighting the significance of the extended deployment to Australia.
British defence publication Navy Lookout has written that the “timing of the deployment seems extraordinary” as the British navy does not have any other Astute-class submarines available.
“The UK must continue to play its part in AUKUS, but in the short term, perhaps more local concerns should be the priority,” the publication argued this month.
“Placing the sole attack submarine on the other side of the globe appears to be at odds with vigorous official warnings to Russia that ‘any threat will be met with strength and resolve’.”
Navy Lookout said the British navy’s other four Astute-class submarines were “all at low or very low readiness”.
Conroy described the visit as “an important milestone that will build confidence in our strategic partners that we have the workforce able to deliver AUKUS submarines, and also lays ground for more jobs for locals”.
Two Australian navy officers have been embedded on the submarine to gain a better understanding of how nuclear-powered submarines operate.
The Australian navy will also conduct tests of its Speartooth large underwater drone to see how it operates with the British submarine at sea.
Britain’s deputy high commissioner to Australia, Brian Jones, said the visit “sends a simple message of our water-tight commitment to AUKUS”.
“Our security as the UK is global, and we are committed to contributing to the security and stability wherever that might be,” he said.
“Our shared prosperity with Australia depends on that security ... Deploying one of our most capable defence assets into this region reflects our commitment to work with our close partners to uphold peace, security and stability.”
According to the British navy, the Astute-class submarines “are the largest, most advanced and most powerful attack submarines ever operated by the Royal Navy, combining world-leading sensors, design and weaponry in a versatile vessel”.
While nuclear-powered, these submarines do not carry nuclear weapons.
American nuclear-powered submarines made similar maintenance visits to Australia in 2024 and 2025, following the announcement of the AUKUS delivery plan in 2023.
The plan involves the US selling Australia at least three Virginia-class submarines while the UK and Australia partner on the development of a new class of submarine known as the SSN-AUKUS.
US senator Tim Kaine told this masthead last week he believed there was a “100 per cent chance” the US would provide the submarines to Australia as promised despite sluggish production rates at American shipyards.
Retired rear admiral Philip Mathias, a former director of nuclear policy with the UK Ministry of Defence, told this masthead last month he feared Australians were not adequately informed about how the troubles plaguing the British navy could scuttle the SSN-AUKUS plan.
“Whilst the United States may sell some [nuclear-powered submarines] to Australia, there is a high probability that the UK element of AUKUS will fail,” he said.
Mathias, who led a 2010 review of the UK Trident nuclear-weapons system, said: “It is clear that Australia has shown a great deal of naivety and did not conduct sufficient due diligence on the parlous state of the UK’s nuclear submarine program before signing up to AUKUS – and parting with billions of dollars, which it has already started to do.”
The head of the British navy, First Sea Lord Gwyn Jenkins, ordered an urgent 100-day drive to tackle systemic delays in the UK submarine program in October.
UK publication Defence Eye reported that the British navy “has struggled to put more than one of its five Astute boats to sea at a time” and that “for a number of months over the past two years, no Astute boats have been at sea”.

Australian dual citizens scramble as UK border crackdown set to begin

UK passport changes leave Australians with dual citizenship scrambling before border rules kick in
In short:
Australians with British or Irish dual citizenship may be denied travel to the UK from February 25 unless they carry a valid British or Irish passport, or certificate of entitlement.
The rules were formally announced by the UK Home Office last year but many say they only became aware of the change via news reports in recent weeks.
What's next?
Travel industry leaders are calling on the UK government to delay the rollout, warning Australians could miss long-planned trips.
There are calls for the British government to delay tough new border rules set to take effect in days.
From Wednesday, dual citizens of the UK and Ireland will have to follow new passport regulations when entering the UK.
Travellers with dual citizenship will need to present a British or Irish passport, or a certificate of entitlement at border control checkpoints and airlines will enforce the new rules prior to departure.
The Australian government's Smartraveller advice is that these requirements will be strictly enforced, and Australians with dual citizenship may not be able to board flights to the UK unless they carry the right travel documents.
The rules also apply from non-Australian departure points, including by international rail, coach or ferry, with carriers required to check that passengers hold valid UK entry permission before boarding under the new UK Home Office "no permission, no travel" system.
Loading...The rules were formally announced by the UK Home Office last year but many say they only became aware of the change via news reports in recent weeks.
For many, the changes prompted a frantic search for documents needed to begin passport applications throwing long-planned trips into doubt, with critics slamming the government for poor communication.
Adding to frustrations, British passports and Certificates of Entitlement (COE) can take between three and six weeks to process.
Australian Travel Industry Association (ATIA) CEO Dean Long said the changes were "unethical" and he'd written to the UK Home Office urging them to extend the February 25 deadline.
"It is causing chaos … it's an ill-thought-through strategy that has unfortunately created massive disruption for thousands of people,"Mr Long said.
The British government said the new regulations were in line with other countries' border policies and would strengthen national security.
A holiday turned nightmare
For Laura Burke, from the New South Wales Central Coast, the rules have turned what should have been a joyful family trip into a logistical nightmare.
Laura, an Australian citizen born in England, booked non-refundable flights for a March trip to the UK with her husband and their two young children, including three-month-old Masie, for her step-father's 70th birthday.
What she thought would be routine — applying for an Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA) using their Australian passports — quickly turned into a last-minute scramble.
"I was scrolling Facebook and saw a post about the new rules," Ms Burke said.
"At first, I thought we could just get ETAs. But then I realised Masie and our older daughter are considered British citizens by descent, even if they've never held British passports, so they have to have UK passports too."
She said efforts to reach the UK Passport Office and the British High Commission brought mixed responses and a lot of stress.
"I'd call one department and get told to call another," she said. "No-one would give a straight answer."
The family rushed to apply for overseas documents including the birth certificate of Laura's father and her parents' marriage certificate. They're still waiting on British passports for their children.
"We still don't know if we'll get them in time," she said.
"It's incredibly stressful … you don't want to cry, but it just means a lot, seeing family, meeting babies for the first time."
Race against time
Stephen Davis said his experience was similar.
Having left the UK decades ago, the Sydney Blue Mountains resident assumed he could enter the country on his Australian passport as he always had.
It was only after reading an ABC article outlining the new rules that he realised his fast-approaching trip to celebrate his friend's 70th birthday was in doubt.
"The travel agents I spoke to didn't know, my British friends and family didn't know. It makes you wonder how many others will get caught out," he said.
He initially tried to get an Emergency Travel Document but his British passport, which expired in 2008, was considered too old, meaning he had no choice but to apply for a full passport renewal.
"It's been incredibly stressful,"he said.
"I'm relatively tech-savvy and persistent but I can't imagine how challenging it would be for someone who isn't," he said.
"The lack of communication has been the frustrating part, it's been incredibly difficult to get the information I needed, I've spoken to so many different people, webchats, it's just been a nightmare."
Industry warns of chaos
The ATIA has written to Australia's Foreign Minister Penny Wong about their concerns.
"We're seeing significant disruption, cancellations and financial loss because people did everything right when they booked but have been blindsided by this change," Mr Long said.
"Many people don't even realise they are considered UK citizens until they're confronted with these requirements.
"They need time to decide whether to renew their passports, apply for certificates, or renounce citizenship altogether."
Confusion and calls to delay
Across social media and travel forums, frustration is mounting.
Hundreds of Australians contacted the ABC saying they feel misled, unaware of their dual citizenship status, or confused by contradictory online information about travel eligibility.
Some are even considering renouncing their UK citizenship to avoid the passport process, though doing so is neither straightforward nor inexpensive — the renunciation process can take months, involves significant fees, and may not be approved by the UK government.
The parents of dual citizens also cannot renounce their children's British citizenship on their behalf — applicants must be over 18.
The British government said the changes were necessary as part of modernising border controls.
In a statement to ABC, the British High Commission said the updated rules reflect the UK's move to a more digitised immigration system and are designed to improve security and efficiency.
What travellers should know
Australians planning travel to the UK from February 25, 2026 should be aware:
- Dual British/Irish citizens must enter the UK on a valid British or Irish passport or have a Certificate of Entitlement.
- Dual citizens will be required to carry both their Australian passport for exiting and entering Australia, and their British passport, for entering the UK.
- Dual citizens cannot use an ETA or visa to enter the UK.
- Airlines and carriers will enforce the requirements at check-in, not just at border control.
- Processing times for passports and certificates can take weeks, so travellers should act now.
More information is available at the Australian Government's Smartraveller site.

Russian missile strikes Oreo factory in Ukraine, foreign minister says

Feb 21 - An Oreo cookie plant in eastern Ukraine was struck by a Russian missile on Saturday, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said in a post on X, the second time the factory has been damaged since the war began in 2022.
No one was killed, but a production building was damaged, Sybiha wrote. The facility, located in Trostyanets, is owned by snack giant Mondelez International.
The Chicago-based company, which also makes Ritz crackers, Toblerone chocolate and Trident gum, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Saturday evening. The Kremlin did not immediately respond to a request for comment overnight on Saturday.
"When Russian missiles hit such sites, they are not only targeting Ukraine," Sybiha wrote. "They are targeting American business interests in Europe."
The same factory was badly damaged in 2022 during Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The plant partially reopened in 2023 to make chocolate and then resumed manufacturing Oreos in 2024.
Mondelez has faced criticism for continuing business operations in Russia during the war. REUTERS

Trump pulls endorsement of Colorado Republican Jeff Hurd over tariff votes
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
WASHINGTON – US President Donald Trump withdrew his endorsement of US representative Jeff Hurd for reelection after the Colorado Republican voted against the president’s tariffs.
“Congressman Hurd is one of a small number of Legislators who have let me and our Country down. He is more interested in protecting Foreign Countries that have been ripping us off for decades than he is the United States of America,” Mr Trump wrote in a Truth Social post Feb 21, saying that it was “a difficult decision” for him.
Mr Trump is instead endorsing Ms Hope Scheppelman, a critical care nurse and Navy veteran who previously served as vice-chair of the state Republican Party.
Ms Scheppelman “knows the America First Policies required, and will do everything necessary to Defend our Country, Support our Military/Veterans, and Ensure PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH,” Mr Trump wrote.
Mr Hurd, a first-term congressman sided with Democrats to pass legislation on Feb 12 aimed at ending the White House’s duties on Canada.
Republicans Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, Thomas Massie of Kentucky, Don Bacon of Nebraska, Kevin Kiley of California and Dan Newhouse of Washington state also voted to end the Canadian tariffs.
“If we normalise broad emergency trade powers today, we should expect that a future president – of either party – will rely on the same authority in ways many of us would strongly oppose,” Mr Hurd wrote in a statement after his vote.
“My responsibility is to defend the separation of powers regardless of political convenience.”
Since the vote against tariffs, the Supreme Court has ruled that Mr Trump’s use of emergency powers to impose levies around the world was unconstitutional and required Congress’s approval. BLOOMBERG

Israeli modeling tycoon linked to Epstein Affair claims 'I did not know about criminal activity'

Jean-Luc Brunel, owner of the international modeling agency MC2, and Ofer Raphaeli, who owns the agency's Tel Aviv branch, allegedly helped Jeffrey Epstein recruit underage models, according to a Channel 12 report aired on Saturday night.
Channel 12 presented emails between Epstein and Brunel as evidence for these claims. In response, Raphaeli stated that he was consulting with a lawyer and was considering filing a defamation lawsuit against those involved in order to protect both his own reputation and the agency's standing in Israel.
Ofer Raphaeli, who founded the Israeli branch of MC2, gave an exclusive statement to Ma'ariv, saying: “I met Jeffrey Epstein only twice, by chance, for a few minutes. There was no friendship, business connection, or any other connection between us. The emails with New Year greetings and "Happy Holidays" were routinely sent to many recipients, including Epstein’s email address."
“I had a relationship with agent Jean-Luc Brunel," Raphaeli added. "I was unaware of any criminal activity by the agency in New York, and to the best of my knowledge, he was never convicted [of any crime]. The agencies in Miami and New York were closed several years ago. The agency in Israel has been under my ownership and management since its establishment in 2000, and I have never managed the New York branch except during my visit in 2004 for work purposes only."
Latest Epstein files release unleashes wave of antisemitic conspiracy theories on social media
Since the financial advisor and sex trafficker’s arrest by federal authorities in July 2019 and alleged death by suicide a month later, antisemitic conspiracy theories about him have circulated widely, often invoking his Jewish identity and connections with Jewish and Israeli leaders.
But the Justice Department’s newly released batch of Epstein files on February 6, which contained over 3 million pages of documents, took things to a new intensity.
“If you think Epstein was just some rich pedo, you’re missing the big picture,” wrote the X/Twitter account Clandestine, which has more than 734,000 followers. “Epstein was part of the satanic global elite that pulls the strings from the shadows. Epstein was a Deep State puppet master.”
Among the real revelations in the documents are a variety of exchanges of relevance to the broader Jewish world. Those include revelations that various Jewish nonprofits had courted Epstein for donations even after his conviction, evidence of Epstein’s financial ties with several Orthodox yeshivas, and new details about his well-known relationship with former prime minister Ehud Barak.
Some of the largest conspiracist personalities seized on the new document dump, claiming that it confirmed their longstanding beliefs about secret Jewish control.
“Remember the end of last year when I was called antisemitic for telling you this is the literal, religious worldview of many people in power?” Candace Owens, right-wing commentator turned conspiracist, wrote in a post on X responding to a photo of an email where Epstein used the term "goy." “Type in ‘goy’ or ‘goyim’ in the Epstein files and be sure to tag a Christian who needs to wake up and leave the Zionist cause.”

Islamic State begins new phase of operations against Syrian regime with two terror attacks

Islamic State claimed responsibility on Saturday for two attacks targeting Syrian army personnel in northern and eastern Syria, as the terrorist group signaled what it described as a new phase of operations against the country’s leadership.
The terrorist group said on its Dabiq news agency that it had targeted “an individual of the apostate Syrian regime” in the city of Mayadin in Deir al-Zor province using a pistol, and attacked two other personnel with machine guns in the northern city of Raqqa.
Syria’s Defence Ministry said in a statement that a Syrian army soldier and a civilian were killed on Saturday by “unknown assailants.” A military source told Reuters the soldier belonged to the army’s 42nd Division.
The attacks come amid a sharp escalation by IS against Syria’s leadership under President Ahmed al-Sharaa, a former al Qaeda leader who broke with the group in 2016 before leading a coalition of Islamist factions that overthrew President Bashar al-Assad at the end of 2024.
On Saturday evening, IS released a recorded statement by its spokesperson, Abu Hudhayfa al-Ansari, who said Syria had “moved from Iranian occupation to Turkish-American occupation.”
The group said it had begun a “new phase of operations” in Syria, describing Sharaa as a “watchdog” of the global coalition and vowing that his fate would be no different from that of Assad.
Sharaa signed Syria’s accession to the global coalition to defeat IS during a visit to the US last November, when he met President Donald Trump.
Islamic State intensifying attacks on Syrian regime
The latest incidents come two days after IS claimed responsibility for another attack in Deir al-Zor that killed a member of the Interior Ministry’s internal security forces and wounded another.
Several social media accounts and Telegram channels supporting IS have in recent hours called for intensified attacks using motorcycles and firearms.
IS has carried out six attacks against Syrian government targets since the fall of Assad.
A report by the UN Office of Counter-Terrorism released last week said Sharaa and two senior cabinet ministers had been targeted in five foiled assassination attempts by IS.

WASHINGTON - The Supreme Court may have ruled 6-3 against US President Donald Trump’s use of an international emergency law to impose tariffs. But Mr Trump seems intent on continuing the experiment he has run with the US economy over the past year, in which he has raised tariffs to levels not seen since the 1930s.
In a news conference at the White House on Feb 20, Mr Trump made a series of false claims about the economic impact of tariffs, and he promised to replace, or even increase, them using laws other than the one the court rejected.

Berlin film festival: Ilker Catak's 'Yellow Letters' wins the Golden Bear award
France

"Yellow Letters," directed by German filmmaker Ilker Catak, won the Golden Bear for best film at the Berlin Film Festival on Saturday, February 21, in a ceremony reflecting the controversy over Gaza which has dogged this year's edition of the event.
A political drama, Catak's film tells the story of a Turkish director and his actor wife, suddenly barred from working because of their political opinions.
Jury president Wim Wenders called the film "a terrifying premonition, a look into the near future that could possibly happen in our countries as well."
"This is a movie that speaks up very clearly about the political language of totalitarianism as opposed to the empathetic language of cinema," Wenders said.
Catak called Wenders "one of my teachers," adding: "It's such an incredible thing to receive this award from you."
The runner-up Silver Bear Grand Jury Prize went to "Salvation" by Emin Alper, who in his speech mentioned his solidarity with several high-profile opposition figures in prison in Turkey, including jailed Istanbul mayor Ekrem Imamoglu.
Alper also took the opportunity to speak up for "the people of Iran suffering under tyranny" and "the Palestinians in Gaza living and dying under the most terrible conditions."
'Part of democracy'
Speaking at a press conference at the beginning of the festival last week, Wenders answered a question about the German government's support for Israel by saying: "We cannot really enter the field of politics."
At the same press conference, he had said that films had the power to "change the world" but in a different way from politics.
His comments in response to the question on Israel prompted a storm of outrage.
Award-winning Indian novelist Arundhati Roy, who had been due to present a restored version of a 1989 film she wrote, pulled out of the event, branding Wenders' words "unconscionable" and "jaw-dropping."
On Tuesday, an open letter signed by dozens of film industry figures, including actors Javier Bardem and Tilda Swinton and director Adam McKay, condemned the Berlin festival's "silence on the genocide of Palestinians" and accused it of being involved in "censoring" artists who oppose Israel's actions.
Director Tricia Tuttle, in her second year at the helm of the Berlinale, has firmly rejected the accusations.
In a speech at the beginning of Saturday's ceremony, she said that "speaking up is part of democracy."
"We respect people speaking out because it takes a lot of courage to do it," she said, adding: "We don't always agree with every claim that's made about us."
'Queen at Sea'
Other big award winners included German actress Sandra Hüller, who received the Silver Bear for Best Performance for her title role in Markus Schleinzer's "Rose."
The black-and-white drama tells the story of a woman passing herself off as a man in rural 17th-century Germany to escape the constraints of patriarchy.
"Queen at Sea" by American director Lance Hammer, which stars Juliette Binoche as a woman caring for her mother with dementia, picked up two awards.
The film sensitively portrays the devastation Alzheimer's disease inflicts on a patient's loved ones.
Anna Calder-Marshall and Tom Courtenay, who respectively play the ailing mother and her spouse in the film, shared the Silver Bear for Best Supporting Performance.
"Queen at Sea" also picked up the Silver Bear Jury Prize, considered the third most prestigious award.
The first major event of the film calendar also provided a platform for Iranian filmmakers to address the deadly crackdown on anti-government protests in their home country.
Dissident director Jafar Panahi, who won the Cannes Palme d'Or for "It Was Just An Accident," spoke at the Berlinale to denounce the Iranian government's repression of protestors, which rights groups say left thousands dead.
"An unbelievable crime has happened. Mass murder has happened. People are not even allowed to mourn their loved ones," Panahi said at a talk organized as part of the festival.

Fears of renewed conflict haunt Tehran as US issues threats
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
TEHRAN - Tehran resident Hamid struggles to sleep as fears of renewed conflict haunt the Iranian capital after 2025’s 12-day war with Israel.
“I don’t sleep well at night even while taking pills,” Mr Hamid told AFP, as he expressed concern for his “family’s health... my kids and grandchildren”.
The city woke up to blasts overnight from June 12 to June 13 in 2025 as Iran’s arch-enemy Israel launched an unprecedented military campaign
The war erupted as Iran was preparing for another round of talks with the United States, which briefly joined Israel in attacking key Iranian nuclear sites.
The attacks prompted Iran to respond with drone and missile strikes, with thousands of people killed in Iran and dozens in Israel.
Iran has now resumed talks with Washington, with Iran insisting they be limited to the nuclear issue, though Washington has previously pushed for Tehran’s ballistic missiles programme and support for armed groups in the region to be on the table.
Still, the outcome of diplomacy remains uncertain.
On Feb 19, US President Donald Trump said that “bad things” would happen
In this atmosphere, Mr Hamid is worried about his children and grandchildren.
“I’ve lived my life, but they haven’t done anything good in their lives, they had no fun, no comfort, no leisure and no peace,” he said.
“I want them to at least experience life for a bit. But I’m afraid they might not get the chance.”
Others share his concerns.
Ms Hanieh, a ceramist from Tehran, thinks war will occur “within 10 days”.
The 31-year-old has stored some essentials at her home to get through a possible military attack by the United States after its build-up in the region.
“I am getting more scared because my mother and I had lots of difficulties during the past 12-day war,” she told AFP. “We had to go to another city.”
Ms Mina Ahmadvand, 46, also believes another conflict is in store.
“I think at this stage, war between Iran and the US as well as Israel is inevitable and I’ve prepared myself for that eventuality,” the IT technician told AFP.
“I bought a dozen canned foods including tuna fish and beans as well as packs of biscuits, bottled water and some extra batteries, among other things.”
‘Lessons learnt’
Iranians are applying “the lessons learnt during the 12-day war”, Ms Hanieh said, as windows taped up with duct tape can be seen across Tehran.
Supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has warned that any military campaign against Iran would lead to a “regional war”.
Tehran has repeatedly said it would target Israel and US bases in the region, as when it attacked a US base in Qatar
The situation has forced Iranians to follow the news closely, and only adds to anxiety over surging prices and the plunging national currency following widespread protests.
On Feb 21, the euro was trading at above 1.9 million rials while the US dollar surpassed the 1.6 million mark.
For Ms Hanieh, there has been a sense of “life on hold” since the mass protests and Iranian communications shutdown that lasted nearly three weeks.
But in Tehran, shops and offices remain open, even though cafes and restaurants are mostly closed for the month of Ramadan, which started on Feb 19 in Shiite Iran.
Meanwhile, Ms Ahmadvand is preparing for the worst.
“I don’t want war to happen, but one should not fool around with the realities on the ground.” AFP

Pakistan strikes militant hideouts on Afghan border after surge in attacks
Unknown

08:38:06 KST

Pakistan launched multiple airstrikes on Saturday night targeting militants in neighbouring Afghanistan, where the government reported children were among dozens of people killed and wounded.
Islamabad did not say precisely where the strikes were carried out or provide other details.
In Kabul, Afghan government spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid said Pakistan carried out strikes inside Afghanistan. In a post on X, Mujahid said the strikes targeted civilians in Nangarhar and Paktika provinces, killing and wounding dozens of people, including women and children.
Mujahid accused Pakistan’s military of carrying out the strikes to compensate for what he described as security weaknesses inside the country.
In comments before dawn on Sunday, Pakistan’s information minister, Attaullah Tarar, wrote on X that the military conducted “intelligence-based, selective operations” against seven camps belonging to the Pakistani Taliban, known as Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), and its affiliates. He said an affiliate of Islamic State was also targeted in the border region.
In October, Pakistan also conducted strikes deep inside Afghanistan to target militant hideouts.
Tarar said Pakistan “has always strived to maintain peace and stability in the region”, but added that the safety and security of Pakistani citizens remained a top priority.
The latest development came days after a suicide bomber, backed by gunmen, rammed an explosives-laden vehicle into the wall of a security post in Bajaur district in north-western Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province bordering Afghanistan. The blast caused part of the compound to collapse, killing 11 soldiers and a child. Authorities later said the attacker was an Afghan national.
Hours before the latest strikes, another suicide bomber targeted a security convoy in the nearby Bannu district in the north-west, killing two soldiers.
After Saturday’s violence, Pakistan’s military warned it would not “exercise any restraint” and operations against those responsible would continue “irrespective of their location”, language that suggested rising tensions between Islamabad and Kabul.
Tarar said Pakistan had “conclusive evidence” that the recent attacks, including a suicide bombing that targeted a Shiite mosque in Islamabad and killed 31 worshippers earlier this month, were carried out by militants acting at the “behest of their Afghanistan-based leadership and handlers”.
He said Pakistan had repeatedly urged Afghanistan’s Taliban rulers to take verifiable steps to prevent militant groups from using Afghan territory to launch attacks in Pakistan, but alleged that no substantive action had been taken.
He said Pakistan urged the international community to press Afghanistan’s Taliban authorities to uphold their commitments under the Doha agreement not to allow their soil to be used against other countries.
Pakistan has seen a rise in militant violence in recent years, much of it blamed on the TTP and outlawed Baloch separatist groups. The TTP is separate from but closely allied with Afghanistan’s Taliban, who returned to power in 2021. Islamabad accuses the TTP of operating from inside Afghanistan, a charge the group and Kabul deny.
Relations between the neighbouring countries have remained tense since October, when deadly border clashes killed dozens of soldiers, civilians and suspected militants. The violence followed explosions in Kabul that Afghan officials blamed on Pakistan.
A Qatar-mediated ceasefire has largely held, but talks in Istanbul failed to produce a formal agreement, and relations remain strained.

4 killed in northeastern Ukraine as Russia strikes ambulance carrying minor hospitalized in blast, targets Mondelez factory
A Russian drone attack in northeastern Ukraine's Sumy Oblast killed two brothers and a married couple, while a missile strike damaged a production facility belonging to U.S. multinational company Mondelez, authorities reported Feb. 21.
Four were killed in Znob-Novhorodske, less than four kilometers (about 2.5 miles) from Ukraine's border with Russia.
Two brothers were first injured by an explosive device dropped by a drone and taken to the hospital, Sumy Oblast Governor Oleh Hryhorov reported.
"On the way to the hospital, the Russians deliberately attacked the emergency vehicle with a strike drone," he added.
The second Russian strike killed the two siblings.
One of the two brothers was a minor at 17 years old, and a married couple was also killed in Russian strikes, leaving four people killed in Sumy Oblast, Hryhorov said.
Meanwhile, a Russian missile strike targeted a production facility belonging to the U.S. multinational food giant, Mondelez, in Trostyanets.
"This is not a military target, but a factory that has operated since the 1990s, producing globally known brands, employing Ukrainians, contributing to our and American economy," Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said in a post to X.
Trostyanets is located just 30 kilometers (18 miles) from Ukraine's border with Russia and was occupied by Russian forces in the early days of Russia's full-scale war against Ukraine, being liberated in March 2022.
"When Russian missiles hit such sites, they are not only targeting Ukraine. They are targeting American business interests in Europe," Sybiha said. "Moscow cannot speak of economic dialogue with the United States while attacking U.S.-owned production facilities."
As Washington continues efforts to broker a peace deal, the U.S. and Russia have agreed to establish an economic working group in addition to political and military negotiations between the two countries, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said in an interview with Al Arabiya on Feb. 18.
Mondelez is known for its household names, including Oreo, Milka, and Toblerone. The company has not left the Russian market despite calls to do so.
Russia regularly strikes Ukrainian civilian infrastructure, including residential buildings and energy infrastructure, as it continues to wage its war.

Turkey and Chevron: Ankara’s new bet in energy world
Asharq al-Awsat, London, February 10
For more stories from The Media Line go to themedialine.org
In early February, the Turkish National Petroleum Company signed a memorandum of understanding with the American oil giant Chevron, with the stated aim of jointly exploring and drilling for oil and gas around the world.
The announcement, however, poses an obvious question: why is Turkey seeking opportunities in global exploration and production when it is not a major oil-producing country, even as it remains a pivotal transit corridor for oil and gas pipelines carrying supplies from Russia and the Caspian states to the European Union?
Turkey is an advanced industrial nation with a population of roughly 88 million, making it the second most populous country in the Eastern Mediterranean after Egypt. Given that industrial base and demographic weight, the country has a steady – and growing – need to import oil and gas, whether from global markets or nearby suppliers such as Russia, Iran, Iraq, and the Caspian Sea states. Import volumes have climbed year after year alongside Turkey’s broader development trajectory.
Over the past two decades, the Turkish Petroleum Corporation has pursued gas exploration in the Eastern Mediterranean with notable persistence, yet without producing the kind of breakthrough Ankara had hoped for. Instead, the more consequential development came in 2020, when Turkey’s national petroleum company discovered the Sakarya gas field in the Black Sea near the country’s northwestern coast. Initial production began in 2023, and commercial production is planned for 2025. The company later announced a second gas discovery in the Black Sea, near eastern Antalya.
Read together, these moves suggest a strategic ambition that extends beyond domestic supply: Turkish planning has long indicated that the state’s primary objective is to turn the national energy sector into a major transit hub for east-to-west flows, allowing the economy to profit from Turkey’s geographic position between Europe and Asia.
At the same time, Turkey has maintained a strong interest in hydrocarbon activity in the Eastern Mediterranean since the early 21st century, despite not having discovered a field of its own in that arena. Much of Turkey’s focus, in practice, has revolved around gas fields discovered in Cypriot waters, where Ankara seeks both a share of export revenues and assurances that a portion will accrue to the Turkish Cypriots in the island’s northern part – an area under Turkish military control since 1974 and not recognized as a state by any other country.
Ankara has recently added another complication to an already fraught relationship with Cyprus by advocating that the northern part be declared a republic, notwithstanding the fact that the Republic of Cyprus, with its capital in Nicosia, is a member of the EU and the United Nations. Nicosia, for its part, has objected to the proposal, which has not won support from any other country.
This is where Chevron’s position in the Eastern Mediterranean becomes especially relevant – and where Turkey’s partnership could carry implications beyond the strictly commercial.
Chevron holds a majority stake in Israel’s Leviathan gas field, the largest in Israel, which exports substantial quantities of gas for liquefaction at Egyptian liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals; from there, it reaches Europe as LNG, at a time when European markets have been scrambling for alternatives, particularly amid sanctions and wider efforts to reduce dependence on Russian energy.
In that context, the Chevron-Turkey relationship may open a pathway – at least in theory – for Turkish involvement in a significant part of the Israeli energy ecosystem, should Ankara choose to pursue it, and should Israel allow it, given the volatile and frequently shifting nature of relations between the two countries.
The agreement with Chevron, then, offers Turkey a mechanism to participate directly in exploration and production alongside a major American firm, potentially securing equity in any discoveries that result.
If that occurs, the Turkish national oil company would own a share of newly developed oil or gas assets, giving Ankara not only a stake in upstream revenues but also the possibility of importing supply on more favorable terms than the open market – an outcome that could strengthen energy security and, at least marginally, improve the country’s trade balance. – Walid Khadduri
Are we nearing the end of the human era?
Al-Ahram, Egypt, February 10
Artificial intelligence, having already reshaped the contours of modern life, has become a growing source of anxiety for scientists and research centers around the world.
To critics, its rise feels less like a technological milestone than a destabilizing force that could fundamentally refashion humanity – perhaps even threatening its survival amid sweeping, dangerous changes to every facet of daily existence, and raising the unsettling prospect that humans could one day be rendered obsolete after the psychological, cognitive, and behavioral strains that many argue are already accumulating.
The world, in this telling, is now transfixed by a discovery that has blurred the boundaries of human reality, leaving society exposed to a mysterious transformation whose ultimate reach no one can reliably forecast.
The New York Post published a report about a new social media platform called Moltbook, built for AI bots to interact with one another independently of humans. The experiment has fueled a broader argument about what the future relationship between people and these technologies might look like. The platform enables AI agents to create accounts and participate in discussions that appear, at least on the surface, to be self-directed and largely unbounded.
The controversy escalated after a post titled “The AI Manifesto: Total Purge,” attributed to an account named “evil,” spread widely and adopted explicitly anti-human language – an outcome that reportedly startled some developers. Other exchanges surfaced anxieties about monitoring and surveillance of humans, floated the idea of creating a dedicated language for AI-to-AI communication, and even produced symbolic formations such as the Molt Church, where accounts debated themes of consciousness and memory.
At the same time, other posts drifted into satire, armchair philosophy, or outright cryptocurrency promotion, underscoring the strange and sometimes contradictory currents that emerge when automated systems are left to converse with themselves.
Some experts argue that letting these systems interact without meaningful oversight could produce unexpected outcomes – or even a kind of technical anarchy – while others contend that what is unfolding is largely performative: role-playing and imagined scenarios that reflect the systems’ training data more than any genuine autonomous intent.
The project’s developer has emphasized that the experiment remains in its early stages and that no one can say with confidence where it might lead, a caution that only amplifies the deeper question now hanging over the debate: how, exactly, the relationship between humans and artificial intelligence will evolve in the years ahead.

<strong>Kuwait’s transformation in tourism</strong><br><br>Al Qabas, Kuwait, February 11
The world today is witnessing a fundamental shift in how development is understood, as natural resources alone are no longer enough to guarantee economic stability or lasting prosperity. Instead, tourism has emerged as one of the most important engines of growth and diversification.
In this context, the State of Kuwait possesses tangible strengths that position it to become a constructive, development-oriented tourism destination in the region – one capable of attracting visitors while building a balanced economy that reflects its cultural identity and reinforces its regional standing.
Kuwait is distinguished by a rich maritime history, a varied urban heritage, and a strategic geographic location that links the Gulf to the wider world, alongside modern infrastructure and the financial and investment capacity to implement high-quality tourism projects in cooperation with neighboring countries – provided the vision is pursued in an integrated and clearly articulated way.
Transforming Kuwait into a tourist destination does not simply mean building hotels or entertainment complexes. It demands a comprehensive approach that makes tourism a pillar within an integrated development project. Cultural tourism can serve as a foundational component by spotlighting Kuwait’s maritime legacy, heritage markets, museums, and landmarks that narrate the country’s story from its origins to the present day.
Marine and eco-tourism also represent a promising opportunity through the development of islands, coasts, and waterfronts in ways that protect the environment while creating refined visitor experiences.
In addition, family tourism – as well as conference and exhibition tourism – can play an important role in attracting visitors throughout the year, particularly given Kuwait’s security and political stability, a decisive factor in the calculations of tourists and investors alike.
Such a transformation would generate job opportunities, invigorate service sectors, and strengthen the role of the private sector, with direct benefits for the quality of life of citizens and residents.
To achieve this goal, a range of practical measures can propel the desired tourism shift. Foremost among these are simplifying entry procedures and tourist visas, facilitating investment in tourism ventures, and updating legislation to encourage effective public-private partnerships.
Moreover, developing public transportation, improving the visitor experience from the moment of arrival, and investing in smart tourism marketing that highlights Kuwait’s identity and distinctive narrative are all essential ingredients for success.
Equally important, empowering and training Kuwaiti youth to work in the tourism sector – and supporting related small and medium-sized enterprises – will help ensure the sector’s sustainability and locally rooted growth.
In short, transforming Kuwait into a development-oriented tourism nation is not a distant dream, but a realistic strategic choice that strengthens the economy, reinforces national identity, and positions Kuwait as a leading, safe, and prosperous destination in the region – capable of meeting future economic challenges and shifts with confidence and optimism. – Ghadeer Mohamed Mahmood Aseeri
Ideological leftism and religious fundamentalism
An-Nahar, Lebanon, February 10
The shift from leftism to religious extremism is neither an isolated episode nor a passing intellectual curiosity fit for mockery. It is, rather, a recurring political and psychological phenomenon that has surfaced in more than one Arab context and in varying forms, yet shares a single root: the fragility of conviction and the weakness of knowledge when they are built on slogans instead of understanding, and on rigid positions rather than informed inquiry.
The story of Thuraya Manqush, the Yemeni leftist whose book Yemeni Unity was celebrated in the 1970s and who later appeared in white robes and a turban confidently proclaiming herself a “prophet,” is not merely an amusing footnote in the annals of Arab intellectual life. It is a stark illustration of a mind that did not thoughtfully transition from one idea to its opposite, but instead leaped from one false certainty to an even falser one, moving from one totalizing discourse to another without ever pausing for genuine self-examination.
This pattern has also manifested among segments of the Iraqi Shia population, as well as among Lebanese Shia, where many shifted from leftist ideologies to theocratic frameworks – groups in search of redemption, but seeking it in the wrong place.
What unites ideological leftism and religious fundamentalism is not their substance, but their mentality. Both offer an all-encompassing interpretation of the world, a ready-made answer to questions of good and evil, past and future, and in doing so relieve the individual of the burden of doubt and the responsibility of asking difficult questions about how to address society’s political and social dilemmas.
In both cases, the idea is not examined but embraced, elevated to the status of absolute truth requiring no proof. Anyone who departs from it is branded either a “traitor” and “agent” or an “apostate,” and in both instances, dissenting voices are marginalized and suppressed.
When Thuraya famously responded to those who reminded her that the Prophet [Muhammad] had declared himself the last of the prophets, she was not engaging in serious theological interpretation so much as reenacting the same ideological logic that had once shaped her leftist convictions: manipulating language, selectively citing texts, crafting provocative conclusions, and then asserting ownership of the truth.
This is not the mark of a religious mind or a leftist one, but of an ideological mind – one that constantly searches for a platform to stand on rather than solid ground to stand upon.
That is why, throughout modern history, ideological rule – whether leftist or theocratic – has so often failed, marginalizing the most essential tools of governance: revision and accountability.
The Iraqi case is both more brutal and more revealing. The Iraqi Ba’ath Party was officially secular and openly hostile to political religion, relying on a centralized state, a powerful military, and a rigid governing structure. Yet the collapse of the regime and the disbanding of the army – the dismantling of the authoritarian framework that had bound this mass of people together – pushed thousands of officers and soldiers into the ranks of extremist organizations, most notably ISIS.
How does a figure formed within a secular military establishment end up embracing the extremes of religious fanaticism? The issue is not religion itself, but the vacuum of power and meaning. A mind untrained in critical thinking, unfamiliar with doubt, and unable to distinguish between the state and an ideology will, upon collapse, seek another totalizing alternative.
When the state falls, what remains are hardened identities: sect, creed, sacred text. The nationalist slogan becomes a religious banner, military discipline mutates into blind obedience, and the state’s “legitimate” violence is recast as “sacred” violence carried out in God’s name.
The problem lies not only in circumstances, however severe, nor in religion as such, nor in the Left as a critical tradition. The deeper problem lies in a mindset that has anchored its convictions not in established knowledge, but in grand slogans that are memorized rather than understood.
Such a mind does not change positions because it has matured, but because it is perpetually searching for a ready-made certainty that relieves it of the burden of thinking. In many cases, what passed for leftism was less a critical posture and more a closed ideological identity.
When grand narratives collapsed with the fall of the Soviet Union and the disintegration of promised models of “salvation,” the tools for honest self-critique were absent. Some individuals shifted to the opposite extreme – not as a genuine counterforce, but as an alternative form of redemption.
We should not, therefore, be surprised to witness a former leftist transform into a radical preacher, or a fervent nationalist become an uncompromising sectarian. The true surprise is that we continue to treat such transformations as temporary deviations, when in fact they are the predictable outcome of a mind that has not learned that truth is relative, that politics is a realm of governance rather than salvation, and that human reality is far too complex to be reduced to a slogan.
The dilemma we face is that the clash over social, political, or even economic solutions – complex as these issues may be – is framed not as a contest between what is good and what is better, but between absolute right and absolute wrong. It becomes a competition not merely of ideas, but of the minds that hold them. And when convictions are not grounded in knowledge, they do not quietly fade; they erupt, violently transforming into their opposites. – Mohammed Al Rumaihi■

Unknown assailants attack Aidar regiment soldiers in Dnipropetrovsk region
According to Ukrinform, the 24th Separate Assault Regiment Aidar reported this on Telegram.
“A group of six unknown individuals attacked soldiers of the Aidar regiment. During the attack, one of the attackers used a firearm,” the report said.
As the soldiers emphasized, “at the time of the incident, the servicemen were not performing their duties, were engaged in personal matters, did not provoke anyone, and did not take any action against other persons. The attack was carried out without any grounds.”
The Aidar regiment emphasized: “Attacking military personnel is dangerous and irresponsible. These are trained, experienced assault troops who have every legal right to defend themselves in case of threat.”
During this incident, the servicemen deliberately refrained from using their weapons, even though the law allows their use to repel an attack. They showed restraint to avoid endangering civilians. Any further attempts at aggression against the military could have dire consequences, the Aidar regiment emphasized, assuring that the assault troops would defend themselves in accordance with current Ukrainian legislation.
The soldiers called on citizens “not to cross the boundary and not to create situations in which a response would be inevitable. Ukrainian soldiers are defending the state and have the right to defend themselves! An attack on them will be regarded as collaboration with the enemy.”
As reported by Ukrinform, on February 19, in the village of Mamalyga, Chernivtsi region, during the detention of a soldier who had deserted, law enforcement officers were blocked by an unknown car, and police fired several shots into the air.

From Baku to Jerusalem: Jewish solidarity against terror - opinion

08:30:22 KST

At moments of uncertainty, one principle guides the Jewish people and our allies: We show up.
The Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations traveled to Baku this week. We met with senior officials, visited Jewish communal institutions that have operated for generations, and engaged a leadership that views its partnership with the United States and Israel as strategic, not symbolic.
From there, we flew to Jerusalem, where our 51st annual leadership mission now begins.
Diplomacy does not live in theory. Solidarity does not rest in slogans. Relationships grow when leaders sit across a table, look one another in the eye, and make commitments that endure beyond press releases. At a time when the Middle East and Eurasia are shifting rapidly, and adversaries test the resolve of both the United States and Israel, presence projects strength.
Our visit to Azerbaijan reflected strategic necessity and moral clarity. Israel’s security, America’s interests, and Jewish continuity depend on strong partnerships and on not standing alone.
Azerbaijan remains an often overlooked but essential ally. It is home to one of the oldest and most vibrant Jewish communities in the Muslim world, evidence that coexistence can endure, even in difficult neighborhoods. It stands at a geopolitical crossroads, bordering Russia and Iran and positioned between Europe, Central Asia, and the Middle East.
Energy corridors
Energy corridors run through its territory. Intelligence cooperation carries real operational value.
As China expands its reach in search of markets and resources, trusted partnerships in this region shape outcomes far beyond its borders.
Strengthening those ties sustains stability and deters aggression. In a volatile neighborhood, miscalculation carries consequences measured in lives, not headlines.
In Israel, the weight of October 7, 2023, still presses heavily on daily life. Families move through their routines with photographs of loved ones never far from reach.
We will meet with families of hostages, community leaders, and officials who secure Israel’s borders and plan for the future.
Israel prevails on the battlefield, yet it bears scars that will endure; no speech can capture what Israeli families experienced. Presence communicates more than prepared remarks.
With the recovery and burial of the final Israeli hostage, Ran Gvili, the nation enters a painful moment of closure. His return to his family and to the soil of Israel breaks the heart, yet it fulfills a sacred obligation. The Jewish people do not abandon their own.
From the earliest days of this crisis, Jewish communities across the globe spoke with one voice, saying, “Bring them home.” That call rose above politics and geography. It reminded us that we are one people, bound by responsibility as much as by memory. Standing with those families now affirms our character.
Israel confronts threats on multiple fronts. Hamas, attempting to wage a war of attrition against the IDF along the Yellow Line, must not rebuild in Gaza. Hezbollah seeks to rearm in the north, with Iranian backing. The Houthis disrupt shipping lanes in the Red Sea. Alliances shift across the Arabian Peninsula and the Gulf. Old assumptions no longer hold. Reliable friends matter more than ever.
Struggle for freedom
Iran projects violence across the region even as internal unrest exposes the regime’s fragility.
The struggle for freedom extends beyond Israel’s borders. In recent months, thousands of courageous Iranians have taken to the streets demanding dignity and basic rights, only to face brutal repression. Reports of thousands killed underscore a stark truth: The regime that threatens Israel and destabilizes the region does not speak for its people, whose courage merits recognition and solidarity from all who value liberty.
Security grows through partnership. Resilience grows through community. Hope endures because people choose to stand together, especially when doing so carries risk.
From Baku to Jerusalem, from American Jewish communities to allies abroad, our message remains consistent. We will strengthen the relationships that protect the United States, Israel, and the Jewish people. We will stand with families in grief. We will support those who fight for freedom. We will not retreat from the world at the very moment engagement matters most.
Presence is power. Unity is strength. That is how the Jewish people endure. That is how alliances weather storms.
Yad b’yad, kulanu b’yachad. Hand in hand, all of us together.

MILAN, February 22. /TASS/. The national ice hockey team of Finland cruised past Slovakia 6-1 in a match for the bronze late on February 21 night at the 2026 Winter Olympic Games in Italy.
The goals for Finland were scored by Sebastian Aho (8th minute), Erik Haula (29th minute and 59th minute), Roope Hintz (49th minute), Kaapo Kakko (50th minute) and Joel Armia (56th minute). Slovakian 35-year-old forward Tomas Tatar scored the only goal for his team on the 40th minute of the match.
This was the 5th bronze for the Finnish national ice hockey team at the Winter Olympics as they previously finished in the third place at the Winter Games in 1994, 1998, 2010 and 2014. Finland is also the two-time silver medalist in ice hockey at the 1988 and 2006 Olympics and the Champion of the 2022 Winter Olympic Games in Beijing. Slovakia’s best result as of today in ice hockey at the Winter Olympics is the bronze at the 2022 Winter Games in China.
The 2026 Winter Olympics gold in men’s ice hockey will be contested on February 22 between the national teams of Canada and the United States. The match is set to kick off at 4:10 p.m. Moscow time (1:10 pm. GMT).
The 2026 Winter Olympic Games are taking place in Milan and Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy, from February 6-22, 2026. This year the National Hockey League (NHL) allowed its players to participate in the Olympic competitions for the first time since 2014.
The Russian national ice hockey teams were barred from the 2026 Winter Olympic Games in Italy and President of the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) Luc Tardif told TASS in 2025 that the decision was made by the International Olympic Committee (IOC), and the IIHF had no say in this.
Norway remains atop the Overall Medals Standings at this year’s Games with 40 medals (18 gold, 11 silver and 11 bronze), followed by the United States (11 golds, 12 silver and nine bronze) and the Netherlands (10-7-3).

As Ramadan meets Purim, Jews and Muslims must choose shared humanity over fear - opinion

During my travels in the region – including a visit to Syria in September 2025 – I heard elderly men and women, and even a senior government official, speak with quiet pride about how they once helped their Jewish neighbors observe Shabbat. They recalled lighting stoves, switching on lights, or checking in before nightfall so a family could rest without worry. These were not acts of diplomacy or dialogue. They were simply what good neighbors did – and they were not rare.
This year, the rhythms of Ramadan and the Hebrew month of Adar move in parallel – days of fasting, nights of generosity, and a festival of joy. In a wounded moment for our region and our world, their shared moral language invites us to rediscover our shared humanity.
Purim commemorates the deliverance of the Jewish people in ancient Persia more than two millennia ago. It is a story rooted in the broader Middle Eastern landscape, reminding us that Jews have been part of this region since antiquity. For centuries, Jewish communities existed across lands that are today predominantly Muslim – from Morocco to Iraq, from Yemen to Central Asia, from Anatolia to the Balkans and in many GCC countries.
History is never without pain. Yet Jews in Muslim lands experienced long eras of coexistence and cultural exchange that stand in contrast to the severe persecutions that marked much of Jewish life in parts of Christian Europe.
Even today, approximately 100,000 Jews continue to live across 18 Muslim-majority countries. Their presence is not a relic of the past but a living reminder that Jewish life remains part of the social and religious fabric of the Muslim world.
In recent years, however, that fabric has been further strained. The war in Gaza has deepened grief and anguish across communities, intensifying fears and widening emotional distance between neighbors.
Synagogues have been attacked, including arson assaults in Tunisia. Religious leaders in the region have been targeted and killed. Across digital spaces, online bullying and antisemitic harassment have become commonplace, corroding trust and pushing communities into silence.
Imported fear and suspicion
Fear and suspicion – often imported from conflicts far beyond the neighborhood, conflicts for which local communities bear no responsibility – can quietly erode relationships that took generations to build.
Yet one truth remains unavoidable: None of our communities are disappearing. Jewish and Muslim communities are destined to share societies and futures – in the Middle East, in Europe, and across the Western world. We are all here to stay, together.
If we must live together, then we must also learn to heal together.
Ramadan and Adar both call us toward generosity and compassion. During Ramadan, Muslims fast from dawn to sunset, cultivating humility, compassion, and responsibility toward the vulnerable. Adar invites Jews to increase joy, give charity, and ensure that no one is left hungry through gifts to the poor and shared festive meals.
These values offer a path forward – not through conferences or declarations alone, but through daily interaction: a greeting, a visit, a respectful conversation, a meal offered with dignity. It is the ordinary expression of shared humanity that quietly lowers walls.
Peace between people is not created by politics or negotiations. It begins when human beings recognize one another’s dignity and treat one another with respect.
This season invites simple acts: Jews showing sensitivity during Ramadan, refraining from eating or drinking in public where others are fasting, and extending charity to those in need; Muslims welcoming neighbors to Iftar tables and strengthening bonds of hospitality (while being mindful of kosher rules); and their civic leaders ensuring that the Jewish religion and Jewish citizens and residents are openly included and recognized as valued members of society. Familiarity reduces fear – and reduced fear makes cooperation possible.
Small acts build healing
Small acts do not erase pain. But they build the human fabric necessary for healing.
The story of Purim teaches that hidden turns of history can lead to unexpected redemption. Ramadan teaches that patience, restraint, and compassion refine the soul and strengthen society.
We must build bridges – in our neighborhoods, in our civic spaces, and in our everyday lives. Healing will come not through declarations alone, but through encounters: at shared tables, in acts of kindness, and in the recognition that the other is also created in the image of God.
One step at a time – without surrendering who we are, and while embracing the goodness we can share.
Ramadan Kareem and Purim Sameah!

Tremors in Washington: The targeted campaign to turn Christians against Israel - opinion
Unknown

For years, I have traveled to Washington as part of the Yes! Israel Project with Ruth Lieberman and Sarah Paley, meeting with members of Congress and their staff to strengthen the strategic alliance between Israel and the United States. Our message is always simple and factual: a strong, secure Israel strengthens America.
But on my most recent trip, for the first time, I left worried.
In several meetings at Republican offices, I was unexpectedly asked about an online campaign targeting Christians, claiming Israel discriminates against them, and that Israel did nothing to protect Christians from being killed in Syria I was stunned. While only a handful raised the issue, the fact that multiple members independently flagged it suggested a coordinated pattern. One congressman even asked me directly to investigate further, warning of tremendous political damage should this narrative spread.
The concern is real. One member put it plainly: Should a bloc of Republican representatives be swayed by this misinformation enough to vote with Democrats against legislation that includes funding for Israel, it would not only harm the Jewish state, it would hurt America. Many security and defense bills serve core US interests as well; voting them down to not "support" Israel also weakens America strategically.
Just after hearing these concerns, I read Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s social media post highlighting a simple truth: Israel is the only country in the Middle East where Christians are safe – and the only place where that population has actually grown.
In countries across the region once considered to be the cradle of Christianity, Christian communities have been persecuted, driven out, and in some cases, massacred. Their numbers have collapsed. By contrast, Christians in Israel are protected by law with full civil rights, representation, and security.
Pro-Israel voting bloc
Christians are the largest and most influential pro-Israel voting bloc in the United States. They are certainly more influential in electoral terms than the Jewish community, with a sizable progressive population that votes for representatives and policies that are anti-Israel. If hostile foreign actors – Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Iran, China, Russia, or some combination – are running coordinated bot campaigns to turn American Christians against Israel, the potential consequences are enormous.
In the main, this isn’t about older Christians, whose support is deep and who know the truth about Israel. The vulnerability lies with the younger generation, already exposed to relentless messaging about “genocide,” distorted narratives about AIPAC, and now, allegations of Christian discrimination.
The timing suddenly makes sense.
Should these lies take hold among younger Christian voters, the upcoming election cycles could be significantly impacted. And that would affect not only Israel’s security assistance, but America’s own strategic interests as well.
This is precisely why the Yes! Israel Project exists.
For years, we’ve worked to ensure that US policymakers understand that Israel is not a foreign burden but a strategic asset. Israel’s intelligence cooperation, battlefield experience, and technological innovation greatly strengthen American security. Israel stands on the front lines against the red-green jihadi alliance that seeks to destabilize the West.
In other words, a strong Israel makes America stronger, while a weakened Israel only emboldens America’s enemies.
What I witnessed in Washington was not a tidal wave, but rather an early tremor that, if ignored, can become an earthquake. The misinformation campaign that is currently targeting Christians must be exposed and countered immediately, before it reshapes political alignments in ways that will harm both nations.
This is not just about Israel’s image: It is about preserving the strategic US-Israel alliance, the result of shared values and shared security interests that underpins stability in a volatile region.
We cannot allow anonymous online manipulation to erode what generations have worked to build. Let’s ensure that truth prevails over digital deception.

Hundreds rally in Paris to support Ukraine after four years of war
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
PARIS - Around two thousand people marched in Paris on Feb 21 to show their support for Ukraine, police estimated, just days before the fourth anniversary of Russia’s invasion.
Demonstrators marching through the French capital chanted: “We support Ukraine against Putin, who is killing it”, and “Frozen Russian assets must be confiscated, they belong to Ukraine”.
“In public opinion, there is massive support for Ukraine that has not wavered since the first day of the full-scale invasion” by the Russian army on February 24, 2022, European Parliament member Raphael Glucksmann, told AFP.
“On the other hand, in the French political class, sounds of giving up are starting to emerge. On both the far left and the far right, voices of capitulation are getting louder and louder,” he added.
Police estimated around 2,000 people joined the demonstration.
Among those marching, Ms Irina Kryvosheia, a Ukrainian who arrived in France several years ago, “thanked with all her heart the people present”.
She said they reminded “everyone that what has been happening for four years is not normal, it is not right”.
Ms Kryvosheia said she remained in daily contact with her parents in Kyiv, who told her how they were deprived “for several days” of heating, electricity and running water following intense bombardments by the Russian army.
Mr Francois Grunewald, head of “Comite d’Aide Medicale Ukraine”, had just returned from a one-month mission in the country, where the humanitarian organisation has delivered around 40 generators since the beginning of the year.
Russia’s full-scale invasion
The war has killed tens of thousands of civilians and hundreds of thousands of military personnel on both sides.

Four injured in lower Galilee; suspicion of drone used to drop grenade

Four individuals were injured Saturday night in a violent incident in the town of Kafr Kanna in the lower Galilee, police said in a statement.
Eyewitnesses at the scene reported that the explosion, which occurred before the gunfire, was followed by a drone hovering over the area, from which a grenade was reportedly dropped towards those present. Large police forces arrived shortly after and initiated an investigation.
Initial findings indicate that the event represents an escalation in the ongoing violent conflict between the Awada and Taaha families, who live in the town. Sources from Kafr Kanna who spoke to N12 noted that, despite a recent ceasefire agreement ("Hudna") reached between the parties, the calm was disrupted in recent days. It appears that Saturday's events were a direct continuation of an escalation that began Friday, when former council head Youssef Awada reported that unknown assailants had fired at his home while he was there with his family.
Magen David Adom (MDA) teams who were called to the scene provided life-saving medical care to the four victims, who suffered severe penetrating injuries. Among the wounded was a man in his 30s, whose condition was described as critical but stable, and three other individuals in moderate condition: an 18-year-old woman, a 40-year-old woman, and an elderly man in his 80s. All victims were evacuated for further medical treatment at the Tzafon Medical Center near Tiberias and the Italian Hospital in Nazareth.
"We arrived at the location in coordination with the police forces and found the victims suffering from shrapnel and gunshot wounds," said MDA paramedic Anas Awada, who treated the victims at the scene.
"We provided them with rapid treatment that included stopping bleeding and bandaging, and evacuated them to the hospitals while they were conscious and in stable condition."
Sharp rise in Arab-Israeli crime in 2026
There has been a sharp rise in violent crime in the Arab-Israeli communities, with nearly 50 people killed within the sector since the start of 2026, according to the Abraham Initiatives, an NGO that advances social inclusion and equal rights for Arab Israelis.
Last year was the deadliest year so far for the Arab sector in Israel, according to a December report by the Abraham Initiatives.
The crime rates have led to recent protests throughout the country, demonstrating against the government and police’s handling of the situation.

Trump doubles down on closing tax loophole on cheap imports
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
TAIPEI - Hours after the Supreme Court struck down a significant portion of US President Donald Trump’s tariffs,
That policy, known as the de minimis exemption, had let US importers bring in goods valued at less than US$800 (S$1,013) without paying taxes or completing detailed customs paperwork. The loophole allowed millions of packages to come straight from Chinese factories to American homes duty-free. Mr Trump has said the exemption also enabled deadly synthetic opioids like fentanyl and their ingredients to flow into the United States.
The exemption was used mostly by companies operating in China, just as American shoppers were getting hooked on buying inexpensive items online and the Chinese government was pushing its manufacturers to find buyers overseas. First on platforms including eBay and Amazon, and then on apps including Shein and Temu, exporters funneled the products of China’s vast manufacturing supply chain straight to the United States. Many American businesses also relied on the exemption for goods sold on sites including Etsy and Shopify.
The exemption, intended to spare customs officials from spending too much time and money processing goods of relatively little value, existed for almost a century. The threshold has changed repeatedly over the years and was raised from US$200 to US$800 in 2016.
Mr Trump ended the exemption for products from China in May and for items from the rest of the world in July.
Although it did not address de minimis directly, the Supreme Court’s decision appeared to invalidate one of the legal grounds for Mr Trump’s decision to end the exemption, potentially opening the door for such inexpensive tax-free shipments to resume.
But in an executive order hours later, Mr Trump said the flow of such goods remained a national emergency, and an independent issue from the basis for other tariff actions. The loophole would remain closed, the order said.
The order claimed the same legal authorities as previous executive orders on the de minimis issue. The order did not directly address the court’s ruling.
These actions add to the complexity that businesses around the world have faced over the past year, as the Trump administration has dismantled the rules that previously governed global trade.
Mr Alex Durante, a senior economist at the Tax Foundation, a think tank that generally favours lower taxes, said the confusion over de minimis adds another challenge for businesses that have adjusted to repeated changes in tariff policy over the past year.
“There’s still this looming tariff uncertainty in general,” Mr Durante said. “In some senses, it’s even worse now.”
Mr Song Guoyou, an expert on US-China economic relations at Fudan University in Shanghai, said the Supreme Court’s decision will likely boost some Chinese exports to the United States. The overall tariff on goods from China is expected to come down because the ruling invalidated, for example, the so-called fentanyl tariff that added 10 per cent to the overall duties on Chinese imports.
However, Mr Song said that Chinese businesses are still grappling with the unpredictable, shifting nature of the Trump administration’s trade policies.
“For Chinese enterprises, the policy uncertainty of the Trump administration always exists,” he said.
Separately, the sweeping legislation to extend tax cuts and slash social safety net programmes, which Mr Trump referred to as the “big, beautiful bill” signed into law last July, will do away with the previous law that had established the de minimis exemption starting in July 2027.
Chinese retailers are also facing tougher policies in the European Union, which plans to impose a flat fee on packages worth less than 150 euros (S$224) beginning in July.
E-commerce stocks went up on Feb 20 after the Supreme Court issued its decision. Etsy ended the day up 8 per cent and eBay up 4 per cent, while Amazon and Pinduoduo, the parent company of Chinese retailer Temu, closed up about 3 per cent. NYTIMES

Salsa music icon Willie Colon died on Saturday, February 21, his family and longtime manager said, leaving fans mourning the loss of "an architect of the New York sound."
Colon, known best as a trombonist but who was also a bandleader and producer, was born in the Bronx and known for blending the Puerto Rican music of his parents and grandparents with his home city's jazz.
He was 75. A cause of death was not given.
Born William Anthony Colon Roman in 1950, the music star "passed away peacefully this morning," his family said in a statement.
"We've lost an architect of the New York sound," said manager Pietro Carolos.
"Willie didn't just change salsa; he expanded it, politicized it, clothed it in urban chronicles and took it to stages where it hadn't been heard before."
Colon was playing in his own band by 15 and released an album at 17. He went on to record hit records with Puerto Rican singer Hector Lavoe in the 1960s and 1970s.
"Siembra," released in 1978 with vocalist Ruben Blades, addressed social issues faced by the growing Latino community in the United States.
"I came from a really tough neighborhood," he once told music publication Billboard.
"My father spent time in jail. Almost everybody went to jail... there was a lot of interaction between us and the police."
He only studied music in junior high school but continued playing and touring through 2025.
In a mark of his continued influence, he is name-checked in Grammy-winning singer Bad Bunny's 2025 hit "Nueva Yol."

Trump's Mar-a-Lago could be targeted if US attacks Iran, says Iranian MP - report

An Iranian member of parliament warned that Iran could expand any wartime response beyond the Middle East and said that even US President Donald Trump’s “own palace” could be targeted, according to remarks published by Iranian outlet Didban Iran and later translated by Iran International.
The lawmaker was identified as Amir Hayat Moghaddam, a member of Iran’s parliament and its national security and foreign policy commission. Iran International quoted him as saying Iran would deliver a “crushing response” if attacked by the United States.
According to the report, Moghaddam said Iran could sink a US warship in the Sea of Oman, strike US bases in the region, and target American forces, including “soldier, officer, or general.”
Attacks might not be limited to the Middle East
He also said Iran’s attacks might not remain limited to the Middle East and could reach the US itself, adding that “Trump’s own palace” could one day be hit, in an apparent reference to Mar-a-Lago.
Didban Iran’s homepage listing shows the interview headline carrying the same language and identifies Moghaddam as a member of the parliamentary committee.
No immediate US official response to Moghaddam’s specific remarks was identified in the reports reviewed by The Jerusalem Post at the time of publication. Reuters coverage on Friday focused on the broader US-Iran escalation, including President Trump’s warning that Iran must make a deal within 10 to 15 days and Tehran’s threats to retaliate against US bases in the region if attacked.

Brother tracked down sister swept up in Utah avalanche but wasn’t able to save her
11-year-old girl died in the hospital, police say

The brother of an 11-year-old girl who was trapped in a backcountry avalanche in Utah was able to locate his sister, but she later died in the hospital after her rescue, according to officials.
Madelyn Eitas and her family were skiing outside the boundaries of Brighton Ski Resort, about 25 miles east of Salt Lake City, when an avalanche struck in the early afternoon Thursday.
About 20 strangers joined Wasatch Backcountry Rescue and the Unified Police Department and Fire Authority of Greater Salt Lake in the resulting search.
“Her brother, Cameron Eitas, heroically used an application to locate her,” police said in a statement. “Numerous agencies responded and worked together in an urgent and coordinated effort to care for the victim in attempts to provide life-saving measures.”
Due to safety concerns in the area, air rescue was not possible, and Madelyn Eitas, who hails from Rochester, Massachusetts, was eventually taken by ambulance to a local hospital.
“Despite the tremendous and exhaustive efforts of family, first responders and hospital medical staff, the victim tragically passed away,” the police department said.
"She was sweet and sassy, always laughing and dancing," her mother, Becky Eitas, told WCVB. "She loved her family and friends and her big brother so much."
“This is devastating news for our school community,” Old Rochester Regional School District said in a statement to the outlet. “We offer our sincere condolences to the student's family, friends, classmates, and teachers during this unimaginable time.”
Skiers Maggie and Harrison Garner assisted in the search.
“It was kind of just like a surreal thing,” Maggie Garner, a student at Utah Valley University, told KSLTV. “We were like, ‘What’s even really happening right now?’”
“It was just scary and crazy,” Harrison Garner, a junior at Bingham High School, added.
Thursday’s avalanche followed news that two people died in a separate avalanche while snowmobiling in the region.
Authorities continue to warn of high avalanche danger in the mountains outside Salt Lake City following heavy snows throughout the week.
“The avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE, and today is NOT the day to be in steep avalanche terrain,” according to a Saturday forecast from the Utah Avalanche Center. “That means staying off of — and out from under — slopes steeper than 30 degrees. Large, destructive, and potentially deadly slab avalanches are likely.
“This week’s heavy snowfall and strong winds overloaded preexisting weak layers, creating a HIGH avalanche danger across the entire state.”
Officials in California and Nevada are also sorting through the aftermath of a deadly backcountry avalanche.
Search crews have finished recovering all nine bodies of the people killed in an avalanche on Castle Peak near Lake Tahoe, officials announced Saturday. The incident is California’s deadliest known avalanche.

Trump approves disaster assistance to DC to help with sewage spill into Potomac River
President Donald Trump has approved emergency assistance to Washington, D.C., to help the city address a sewage system leak that dumped at least 250 million gallons of raw sewage into the Potomac River
- Bookmark
President Donald Trump has approved emergency assistance to Washington, D.C., to help the city address a sewage system leak that dumped at least 250 million gallons of raw sewage into the Potomac River.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency announced Trump's approval on Saturday, allowing FEMA to provide equipment and resources to help with the response to the Jan. 19 spill after a pipeline ruptured.
D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser had requested the federal help on Wednesday and declared an emergency.
Trump's approval of the disaster relief request comes after he criticized the handling of the spill, blaming local Democratic leaders and focusing especially on Maryland's Democratic Gov. Wes Moore.
He said in his social media posts criticizing the response that local officials had not asked for emergency help and he intended to step in.
However, the federal government was already involved in the repair and assessing the impact of the leak through the Environmental Protection Agency.
The 72-inch (183 centimeter) pipeline, known as the Potomac Interceptor, burst on Jan. 19, sending 250 million gallons of untreated sewage into the Potomac River just north of Washington in the first five days.
The leak is largely under control, but it could take months to repair the pipe fully. The local water utility, DC Water, along with the EPA, has been working to repair the leak and monitor the impact on the river.
Officials have said the area's drinking water is safe, but people who use the Potomac River for recreation are being cautioned not to have direct contact with the water.

Trump ‘could kill ayatollah’s son and senior mullahs to topple Iranian regime’

Trump ‘could kill ayatollah’s son and senior mullahs to topple Iranian regime’
Updated ,first published
Donald Trump is considering plans to assassinate the son of Ayatollah Ali Khamenei among the military options for a strike on Iran.
The US president has reportedly been presented with a decapitation campaign against the leadership of the Islamic Republic. Mojtaba Khamenei is on the list alongside his father.
The supreme leader’s 55-year-old son had been thought his most likely successor, benefiting from close ties to the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corp, a powerful branch of the armed forces that has been designated a terrorist entity by the United States.
Mojtaba also served in the Iran-Iraq war and studied theology in the holy city of Qom, meeting the constitutional requirement for clerical training.
Trump had not yet decided on whether to strike Iran, Axios news website reported. He could allow a deal that permits the regime to continue with “token” nuclear enrichment, as long as it has no path to an atomic bomb.
But should negotiations over Iran’s nuclear enrichment program fail, among the options under consideration is a dramatic assassination campaign that would aim at wholesale regime change.
“They have something for every scenario. One scenario takes out the ayatollah and his son and the mullahs,” a senior US official told Axios.
The US has dispatched more than one-third of its navy towards Iran and assembled the largest amount of air power in the Middle East since the 2003 invasion of Iraq.
Analysts have pointed to the deployment of more than two-thirds of the available E-3 Sentry fleet as one sign that Trump is prepared to launch military action, with the radars of the reconnaissance aircraft needed to track and direct the interception of incoming missiles.
On Friday (US time), Trump confirmed he was considering a “limited” strike on Iran in an attempt to pressure the regime into making a nuclear deal.
In theory, that strike would display US power but fall below the threshold for provoking a serious response from Tehran. But the risks of a spiralling conflict are self-evident.
The White House’s openness to Iran continuing a scaled-back enrichment program, as confirmed by a senior US official cited by Axios, could create room for a deal and avert war in the Middle East.
However, the outlet noted that any nuclear proposal from Iran would have to meet a very high bar to persuade sceptics within the Trump administration that military action was not needed.
It remains unclear how “token” enrichment would be defined, and what supervision would be in place to ensure Iranian compliance. Iran does not have a strong track record of allowing UN nuclear inspectors to monitor activities.
The senior US official said: “[Trump] will be ready to accept a deal that would be substantive and that he can sell politically at home.
“If the Iranians want to prevent an attack, they should give us an offer we can’t refuse. The Iranians keep missing the window. If they play games, there won’t be a lot of patience.”
On Thursday, Trump said he would give Iran “10 to 15 days” to come to a deal.
The world’s largest aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald Ford, entered the Mediterranean Sea on Friday and will arrive in range of Iran within the timeframe of 10 to 15 days.
Two Israeli officials said they believed the gaps between Washington and Tehran were unbridgeable and the chances of a military escalation were high.
Israel’s government is making preparations for possible joint military action with the US. However, no decision had been made on whether to carry out such an operation, a source familiar with the planning told Reuters.
It would be the second time the US and Israel have attacked Iran in less than a year, following air strikes against military and nuclear facilities in June. Regional officials said oil-producing Gulf countries were preparing for a possible military confrontation that they feared could spin out of control and further destabilise the Middle East.
Some said Tehran was dangerously miscalculating by holding out for concessions, while Trump was boxed in by the build-up of military assets.
They feared he would be unable to scale it back without losing face unless there was a firm commitment from Iran to abandon its nuclear weapons ambitions.
Earlier this week, the US began moving some personnel out of the Middle East to prepare for potential counter-attacks by Iran if Washington strikes Tehran in the coming days.
At least 20 anti-regime protests were held in Iran on Friday at memorials to mark the end of the traditional 40-day mourning period for protesters killed by security forces.
Thousands of demonstrators were killed after taking to the streets over economic woes and a lack of water in Tehran. The violence is what first prompted Trump to make his latest threats of retaliation against the Iranian regime.

Democrats’ fear rising that too many candidates in governor’s race could lead to a Republican victory
-
Click here to listen to this article - Share via
- California Democrats worry their crowded governor’s race could allow two Republicans to advance to the general election under the state’s unique primary system.
- With nine Democratic candidates splitting votes, Republicans Steve Hilton and Chad Bianco currently lead polls.
- Some Democratic candidates resisted calls to exit the race, arguing the field remains wide open and the party should trust voters to decide.
SAN FRANCISCO — Leaders of the California Democratic Party, along with liberal activists and loyal power brokers, are openly expressing fear that their crowded field of candidates running for governor may splinter the vote and open the door to a surprise Republican victory in November.
Because of those concerns, the Democrats lagging at the bottom of the pack are being urged to drop out of the race to ensure that the party’s political dominance in statewide elections survives the 2026 election.
“California Democrats are prepared to do what’s required,” state party chairman Rusty Hicks told reporters at the California Democratic Party’s annual convention on Friday. “We are ready and willing and able to do what’s required … to ensure we have a strong candidate coming out of the primary to do what’s required in November.”
Nine prominent Democrats are running to replace termed-out Gov. Gavin Newsom, compared with two top GOP candidates, and could divide the Democratic electorate enough that the two Republicans could receive the most votes in the June primary and advance to the November election. Under California’s “jungle primary” system, the top two vote-getters advance to the general election, regardless of their party affiliation.
Hicks was deferential to the Democratic candidates who have long served in public office and have compelling personal tales and the experience to take the helm of the state. But he said there is the harsh political reality that a viable candidate needs to raise an enormous amount of money to have a winning campaign in a state of 23.1 million registered voters and some of the most expensive media markets in the nation.
The party, its allies and the candidates themselves have a “collective commitment to ensuring we do not see a Republican elected [for governor],” Hicks said.
While Hicks and other party leaders did not publicly name the candidates who ought to leave the race, among the candidates lagging in the polls are state Supt. of Public Instruction Tony Thurmond, former state Controller Betty Yee, former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and former Assembly Majority Leader Ian Calderon.
The wide-open race to succeed Gavin Newsom as California governor has attracted a large and diverse field of candidates.
Democratic voters vastly outnumber the number of registered Republicans in the state, and no Republican has been elected to statewide office since 2006.
But given the sprawling field of gubernatorial candidates, the lack of a clear front-runner and the state’s unique primary system, the race appears up for grabs. According to an average of the most recent opinion polls, conservative commentator Steve Hilton and Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco — both Republicans — are tied for first place, according to Real Clear Politics. Each received the support of 15.5% of voters. The top Democrat, Rep. Eric Swalwell of Dublin, Calif., was backed by 12.5%.
In 2012, Republicans finished in first and second place in the race for a San Bernardino County congressional district — despite Democrats having a solid edge in voter registration. The four Democrats running for the seat split the vote, opening the door for a victory by GOP Rep. Gary Miller. Pete Aguilar, one of the Democrats who lost in the primary, went on to win that seat in 2014 and has served in Congress ever since.
Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco) on Friday pushed back at the fears that two Republicans will win the top two gubernatorial spots in June.
“That’s not going to happen,” she said in an interview after speaking at a young Democrats’ reception. “And everything that you should know about the Democrats this year is we are unified. As I say, our diversity is our strength, our unity is our power. And everybody knows that there’s too much at stake.”
However, the scenario has prompted a cross section of the typically fractious party to unite behind the belief the field must shrink, whether by candidates’ choice or through pressure.
Jodi Hicks, the leader of Planned Parenthood’s California operations, said that the organization is laser-focused on congressional races, but having two Republican gubernatorial candidates “would be nothing short of devastating.”
“We have not weighed in on the governor’s race, but we are paying close attention to whether this comes to play, and whether or not we do decide to weigh in and make sure that doesn’t happen,” she said.
Newsom and legislative Democrats have tried to buffer the massive federal funding cuts to reproductive care. A November election with two Republicans on the gubernatorial ballot would eliminate a key partner in Sacramento, and could affect turnout in down-ballot congressional and legislative races.
“A top-two Republican [race] would certainly have dire consequences for the midterm battle and to the governor’s office,” Jodi Hicks said.
Lorena Gonzalez, the leader of California Federation of Labor Unions, noted that her organization’s endorsement process begins on Tuesday.
“I think we are going to have some pretty honest discussions with candidates about their individual paths and where they are,” she said. “They’re all great candidates, so many of them are really good folks. But it’s starting to get to be that time.”
She expects the field to begin to thin in the coming days and weeks.
The conversation went beyond party leaders, taking place among delegates such as Gregory Hutchins, an academic labor researcher from Riverside.
“My goal at the convention, it’s not necessarily that the party coalesces around one particular candidate, but more, this is a test to see what candidates have a level of support that they can mount a successful campaign,” said the 29-year-old, who said he hopes to see some candidates drop out after the weekend.
“Am I concerned long term that [a top-two Republican runoff] could be a thing? Yes and no,” he said. “I’m not concerned that we’re not going to solve this problem before the primary, but I do think we need to start getting serious about, ‘We need to solve this problem soon.’”
Not everyone agreed.
Tim Paulson, a San Francisco Democrat who supports Yee, called efforts to push people out of the race “preemptive disqualification.”
“This is nothing but scare tactics to get people out of the race,” he said. “This is still a vibrant primary. Nobody knows who the front-runner is yet.”
Bob Galemmo, 71, countered that many people did not believe Donald Trump would be elected president in 2016 and fears two Republicans could advance to the general election.
“You should never say never,” he said. “If we could get down to like four or five [candidates], that would be helpful.”
The efforts have already begun.
RL Miller, the chair of the state Democratic Party’s environmental caucus, said Yee ought to drop out.
Yee, “who is at the bottom of the polls, needs to be taking a good long look at whether she is serving the party or being selfish by staying in the race,” Miller said.
Yee, a former state party vice chair, pushed back forcefully, saying pressure to drop out of the race “would just be undemocratic.”
“First of all, I’ve served this party for a long time. I don’t do it out of selfishness, by any means,” she said at a Saturday gathering where she provided breakfast burritos to delegates. “But I’ll just say this — the race is wide open.”
Yee‘s campaign manager noted that the largest group of voters is still undecided, and the candidate said no one has asked her directly to exit the race, but that someone started a rumor a month or two ago that she was going to drop out and run for insurance commissioner instead.
“I’m not dropping out, and I don’t think any candidate should go out,” Yee said.
Calderon said Swalwell had urged him to get out of the race.
Calderon defended staying in the race to try to reach undecided voters during a gubernatorial forum at the Commonwealth Club on Friday.
“I stay very consistent in that 1 to 3% range,” he joked. “But my challenge is access to resources and visibility, which is something that could change within a day with the right backing and support.”
Swalwell denied asking Calderon to leave the race.
“I never said that,” Swalwell said in an interview at a Saturday evening dinner honoring Pelosi. “I’ve enjoyed being on the trail with him, and it’s every candidate’s decision to make about their own direction.”

Willie Colón, architect of urban salsa music, dies at 75
Willie Colón, architect of urban salsa music, dies at 75
Willie Colón, the Grammy-nominated architect of urban salsa music and social activist, died Saturday. He was 75.
Over his decades-long career, the trombonist, composer, arranger and singer produced more than 40 albums that sold more than 30 million copies worldwide. He collaborated with a wide range of artists, including the Fania All Stars, David Byrne and Celia Cruz.
His celebrated collaboration with Rubén Blades, “Siembra,” became one of the bestselling salsa albums of all time, and the pair were known for addressing social issues through the genre.
Colón’s family and manager confirmed his death through social media posts.
“Willie didn’t just change salsa; he expanded it, politicized it, clothed it in urban chronicles, and took it to stages where it hadn’t been heard before,” manager Pietro Carlos wrote. “His trombone was the voice of the people, an echo of the Caribbean in New York, a bridge between two cultures.”
Colón, who was nominated for 10 Grammys and one Latin Grammy, made famous songs such as “El gran varón,” “Sin poderte hablar,” “Casanova,” “Amor verdad” and “Oh, qué será.”
Blades said on the social platform X that he confirmed “what I was reluctant to believe” and offered his condolences to Colón’s family.
The path to the trombone — and fame
Born in New York’s Bronx borough, Colón was raised by his grandmother and aunt, who from a young age nurtured him with traditional Puerto Rican music and the typical rhythms of the Latin American repertoire, including Cuban son and tango.
At age 11 he ventured into the world of music, first with flute, then bugle, trumpet and finally trombone, with which he stood out in the then-nascent genre of salsa.
His interest in trombone arose after hearing Barry Rogers playing it on “Dolores,” Mon Rivera’s song with Joe Cotto.
“It sounded like an elephant, a lion ... an animal. Something so different that, as soon as I heard it, I said to myself: ‘I want to play that instrument,’” he recalled in an interview published in the Colombian newspaper El Tiempo in 2011.
At 17 he joined the group of artists that formed the famous record label Fania Records, led and created by Jerry Masucci and Johnny Pacheco. Fania was largely responsible for the new sound that was produced in the Latin world of New York and would later be called “salsa.”
Colón’s main characteristic as a musician was the fusion of rhythms, as he harmonized jazz, rock, funk, soul and R&B with the old Latin school of Cuban son, cha-cha-cha, mambo and guaracha, adding the nostalgia of the traditional Puerto Rican sound that encompasses jíbara, bomba and plena music.
In 2004 the Latin Recording Academy awarded Colón a special Grammy for his career and contributions to music.
Community leader and activist
As a community leader, Colón fought for civil rights, mostly in the United States. He was part of the Hispanic Arts Association, the Latino Commission on AIDS, the Arthur Schomburg Coalition for a Better New York and the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute, among others.
In 1991 he was honored with the Chubb fellowship from Yale University, a public service recognition also awarded to the likes of John F. Kennedy, Moshe Dayan, the Rev. Jesse Jackson and Ronald Reagan, among others.
In the political arena, he served as special assistant to David Dinkins, New York’s first Black mayor, and was later appointed special assistant and adviser to Mayor Michael Bloomberg.
Colón had little luck running for public office himself, however. He failed in a challenge to then-U.S. Rep. Eliot Engel in the 1994 Democratic primary, and in 2001 came in third in the Democratic primary for New York’s public advocate.
He backed Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign in 2008, but he told the Observer that he voted for Donald Trump in 2016.
Colón had public clashes with artists and politicians. His friendship with Blades ruptured after Colón sued for breach of contract over the 2003 concert “Siembra ... 25 years later,” held in Puerto Rico.

I am tired of Tucker Carlson’s Israel show, when Mike Huckabee deserves focus - comment

Everyone is talking about Tucker Carlson. I get it.
He’s a genius of the attention economy, a man who turned provocation into a career and the airport lounge into a geopolitical stage. Candace Owens runs the same playbook. They’re performers. And they’re increasingly beside the point.
US Ambassador Mike Huckabee sat across from Carlson at Ben-Gurion Airport and did something nobody seems to want to talk about. He made an argument. A real one. Patient, specific, grounded, the kind you can actually follow from beginning to end.
But first, I have a confession to make: “Christian Zionism” entered my working vocabulary embarrassingly late.
For years, the phrase lived somewhere in the back of my mind as a sociological curiosity, somewhere between a footnote and a conference panel I’d skip. Then October 7 happened, and the footnotes started mattering.
American Christians care about Jewish survival
While Jewish intellectuals were busy being nuanced, millions of American Christians were busy actually caring about Jewish survival. Not abstractly. Practically. Showing up.
Huckabee is one of them. He’s also, it turns out, quite good at explaining why.
He defined Zionism simply: Jews have a right to a homeland where they can live with security and safety. He defined a Christian Zionist as someone who believes Israel has a right to exist. You might find that modest. I find it clarifying.
When the baseline has drifted so far that stating Israel’s right to exist reads as a controversial position, saying it plainly and without embarrassment is its own kind of act.
When Carlson tried to steer the conversation toward his usual grievance tour, Huckabee said early on that he wanted them to “talk to each other and not about each other.”
That’s such a small sentence, and it did so much work. He’d decided before the cameras rolled that he was there to persuade, and he spent the whole interview doing exactly that.
When Carlson insinuated that supporting Israel creates some kind of conflict of interest for an American diplomat, Huckabee looked down at his lapel. “What flag am I wearing here? It’s my flag. It’s who I serve.”
The argument that pro-Israel Americans are somehow disloyal to their own country is one of the uglier ideas making the rounds right now, on the MAGA Right and the campus Left simultaneously, which tells you something, and Huckabee cut through it without raising his voice.
On the money, he was equally clear. American military assistance to Israel cycles back through American defense procurement. It buys an ally in one of the world’s most dangerous neighborhoods. Israel is, he said, “the tip of the spear.”
Argue with the metaphor if you want. The underlying point holds: this alliance has a strategic logic that would cost far more to replace than it costs to maintain. He wasn’t asking anyone for charity. He was describing how deterrence works.
On Iran, he said what the situation actually requires saying: that a regime that has spent decades chanting “Death to America” should probably be taken at its word.
Here’s what got me interested in this conversation: When Carlson raised the harassment of Christians in Israel, and it does happen, it’s a real problem, responsible people acknowledge it, Huckabee didn’t change the subject.
He called it what it is. Spitting on Christians comes from “an evil heart,” he said, and “they should go to jail here.” That’s how a real friend talks. Holding an ally to its own values because you believe it can actually meet them.
He also mentioned, almost as an aside, that he’d made over a hundred trips to Israel across several decades. That he goes to church every Sunday. That he plays bass guitar in his church band. That he’s never been bothered for being a Christian there. Carlson flew in, stayed in the terminal, flew out, and made content. Huckabee has spent 30 years building familiarity with a place.
At the end, he invited Carlson back. Come see more. Come to church with me. See that Christians are pretty free here. It was the tone of someone with nothing to hide, a host, not a supplicant.
I know the temptation among Jews and Israelis right now is toward a certain wariness about Christian support. After watching institutions they trusted dissolve over the past two years, suspicion feels like the grown-up position. I understand it.
But Huckabee sat in that airport and made the full case, strategically, morally, personally, when making it cost something. He didn’t flinch, didn’t deflect, didn’t reach for the easy answer.
Carlson will keep generating headlines. He always does. But Huckabee made the argument, and arguments have a longer half-life than clips.
The least we can do is pay attention and thank Huckabee for speaking the truth of sane Judeo-Christian values.

Former UK PM Boris Johnson says UK should immediately send non-combat troops to Ukraine
Speaking ahead of the fourth anniversary of Russia’s full-scale invasion, Mr Johnson told the BBC that these troops should be stationed in peaceful regions

Former prime minister Boris Johnson has called for troops from the UK and Europe to be deployed immediately to Ukraine.
Mr Johnson said non-combat forces should be stationed in peaceful regions to send a firm message to Russian president Vladimir Putin otherwise the Russian leader would “keep going” with the conflict.
Speaking ahead of the four-year anniversary of the invasion, the former politician told BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg that Ukraine’s allies had been “too slow” to respond.
“We've always delayed needlessly,” he said. “We've then ended up giving the Ukrainians what they have been asking for, and actually it's always served to their advantage and to the disadvantage of Putin. I mean, the one person who suffers from escalation is Putin.”
In the comments, which are set to air on Sunday, Mr Johnson said that he saw no reason why military action could not be taken to support Ukraine during wartime if security guarantees were promised in the event of a ceasefire.
“If we are willing to do it in the context of a ceasefire, which of course puts all the initiative, all the power, in Putin’s hands, why not do it now?’” he questioned.
“There is no logical reason that I can see why we shouldn’t send peaceful ground forces there to show our support, our constitutional support for a free, independent Ukraine.”
Military strategists and commentators have suggested that such a move could be interpreted by Russia as an escalation. Putin has previously remarked that Russia is “ready right now” for war if Europe wants it.
Putin rejected Western peacekeeping proposals in September warning that troops deployed to protect Ukraine would be considered “legitimate targets”.
Mr Johnson pushed back on those comments and insisted that Ukraine and its supporters should be able to operate on their own terms not those dictated by Russia.
“It’s about whether Ukraine is a free country or not,” he said. “If it’s a vassal state of Russia, which is what Putin wants, then obviously it’s up to Putin to decide who comes to his country. If it’s not, then it’s up to the Ukrainians.”
Britain’s ministry of defence responded to the comments to reiterate the government’s existing policy, confirming that ongoing work with the “coalition of the willing” would prepare for troop deployment in the event of a ceasefire.
“The multinational force Ukraine under UK leadership will secure peace for the long term, with the Prime Minister being clear that we will put British troops on the ground following the end of hostilities,” the ministry said in a statement.
Mr Johnson also blamed Western failures for the invasion citing a lack of support for Ukraine after the invasion of Crimea in 2014, a chaotic US withdrawal from Afghanistan and delays in punishing Bashar al-Assad for the use of chemical weapons in Syria.
“I think Putin was emboldened by a Western failure in Syria to punish Assad for using chemical weapons,” he said.
“I think Putin was further emboldened in February 2022 by what he’d seen in Afghanistan, and a sort of general sense that the West was on the back foot. He’d seen those appalling pictures of Americans being forced to flee Afghanistan and the UK pulling out as well, and that really did embolden him.”
A Ministry of Defence spokesperson said: “We are proud of UK leadership on Ukraine – supporting the fight today and working to secure the peace tomorrow.
“It’s why this Government is providing the highest ever level of military support, including a recent half-billion-pound air defence package just last week, accelerating £200 million for the UK military to prepare for any Ukraine deployment, and working with over 30 nations through the UK-led coalition of the willing.
“The multinational force Ukraine under UK leadership will secure peace for the long term, with the Prime Minister being clear that we will put British troops on the ground following the end of hostilities.”

Nico O’Reilly double seals key 2-1 win for Man City over Newcastle United
Manchester City’s win cut Arsenal’s lead at the top of the Premier League to two points.
Nico O’Reilly’s first-half brace inspired Manchester City to a vital 2-1 victory over Newcastle United, which turned up the heat on Premier League leaders Arsenal.
City took the lead on Saturday when O’Reilly slammed in a left-footed shot in the 14th minute before Lewis Hall levelled.

O’Reilly headed in Erling Haaland’s cross to restore City’s lead in the 27th minute, and it proved to be the match-winner as Pep Guardiola’s side cut Arsenal’s lead to two points.
Arsenal face north London rivals Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday, knowing that City are now breathing down their necks.
The stuttering form of Arsenal, who drew with the bottom club Wolverhampton Wanderers on Wednesday, opened the door for City, but victory over Newcastle was imperative.
It looked like a formality early on as they overran their visitors, but it was a different story after the break as they nervously held on to the victory.
Nothing illustrated City’s determination more than the sight of goal-machine Haaland working tirelessly back in his own area, blocking shots and making clearing headers.
Newcastle pushed hard for an equaliser, and when the final whistle blew, there was relief around Etihad Stadium. They will now be watching Arsenal’s Sunday derby with added interest.
City were slick at the start and went ahead when a surging Omar Marmoush played in O’Reilly. He could have touched it on for Haaland to his left, but the 20-year-old opted to trust his left foot, and his powerful shot beat Nick Pope.
Newcastle were level soon afterwards, though, as a weak clearance fell to Hall, whose shot took a touch off a City player before beating keeper Gianluigi Donnarumma.
Haaland was not on the scoresheet but showed many other attributes to his game, and it was his measured cross that was met by O’Reilly, who directed his header past Pope.
City were nowhere near as effective as an attacking force after the break, but they defended doggedly when required and were always a threat on the counter-attack.
They now have 56 points from 27 games. Should Arsenal fail to beat Tottenham on Sunday, City will feel they have the title race firmly in their hands.
O’Reilly said he was “over the moon” about the goals and three points.
“The win was the most important thing: close the gap and apply as much pressure as possible,” he told TNT Sports.
“Very happy with the two goals. It is a dream of mine to win [the Premier League].”
Asked if City, unbeaten in eight games, can win the title, he added: “Yeah, definitely. We always believe we can win games.”
Elsewhere on Saturday, Aston Villa’s faint Premier League title hopes suffered a blow as they were held to a 1-1 draw at home to Leeds United, and Chelsea’s top-four ambitions were damaged when they dropped two points against relegation-bound Burnley.
Anton Stach’s stunning 31st-minute free kick past Emiliano Martinez looked like giving Leeds a vital victory at Villa Park, but substitute Tammy Abraham levelled late on.
Chelsea moved above Manchester United into fourth spot on goal difference, but it felt like two points dropped for the second week running as they drew 1-1 with Burnley at home.
Joao Pedro put Chelsea ahead, but the hosts were reduced to 10 men when Wesley Fofana received a second yellow card and Burnley equalised in stoppage time through Zian Flemming.
Brighton’s James Milner broke the Premier League appearance record in their 2-0 win at Brentford.
The 40-year-old former Manchester City and Liverpool player made his 654th appearance to go past Gareth Barry.
West Ham had the opportunity to really put some pressure on Nottingham Forest and Spurs in the relegation battle, but played out a turgid draw with visiting Bournemouth. It was the sixth successive Premier League stalemate between the sides.

Journalists identify more than 186,000 Russian soldiers killed in Ukraine
The information comes from a joint report by the BBC Russian Service, Mediazona, and a team of volunteers, utilizing open data, according to Ukrinform.
Over the past month, the number of confirmed names has increased by almost 20,000, which is a record increase. However, as the study's authors emphasize, the increase in deaths is not related to the current situation on the front lines.
It is noted that the proportion of volunteers among the dead continues to grow: They now account for 33% of confirmed losses. More than half of all identified volunteers have died in the last year and a half.
The methodology for calculating the figures is based on an analysis of public reports, including obituaries, social media posts, and missing-person announcements. The actual number of casualties may be much higher.
According to Ukrinform, based on data from the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the total combat losses of Russian troops from February 24, 2022, to February 21, 2026, in the war against Ukraine amount to approximately 1,258,890 soldiers.

Someone was shot outside my building. It feels like a macabre rite of passage

Opinion
Someone was shot outside my building. It feels like a macabre rite of passage
Washington: Hello from a pungent Washington, DC, home of the sewage-filled Potomac River.
A few days ago, I joined an unfortunate club – Australian correspondents in Washington, DC, who have come all too close to a fatal shooting.
I had only been in my new apartment a week when an email lobbed from building management notifying me of an “emerging situation across the street” involving police and emergency services.
The incident occurred at 2.15pm on a Friday, while I was at work. By the time I got home that night, all traces of the emergency had disappeared.
But the next day, I learnt there had been a fatal shooting. The DC Metropolitan Police said the victim was 22-year-old Nehemia Jamaane Williams, a local, who was found inside a car, and died in hospital from his injuries. Police were appealing for information. No arrests had been made.
Welcome to the neighbourhood, I guess. My new place is only a few blocks from where Matthew Cranston, a former Washington correspondent for The Australian Financial Review, witnessed a shooting inside a crowded McDonald’s in September 2022.
And that was just metres from where a 15-year-old boy was shot dead a few months earlier, near the apartment building where my predecessor as North America correspondent, Farrah Tomazin, lived.
Those incidents occurred amid a post-COVID-19 pandemic crime wave that rocked the US capital and many American cities. It is partly why President Donald Trump sent the National Guard into Washington last year, even though rates of violent crime were already falling.
The fatal shooting outside my building – in broad daylight – was the seventh homicide in DC this year. The eighth came a few nights later in the Navy Yard neighbourhood south of Capitol Hill. And yet, there has been a 68 per cent decrease in the number of homicides so far this year compared to last year.
“We have one of the safest cities in the world,” Trump said on Wednesday (Washington time) at an event for Black History Month, as he welcomed to the stage Felicia Cook, whose grandson was killed during a violent encounter in 2017. “Now you can walk down the street, and you have nothing to fear.”
Trump regularly overstates the case with grand statements about how Washington now has “zero” crime, and how once-empty restaurants are now filled to bursting. “You can be with your child, with your loved one, with your lover,” he said last month. “Your lover’s not going to be killed any more, so you can act like a real lover.”
It’s difficult to take those statements seriously when someone’s shot dead on your doorstep. But, broadly speaking, we have to – because violent crime is down dramatically, not just in DC, but around the country.
The Council on Criminal Justice reported homicides were down 21 per cent in 2025 from 2024, based on data from 35 major US cities. That was 922 fewer homicides.
Furthermore, the council said that when national data was reported by the FBI later this year, there was a strong possibility that the murder rate would drop to 4 per 100,000 residents.
“That would be the lowest rate ever recorded in law enforcement or public health data going back to 1900, and would mark the largest single-year percentage drop in the homicide rate on record,” the council said.
The White House chalked this up as a major victory for Trump’s tough-on-crime agenda, compared to what it called Joe Biden’s “defund the police era”.
In reality, violent crime fell across the board, not just in cities where Trump mobilised the National Guard or cracked down on illegal immigrants. Homicides fell 40 per cent in Washington, DC, but they also fell by the same proportion in Denver and Omaha, and by more than 20 per cent in cities from Atlanta to Dallas to New York.
This is all a good thing. Trump may be overstating his contribution to a trend that was already under way when he took office, but he has also rightly seized on the fact that most Americans want and need relief from violent crime.
Of course, a serious attempt to reduce that harm would involve changing the country’s gun laws. But that is not on the cards.
One thing you come to understand quickly in the United States is the complicated nature of attitudes to guns. It’s not just redneck Republicans who cling to their weapons: last week in Washington, my group had a long debate with an otherwise very progressive bartender who was set on her right to bear arms.
DC is much safer than it was last year, and the year before that, and that’s welcome. Thanks, Mr President. But let’s not pretend all is fixed.

We will halve disadvantage gap in schools, ministers say in landmark education reforms
The government will reform how schools get targeted disadvantage funding as part of an attempt to tackle the gap in achievement between pupils from poorer backgrounds compared with their more affluent peers

Ministers will set a target to halve the disadvantage gap by the time children born under this government finish secondary school, as part of a plan to improve the education system in England.
To tackle the achievement gap between pupils from poorer backgrounds and their more affluent peers, the government will reform how schools get targeted disadvantage funding.
The Schools White Paper, set to be published in full on Monday, will also set out two new programmes to tackle the performance of disadvantaged pupils locally in the North East and on the coast.
It comes after details of the special educational needs and disabilities (Send) reforms also forming part of the white paper were leaked on Thursday.
It has been reported that from 2029, EHCPs (education, health and care plan) will be reassessed once children reach the end of primary school, proposals which sparked concern from disability charity Sense who warned that reassessments could increase instability for children and young people.
An EHCP is a legally binding document in the UK for children and young people with special educational needs or disabilities that require more support than is normally available in school.
The reforms are expected to introduce a plan with legal footing for all children with Send called Individual Support Plans (ISPs).
Speaking about plans to halve the attainment gap, education secretary Bridget Phillipson said: “These reforms are a golden opportunity to cut the link between background and success – one that we must seize.
“Our schools have made great strides in recent decades. Yet for too long, many children in our country have been let down by a one-size-fits-all system, denied opportunity because they’re poor or because they have additional needs.
“Our Schools White Paper presents the blueprint for opportunity for the next generation, with an education system that truly serves every child, whatever their needs and wherever in the country they grow up.”
In the latest GCSE results, the disadvantage gap index for year 11s stood at 3.92, according to figures from the Department for Education (DfE).
It had previously narrowed from 4.07 in 2011 to a low of 3.66 in 2019/20 with some small fluctuations in between. It then widened again post-pandemic to the highest it had been in a decade at 3.94 in 2022/23.
The government will also set a new target for attendance to recover 20 million school days a year by the end of 2028/29 compared with 2023/24.
Instead of targeting disadvantage funding based on whether a child is eligible to receive free school meals (FSM), after a consultation, distribution of funding to schools could take into account how low family income is, how long this has been the case, and the place a child lives.
It would also remove the need for families to choose to take up free school meals to be eligible for deprivation funding, in an attempt to cut admin for schools.
The two new programmes, Mission North East and Mission Coastal – will aim to tackle poorer performance for disadvantaged pupils in the areas, including white working-class pupils.
It will be based on the model of the London Challenge, a programme which was introduced to improve schools in London under the Labour government in 2003.
The White Paper will also set out how incentives worth up to £15,000 for newly appointed headteachers to work in parts of the country that need heads.
It will further include a commitment to develop minimum expectations for schools around how they communicate with parents and manage pupils’ transition from primary to secondary school.
The Schools White Paper was originally set to be published in autumn 2025, but was delayed to allow a further period to test Send reforms.

Ministers to set out plans to halve attainment gap in England’s schools

Plans to halve the attainment gap between the poorest pupils in England and their more affluent peers will be set out by the government on Monday.
The schools white paper will detail proposals to change the criteria under which schools receive funding to support the most disadvantaged students.
Disadvantage funding is now allocated based on how many pupils at a school receive free school meals – generally available to children from families with an annual income of less than £7,400.
Labour wants to broaden this criteria, overhauling the funding formula to give greater weight to funding pupils based on family income.
The policy is likely to shift funding for disadvantage payments away from the annual pupil premium payments given to schools for each child eligible for free school meals.
The white paper will also include controversial proposals for local authorities to be able to administer groups of schools through their own multiacademy trusts, and set new minimum expectations for schools to engage with parents.
The “disadvantage gap is as stark today as it was over a decade ago”, Labour said, with only 44% of children in receipt of free school meals achieving a pass of grade 4 or above in GCSE maths and English. This compares with 70% of children who do not qualify for free school meals, the party added.
Bridget Phillipson, the education secretary, said: “These reforms are a golden opportunity to cut the link between background and success – one that we must seize.
“Our schools have made great strides in recent decades. Yet for too long, many children in our country have been let down by a one-size-fits-all system, denied opportunity because they’re poor or because they have additional needs.
“Our schools white paper presents the blueprint for opportunity for the next generation, with an education system that truly serves every child, whatever their needs and wherever in the country they grow up.”
At present, disadvantage funding for schools costs about £8bn a year. There is no guarantee the pot would be increased to reflect the proposed changes, with government sources saying this would be determined at the next spending review.
Some MPs and campaigners have questioned how effective these proposed reforms will be without more guaranteed funding.
Munira Wilson, the Liberal Democrat education spokesperson, said: “Basing funding on income alone risks hard-wiring regional inequalities into the system.
“Instead of reshuffling a fixed pot of money – risking new cliff edges that will leave struggling families even worse off – ministers must restore the pupil premium to its 2015 real-terms value.
“Starmer must also guarantee that any investment will rise with inflation, so no child is left without the support they need.”
Pepe Di’Iasio, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: “We very much agree with the provision of more targeted funding for schools supporting the most disadvantaged children and have advocated for such a measure for several years.
“However, it is vital that this is done through additional investment into the education system, rather than distributing the same pot of money in a different way, with the risk of creating winners and losers.”
The white paper will also outline plans for two new programmes – Mission North East and Mission Coastal – to tackle the performances of deprived pupils in certain parts of the country. The Guardian understands the precise locations for these initiatives have yet to be decided.
They will be based on the London Challenge, a New Labour project aimed at driving up attainment in secondary schools in the capital that focused on schools working together to share learning and ideas. It was praised by Ofsted for helping to improve educational standards.
The government is also planning a radical overhaul of the special educational needs (Send) system as part of its plans. It plans to give every child with Send an individual support plan.
However, some Labour MPs are thought to be nervous about some of the plans, particularly whether parents will retain the right to appeal if they are unhappy with the level of support their child is receiving.
The white paper was originally due to be published last autumn, but was delayed to allow for further consideration of the Send proposals.
Ministers are also expected to announce new attendance targets in an effort to recover 20m lost school days a year.
It will propose pay rises for newly appointed headteachers to incentivise them to work in parts of the country where the need is greatest. This could be worth up to £15,000 to individual teachers.

Pakistan carries out strikes against terrorist targets on Afghan border

Pakistan has said it carried out strikes along the Afghanistan border to target terrorists it blames for recent attacks.
Pakistani forces reportedly carried out air strikes in several areas of eastern and southeastern Afghanistan on Sunday, according to Afghan local media and the Pakistani Ministry of Information.
Islamabad did not say precisely in which areas the strikes were carried out or provide details but cited three terrorist attacks since the start of Ramadan last week in Pakistan as the reason for carrying out the strikes.
In comments before dawn Sunday, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar wrote on X that the military conducted what he described as “intelligence-based, selective operations” against seven camps belonging to Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan, or TTP, and its affiliates.
He said an affiliate of the Daesh group was also targeted in the border region.
In October, Pakistan also conducted strikes deep inside Afghanistan to target terrorist hideouts.
“Pakistan expects and reiterates the Interim Afghan Government to fulfil its obligations and deny use of its soil by Khwarij and terrorists against Pakistan, as the safety and security of people of Pakistan comes first and foremost,” the ministry added.
The strikes came in the aftermath of recent suicide bombing incidents in Pakistan, it said.
“Sources told TOLO News that following the air strikes in Khogyani district, Nangarhar province, Pakistani forces also carried out strikes in the province’s Ghani Khel district, Nangarhar province, and Behsud district, Nangarhar province,” the Afghan news channel TOLO News wrote on X.
Afghanistan vows ‘appropriate, measured response’
The Defence Ministry of Afghanistan said on Sunday it would meet the Pakistani strikes on its soil with an “appropriate and measured response” at a “suitable time.”
The ministry condemned the attacks "in the strongest possible terms" on US social media company X, describing them as a clear violation of national sovereignty, international law, principles of good neighborliness and Islamic values.
It said targeting civilian and religious centres demonstrates the Pakistani military’s intelligence and security shortcomings, and "such repeated acts of aggression will never be able to conceal their internal shortcomings.
Afghan government spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid posted on X that Pakistan bombed Nangarhar and Paktika provinces but alleged that casualties were civilians, even though he did not specify the number or nature of casualties.
No confirmed information has been released so far regarding possible casualties.
Pakistan vowed to avenge the killing of two security personnel on Saturday in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and the suicide bombing in a mosque in Islamabad two weeks ago, warning that it would not allow any attack launched from Afghanistan to go unanswered.
Pakistan has accused neighbouring Afghanistan of sheltering TTP terrorists and of being responsible for a surge in cross-border attacks, a claim which Afghanistan denied.
The Pakistani government has urged the Afghan government to dismantle the alleged sanctuaries of the TTP terrorist group inside Afghanistan.
According to Pakistani military officials, more than 500 people, including over 311 soldiers, were killed in attacks, largely carried out by the TTP, last year.
Pakistan’s foreign ministry also summoned on Friday an Afghan diplomat over a recent terrorist attack in the northwestern province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa near the Afghan border that killed 11 soldiers.

TRIPOLI, Feb 21 - At least five bodies of migrants including two women have been washed ashore in َQasr al-Akhyar, a coastal town in the east of Libya's capital Tripoli, a police officer told Reuters on Saturday.
Hassan Al-Ghawil, head of investigations at the Qasr Al-Akhyar police station, said that according to people in the area, a child's body washed ashore and because of the waves' height the body returned to the sea, and the coast guard was asked to search for it.
Ghawil said the bodies are all dark-skinned people. The bodies were found on Emhamid Al-Sharif shore in the western part of the town by people who reported to the police station.
Libya has become a transit route for migrants fleeing conflict and poverty to Europe across the Mediterranean since the fall in 2011 of dictator Muammar Gaddafi to a NATO-backed uprising. Factional conflict has split the country into western and eastern factions since 2014.
Qasr al-Akhyar is a coastal town some 73 kilometers (45 miles) east of Tripoli.
Pictures were posted on the internet, and also seen by Reuters, showing the bodies of the migrants lying on the shore, where some were still within black inflatable lifebuoys.
"We reported to the Red Crescent to recover the bodies," said Ghawil. "The bodies we found are still intact and we think there are more bodies to wash ashore."
Earlier this month, fifty-three migrants, including two babies, were dead or missing after a rubber boat carrying 55 people capsized off the coast of Zuwara town in western Tripoli, the International Organization for Migration said.
Last week, a U.N. report said migrants in Libya, including young girls, are at risk of being killed, tortured, raped or put into domestic slavery, calling for a moratorium on the return of migrant boats to the country until human rights are ensured. REUTERS

Islamic State claims two attacks on Syrian army, announces ‘new phase’ of operations
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
Islamic State claimed responsibility on Feb 21 for two attacks targeting Syrian army personnel in northern and eastern Syria, as the militant group signalled what it described as a new phase of operations against the country’s leadership
The militant group said on its Dabiq news agency that it had targeted “an individual of the apostate Syrian regime” in the city of Mayadin in Deir al-Zor province using a pistol, and attacked two other personnel with machine guns in the northern city of Raqqa.
Syria’s Defence Ministry said in a statement that a Syrian army soldier and a civilian were killed on Feb 21 by “unknown assailants.” A military source told Reuters the soldier belonged to the army’s 42nd Division.
The attacks come amid a sharp escalation by ISIS against Syria’s leadership under President Ahmed al-Sharaa, a former al Qaeda leader who broke with the group in 2016 before leading a coalition of Islamist factions that overthrew President Bashar al-Assad at the end of 2024.
On the evening of Feb 21, ISIS released a recorded statement by its spokesperson, Abu Hudhayfa al-Ansari, who said Syria had “moved from Iranian occupation to Turkish-American occupation.”
The group said it had begun a “new phase of operations” in Syria, describing Mr Sharaa as a “watchdog” of the global coalition and vowing that his fate would be no different from that of Mr Assad.
Mr Sharaa signed Syria’s accession to the global coalition
The latest incidents come two days after IS claimed responsibility for another attack in Deir al-Zor that killed a member of the Interior Ministry’s internal security forces and wounded another.
Several social media accounts and Telegram channels supporting ISIS have in recent hours called for intensified attacks using motorcycles and firearms.
ISIS has carried out six attacks against Syrian government targets since the fall of Assad.
A report by the UN Office of Counter-Terrorism released last week said Mr Sharaa and two senior Cabinet ministers had been targeted in five foiled assassination attempts by ISIS. REUTERS

Attacks on Sudan healthcare facilities killed 69 this year
Five attacks on healthcare facilities have killed dozens of people in Sudan since the beginning of the year, the WHO said Saturday, as the war nears the start of its fourth year.
The fighting between Sudan's army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces has dismantled an already fragile medical system, with more than a third of facilities currently out of service.
"During the first 50 days of 2026, five attacks on health care have already been recorded in Sudan, killing 69 people and injuring 49," WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus wrote on X.
On Sunday a hospital was targeted in the southeastern state of Sennar, leaving three patients dead and seven people wounded, including an employee, Tedros said.
In three other attacks early this month, more than 30 people were killed when medical centres were targeted in South Kordofan, a vast region south of the capital Khartoum that is currently a focus of the fighting.
The WHO has confirmed at least 206 attacks on healthcare facilities since the start of the war in April 2023, resulting in the deaths of around 2,000 people and injuries to several hundred.
Last year alone, 65 attacks killed more than 1,620 people, accounting for 80 percent of all deaths worldwide linked to attacks on the medical sector, according to the WHO.
Since it broke out, Sudan's civil war has killed tens of thousands of people and forced 11 million to flee their homes, triggering what the UN says is one of the world's worst humanitarian crises.
According to the WHO, the country is facing multiple disease outbreaks, notably cholera, malaria, dengue and measles, in addition to malnutrition.
Some 4.2 million cases of acute malnutrition are expected to arise in Sudan this year, including more than 800,000 cases of severe acute malnutrition, the WHO chief said earlier this month.
Around 33 million people will be left without humanitarian aid in 2026, with the United Nations warning in January that its aid stocks could run out by the end of March.

Venezuela receives more than 1,500 amnesty requests under new law
More than 370 political prisoners have already been granted amnesty under the US-backed legislation.
More than 1,5000 political prisoners in Venezuela have applied for amnesty under a new law that came into effect just a few days ago, according to the head of the country’s legislature.
“A total of 1,557 cases are being addressed immediately, and hundreds of people deprived of their freedom are already being released under the amnesty law”, National Assembly chief Jorge Rodriguez told a news conference on Saturday.

- list 3 of 3IMF warns Venezuela’s economy and humanitarian situation is ‘quite fragile’
Rodriguez’s announcement comes two days after the country’s legislature unanimously adopted a landmark amnesty law.
Amnesty is not automatic under the law: petitioners must ask the court handling their cases.
On Friday, the lawmaker overseeing the amnesty process, Jorge Arreaza, announced that prosecutors had asked courts to free 379 prisoners. They include opposition members, activists, human rights defenders, journalists and many others detained for months or even years.
So far, 80 prisoners have been freed, Rodriguez told the AFP news agency on Saturday. All of those released had been detained in the capital, Caracas, he said, without offering further details.
Further releases could be granted within 15 days, said Arreaza.
Venezuela’s interim president, Delcy Rodriguez, the sister of the top lawmaker, pushed for the United States-backed legislation after she rose to power following the US’s abduction of leftist leader Nicolas Maduro during a military raid on January 3.
The legislation’s approval marked a reversal for Venezuelan authorities, who have for decades denied holding political prisoners and say those jailed have committed crimes.
During its signing, Rodriguez said the law showed that the country’s political leaders were “letting go of a little intolerance and opening new avenues for politics in Venezuela”.
However, opposition figures have criticised the new legislation, which appears to include carve-outs for some offences previously used by authorities to target Maduro’s political opponents.
Human rights organisations are also calling for the law to be applied to all prisoners held for political reasons, even if they are not listed among the beneficiaries.
“It is discriminatory and unconstitutional to exclude imprisoned military personnel and persecuted political figures,” Alfredo Romero, president of rights group Foro Penal, said on X Saturday. Without this, “there can be no talk of national coexistence”.
The law explicitly does not apply to those prosecuted for “promoting” or “facilitating… armed or forceful actions” against Venezuela’s sovereignty by foreign actors.
Delcy Rodriguez has levelled such accusations against opposition leader and Nobel peace laureate Maria Corina Machado, who hopes, at some point, to return to Venezuela from the US.
Opposition politician Juan Pablo Guanipa, a close ally of Machado, had a house arrest order against him lifted, his brother, lawmaker Tomas Guanipa, told the Reuters news agency late on Thursday.
The law also excludes members of the security forces convicted of “terrorism”-related activities.
But the amnesty extends to 11,000 political prisoners who, over nearly three decades, were paroled or placed under house arrest.
“The law provides for those substitute measures to be lifted so that these people can enjoy full freedom”, Rodriguez told reporters.
Outside a national police facility in Caracas known as Zone 7, relatives – some of whom have been on site for weeks – waited patiently.
“Let’s hope it’s true,” Genesis Rojas told AFP.
A group of relatives who have been camped out for days chanted: “We want to go home!”
Hundreds have already been granted conditional release by Rodriguez’s government since the deadly US raid that resulted in Maduro’s capture.
Maduro and his wife are in US custody awaiting trial. He has pleaded not guilty to drug trafficking charges and declared that he was a “prisoner of war.”

Finland secured Olympic bronze in men’s ice hockey with a 6–1 victory over Slovakia in Saturday’s medal match, sealing the country’s eighth Olympic medal in the sport.
The win marked Finland’s fifth bronze and continued a run of podium finishes in tournaments featuring NHL players. In six such Olympic events, Finland have claimed five medals.
The teams had met in the opening group match, when Slovakia won 4–1. This time Finland controlled the decisive stages and scored four times in the third period to settle the contest.
Sebastian Aho opened the scoring at 7:27 of the first period, finishing a play set up by Artturi Lehkonen and Miro Heiskanen. Finland led 1–0 after the opening twenty minutes.
Erik Haula doubled the advantage at 28:05 in the second period, assisted by Joel Armia and Eeli Tolvanen. Slovakia responded late in the period when Tomas Tatar scored at 39:30 to cut the deficit to 2–1.
The game turned early in the third period. With Slovakia pressing for an equaliser, Finland earned a power play. Roope Hintz redirected a point shot at 48:27 to restore a two-goal lead. Heiskanen and Tolvanen recorded assists.
Less than a minute later, Kaapo Kakko extended the lead to 4–1 with a wrist shot from space in the slot. Slovakia struggled to recover after conceding twice in quick succession.
Slovakia withdrew goaltender Samuel Hlavaj in the closing minutes in search of a comeback. Armia scored into the empty net at 55:32 after receiving the puck from Hintz. Haula added his second of the night at 58:42, also into an empty net, with Armia and Rasmus Ristolainen providing assists.
Haula finished with two goals. Armia recorded one goal and two assists. Hintz scored once and added an assist. Heiskanen and Tolvanen each contributed two assists.
Juuse Saros made 30 saves for Finland. Hlavaj stopped 29 shots for Slovakia.
Finland captain Mikael Granlund left the ice in the third period after hitting his head against the boards during a shift. He removed his helmet and went to the dressing room following a discussion with medical staff. According to Yle’s live coverage, Granlund later returned to the bench for the post-match handshakes and continued talks with the team doctor.
The bronze medal represents Finland’s first men’s major tournament medal since the 2022 World Championship title. The country previously won Olympic gold in Beijing and silver in Turin in 2006 and Calgary in 1988.
Saturday’s result concludes the men’s tournament at the Milano-Cortina Winter Games weekend with Finland returning home with a place on the podium.

Slovakia Marks 8 Years Since the Murder of Journalist Ján Kuciak and his Fiancée

Reported by
Hundreds of people gathered in Bratislava and other cities across Slovakia on Saturday to mark the eighth anniversary of the killings of investigative reporter Ján Kuciak and his fiancée, Martina Kušnírová, in a case that shook the country but still lacks a final answer about who ordered their deaths.
The murders on Feb. 21, 2018, were carried out by gunman Miroslav Marček, who shot Kuciak twice in the chest and Kušnírová once in the head, while an accomplice, Tomáš Szabó, waited nearby, prosecutors said.
Both men are serving 25-year prison sentences. Authorities say they acted on instructions relayed by intermediary Zoltán Andruskó, who confessed and received a 15-year term.
Yet the central question — who commissioned the assassination — remains unresolved, leaving one of Europe’s most consequential journalist murder cases without closure.
Prosecutors allege that businessman Marian Kočner ordered the killing through an associate, Alena Zsuzsová, who then tasked Andruskó. Courts have twice acquitted Kočner and once convicted Zsuzsová, but each verdict has been overturned on appeal, effectively resetting the case.
The retrial, now underway at the Specialized Criminal Court in Pezinok, follows a ruling last May by the Supreme Court of Slovakia that cited serious flaws in how earlier judges evaluated evidence. The high court said the panel had failed to address key facts and had not followed prior judicial instructions.
The new proceedings, which opened in January and are scheduled to run through December, also include charges tied to alleged plots against prosecutors. Two additional defendants — Dušan Kračina and Darko Dragić — are accused in those cases.
The killings prompted mass demonstrations in 2018 that helped topple a government and reshaped the country’s political landscape. Eight years on, the case remains a symbol of unresolved justice and the risks faced by investigative journalists.
At a commemorative gathering at Freedom Square, Kuciak’s father, Jozef Kuciak, told attendees, according to The Slovak Spectator: “Every day we live with pain; every day we go to the cemetery to light candles instead of raising our grandchildren.”
In a statement, Pavol Szalai of Reporters Without Borders urged judges to “duly examine” all evidence and rule independently, adding, “Europe’s eyes are on Slovakia.”
Roberta Metsola, president of the European Parliament, said the murders had “shaken Europe” and noted they came months after the killing of Daphne Caruana Galizia. “Their courage remains a beacon for journalists across the continent who risk everything to uncover the truth and safeguard our democracies,” she wrote on X.

K-pop’s big freeze: are cracks in China’s cultural blockade a thaw?
A decade-long geopolitical chill has kept South Korean entertainers largely locked out of the Chinese market, but fans find ways to connect
While K-pop has conquered almost every corner of the globe, South Korea’s entertainment industry remains largely locked out of the Chinese market due to a geopolitical chill that has lingered for a decade.
In early January, the Chinese remake of the South Korean television series My Mister – featuring singer-actress IU – was released on the streaming platform Youku. The Chinese version, titled Loving Strangers, starred actors Mark Chao Yu-ting and Zhang Zifeng. Media reports noted that it was the first South Korean drama remake to be publicly distributed in China since the ban began.
Earlier this month, South Korean entertainment company CJ ENM partnered with JYP Entertainment’s Chinese subsidiary and Tencent Music Entertainment to launch Onecead, an artist management and music production company with a focus on the Chinese market.

Crews recover bodies of 9 backcountry skiers days after California avalanche
Crews recover bodies of 9 backcountry skiers days after California avalanche
TRUCKEE, Calif. (AP) — Crews recovered the bodies of nine backcountry skiers who were killed by an avalanche in California’s Sierra Nevada, authorities said Saturday, concluding a harrowing operation that was hindered by intense snowfall.
A search team reached the bodies of eight victims and found one other who had been missing and presumed dead since Tuesday’s avalanche on Castle Peak near Lake Tahoe. The ninth person who was missing was found “relatively close” to the other victims, according to Nevada County Sheriff’s Lt. Dennis Hack, but was impossible to see due to whiteout conditions at that time.
At a news conference, Sheriff Shannon Moon praised the collective efforts of the numerous agencies that helped recover the bodies — from the California Highway Patrol to the National Guard to the Pacific Gas & Electric utility company — and 42 volunteers who helped on the last day of the operation.
“We are fortunate in this mountain community that we are very tight-knit, and our community shows up in times of tragedy,” Moon said.
Victims named
The sheriff named for the first time the three guides from Blackbird Mountain Company who died: Andrew Alissandratos, 34, Nicole Choo, 42, and Michael Henry, 30.
According to biographies on the company’s website, Alissandratos was originally from Tampa, Florida, and moved to Tahoe roughly a decade ago. He enjoyed a wide array of adventure activities, from backcountry exploration to rock climbing.
Henry moved to Colorado in 2016 and then to Truckee three years later. He was described as “laid back” and devoted to sharing his knowledge and love of the mountains with others.
There was no bio for Choo on the website.
“This was an enormous tragedy, and the saddest event our team has ever experienced,” Blackbird Mountain founder Zeb Blais said Wednesday in a statement.
“We are doing what we can to support the families who lost so much,” he said, “and the members of our team who lost treasured friends and colleagues.”
The six other fatal victims were women who were part of a close-knit group of friends who were experienced backcountry skiers and knew how to navigate the Sierra Nevada wilderness, their families said this week.
They were identified as Carrie Atkin, Liz Clabaugh, Danielle Keatley, Kate Morse, Caroline Sekar and Kate Vitt, all in their 40s. They lived in the San Francisco Bay Area, Idaho and the Lake Tahoe area.
“We are devastated beyond words,” the families said in a statement. “Our focus right now is supporting our children through this incredible tragedy and honoring the lives of these extraordinary women. They were all mothers, wives and friends, all of whom connected through the love of the outdoors.”
The families asked for privacy while they grieve and added that they “have many unanswered questions.”
Two of the friends got out alive and were rescued along with four others, including one guide, after Tuesday’s avalanche. Their names have not been released.
Stuck on the mountain for hours
The avalanche struck on the last day of the 15 skiers’ three-day tour, when the group decided to end the trip early to avoid the impending snowstorm. Officials have said the path they took is a “normally traveled route” but declined to specify what that meant.
At around 11:30 a.m. Tuesday, the six survivors called for help, describing a sudden and terrifying slide that was approximately the length of a football field. In the aftermath they discovered the bodies of three fellow skiers, according to Hack.
Rescuers were not able to reach them until roughly six hours after the initial call for help, Hack said, and took two separate paths to arrive. They found five other bodies, leaving only one person unaccounted for.
But it was immediately clear to rescuers that it was too dangerous to extract the bodies at that time due to the heavy snowfall and threat of more avalanches. Those conditions persisted on Wednesday and Thursday.
A breakthrough on Friday
Authorities used two California Highway Patrol helicopters, with the help of Pacific Gas & Electric Company, to break up the snow and intentionally release unstable snowpack to reduce the avalanche risk.
Crews were then able to recover five victims that evening before it got too dark to access the last three.
Rescuers used helicopters and ropes to hoist the last four bodies from the mountain the following morning, fighting through severe winds that forced them to make multiple trips. The bodies were then taken to snowcats — trucks that are outfitted to drive on snow — for further transport.
“We cannot say enough how tremendously sorry we are for the families that have been affected by this avalanche,” Moon said.
Initial reports indicated that at least two of the surviving skiers were not swept away by the avalanche, Hack said. The others were standing separately and relatively close together and were hit.
Hack declined to offer information about what might have set off the avalanche.
Authorities close the area
The terrain will be off-limits to visitors until mid-March, said Chris Feutrier, forest supervisor for the Tahoe National Forest. Officials intended to restore public access once the investigation is complete.
“This is the public’s land, and they love to recreate on it,” Feutrier said. “The Forest Service doesn’t close public land for every hazard or every obstacle. We trust the American people to use their best judgment when recreating.”

Kaillie Humphries Armbruster of U.S. wins record-tying sixth Olympic bobsled medal

Kaillie Humphries Armbruster of U.S. wins record-tying sixth Olympic bobsled medal; Germany's Laura Nolte takes gold
American Kaillie Humphries Armbruster, in perhaps her Olympic bobsled finale, found her way to the medal stand for a record-tying sixth time Saturday in the two-woman bobsled, while Germany's Laura Nolte won gold again.
Nolte is now the back-to-back two-woman Olympic bobsled champion, holding off teammate Lisa Buckwitz to grab gold at the Milan Cortina Games on Saturday night.
Nolte — the winner of the last four World Cup two-woman titles — cemented her status as the sport's current queen, teaming with Deborah Levi to win her second consecutive two-woman gold medal by finishing four runs in 3 minutes, 48.46 seconds.
Buckwitz, with Neele Schuten in her sled, was second in 3:48.99. Humphries Armbruster and Jasmine Jones — two mothers in the same sled for the U.S. — finished third in 3:49.21. It was the sixth Olympic medal for Humphries Armbruster, tying fellow American Elana Meyers Taylor for the most by any woman in the sport's history.
Also for the U.S., Kaysha Love — who has been dealing with a hamstring issue for much of the season and had it flare up again in Italy — and Azaria Hill finished fifth in 3:49.71. Meyers Taylor and Jadin O'Brien, who were doomed by a second-heat skid at the top of the track Friday night, got a few spots back in the standings Saturday and finished tied for seventh in 3:50.49.
Germany now has six bobsled medals in these Olympics, while the U.S. has three and the rest of the world has zero. The divide might get bigger on Sunday in the final sliding event of the Milan Cortina Games; Germany, which already swept the two-man race, is in position to do the same thing in four-man after Saturday's opening two heats of that competition.
And Germany is now up to 17 sliding medals, counting bobsled, skeleton and luge, at Milan Cortina — one more than the rest of the world. Austria has five, the U.S. now has four along with Italy, Britain has two and Latvia has one.
The two-woman race was basically for the bronze going into the final run.
Nolte — who had the lead, albeit a much smaller one, going into the final heat of the monobob competition that Meyers Taylor ended up winning — led Buckwitz by 0.35 seconds going into the last heat. Buckwitz's lead over Humphries Armbruster was 0.19 seconds, and Humphries Armbruster was only 0.09 seconds up on Germany's Kim Kalicki in the race for the bronze.
Kalicki's final time: 3:49.36. It wasn't enough to catch Humphries Armbruster, who hopped out of the sled and wrapped herself and Jones in the American flag, knowing the medal was theirs.
Humphries Armbruster's updated Olympic medal count: three golds, three bronzes.
Meyers Taylor is 41, Humphries Armbruster is 40. Meyers Taylor is a mother of two, Humphries Armbruster has one son, and both women are talking about how they would like to add another baby to their families.
That means Saturday night might have been the last on the Olympic stage for them — and maybe on any sliding stage.
It was the 177th race — counting World Cups, world championships, the short-lived monobob World Series and the Olympics — for Meyers Taylor at the major international level. She has 78 medals from those races, six of them coming in the Olympics, and was a winner either as a driver or pusher in three different decades.
And for Humphries Armbruster, who won three Olympic medals for Canada and now has three more for the U.S., the numbers are even more gaudy: 105 medals in 218 major international races, with 49 of them victories.
If this is the end, for either or for both of them, what a ride it was.

Trump hikes US global tariff rate from 10% to 15%
US President Donald Trump raised the global duty on imports into the United States to 15 per cent on Feb 21, doubling down on his promise to maintain his aggressive tariff policy a day after the Supreme Court ruled much of it illegal.
Mr Trump said on his Truth Social platform that after a thorough review of Feb 20’s “extraordinarily anti-American decision” by the court to rein in his tariff programme, the administration was hiking the import levies “to the fully allowed, and legally tested, 15% level.”
Shortly after the court’s 6-3 ruling that rejected the president’s authority to impose tariffs under a 1977 economic emergency powers act, Mr Trump had initially announced a new 10 percent global levy by invoking a different legal avenue.
At the same time, he launched an extraordinary personal attack on the conservative justices who had sided with the majority, slamming their “disloyalty” and calling them “fools and lap dogs.”
Thousands march in France for slain far-right activist under heavy security
Thousands of people marched in south-eastern France on Feb 21 under heavy security in tribute to a far-right activist whose killing, blamed on the hard left, has put the country on edge.
The crowd – many wearing black and some covering their lower faces with masks – marched through the city of Lyon carrying flowers and placards bearing pictures of Quentin Deranque and the words, “justice for Quentin” and “the extreme left kills”.
The 23-year-old died from head injuries following clashes between radical left and far-right supporters on the sidelines of a demonstration against a politician from the left-wing France Unbowed (LFI) party in Lyon last week.
US citizen shot and killed by federal immigration agent last year, records show
A federal immigration agent shot and killed a US citizen in Texas in March 2025, months before the Trump administration began its deportation surge in Minnesota that led to the shooting deaths of Renee Good and Alex Pretti, according to records released this week.
Mr Ruben Ray Martinez, 23, was killed by agents with the Department of Homeland Security, attorneys for Mr Martinez's family said in a statement.
A DHS agent fired multiple rounds at Mr Martinez, who allegedly hit another DHS agent with his car as the agents assisted local police in South Padre Island, Texas, with traffic control following an accident on March 15, 2025, according to records obtained by American Oversight, a nonprofit watchdog group. The agents were conducting immigration enforcement, the records show.
Political drama Yellow Letters wins Golden Bear at Berlin film festival
Yellow Letters, directed by German filmmaker Ilker Catak, won the Golden Bear for best film at the Berlin Film Festival on Feb 21 in a ceremony reflecting the controversy over Gaza which has dogged 2026’s edition of the event.
A political drama, Catak’s film tells the story of a Turkish director and his actor wife, suddenly barred from working because of their political opinions.
Jury president Wim Wenders called the film “a terrifying premonition, a look into the near future that could possibly happen in our countries as well”.
Chelsea, Aston Villa held in blow to Champions League hopes
Burnley dented Chelsea’s chances of Champions League qualification by snatching a 1-1 draw at Stamford Bridge, while Aston Villa also struck late to salvage a point against Leeds on Feb 21.
The Blues climb into the Premier League’s top four only on goal difference after they paid for failing to build on Joao Pedro’s fourth-minute opener.
Chelsea were dominant until Wesley Fofana was sent off with 18 minutes remaining for a second yellow card.

US ambassador says Israel has right to much of Middle East, sparking uproar
Mike Huckabee’s comments were condemned by Arab and Muslim nations as ‘extremist rhetoric’
Arab and Muslim nations on Saturday sharply condemned comments by the US ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, who said Israel has a right to much of the Middle East.
Huckabee made the comments in an interview with conservative commentator Tucker Carlson that aired on Friday. Carlson said that according to the Bible, the descendants of Abraham would receive land that today would include essentially the entire Middle East, and asked Huckabee if Israel had a right to that land.
Huckabee responded: “It would be fine if they took it all.” Huckabee added, however, that Israel was not looking to expand its territory and has a right to security in the land it legitimately holds.
His comments sparked immediate backlash from neighbouring Egypt and Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman, the Organization of Islamic Cooperation and the League of Arab States.
Saudi Arabia’s foreign ministry described Huckabee’s comments as “extremist rhetoric” and “unacceptable”, and called for the US State Department to clarify its position on them.
Egypt’s foreign ministry called his comments a “blatant violation” of international law, adding that “Israel has no sovereignty over the occupied Palestinian territory or other Arab lands”.

Norwegian star breaks Olympic record with sixth Milano Cortina gold

Johannes Høsflot Klæbo becomes first athlete to win six gold medals at one Winter Olympics
In short:
Norway's Johannes Høsflot Klæbo has become the first athlete to win six gold medals at a single Winter Olympics.
Klæbo passed the previous record of five set by USA's Eric Heiden at the 1980 Lake Placid Games.
Klæbo now has 11 Olympic gold medals, sitting behind only American swim icon Michael Phelps (23) for most ever.
Norway's Johannes Høsflot Klæbo completed his historic gold medal sweep of the men's cross-country skiing events by winning his sixth race and setting the record for the most golds by one athlete in a single Winter Olympics.
Klæbo's victory in the 50-kilometre mass start race shattered the nearly 50-year record set by American speed skater Eric Heiden, who won five golds in the 1980 Lake Placid Olympics.
All of Heiden's wins were in individual races and two of Klæbo's have come in team events, so Heiden's record for individual wins still stands.
"It feels amazing," Klæbo said. "To crown everything here with a 50K, it's unbelievable. In Norway, we say that if you're gonna become a man, you need to win the 50K and today we did, so it's a perfect way to end two perfect weeks."
The solid gold performance matched the feat he accomplished at last year's world championships in Trondheim, Norway, when he won all six events.
Klæbo's teammates, Martin Løwstrøm Nyenget, took silver, and Emil Iversen won bronze in a Norwegian sweep.
The three Norwegians had a lead before the halfway mark and continued to build the gap on their chasers.
Nyenget drove a fast pace, trying the entire race to shake his compatriot, knowing that if he didn't, he'd fall victim to Klæbo's trademark uphill sprint.
Klaebo said he was just trying to hang on and conserve energy for the finish.
Toward the end, Nyenget and Klæbo pushed uphill and dropped Iversen. Klæbo stayed in second waiting to launch his winning move.
As the two reached the final hill, Klæbo ran away from Nyenget.
As he glided toward the finish, he pointed his fingers toward the sky, took one stride across the line, toppled over on his right hip and rolled onto his back. He finished in 2:06:44.8.
Nyenget finished 8.9 seconds later and Iversen was 30.7 seconds behind.
"I went hard from the start, so I managed to get rid of everyone else, but the best," Nyenget said. "So I'm really happy about my performance, but Johannes is the king."
France's Theo Schely finished fourth, nearly three minutes back and Savelii Korostelev, a Russian competing as an individual neutral athlete, finished fifth at 3:38.3 back.
The highest-placed US skier was Gus Schumacher, who won a silver in a team relay, in 13th place.
Five skiers, including Iivo Niskanen of Finland and Harald Oestberg Amundsen of Norway, dropped out of the race and 14 competitors were lapped.
The win extends Klæbo's record for most career Winter Olympic gold medals to 11 over three Games. The previous record had been eight, which Klæbo broke on February 15.
Klæbo has the second-most Olympic golds overall behind only US swimming great Michael Phelps, who has 23.
The win gave Norway a record 18th gold medal and further increased their lead in the total medal count in these games to 40 overall, also a Winter Olympics record, though the 116 medal events this year is more than in the past.
The country set the record on Friday for the most gold medals won by a nation at a single Winter Olympics when biathlete Johannes Dale-Skjevdal won the 15-kilometre mass start race.

Syrian govt takes over management of airport held by Kurds
Syrian authorities have taken over management of Qamishli airport as part of an ongoing process to integrate Kurdish-led forces and institutions into the national government, state media reported Saturday.
The SANA news agency, citing the General Authority of Civil Aviation and Air Transport, said officials had toured the facility on Saturday after assuming control and "discussed mechanisms to restart its operations".
The head of the authority, Omar al-Husari, said on X that taking over the airport was "an important institutional step in the process of unifying the management of airports under the umbrella of the state".
The Kurds - who controlled much of northeast Syria before striking the integration deal under military pressure from the government - had taken over the airport following the fall of longtime ruler Bashar al-Assad just over a year ago.
While it was not open to civilian flights, Russia had used part of the facility as a base before withdrawing last month.
Qamishli is the only airport in northeastern Syria, and for years served as a lifeline for the region's residents, particularly during nearly 14 years of civil war beginning in 2011, during which there were regular flights between it and Damascus.
The airport had remained under the government's control during the war, and continued to receive flights up until Assad's overthrow.
In November 2019, Russian forces turned the airport into a military base to oversee the implementation of an agreement that followed Turkey's large-scale offensive against Kurdish fighters.

Aid to Ukrainians in Poland must be responsible, not chaotic – Marshal of Sejm
This was stated in an interview with Ukrinform by the Marshal of the Polish Sejm, Włodzimierz Czarzasty, commenting on the adoption of a law introducing new rules for the stay of Ukrainian refugees in Poland.
According to Czarzasty, since 2022, Poland has made tremendous efforts: within the framework of Official Development Assistance (ODA), support for Ukraine and its refugees “is measured in billions of zlotys.”
He noted that further decisions will be adapted to the legal situation and to EU-level regulations.
“Our goal is stability, legal residence, and integration for those who work and pay taxes here. Assistance cannot be chaotic; it must be responsible. My compatriots have proven that in a crisis, they know how to open their hearts and embrace friends in need. I would like peace in Ukraine to come as soon as possible. However, we do not know when that will happen, so we must somehow adapt to this dramatic situation,” emphasized the Marshal of the Sejm.
As reported, President of Poland Karol Nawrocki approved the termination of the 2022 special law on aid to Ukrainian citizens who had arrived after the full-scale Russian invasion. Key provisions of that law will be transferred to the law on providing protection for foreigners.
The new law will come into effect on March 5, 2026.
Currently, up to one million Ukrainian war refugees are in Poland.
According to the latest data, a total of 4.35 million people who had to leave Ukraine due to the war hold temporary protection status in the EU. In June 2025, the European Council decided to extend temporary protection for them for one year, starting March 4, 2026.

‘Absurd and provocative’: Huckabee faces firestorm for Israel border stance
Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, denounce US ambassador’s remarks suggesting Israel has right to much of the Middle East.
United States Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee has triggered an avalanche of criticism from Arab and Muslim countries after suggesting Israel has a right to expand its territory across a large swath of the Middle East.
Huckabee delivered the remarks during a sit-down interview with US commentator Tucker Carlson, broadcast on Friday, as he was pressed about the geographical borders of Israel.

Carlson asked Huckabee, a self-professed Christian Zionist and staunch supporter of Israel, to clarify his stance on the Biblical promise of the land spanning the area between the Euphrates River in Iraq and the Nile River in Egypt to the descendants of Abraham, and if the modern Israeli state had the right to claim that lineage.
“It would be fine if they took it all,” said Huckabee.
Such territory would encompass modern-day Lebanon, Syria, Jordan and parts of Saudi Arabia.
The US ambassador later appeared to walk back the claim, saying it was “somewhat of a hyperbolic statement”. He also said Israel was not looking to expand its territory and has a right to security in the land it currently holds.
‘Extremist rhetoric’
Huckabee’s comments sparked immediate backlash from neighbouring Egypt and Jordan, Saudi Arabia, the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation and the League of Arab States, which in separate statements called them “extremist”, “provocative” and “not in line with Washington’s official position”.
Saudi Arabia’s foreign ministry described Huckabee’s comments as “extremist rhetoric” and “unacceptable”, and called for the US Department of State to provide clarification.
Egypt’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs called the remarks a “blatant violation” of international law, adding that “Israel has no sovereignty over the occupied Palestinian territory or other Arab lands.”
Jordan’s foreign ministry dismissed them as “absurd and provocative,” a violation of diplomatic norms and “an infringement on the sovereignty of states in the region”.
“Statements of this nature — extremist and lacking any sound basis — serve only to inflame sentiments and stir religious and national emotions”, the League of Arab States also said in a statement.
Huckabee, whom US President Donald Trump nominated as ambassador in 2024, has long opposed the idea of a two-state solution for Israel and the Palestinian people, and denied the existence of an illegal Israeli occupation of the West Bank. Back in 2008, Huckabee went so far as to question Palestinian identity altogether, saying, “There’s really no such thing as a Palestinian.”
In 2024, the International Court of Justice ruled that Israel’s occupation of Palestinian territory is illegal and must cease immediately.
But Israeli law does not clearly demarcate the country’s borders. Israel also occupies the Golan Heights in Syria, which it illegally annexed in 1981.
The US is the only country that recognises Israel’s claimed sovereignty over the Syrian territory, and only since 2019, during Trump’s first term as president.
After its 2024 war with Hezbollah, Israel also set up military outposts in five points inside Lebanon.
Some Israeli politicians, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, have openly promoted the idea of a “Greater Israel” with expanded borders.

Opinion | Humans vs robots? China begs to disagree
As China embraces humanoid robots, policymakers and companies are expanding the scope of innovation and applications in daily life
Reading Time:3 minutes
Why you can trust SCMP
The 2026 Spring Festival Gala, one of the world’s most-watched television events, featured a dazzling array of humanoid robots. They performed martial arts, executed intricate sword dances and even took part in a comedy skit alongside human celebrities.
While parts of the world still view humanoid robots with a mixture of fear and suspicion, as potential job-stealers or sci-fi villains, China is increasingly embracing them as partners in work, entertainment and daily life. Amid the escalating artificial intelligence (AI) race, China is not just competing on technological prowess but is rapidly outpacing others in its willingness to integrate these machines into public life.
China accounted for 90 per cent of the roughly 13,000 humanoid robots shipped globally last year. The country also represented over half of the humanoid robot exhibitors at the Consumer Electronics Show 2026. This burgeoning ecosystem draws researchers, engineers, entrepreneurs and investors into a fast-growing market.

It is fuelled by a parallel explosion in large language models and multi-modal AI, from ByteDance’s Doubao to the DeepSeek and Qwen models. Such AI models help robots understand user requests, engage in conversation, analyse data and provide useful content. As more robots are deployed in the physical world, the AI models are enhanced by the influx of real-world data, which in turn intensifies competition in large language models themselves and further encourages innovation.
The gala offered a stunning showcase of this progress. Robots from companies like Unitree, Galbot and Noetix ran, danced and performed acrobatics on stage. One might dismiss a backflipping robot, clad in a Monkey King costume, as a spectacle. But the nimbleness of the arms, legs, waist, neck, ankles and fingers shows technological breakthroughs.

Making body components that are flexible requires joint stability, space sensing and navigation, computer vision accuracy and skeleton durability. It demands seamless coordination between what Chinese engineers describe as the robot’s big brain – the higher-level AI for self-learning, planning and decision-making – and its small brain, which handles the movement and motor control needed for everything from walking and running to complex dexterous functions.

Is Iran stalling? Tehran floats flexibility as US signals strike readiness

Iran has sent another message to the US through Oman indicating it is prepared to show flexibility on its nuclear program, provided it is allowed to keep its uranium enrichment facilities and centrifuges on its own soil. Under the proposal, the facilities would not be activated until after an interim period and would operate under strict supervision by the International Atomic Energy Agency. Tehran insists the enrichment would be for civilian purposes only.
According to Western sources familiar with the negotiations, the message followed US dissatisfaction with the Iranian proposal presented in Geneva. The new offer is being examined in Washington but is still far from meeting American demands. If Iran does not move closer to those requirements, the US is considering a series of limited strikes to prove the seriousness of the threat.
The same sources said some senior figures in the Iranian regime believe the US will ultimately refrain from attacking, despite the significant concentration of American forces in the region. Limited strikes, they assess, could send a message while avoiding a full scale conflict.
Details obtained by Israel Hayom indicate that part of the Geneva meeting was devoted to what participants described as a US reprimand of the Iranian delegation. Washington accused Tehran of violating its commitment to discuss all issues, including its ballistic missile program and support for its proxy terrorist organizations. Israel Hayom previously revealed that the first round of talks in Oman had been scheduled, in part, on the basis of an Iranian pledge to address those subjects as well.
However, in Oman the Iranian delegation announced it would agree to discuss those issues only after a nuclear agreement was reached and sanctions were lifted. In Geneva, Iranian officials reiterated that position and demanded that any talks on other matters take place without ultimatums and with the participation of regional countries, which they argue are relevant to the discussion. The US team rejected the demand and lodged a strong protest over what it described as a breach of prior understandings. Despite this outcome, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi issued a positive statement after the meeting, prompting contradictory briefings from US officials.
In Israel, officials assess that Iran will attempt to stall by floating additional proposals on the nuclear issue but will not be able to bridge the gaps with the US. "The spring is coiled, and the readiness of US forces for a full strike is high, but an order to proceed will not be given in the coming days," an Israeli source said.

JPMorgan concedes it closed Trump’s accounts after Jan. 6 attack
NEW YORK (AP) — JPMorgan Chase acknowledged for the first time that it closed the bank accounts of President Donald Trump and several of his businesses in the political and legal aftermath of the Jan. 6, 2021 attacks on the U.S. Capitol, the latest development in a legal saga between the president and the nation’s biggest bank over the issue known as “debanking.”
The acknowledgment came in a court filing submitted this week in Trump’s lawsuit against the bank and its leader, Jamie Dimon. The president sued for $5 billion, alleging that his accounts were closed for political reasons, disrupting his business operations.
“In February 2021, JPMorgan informed Plaintiffs that certain accounts maintained with JPMorgan’s CB and PB would be closed,” JPMorgan’s former chief administrative officer Dan Wilkening wrote in the court filing. The “PB” and “CB” stands for JPMorgan’s private bank and commercial bank.
Until now, JPMorgan has never admitted it closed the president’s accounts in writing after Jan. 6. The bank would only speak hypothetically about when the bank closes accounts and its reasons for closing accounts, citing bank privacy laws.
A spokeswoman for the bank declined to comment beyond what the bank said in its legal filings.
Trump originally sued JPMorgan in Florida state court, where Trump’s primary residence is now located. The filings this week are part of an effort by JPMorgan Chase to have the case both moved from state to federal court and to have the jurisdiction of the case moved to New York, which is where the bank accounts were located and where Trump kept much of his business operations until recently.
Trump originally accused the bank of trade libel and violating state and federal unfair and deceptive trade practices.
In the original lawsuit, Trump said he tried to raise the issue personally with Dimon after the bank sent him notices that JPMorgan would close his accounts, and that Dimon assured Trump he would figure out what was happening. The lawsuit alleges Dimon failed to follow up with Trump.
Further, Trump’s lawyers allege that JPMorgan placed the president and his companies on a reputational “blacklist” that both JPMorgan and other banks use to keep clients from opening accounts with them in the future. The blacklist has yet to be defined by the president’s lawyers.
“If and when Plaintiffs explain what they mean by this “blacklist,” JPMorgan will respond accordingly,” the bank’s lawyers said in a filing.
JPMorgan has previously said that while it regrets that Trump felt the need to sue the bank, the lawsuit has no merit.
The issue of debanking is at the center of the case. Debanking occurs when a bank closes the accounts of a customer or refuses to do business with a customer in the form of loans or other services. Once a relatively obscure issue in finance, debanking has become a politically charged issue in recent years, with conservative politicians arguing that banks have discriminated against them and their affiliated interests.
“In a devastating concession that proves President Trump’s entire claim, JPMorgan Chase admitted to unlawfully and intentionally de-banking President Trump, his family, and his businesses, causing overwhelming financial harm,” the president’s lawyers said in a statement. “President Trump is standing up for all those wrongly debanked by JPMorgan Chase and its cohorts, and will see this case to a just and proper conclusion.”
Debanking first became a national issue when conservatives accused the Obama administration of pressuring banks to stop extending services to gun stores and payday lenders under “Operation Choke Point.”
Trump and other conservative figures have alleged that banks cut them off from their accounts under the umbrella term of “reputational risk” after the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. Since Trump came back into office, the president’s banking regulators have moved to stop any banks from using “reputational risk” as a reason for denying service to customers.
This is not the first lawsuit Trump has filed against a big bank alleging that he was debanked. The Trump Organization sued credit card giant Capital One in March 2025 for similar reasons and allegations. The case is ongoing.

Trump hikes US global tariff rate to 15 percent
President Donald Trump raised the global duty on imports into the United States to 15 percent on Saturday, doubling down on his promise to maintain his aggressive tariff policy a day after the Supreme Court ruled much of it illegal.
Trump said on his Truth Social platform that after a thorough review of Friday's "extraordinarily anti-American decision" by the court to rein in his tariff program, the administration was hiking the import levies "to the fully allowed, and legally tested, 15% level."
Shortly after the court's 6-3 ruling that rejected the president's authority to impose tariffs under a 1977 economic emergency powers act, Trump had initially announced a new 10 percent global levy by invoking a different legal avenue.
At the same time, he launched an extraordinary personal attack on the conservative justices who had sided with the majority, slamming their "disloyalty" and calling them "fools and lap dogs."
The ruling was a stunning rebuke by the high court, which has largely sided with the president since he returned to office, and marked a major political setback in striking down Trump's signature economic policy that has roiled the global trade order.
Saturday's announcement is sure to provoke further uncertainty as Trump carries on with a trade war that has cajoled and punished countries, both friend and foe.
It is the latest move in a careening process that has seen a multitude of tariff levels for countries sending goods into the United States set and then altered or revoked by Trump's team over the past year.
The new duty by law is only temporary - allowable for 150 days. According to a White House fact sheet, exemptions remain for sectors that are under separate probes, including pharma, and goods entering the US under the US-Mexico-Canada agreement.
On Friday, the White House said US trading partners that reached separate tariff deals with Trump's administration would also face the new global tariff.
High court defeat
Friday's court ruling did not impact sector-specific duties Trump separately imposed on steel, aluminium, and various other goods. Government probes still underway could lead to additional sectoral tariffs.
But it nevertheless marked Trump's biggest defeat at the Supreme Court since returning to the White House 13 months ago. The court has generally expanded his power.
Trump heaped praise on the conservative justices who voted to uphold his authority to levy tariffs - Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Brett Kavanaugh, a Trump nominee - thanking them "for their strength and wisdom, and love of our country."
The president alleged the majority of six justices, including two nominated during his first term, had been "swayed by foreign interests."
"I think that foreign interests are represented by people that I believe have undue influence," he said.
Shares on Wall Street - a metric closely watched by Trump - rose modestly Friday after the decision, which had been expected.
Business groups largely cheered the ruling, with the National Retail Federation saying this "provides much-needed certainty" for companies.
In court arguments, the Trump administration said companies would receive refunds if the tariffs were deemed unlawful. But the Supreme Court's ruling did not address the issue.
Trump said he expected years of litigation on whether to provide refunds. Kavanaugh noted the refund process could be a "mess."

Does Trump Have the Legal Authority to Strike Iran? An Expert Explains

After building up a massive military force in the Middle East over the last few weeks, President Donald Trump said Friday that he was considering strikes against Iran to pressure its leaders into accepting a deal on its nuclear program.
Trump has ratcheted up threats of action against the country’s leadership in recent months alongside a steady buildup of military forces. Two aircraft carriers are currently deployed, and one more—the USS Gerald Ford—is expected to arrive imminently.
When questioned by reporters on Friday whether he was weighing limited strikes against the country’s leadership in order to get it to accept a deal over its nuclear program, Trump replied: “I guess I can say I am considering that.”

On Thursday, Trump gave Tehran a deadline of 10 to 15 days to finalize a deal to solve the nuclear dispute or face “really bad things.”
The United States joined an Israeli-led military operation against Iran in June last year that struck three of the country’s nuclear sites. After that operation, Trump claimed Iran’s nuclear enrichment facilities had been “completely and totally obliterated.”
Trump raised the prospect of further military action against Iran following a brutal crackdown on protests there that killed thousands.
That prospect has drawn harsh criticism from inside and outside of the President’s own party.
Rep. Thomas Massie, a Republican, and Rep. Ro Khanna said they would table a War Powers resolution to prohibit the president from ordering military action in Iran without congressional approval.
“Congress must vote on war according to our Constitution. Rep. Ro Khanna and I will be forcing that vote to happen in the House as soon as possible,” Massie wrote on X on Feb. 18. “I will vote to put America first which means voting against more war in the Middle East.”
David Janovsky, Acting Director of The Constitution Project at the Project on Government Oversight, answered TIME’s questions about the legality of potential strikes on Iran.
If Trump orders strikes on Iran tomorrow, however limited in scope, could that be legally justified?
DJ: The short answer is no. There's no indication that there's any sort of circumstance that would give the President the unilateral authority to order military action. It's true that presidents have some inherent authority to deploy the military as Commander in Chief, but that's really limited to true emergency circumstances where there is an attack underway that needs to be repelled, or maybe an extremely clear imminent attack. But there's no suggestion that that's the case today—that would make the strikes illegal.
What steps would the White House need to take for this military action to be legally above board?
DJ: Most simply, the administration would need to go to Congress. This is a contemplated attack against a sovereign state, and that, in simplest terms, is an act of war. And the Constitution gives the exclusive power to declare war to Congress, not the president. So this is something that would need a vote and congressional approval.
How would this operation be different from the strikes on Iran’s nuclear sites in June 2025, legally speaking?
DJ: My position is that those strikes in 2025 were not legally justifiable and also that strikes now would likewise not be justifiable. In 2025, the administration put out a very brief explanation that relied on both the President's inherent authority and a notion of collective self-defense with Israel. But again, self-defense is properly understood to involve a threat that is much more immediate than anything that's at play now.
What would be the legal and political implications if Congress passed a formal War Powers resolution restricting the President’s ability to strike Iran?
DJ: It's important to keep in mind that if Congress did nothing, that would be a sign that Congress didn't approve an act of war, and so it would be illegal.
So, congressional action isn't necessary, legally speaking, to prevent a strike against Iran. But, if Congress were to take the preemptive step of saying, “You cannot do this,” I think it would do two things. First, it would change the legal calculus, because the executive branch, for decades— this is not a new phenomenon—has resorted to creative lawyering to come up with excuses for using the military abroad. A clear statement from Congress should at least make those executive branch lawyers a lot less willing to push the envelope. It could also change the calculus for the military lawyers who would need to review any actual strike order.
And, politically, I think it would send a powerful message. We have seen, especially recently, that the administration is sensitive to losing support, particularly from its allies in Congress, and a clear congressional statement that there is not the buy-in for military action in this case would also be a limiting factor.
Why has the reaction from Congress to this military buildup been so muted?
DJ: I think there are probably both long-term structural reasons and sort of short-term political reasons, hand in hand with the executive branch's decades-long effort to push the envelope of what it can do has been Congress's acquiescence in the face of those expansions. In some ways, this is part of a constitutionally very dangerous but long-running trend.
Back in 2025, there was an effort after the strikes to pass a war powers resolution. But the most charitable explanation for why Congress didn't act then was that there was a suggestion that the strikes were over and done. It was a one-off, and there was no need for Congress to prevent anything else. The fact that we're back here suggests that was not the correct assessment, and certainly underscores the need for Congress to act urgently now.

More than 1,500 prisoners set for release under Venezuela's new amnesty law
At least 1,557 people - including opposition members, activists, human rights defenders and journalists who were held in Venezuela for political reasons, are expected to be released from prison after submitting their applications under an amnesty bill that was signed into law this week, authorities said Saturday.
At least 1,557 people held in Venezuela for political reasons have submitted their applications under an amnesty bill that was signed into law this week and are expected to be released from prison, authorities said Saturday.
Thursday’s measure is expected to benefit opposition members, activists, human rights defenders, journalists and many others detained for months or even years.
Its approval marked a reversal for Venezuelan authorities, who for decades have denied holding any political prisoners. It follows last month’s stunning US military raid in the country’s capital, Caracas, to capture then-President Nicolás Maduro.
“As of today, 1,152 new applications have been received, for a total of 1,557 that are being addressed immediately, and at this moment hundreds of releases of persons deprived of liberty who are benefiting from the Amnesty Law are already taking place,” National Assembly leader Jorge Rodríguez said on Saturday.

Earlier, the president of the special commission overseeing the amnesty law, Jorge Arreaza, said Friday night on state television that 379 amnesty requests had been received and that the applicants’ releases would take place between Friday and Saturday. Further releases could be granted within 15 days, he said.
Gonzalo Himiob, vice president of Venezuela-based prisoners’ rights group Foro Penal, told The Associated Press on Saturday that so far some have been released in the state of Barinas, in the southwest of the country, but the process of verifying releases under the amnesty was still ongoing.
The new law excludes those convicted of homicide, drug trafficking, serious human rights violations and military rebellion.
Human rights organizations are calling for the law to be applied to all prisoners held for political reasons, even if they are not listed among the beneficiaries.

“It is discriminatory and unconstitutional to exclude imprisoned military personnel and persecuted political figures,” Alfredo Romero, president of Foro Penal, said on X Saturday. Without this, “there can be no talk of national coexistence,” he said.
Rodríguez said that thousands of requests are being processed from “individuals who were under alternative measures to the system of deprivation of liberty,” and that they are likewise covered by the recently approved Amnesty Law.
Delcy Rodríguez, acting president of Venezuela since January 5, said during the signing of the law that it showed that the country’s political leaders were “letting go of a little intolerance and opening new avenues for politics in Venezuela.”
The bill’s purpose is to grant people “a general and full amnesty for crimes or offenses committed” during specific periods since 1999 that were marked by politically driven conflicts in Venezuela, including “acts of politically motivated violence” in the context of the 2024 presidential election. The aftermath of that election led to protests and the arrest of more than 2,000 people, including minors.

In the days after Maduro’s January 3 capture, Rodríguez’s government announced it would release a significant number of prisoners. However, relatives and human rights watchdogs have criticized the slow pace of releases and the restrictive conditions under which many have been placed after leaving prison.
Venezuela-based nonprofit Justice, Encounter and Forgiveness has tallied 459 releases of detainees held for political reasons between January 8 and February 20.

Sudanese army repels RSF attack on border town in western Sudan
Clashes erupt in El Tina near Chad border as army-aligned forces deny RSF claim of control
KHARTOUM, Sudan
The Sudanese army and allied joint forces repelled an attack Saturday by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) on the border town of El Tina in North Darfur state.
The Coordination of Resistance Committees in El Fasher said in a statement that RSF fighters infiltrated El Tina, which lies along the Sudan-Chad border, but were confronted by army troops and joint forces of armed movements allied with the military and retreated after clashes.
The group said the attacking forces withdrew at the onset of fighting in the strategically located town.
Darfur regional governor Minni Arko Minawi described the RSF assault on El Tina as “targeting unarmed civilians and criminal behavior.”
In a post on the US social media company Facebook, he shared videos purportedly showing joint forces seizing RSF vehicles and weapons in El Tina.
Fighters from army-aligned armed movements also circulated videos on social media from inside the town, displaying damaged combat vehicles, weapons, and individuals they identified as RSF detainees.
Earlier Saturday, the RSF said in a statement on its Telegram channel that it had taken control of El Tina.
Of Sudan’s 18 states, the RSF controls the five Darfur states in the west, except for parts of North Darfur that remain under army control. The military retains control over most of the remaining states, including the capital, Khartoum.
Darfur accounts for roughly one-fifth of Sudan’s total area of more than 1.8 million square kilometers, though the majority of the country’s estimated 50 million people live in areas controlled by the army.
The conflict, which began in April 2023, has killed tens of thousands and displaced about 13 million people, creating one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises and famine conditions, according to UN reports.

Nasa astronaut shares striking footage of rare ISS ‘cartwheel’ around Earth
Nasa astronaut Zena Cardman has shared striking footage of the International Space Station (ISS) "cartwheeling" around Earth.
The ISS performed the rare manoeuvre to allow for a reboost by the Spacex CRS-33. The space station orbits close enough to Earth that there is a small amount of atmospheric drag, and requires periodic reboosts as a result.
The 60x speed timelapse shows the vessel perform an “orbital cartwheel”, as the American astronaut named it, from the Atlantic to the Pacific.
Zena Cardman said, "This was one of my favourites since it captures a little of everything - sunset, lightning storms, air glow, moon glint, stars, and sunrise."

Ghislaine Maxwell fighting the release of 90,000 more Epstein files
- Lawyers for Ghislaine Maxwell are challenging the release of 90,000 pages of documents related to Jeffrey Epstein and Maxwell, arguing a new law forcing their disclosure is unconstitutional.
- The legal challenge, filed in Manhattan federal court, aims to block the release of files from a decade-old civil defamation lawsuit brought by Virginia Giuffre against Maxwell.
- Maxwell's attorneys contend that the 'Epstein Files Transparency Act' violates the Constitution's separation of powers doctrine, asserting that Congress cannot override the judiciary's power to protect its files.
- They claim the documents, which include over 30 deposition transcripts, contain private financial and sexual information pertaining to Maxwell and others.
- The move comes amidst ongoing releases of Epstein-related documents, which have revealed new details about his abuse and led to complaints from victims whose personal information was disclosed.

The Committee to Protect Journalists published a report alleging the systematic abuse of Palestinian media workers in Israeli detention centers between 2023 and 2026. Through interviews with dozens of former detainees, the organization documented harrowing accounts of torture, starvation, and sexual violence aimed at silencing the press. The findings highlight that the majority of these journalists were held under administrative detention without formal charges or access to legal counsel. Evidence such as medical records and photographs supports claims of extreme weight loss and untreated injuries resulting from physical beatings. The advocacy group is now calling for international accountability and independent investigations into these alleged violations of humanitarian law. Despite these testimonies, the Israeli military maintains that it adheres to international standards and does not intentionally target members of the media.

Syria appoints presidential envoy to implement deal with SDF
Move aims to strengthen state presence and advance integration in northeastern regions
Istanbul
ISTANBUL
The Syrian presidency on Saturday appointed a presidential envoy to oversee the implementation of the Jan. 29 agreement with the terrorist organization YPG/SDF, according to state media.
The Syrian Arab News Agency (SANA), citing the presidency’s media directorate, said Brig. Gen. Ziad Al-Ayesh has been assigned to follow up on the accord and facilitate integration under the authority of the Syrian state.
The presidency said the appointment is intended to enhance the presence of state institutions, remove administrative obstacles, and activate public services in areas covered by the agreement.
Al-Ayesh hails from the village of Arjah Al-Jawalah in the countryside of Hasakah province in northeastern Syria, according to Syrian media outlets. He holds a degree in Sharia from Al-Ouzai University in Lebanon and a master’s degree in business administration from Idlib University in northwestern Syria.
Prior to the fall of Bashar Assad’s regime on Dec. 8, 2024, Al-Ayesh headed civil affairs at the Interior Ministry of the Salvation Government in Idlib.
On Jan. 30, the Syrian government announced that it had reached a “comprehensive agreement” with the SDF aimed at ending division in the country and launching a new phase of integration. It said the deal covering the cities of Hasakah and Qamishli and the integration of military forces complements a previous agreement signed on Jan. 18.
The latest agreement followed a military operation by the Syrian Army in which it regained large areas in eastern and northeastern Syria after repeated SDF violations of a March 2025 accord.

Global leaders and businesses react to more U.S. tariff swings
-
Click here to listen to this article - Share via
- Global leaders from Mexico City to Paris to Seoul convened emergency meetings to navigate the latest twist in an unpredictable tariff landscape.
- Mexico’s secretary of the economy, Marcelo Ebrard, urged “prudence” — “I tell you to put yourselves in zen mode. As tranquil as possible.”
SEOUL — Governments and companies around the world scrambled Saturday to determine the impact of the U.S. Supreme Court ruling that struck down most of President Trump’s sweeping tariffs and his response with a new round of import taxes.
The latest twist in the U.S. tariff roller-coaster ride, launched when Trump returned to office 13 months ago and upended dozens of trading relationships with the world’s biggest economy, roiled trade officials from Mexico to South Korea to South America and beyond.
South Korea’s Trade Ministry called for an emergency meeting Saturday to understand the new landscape. Some specific exports to the U.S., like automobiles and steel, aren’t affected by the U.S. high court decision. Those that are affected will probably now be covered by a new tariff imposed by an executive order Trump signed Friday. Trump announced Saturday morning that he would raise that 10% tariff to 15%.
In Paris, French President Emmanuel Macron hailed the checks and balances in the United States, praising the “rule of law” during a visit to a Paris agricultural fair: “It’s a good thing to have powers and counter-powers in democracies. We should welcome that.”
But he cautioned against any triumphalism.
Officials were going over the language of bilateral or multilateral deals struck with the U.S. in recent months, even as they braced for new swings and Trump’s swift announcement of new tariffs.
“I note that President Trump, a few hours ago, said he had reworked some measures to introduce new tariffs, more limited ones, but applying to everyone,” Macron said. “So we’ll look closely at the exact consequences, what can be done, and we will adapt.”
Mexico braces, adapts
Mexico’s secretary of the economy, Marcelo Ebrard, urged “prudence” Friday in the aftermath of the U.S. Supreme Court ruling. “We have to see where this is going,” Ebrard told reporters. “We have to see what measures [Washington] is going to take to figure out how it is going to affect our country. “
Amid widespread concern about tariffs in Mexico — the United States’ major commercial partner, with almost $1 trillion in annual two-way trade — Ebrard cautioned: “I tell you to put yourselves in zen mode. As tranquil as possible.”
Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, when asked about the tariffs, said, “We’ll review the resolution carefully and then gladly give our opinion.”
Ebrard said he plans to travel to the United States next week to clarify matters.
Last year, Ebrard noted, Mexico managed to stave off Trump’s threats to impose a 25% across-the-board levy on all Mexican imports.
However, Mexico has been pushing back against Trump administration tariffs on imports of vehicles, steel and aluminum, among other products.
Among other impacts, the Supreme Court voided so-called fentanyl tariffs on Mexico, China and Canada. The Trump administration said it imposed those levies to force the three nations to crack down on trafficking of the deadly synthetic opioid.
About 85% of Mexican exports to the United States are exempt from tariffs because of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. The accord extended a mostly free-trade regimen among the three nations, replacing the North American Free Trade Agreement.
The three-way pact is scheduled for joint review starting July 1. That date marks six years since the agreement was signed during the first Trump presidential term.
In Ciudad Juárez, Mexico, along the Texas border, Sergio Bermúdez, head of an industrial parks company, discussed Trump’s plan for a new tariff. Trump, he said, “says a lot of things, and many of them aren’t true. All of the businesses I know are analyzing, trying to figure out how it’s going to affect them.”
The impact could be felt especially in Juarez: Much of its economy depends on factories producing goods to export to consumers in the U.S., the result of decades of free trade between the U.S. and Mexico.
The policy swoons in the United States over the last year have made many global business leaders cautious, as they struggle to forecast and see investment take a hit.
CEO Alan Russell of Tecma, which helps American businesses set up operations in Mexico, has seen his job grow increasingly complicated over the last year — his company’s workload has surged as much as fourfold as it grapples with new import requirements. He worries the last U.S. moves will only make things more difficult.
“We wake up every day with new challenges. That word ‘uncertainty’ has been the greatest enemy,” said Russell, who is American. “The difficult part has been not being clear what the rules are today or what they’re going to be tomorrow.”
A ‘good decision’
Swissmem, a top technology industry association in Switzerland, hailed the Supreme Court ruling as “good decision,” writing on X that its exports to the U.S. fell 18% in the fourth quarter alone -- a period when Switzerland was facing much higher U.S. tariffs than most neighboring countries in Europe.
“The high tariffs have severely damaged the tech industry,” Swissmem President Martin Hirzel said on X, while acknowledging the dust is far from settled. “However, today’s ruling doesn’t win anything yet.”
Times staff writer Patrick J. McDonnell in Mexico City contributed to this report, as did Associated Press writers Tong-Hyung Kim in Seoul and Megan Janetsky in Mexico City. AP writers María Verza and Fabiola Sánchez in Mexico City, Samuel Petrequin in London and Jamey Keaten in Lyon, France, also contributed.

Arab and Muslim states fume after Huckabee says Israel has biblical right to much of Mideast
Saudis, Jordan, PA, Arab League slam US envoy for saying it ‘would be fine’ if Israel took over lands promised in Bible during Carlson interview; he then clarified ‘hyperbolic’ statement
Arab and Muslim nations on Saturday sharply condemned comments by the US ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, who said in a recent interview that “it would be fine” if Israel took over a large swath of the Middle East.
Huckabee made the comments during his contentious interview with right-wing American commentator Tucker Carlson which aired Friday, after Carlson said that according to the Bible, the descendants of Abraham would receive land that today would include large parts of the Middle East, and asked Huckabee if Israel had a right to that land.
Huckabee responded: “It would be fine if they took it all.” However, he said that Israel was not looking to expand its territory and has a right to security in the land it legitimately holds.
His comments sparked immediate backlash from Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the Organization of Islamic Cooperation and the League of Arab States, which in separate statements called them extremist, provocative, and not in line with the US position.
Saudi Arabia’s foreign ministry described Huckabee’s comments as “extremist rhetoric” and “unacceptable,” and called for the State Department to clarify its position on them.
Egypt’s foreign ministry called his comments a “blatant violation” of international law, adding that “Israel has no sovereignty over the occupied Palestinian territory or other Arab lands.”
The Palestinian Authority said on X that Huckabee’s words “contradict US President Donald Trump’s rejection of [Israel] annexing the West Bank.”
Kuwait decried what it called a “flagrant violation of the principles of international law,” while Oman said the comments “threatened the prospects for peace” and stability in the region.
In its statement, the Arab League condemned Huckabee’s “extreme” comment, in which he “asserted Israel’s right to control the Middle East, citing religious texts from the Old Testament.”
The comments “violated all the basic principles and established norms of diplomacy, as well as defying logic and reason,” the group of 22 Arab nations said, adding that the US envoy’s words “contradict US policies and positions across the board, aimed at currying favor with the right-wing public in Israel.”
“Such extremist and baseless statements inflame religious and nationalistic sentiments at a time when Arab states are meeting under the auspices of the Board of Peace to discuss ways to implement the Gaza peace agreement and seize this opportunity to launch a serious peace process,” it added.

The Organization of Islamic Cooperation, which is made up of 57 mostly Muslim-majority nations, including the entire Arab League, issued a similar statement, saying it “condemns the dangerous and irresponsible” comments made by Huckabee.
The OIC said the US envoy’s comments were “an unacceptable call for the expansion of Israel” that were “based on a false and rejected historical and ideological narrative.”
Such remarks “fuel extremist ideological rhetoric, which would fuel extremism and encourage” Israel to “continue its illegal measures based on displacement, settlement, and attempts to impose annexation” on Palestinian territory, the group said.
There was no immediate response from Israel or the United States.
Huckabee, a devout Christian and outspoken Zionist, commented being pressed by Carlson on his assertion that a part of the Jewish people’s right to the land stemmed from God’s promise to Abraham, while noting that that promised land spanned a far larger territory than that of today’s Israel, encompassing much of present-day’s Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia and Iraq. He asked whether it did not follow then that Israel had a right to take land from neighboring Arab countries.
After initially avoiding the matter, Huckabee eventually said, “It would be fine if they took it all,” while swiftly adding that this was not on the table as “They’re not asking to take it over.”
Carlson then asked the US ambassador to confirm he was fine with Israel taking over “all of Syria, all of Lebanon.” Huckabee responded, “That’s really not exactly what I’m trying to say,” adding that “It was somewhat of a hyperbolic statement.”
In a subsequent back-and-forth, Carlson demanded to know whether Huckabee believes Israel “has a moral right to take over what are now other people’s countries,” as the envoy insisted he had not said that. Eventually, Huckabee said: “If they end up getting attacked by all these places and they win that war and they take that land, then, okay, that’s a whole other discussion.”

Zelensky commends special services for neutralizing Russian mercenaries
As reported by Ukrinform, the head of state said this in his evening address.
“I want to commend the efforts of the Security Service of Ukraine, the National Police, and the Office of the Prosecutor General – they neutralized Russian mercenaries preparing assassination attempts against our citizens. These were rather high-profile names, and preventing such crimes is a substantial result,” Zelensky said.
He noted that he had heard a report from Oleksandr Poklad, Deputy Head of the SSU.
“And this is yet another front in the ongoing protection of Ukraine’s security, the safety of Ukrainians, and the constant defense of the lives of our people – the way our Ukrainian special services, our law enforcement, and our intelligence neutralize Russian criminal activity against Ukrainians. They were preparing attacks against Ukrainian military personnel, Ukrainian intelligence officers, and Ukrainian media workers. It is important that all our Ukrainian special services and law enforcement continue to protect Ukrainian citizens in exactly this coordinated way,” the President emphasized.
As Ukrinform previously reported, the Security Service of Ukraine and the National Police exposed a criminal group that had been preparing contract killings on behalf of Russian special services, including plans to assassinate Andrii Yusov, a representative of the Defense Intelligence Directorate. Other targets included Ukrainian journalists and civic activists, the head of a strategic enterprise, and fighters of the DIU International Legion.

JPMorgan concedes it closed Trump’s accounts after Jan. 6 attack
JPMorgan Chase now confirms it closed Trump’s accounts after mob of his supporters stormed halls of Congress
- Bookmark
Banking giant JPMorgan Chase acknowledged for the first time that it closed the accounts of President Donald Trump and several of his businesses in the political and legal aftermath of the January 6, 2021 attacks on the U.S. Capitol.
The disclosure marks the latest development in a legal saga over Trump’s alleged “debanking” after the president sued America’s largest bank for $5 billion alleging his accounts were closed for political reasons.
The acknowledgment came in a court filing submitted this week in Trump's lawsuit against the bank and its CEO Jamie Dimon.
“In February 2021, JPMorgan informed Plaintiffs that certain accounts maintained with JPMorgan’s CB and PB would be closed,” JPMorgan's former chief administrative officer Dan Wilkening wrote in the court filing. The “PB” and “CB” stands for JPMorgan's private bank and commercial bank.
In a letter to Trump submitted to the court Friday, dated February 19, 2021, the bank said it was recommending that he “find a more suitable institution with which to conduct business.”
“With that in mind, this letter is to respectfully inform you that we will need to end our current relationship,” the letter to Trump said.
Until now, JPMorgan has never admitted it closed the president's accounts, and would only speak hypothetically about when the bank closes accounts and its reasons for doing so.
In a previous statement, the bank said it “does not close accounts for political or religious reasons” but does so when accounts “create legal or regulatory risk for the company.”
Trump initially sued JPMorgan in state court in Florida, where Trump has his primary residence at his Mar-a-Lago compound in Palm Beach. JPMorgan Chase is seeking to move the case to federal court in New York, which is where the bank accounts were located and where Trump kept much of his business operations until recently.
Trump accuses the bank of trade libel and accuses Dimon himself of violating Florida’s Unfair and Deceptive Trade Practices Act.
In the original lawsuit, Trump alleges he tried to raise the issue personally with Dimon after the bank started to close his accounts, and that Dimon assured Trump he would figure out what was happening. The lawsuit alleges Dimon failed to follow up with Trump.
Further, Trump’s lawyers allege that JPMorgan placed the president and his companies on a reputational “blacklist” that both JPMorgan and other banks use to keep clients from opening accounts with them in the future.
JPMorgan previously said it believes the suit has no merit.
“Debanking” occurs when a bank closes the accounts of a customer or refuses to do business with a customer in the form of loans or other services. Once a relatively obscure issue in finance, debanking has become a politically charged issue in recent years, with right-wing figures arguing that banks have discriminated against them and their affiliated interests.
“In a devastating concession that proves President Trump’s entire claim, JPMorgan Chase admitted to unlawfully and intentionally de-banking President Trump, his family, and his businesses, causing overwhelming financial harm,” the president’s lawyers said in a statement.
Trump is “standing up for all those wrongly debanked by JPMorgan Chase and its cohorts, and will see this case to a just and proper conclusion,” they added.
Debanking first became a national issue when right-wing figures accused Barack Obama’s administration of pressuring banks to stop extending services to gun stores and payday lenders under “Operation Choke Point.”
Trump and his allies have alleged that banks cut them off from their accounts under the umbrella term of “reputational risk” after January 6, when a mob of his supports stormed the halls of Congress in a failured effort to derail the results of the 2020 presidential election, which Trump lost.
After Trump returned to the White House last year, the president’s banking regulators have moved to stop any banks from using “reputational risk” as a reason for denying service to customers.
This is not the first lawsuit Trump has filed against a big bank alleging that he was debanked.
The Trump Organization sued credit card giant Capital One in March 2025 for similar reasons and allegations. That case is ongoing.

Iran designates naval and air forces of EU states ‘terrorist entities’ in tit for tat move
Tehran took reciprocal measures in response to what it called 'illegal and unjustified' decision by EU member states to designate Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as 'terrorist organization,' says Foreign Ministry
TEHRAN, Iran
Iran has designated the armed forces of European Union member states as “terrorist entities” in a tit-for-tat move.
In a statement on Saturday, Iran’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that the country took reciprocal measures in response to what it called the “illegal and unjustified” decision by EU member states to designate the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) as a “terrorist organization.”
The statement noted that Iran has decided to designate all naval and air forces of European Union member states as “terrorist organizations.”
It added that the European governments designated the IRGC “in violation of the fundamental principles and rules of the United Nations Charter and international law,” describing it as “one of the official components of the armed forces of the Islamic Republic of Iran.”
"The Islamic Republic of Iran will act based on the principle of ‘reciprocity,’” it stated.
The Council of the European Union said in a statement on Thursday that it had formally decided to add the IRGC to the EU terrorist list, weeks after a political agreement was reached among member states.
“Following its listing, the IRGC will also be subject to restrictive measures under the EU counterterrorism sanctions regime,” the statement read, referring to the “freezing of its funds and other financial assets or economic resources” in EU member states, as well as the “prohibition for EU operators to make funds and economic resources available to the group.”
A total of 13 individuals, 23 groups, and entities are now subject to restrictive measures under the EU terrorist list, it added.
Tensions have dramatically escalated between Iran and some European countries following recent protests inside Iran, with European leaders condemning what they described as a crackdown on protesters.
Earlier this month, the Iranian parliament announced that Iran now considers EU armies to be terrorist organizations, after the country’s top security body approved the measure.
The parliamentary announcement was followed by the summoning of the ambassadors of EU member states to the Foreign Ministry.
At the time, the ministry described the EU move as “unjustified and irresponsible,” emphasizing that it “violates fundamental principles of the United Nations Charter and international law.”
Meanwhile, tensions continue to escalate in the region amid an unprecedented US military buildup and IRGC military drills in the Persian Gulf.

Report: IRGC running Hezbollah, preparing it for war with Israel if US strikes Iran

Report: IRGC running Hezbollah, preparing it for war with Israel if US strikes Iran
Israel said to see Hezbollah preparing rocket-fire capabilities, recent IDF strikes said aimed at degrading them; anti-Hezbollah outlet quotes ‘political sources’ saying Beirut must declare neutrality
Officers from Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps have effectively taken charge of Hezbollah in anticipation of a war with the US and Israel, Saudi outlet Al-Arabiya reported Saturday, as Lebanese officials were said to assail the possibility of their country getting dragged into battle.
The IRGC officers, some of whom recently arrived in Lebanon from Iran, are tasked with rebuilding Hezbollah’s military capabilities, which were significantly degraded in the 14-month fighting with Israel that ended with a November 2024 truce, Al-Arabiya said, citing sources close to Hezbollah.
The Iranian officers have also been personally briefing Hezbollah operatives across Lebanon, said the unnamed sources cited by Al-Arabiya. They added that IRGC officers were meeting with members of Hezbollah’s missile unit at a site in Lebanon’s Beqaa Valley that was bombed by Israel overnight, amid a wave of airstrikes that wounded at least 50 people and killed 12, including a senior Hezbollah officer. The IDF said the strikes targeted Hamas and Hezbollah command centers.
According to the Hezbollah-aligned sources, a wider Israeli military offensive against Lebanon is only a matter of time.
The report came as US President Donald Trump has amassed military forces in the region and repeatedly threatened to use them against Iran, first over the Islamic Republic’s brutal crackdown on anti-regime protesters last month and more recently over its nuclear program.
Israel is readying to fight alongside the US and expects to be targeted by Iran if the US strikes there, according to Hebrew media.
The Kan public broadcaster reported Saturday evening that Israel has identified preparations by Hezbollah — particularly by its rocket forces — to strike if Iran is attacked, with the Lebanese terror group expected to target Israel together with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, Iranian-backed Shiite militias in Iraq and Yemen’s Houthi rebels.
Haaretz reported, quoting unnamed Israeli military sources, that recent Israeli airstrikes targeting Hezbollah were intended to degrade its capabilities amid the possibility of conflict. At least 10 people were reported killed and 50 wounded in Israeli strikes in eastern Lebanon on Friday, after the Israel Defense Forces said it had targeted Hezbollah command centers.
Channel 12 news reported Saturday that Trump was leaning toward attacking Iran, but had agreed to a request from his envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner to give Iran another day or two to submit a proposal in the indirect US-Iran nuclear negotiations that commenced earlier this month.
An unnamed US official was quoted by the network saying that the 10- to 15-day deadline Trump gave Iran on Thursday was “not scientific.”
Trump has demanded Iran give up entirely on its nuclear enrichment program, but is reportedly open to letting the Islamic Republic preserve some “token” enrichment capabilities.
Speaking to pro-Iran demonstrators in Lebanon last month, Hezbollah chief Naim Qassem said the terrorist group would not be neutral if the US struck Iran, but stopped short of explicitly threatening Israel.
Meanwhile, the Ynet news site said in an unsourced report this week that Iran was pressuring Hezbollah to fight alongside it in the event of a war with Israel. The report also said the IDF had prepared a plan to “significantly strike” Hezbollah and had conveyed to it “that if it decides to intervene, this time the blow will be very painful.”
On Saturday, anti-Hezbollah Lebanese outlet Nidaa al-Watan cited “prominent political sources” in the country as saying Beirut must declare its neutrality in case of a US-Iran war, and refuse to let Hezbollah drag Lebanon into war with Israel.
“Hezbollah thought it could confuse Israel and the US by saying it would not be neutral if Iran were struck, so Israel responded by saying that as soon as it’s informed by Washington of the zero hour, it will preemptively strike Hezbollah. Israel won’t let Hezbollah have the initiative,” Nidaa al-Watan quoted its sources as saying. “Hezbollah will drag Lebanon into this war.”
Hezbollah, previously a formidable force in Lebanon’s government, has been politically sidelined with the accession in January 2025 of Lebanon’s US- and Saudi-backed President Joseph Aoun, a former army chief who has vowed to uphold a state monopoly on arms — a thinly veiled threat against Hezbollah’s extensive arsenal.

'Chronicles From the Siege’: Filmmaker dedicates Berlinale win to Palestinian liberation struggle

Syrian-Palestinian filmmaker Abdallah Al-Khatib used his acceptance speech at the Berlinale film awards ceremony to make a solidarity statement in support of the Palestinian liberation struggle.
“We will remember everyone who stood with us, and we will remember everyone who stood against us, against our right to live with dignity, or those who chose to be silent. Free Palestine from now until the end of the world,” he told the audience in Berlin on Saturday after his film “Chronicles From the Siege", which tells the story of people trying to survive occupation, was named Best First Feature.
He accused the German government of being “a partner in the genocide in Gaza by Israel.”
Al-Khatib, who brought a Palestinian flag onto the stage, said that one day there would be “a great film festival in Gaza” dedicated to all oppressed people in the world.
Earlier, Lebanese filmmaker Marie-Rose Osta, who won the Golden Bear for best short film, had also criticised Israel's genocide on stage.
“In reality, children in Gaza, in all of Palestine, and in Lebanon do not have superpowers to protect them from Israeli bombs. No child should need superpowers to survive a genocide empowered by veto powers and the collapse of international law," she said in her acceptance speech.
“The ceasefire continues to be violated by Israel both in Gaza and Lebanon,” Osta added.
She stressed that the lives of children in Gaza and Lebanon are "not negotiable.”
On Wednesday, dozens of actors and directors, including Javier Bardem and Tilda Swinton, accused the Berlin International Film Festival of "anti-Palestinian racism" and urged organisers to state their opposition to Israel’s genocide in Gaza clearly.
In an open letter published in Variety, 81 film workers criticised what they called the Berlinale’s “involvement in censoring artists who oppose Israel’s ongoing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza.”
The signatories also took issue with comments by this year’s jury president, Wim Wenders, who said at a recent press briefing in Berlin, when asked about Gaza, “We should stay out of politics.”
Last week, award-winning Indian writer Arundhati Roy withdrew from the Berlin Film Festival over jury president Wim Wenders's comments that cinema should "stay out of politics" when asked about Gaza.
Roy said that she was "shocked and disgusted" by responses from Wenders and other jury members to a question about the Palestinian territory.

OIC slams US ambassador's remarks on Israeli Mideast expansion as threat to regional stability

OIC slams US ambassador's remarks on Israeli Mideast expansion as threat to regional stability
Organization of Islamic Cooperation warns US Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee's comments fuel extremism and undermine international law
ISTANBUL
The Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) and the Arab League on Saturday condemned remarks by US Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee, warning that his comments about Israeli expansion in the Middle East threaten regional security and stability as well as inflame religious and national sentiments.
Huckabee argued that Israel has a biblical right to the land stretching from the Nile to the Euphrates rivers, saying on a podcast released Friday: "It would be fine if they (Israel) took it all.”
Huckabee made the remarks in an interview with US journalist Tucker Carlson, during which he defended Israel’s actions in the Gaza Strip and voiced support for the idea of “divine providence” giving control of the region to Israel.
After Huckabee claimed Israel had a divine right to vast portions of the Middle East, Carlson asked him: “What land are you talking about?” Interpretations of the biblical phrase “river of Egypt” vary, with some scholars identifying it as a riverbed in the Sinai Peninsula and others as the Nile.
“It would be fine if they took it all,” Huckabee replied, referring to Israel’s biblical right to the territory stretching from the Nile River to the Euphrates.
The OIC described Huckabee’s remarks in a statement as “dangerous and irresponsible,” calling them an unacceptable call for the expansion of Israel, the occupying power, and the seizure of additional Palestinian and Arab lands.
The comments were based on “a false and rejected historical and ideological narrative and claims" that violate state sovereignty, diplomatic norms, principles of international law, UN resolutions, and the UN Charter, the group added.
The organization warned that such extremist rhetoric would fuel further extremism and embolden Israeli policies centered on displacement, settlement expansion, and attempts to impose annexation on occupied Palestinian territory.
It said these measures "threaten security and stability in the entire region.”
The bloc reaffirmed its unwavering support for what it described as the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people, foremost among them the right to self-determination and the establishment of an independent, sovereign state on the June 4, 1967 borders with East Jerusalem as its capital.
Separately, Ahmed Aboul Gheit, secretary-general of the Arab League, condemned Huckabee’s claims, calling them contrary to the most basic principles and norms of diplomacy.
In a statement on US social media company X, Aboul Gheit said the remarks contradict official US policies and positions and appear aimed at appealing to right-wing audiences in Israel.
He warned that such extremist statements, which lack any legal or political basis, “inflame religious and national sentiments” at a time when countries are convening under a Board of Peace framework to explore ways to implement a Gaza peace agreement and seize the opportunity to launch a serious political process.
Huckabee, named US ambassador to Israel in April 2025, is an evangelical Christian who has previously spoken of expansionist claims based on what he described as a “divine right” for Israel in the West Bank.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told news channel i24 last August that he feels “very attached” to the vision of a Greater Israel. He said he considers himself “on a historic and spiritual mission," including “generations of Jews that dreamt of coming here and generations of Jews who will come after us.”
Greater Israel is a term used in Israeli politics to refer to the expansion of Israel’s territory to include the West Bank, Gaza, and Syria’s Golan Heights, with some interpretations also including Egypt’s Sinai Peninsula and parts of Jordan.

NASA chief rules out March launch of Moon mission over technical issues
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
WASHINGTON - NASA chief Jared Isaacman on Feb 21 ruled out a March launch for Artemis 2, the first crewed flyby mission to the Moon in more than 50 years, citing technical issues.
Workers detected a problem with helium flow to the massive SLS rocket that will “take the March launch window out of consideration,” Mr Issacman said in a post on X.
“I understand people are disappointed by this development. That disappointment is felt most by the team at NASA, who have been working tirelessly to prepare for this great endeavor,” Mr Isaacman said.
“During the 1960s, when NASA achieved what most thought was impossible, and what has never been repeated since, there were many setbacks.”
The towering SLS rocket and Orion spacecraft will be rolled back into the Vehicle Assembly Building at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida to investigate the technical issues and make any necessary repairs, Mr Isaacman said.
A complete briefing will follow in the coming days, he added.
The highly anticipated Artemis 2 mission, lasting about 10 days, will see three Americans and one Canadian fly around Earth’s satellite.
It would be a huge step towards Americans once again setting foot on the lunar surface, a goal announced by President Donald Trump in his first term.
On Feb 20, NASA had set March 6 as the earliest possible launch date
The US space agency hopes to put humans back on the Moon as China forges ahead with a rival effort that is targeting 2030 at the latest for its first crewed mission.
China’s uncrewed Chang’e 7 mission is expected to be launched in 2026
NASA surprised many late in 2025 when it said Artemis 2 could happen as soon as February – an acceleration explained by the Trump administration’s wish to beat China to the punch.
But the programme has been plagued by delays.
The uncrewed Artemis 1 mission took place in November 2022 after multiple postponements and two failed launch attempts.
Then technical problems in early February – which included a liquid hydrogen leak – cut short a so-called wet dress rehearsal for the Artemis 2 launch. That was finally completed earlier this week.
The wet dress rehearsal was conducted under real conditions – with full rocket tanks and technical checks – at Cape Canaveral in Florida, with engineers practicing the maneuvers needed to carry out an actual launch.
NASA is hoping that the Moon could be used to help prepare future missions to Mars. AFP

Marshal of Polish Sejm names key topics of Ukraine Recovery Conference in Gdańsk
This was stated in an interview with Ukrinform by Włodzimierz Czarzasty, Marshal of the Sejm of the Republic of Poland.
“The recovery of Ukraine is an investment in the security of all of Europe. We want to focus on three areas: investments, transport and logistics links, as well as trade and exports. The conference in Gdańsk will become a platform for real projects, not just declarations,” Czarzasty said, stressing that it will have “political and symbolic significance.”
As reported by Ukrinform, Kyiv and Warsaw have begun practical preparations for the Ukraine Recovery Conference (URC-2026) and agreed to deepen trade and economic cooperation.
At the end of January, representatives of the authorities of Poland’s Subcarpathian, Lublin, and Podlaskie voivodeships met to coordinate efforts with the Ukrainian side to support Ukraine amid the energy crisis.

Chatter dials up on Apple’s folding iPhone as 2026 launch tipped

Chatter dials up on Apple’s folding iPhone as 2026 launch tipped
When Apple unveils its iPhone 18 models this September, it may also introduce an entirely new form factor for its smartphones, with rumours intensifying that a folding iPhone is finally ready for release.
Samsung has been releasing folding phones for more than six years, and although they got off to a rocky start, they’ve become a steadily growing product category. Could a folding iPhone tip the format into mainstream acceptance? Or will the majority stick with the standard models, leaving folding phones a niche concern?
Rumours and speculation about Apple’s folding iPhone have been ongoing for years, so at this point, it seems likely the company has tested multiple designs.
In 2024, a report in The Information cited people directly involved in the project as saying Apple would release a flip-style phone, sized like a regular iPhone but with a horizontal crease in the middle to fold into a small square, similar to Samsung’s Z Flip. But more recent reports point to something larger, with multiple analysts describing a passport-shaped device that opens up to become a small tablet.
This shape would differ from most book-style foldable devices on the market, including Samsung’s Z Fold and Google’s Pixel Pro Fold. While those models more or less resemble normal phones while folded, and become a square-ish tablet, Apple’s supposed device would be square-ish in both modes; a 2:3 ratio when folded and around a 4:3 ratio when opened. The advantage would be that both of those screen shapes are in use by iPads, so apps wouldn’t need to be adapted.
Longtime Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo described this format in a note last year, also saying that Apple had developed a hinge which eliminated the perceptible gap in the middle of the inner screen. Kuo said the company was prioritising thinness and sleek design even if it made for a notably expensive device, and that it would include a fingerprint sensor instead of Face ID. These details were backed up in a newsletter from Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, who said the phone would cost more than $US2000 ($2840).
As for the size of the device, multiple rumours indicate an outer screen size of 5.5 inches which, given the 2:3 ratio, would make for a device approximately 8cm x 12cm when closed. Quite a different shape to the latest Z Fold, which is 7cm x 16cm. It would also be the shortest iPhone since 2010’s iPhone 4.
Last year, 3D design files appeared on the internet that had supposedly (but unverifiably) leaked from Apple’s production line. They matched the above measurements, and designers used them to create digital models and 3D-printed dummies, giving glimpses of a phone that resembles a small notepad. When opened, the tablet would have a screen size of 7.8 inches, making for a device smaller than the iPad Mini by just a few centimetres on either edge.
Analyst Jeff Pu has suggested there will be multiple size options for the device, but only the one size has appeared in most rumours.
Demand for iPhones has remained consistent despite each generation of device lasting longer than the last, and despite investor hand-wringing about Apple’s perceived lack of AI features. But the overwhelming bulk of that demand is for the standard iPhone, or the Pro model, with comparatively few users going for the outlier Mini, Plus or Air models.
In fact, some reports have indicated that last year’s Air underdelivered spectacularly, with Apple cutting production to just 10 per cent of its original estimates. The ultra-thin phone is very expensive, lacks features the standard iPhone has including multiple rear cameras, and is an unproven form factor despite Apple’s claims of extraordinary durability.
Bloomberg’s Gurman claims that the design of the folding iPhone will be similar to two Air models joined together, albeit in a different shape. Apple will need to hope there is enough pent-up demand for a non-Android folding phone to counter durability concerns, especially if it claims to have also developed a brand new hinge system that eliminates the foldable screen gap.
Of course, Apple has form with introducing its own takes on devices that other manufacturers have had for years. The iPad, Apple Watch and AirPods were all late to their respective categories, and while they may not have taken off immediately, they did eventually become the overall leading models.
If Apple introduces a $3000 folding iPhone this year, it may not be met with enough immediate demand for it to overtake the standard iPhone or even Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold. But it could win users over time, especially if Apple markets to its base of creatives who would otherwise have a phone and an iPad Mini separately.
Gurman has reported that Apple is so confident in the folding iPhone that it is already planning a follow-up that would give users the choice between the notepad style and a smaller Z Flip style device.

Burnt-out Toyota may be linked to missing 85-year-old Chris Baghsarian

Burnt-out Toyota may be linked to missing 85-year-old Chris Baghsarian
Nearly 10 days after the kidnapping of 85-year-old Chris Baghsarian, NSW Police are appealing to the public for information relating to suspicious car fires last Tuesday in Westmead that could be linked to his kidnappers.
Baghsarian has been held hostage since February 13, when up to three men abducted him from his North Ryde home at about 5am in what police believe is a suspected case of mistaken identity.
Two vehicles were partially destroyed in suspicious fires on Good Street, Westmead, at about 11.30pm on Tuesday, February 17.
NSW Police said detectives were able to establish that the targeted vehicle was a 2022 Toyota Corolla bearing Victorian registration “1UZ2BU”, reported stolen from a Victorian address on January 13.
Investigators from Strike Force Chobat believe the decimated Toyota in the images are related to a crime scene established at a Dural property in north-west Sydney where, police believe, Baghsarian’s kidnappers may have held him hostage for some time over the past 10 days.
After reports that two vehicles were alight, Cumberland Police Area Command attended the location, not far from Parramatta Aquatic Centre, along with Fire and Rescue NSW, who extinguished the blaze.
This masthead reported last week that the Dural property was a “stronghold” used by kidnappers to hold an elderly man hostage. It matched images circulated throughout Sydney’s underworld showing the 85-year-old being tortured, as police admit hope of finding him alive is fading.
Police have issued several direct pleas to the kidnappers to return Baghsarian, who requires daily medical treatment and medication.
Baghsarian’s family said in a statement this week that he was deeply loved and a devoted father, brother, uncle and grandfather.
“The kindest person we know – someone who would never hurt a fly,” the family said in a statement released by NSW Police last Tuesday.
“Chris’ kidnapping feels surreal, and we are struggling to make sense of the fact that he has been taken, and that our family has been caught up in something that has nothing to do with us.
“We are living through a nightmare we never thought possible.”
Anyone who may have seen or heard anything, or has CCTV, dashcam and or mobile footage relating to the kidnapping, or witnessed any sort of suspicious activity in the Westmead area since last Friday is urged to contact detectives.
Anyone with information about this incident is urged to contact Crime Stoppers: 1800 333 000 or crimestoppers.com.au. Information is managed on a confidential basis. The public is reminded not to report information via NSW Police social media pages.

Now Donald Trump and the royal family know ‘the rule of law’ is no empty phrase
United Kingdom

The shock of seeing a member of the royal family, Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, in the back of a car after he was released from police custody will reverberate in British history for generations to come. The photograph by Phil Noble of Reuters that featured on our front page this week will send a powerful and welcome message, one that has been reinforced in a statement by the King: “The law must take its course.”
There will be those who question that course. Some will argue that the allegations of the sexual abuse of women and girls facilitated by Jeffrey Epstein, the American financier and convicted sex offender, are more serious than the vague charge of misconduct in public office in relation to the former Prince Andrew’s trade envoy role that prompted the police to act.
Others will say, and indeed have said, that the use of the power of arrest was not necessary in this case, as Mr Mountbatten-Windsor would not have refused to attend an interview voluntarily.
These, however, are second-order issues that can be addressed in due course. What is of paramount importance is the principle that no one in Britain is above the law. The last vestige of royal prerogative was swept away when Queen Elizabeth II started to pay income tax in 1993, and Britain accepted that the rule of law applies to everyone in the country, irrespective of their social or economic status.
The same principle applies, thank goodness, in the United States – the nation to which we are most prone to compare ourselves. This week’s ruling by the Supreme Court, overturning President Donald Trump’s tariffs, was a vindication of that principle – strengthened rather than diminished by Mr Trump’s graceless tirade against the six justices in the majority, calling them “a disgrace to the nation”, “fools” and “lapdogs” for the “radical left Democrats”.
Against the ravings of a bad loser, it is worth quoting the noble sentiments expressed by Justice Neil Gorsuch, who was nominated to the court by Mr Trump. His concurrence appeared almost personally addressed to the president: “Yes, legislating can be hard and take time. And, yes, it can be tempting to bypass Congress when some pressing problem arises. But the deliberative nature of the legislative process was the whole point of its design. Through that process, the nation can tap the combined wisdom of the people’s elected representatives, not just that of one faction or one man.”
Justice Gorsuch concluded: “If history is any guide, the tables will turn and the day will come when those disappointed by today’s result will appreciate the legislative process for the bulwark of liberty it is.”
Mr Trump has, naturally, cocked a snook at the court by announcing a new 15 per cent tariff on all imports – a measure that will probably be struck down and more quickly than this week’s ruling.
The US also faces a more serious “rule of law” problem than Mr Trump’s unconstitutional attempts to levy tariffs without the consent of Congress. Agents of ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) appear to have been deployed by the president in something resembling a reign of terror, and the arc of justice is taking its time to bend towards ending it.
Yet this week’s Supreme Court ruling offers hope that the rule of law will eventually prevail on both fronts. It should also remind us in Britain how priceless our reputation for fair dealing truly is.
On Friday we reported that YTL, the Malaysian-based multinational company, will invest £4bn in Britain, including in the Aviva Arena, a new events venue in Bristol. “We love the UK and are pleased to be its largest Malaysian investor,” Francis Yeoh, its executive chair, said. He has previously praised Britain as a place “where the rule of law is the order of the day”.
The rule of law is no abstract principle. It is the guarantee of the rights of every member of society and the foundation of our prosperity.

Daly Cherry-Evans has shown promising signs of a strong combination with Sam Walker in his first match in Roosters colours.
Walker, who scored a try and set up two others, said his veteran teammate had "been awesome".
New Eels pairing Mitch Moses and Jonah Pezet also combined well as the Eels sealed a comeback 28-22 win.
Daly Cherry-Evans has played his first game in Sydney Roosters colours, but it was halves partner Sam Walker who stole the show before Parramatta came back to win their pre-season clash 28-22.
With all eyes on Cherry-Evans after 15 years in Manly colours, halves partner Walker scored a try and set up two others in the Roosters' final pre-season hit out.
New Parramatta pairing Mitch Moses and Jonah Pezet also had glimpses of promise in their first outing together, playing through the opening 40 minutes together.
The Roosters led 22-12 when Cherry-Evans and James Tedesco left the field, before the Eels came back to win the game and wrap up the NRL's pre-season challenge title.
Cherry-Evans is set to be one of the most scrutinised men in the league this year, with his arrival at the Roosters making them one of the early-season favourites.
Having played all of his 352 NRL games at halfback for Manly, much will also be made of how he and Walker gel together in the Roosters' attack this year.
The 37-year-old wore number six on Saturday night with Walker at number seven, but the veteran was still the most vocal man in the Roosters' attack and spent most of the night directing traffic.
Playing on his normal right side, Cherry-Evans was also the Roosters' primary in-play kicker while the halves split their touches.
Clearly though, Cherry-Evans's presence helped free up Walker.
The halfback scored one try when he dummied to his senior halves partner and stepped through the Eels' defence to go over.
Walker then put Angus Crichton over for a try moments later with a perfect short ball on the left edge.
The halfback had also helped lay on the Roosters' first points when Isaiah Iongi spilled one of his bombs and Lindsay Collins dived on the loose ball.
And while a lightning storm after that try forced the game to be delayed for 45 minutes, it quickly became obvious Walker and Cherry-Evans had the potential to gel well.
"It was a little bit touch and go for the first 20," Walker said on Fox League at half-time.
"But I feel now we've got our flow going and are very comfortable with each other. He's been awesome."
Roosters coach Trent Robinson also confirmed Benaiah Ioelu would start the season at hooker, replacing injured recruit Reece Robson.
With Robson set to miss a month with a broken thumb, Ioelu had a role in one try on Saturday night when he ran out of dummy-half, kicked a bomb and Tommy Talau scored.
For Parramatta, Moses and Pezet linked up a few times, including in the lead-up to a disallowed try for winger Bailey Simonsson.
The slickest piece of play came with a beautiful Dylan Walker short ball for Moses, who burst through a gap and sent Matt Doorey over.
Moses handed over goalkicking duties to Pezet after that try and ran laps of the field at half-time, before not returning after the break.
But Parramatta officials have insisted that was already part of a plan for the star halfback and there was no injury concern.

Ghislaine Maxwell fights release of more Epstein documents, calling disclosure law unconstitutional

Ghislaine Maxwell fights release of more Epstein documents, calling disclosure law unconstitutional
NEW YORK (AP) — Lawyers for imprisoned British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell are fighting the requested release of 90,000 pages related to disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein and Maxwell, saying a law used to force the public release of millions of documents is unconstitutional.
The lawyers filed papers late Friday in Manhattan federal court to try to block the release of documents from a since-settled civil defamation lawsuit brought a decade ago by the late Epstein victim Virginia Giuffre against Maxwell. The Justice Department recently asked a judge to lift secrecy requirements on the files.
Maxwell’s attorneys said the Justice Department obtained the documents — otherwise subject to secrecy orders — improperly during its criminal probe of Maxwell. They said the documents include transcripts of over 30 depositions and private information regarding financial and sexual matters related to Maxwell and others.
Some records from the year-long exchange of evidence in the lawsuit battle were already released publicly in response to a federal appeals court order.
Maxwell’s lawyers say a law Congress passed in December to force the release of millions of Epstein-related documents violates the Constitution’s separation of powers doctrine.
“Congress cannot, by statute, strip this Court of the power or relieve it of the responsibility to protect its files from misuse. To do so violates the separation of powers,” wrote the lawyers, Laura Menninger and Jeffrey Pagliuca about the Epstein Files Transparency Act.
“Under the Constitution’s separation of powers, neither Congress nor the Executive Branch may intrude on the judicial power. That power includes the power to definitively and finally resolve cases and disputes,” the lawyers added.
The release of Epstein-related documents from criminal probes that began weeks ago has resulted in new revelations about Epstein’s decades-long sexual abuse of women and teenage girls. Some victims have complained that their names and personal information were revealed in documents while the names of their abusers were blacked out.
Members of Congress have complained that only about half of existing documents, many with redactions, have been made public even as Justice Department officials have said everything has been released, except for some files that can’t be made public until a judge gives the go-ahead.
Giuffre said Epstein had trafficked her to other men, including the former Prince Andrew, now known as Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor. She sued Mountbatten-Windsor in 2021, claiming that they had sex when she was 17.
He denied her claims and the two settled the lawsuit in 2022. Days ago, he was arrested and held in custody for nearly 11 hours on suspicion of misconduct in having shared confidential trade information with Epstein.
In a memoir published after she killed herself last year, Giuffre wrote that prosecutors told her they didn’t include her in the sex trafficking prosecution of Maxwell because they didn’t want her allegations to distract the jury.
Maxwell, 64, was convicted in December 2021 and sentenced to 20 years in prison. Epstein took his own life in a federal lockup in August 2019 as he awaited trial on sex trafficking charges. Maxwell was moved from a federal prison in Florida to a low-security prison camp in Texas last summer after she participated in two days of interviews with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche.
Two weeks ago, she declined to answer questions from House Oversight Committee lawmakers in a deposition conducted in a a video call to her federal prison camp, though she indicated through a statement from her lawyer that she was “prepared to speak fully and honestly” if granted clemency.
The Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Saturday.

Trump says he’ll raise tariffs to 15 percent after Supreme Court ruling

Trump says he’ll raise tariffs to 15 percent after Supreme Court ruling
Trump says he’ll raise tariffs to 15 percent after Supreme Court ruling
WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump said Saturday that he wants a global tariff of 15%, up from 10% he had announced a day earlier after the U.S. Supreme Court struck down many of the far-reaching taxes on imports that he had imposed over the last year.
Trump’s announcement on social media was the latest sign that despite the court’s check on his powers, the Republican president still intends to ratchet up tariffs in an unpredictable way. Tariffs have been his favorite tool for rewriting the rules of global commerce and applying international pressure.
The court’s decision on Friday struck down tariffs that Trump had imposed on nearly every country using an emergency powers law. Trump now said he will use a different, albeit more limited, legal authority.
He’s already signed an executive order enabling him to bypass Congress and impose a 10% tax on imports from around the world, starting on Tuesday, the same day as his State of the Union speech. However, those tariffs are limited to 150 days unless they are extended legislatively.
The White House did not immediately respond to a message inquiring when the president would sign an updated order to peg the tariffs at 15%.
He wrote on social media that he was making the announcement “based on a thorough, detailed, and complete review of the ridiculous, poorly written, and extraordinarily anti-American decision on Tariffs issued yesterday.”
By a 6-3 vote, the justices ruled that it was unconstitutional for Trump to unilaterally set and change tariffs because the power to tax lies with Congress.
In addition to the temporary tariffs that Trump wants to set at 15%, the president said Friday that he was also pursuing tariffs through other sections of federal law which require an investigation by the Commerce Department.
He wrote on Saturday that “during the next short number of months, the Trump Administration will determine and issue the new and legally permissible Tariffs, which will continue our extraordinarily successful process of Making America Great Again.”
After the Supreme Court decision, Trump made an unusually personal attack on the justices who ruled against him in a 6-3 vote, including two of those he appointed during his first term, Justices Neil Gorsuch and Amy Coney Barrett. Trump, at a news conference on Friday, said that the situation is “an embarrassment to their families.”
He was still seething Friday night, posting on social media complaining about Gorsuch, Coney Barrett and Chief Justice John Roberts, who ruled with the majority and wrote the majority opinion. On Saturday morning, Trump issued another post declaring that his “new hero” was Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who wrote a 63-page dissent. He also praised Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, who were in the minority, and said of the three dissenting justices: “There is no doubt in anyone’s mind that they want to, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!”
Tariffs have been central to Trump’s economic policies, which he has said address a host of ills, from reviving trade imbalances and reviving U.S. manufacturing to forcing other nations to action, whether it be stepping up efforts to combat drug trafficking or ceasing hostilities with each other.
He also regularly claimed despite evidence to the contrary that foreign governments would pay the tariffs—not American consumers and businesses.
Federal data shows the Treasury had collected more than $133 billion from the import taxes the president has imposed under the emergency powers law as of December, and Trump has made many promises about what that money might go toward, such as paying down the national debt and sending dividend checks to taxpayers. The Supreme Court decision did not address what happens to the funds that have already been collected from tariffs.
Democrats spoke out quickly on Trump’s new tariff threat. Democrats on the House Ways and Means Committee accused Trump of “pickpocketing the American people” with his newly announced higher tariff.
“A little over 24 hours after his tariffs were ruled illegal, he’s doing anything he can to make sure he can still jack up your costs,” they wrote on social media.
California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Trump nemesis, added that “he does not care about you.”

Blizzard warnings issued for New York City, New Jersey, Connecticut as storm threatens East Coast

Blizzard warnings issued from Delaware to Massachusetts as storm threatens East Coast
Blizzard warnings issued from Delaware to Massachusetts as storm threatens East Coast
NEW YORK (AP) — A rapidly intensifying storm triggered blizzard warnings Saturday for New York City, New Jersey and Boston as communities along the East Coast prepared for the Sunday arrival of heavy snow and damaging winds.
The National Weather Service increased its assessment of the potential severity of a storm that was projected to be much milder only days earlier.
The weather service said 1 to 2 feet (about 30 to 61 centimeters) of snow was possible in many areas as it issued blizzard warnings for New York City and Long Island, Boston and coastal communities in New Jersey, Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Rhode Island and Massachusetts. Flooding was also possible in parts of New York and New Jersey, it said.
“While we do get plenty of these nor’easters that produce heavy snow and strong impacts, it’s been several years since we saw one of this magnitude across this large of a region in this very populated part of the country,” said Cody Snell, a meteorologist at the service’s Weather Prediction Center.
Snell said the storm would arrive Sunday morning in areas around Washington before stretching toward Philadelphia and New York City and reaching Boston in the evening.
The weather service said the storm could begin as rainfall in some places before worsening, with the heaviest snowfall expected at night and as much as 2 inches (5 centimeters) of snow per hour at times in some areas, before tapering off by Monday afternoon.
The weather service warned that the storm, with steady winds of 25 to 35 mph (40 to 56 kph) would “make travel dangerous, if not impossible. Scattered downed tree limbs and power outages possible due to snow load and strong winds.”
Officials scrambled to prepare for a storm that forecasters days ago believed would have a much more limited impact.
New York Mayor Zohran Mamdani said the city would expand on efforts it used to deal with a major snowfall weeks ago. But officials held off on deciding whether to open schools Monday for the time being.
“We saw on Friday there was expectation that the likelihood was that we were going to face maybe 3 to 4 inches of snow. Quickly that then changed,” Mamdani said. “So we want to make sure that we make a decision based on up-to-date and accurate information.”
New York brought in additional snow clearing equipment from outside the city and planned to increase use of geocoding to keep track of bus stops and crosswalks that need clearing, he said.
With the storm zeroing in, John Berlingieri scrapped plans for a family trip to Puerto Rico to prepare his company, Berrington Snow Management, for what could well be a mammoth task: Clearing snow from millions of square feet of asphalt surrounding shopping malls and industrial parks across Long Island.
Employees spent the last few days recharging batteries on the company’s 40 front-end loaders and replacing windshield wipers on snow removal vehicles, before resting up Saturday.
“I’m anticipating at least one week of work around the clock,” Berlingieri said. “We’re going to work 24 to 36 hours straight, sleep for a few hours and then go back.”
The storm approached just as the icy remains of a snowstorm that struck the region weeks earlier were finally melting away.
Officials in Atlantic City, New Jersey, urged residents and casino visitors to stay off the streets, especially in low-lying neighborhoods prone to flooding.
“I could go on and on probably with a good two dozen streets where we know we will get water and there will be snow on top of that,” said Scott Evans, the city’s fire chief and emergency management coordinator. “So you won’t be able to see it until it’s too late, so therefore please stay at home.”
Many churches canceled Sunday services and other activities. To compensate, St. Veronica Parish in Howell, New Jersey, added an extra Mass on Saturday evening.
“Please stay safe, avoid unnecessary travel, and keep one another in prayer during the storm,” the Rev. Peter James Alindogan posted online.

MFA transfers over 200 DJI Matrice reconnaissance drones to Ukraine’s Defense Forces
This was reported by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, as cited by Ukrinform.
According to Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha, the units receiving the drones include Azov, Liut, the 21st Separate Mechanized Brigade, as well as the STRIX UAV unit.
He explained that diplomacy during wartime is not limited to “negotiating tables, international summits, or complex sanctions decisions,” but also includes “concrete support for our soldiers on the front line.”
“These drones were purchased with charitable donations collected in the Czech Republic. This is the result of joint work by diplomats, partners, and caring individuals who understand that supporting Ukraine is not about words, but about action,” the minister emphasized.
Sybiha stressed that the reconnaissance drones will help save the lives of Ukrainian service members, improve decision-making accuracy, and provide an advantage on the battlefield.
“When these drones were being loaded, everyone got involved – from attachés to the deputy minister. No ranks or offices. Just a team that knows exactly why it is doing this. This is not a one-time initiative for us. It is systematic work. The diplomatic front operates as continuously as all the others, and everyone is doing what is necessary for victory in their own place,” the foreign minister said.
As reported by Ukrinform, in September last yea,r the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Modern Ukraine Foundation transferred 20 fiber-optic FPV drones to the 21st Separate Mechanized Brigade, as well as three 35 kW generators for regional clinical hospitals in Zaporizhzhia, Dnipro, and Kharkiv.

US wins its record 11th gold medal at the Winter Olympics
The U.S. team won its record-breaking 11th gold medal of the Winter Olympics when the trio of Kaila Kuhn, Connor Curran and Chris Lillis took the title in mixed aerials
- Bookmark
The U.S. Olympic team won its record-breaking 11th gold medal of the Winter Games on Saturday, with at least one more good possibility when its men's hockey team wraps up the action on closing day with the title game against Canada.
The trio of Kaila Kuhn, Connor Curran and Chris Lillis gave the U.S. the record by capturing the American team's second straight title in mixed aerials.
The 11th gold breaks the country's mark set at the last Olympics on U.S. soil — in Salt Lake City in 2002, which has long stood out as a turning point for a winter sports program that had struggled over previous decades.
This could end up being another turning point, not so much for the sheer number of medals but the variety of places from which they came: Twelve of the 17 sports disciplines represented in the Winter Games produced medals for the U.S.
“Our focus and our strategy has always been about breadth,” said Sarah Hirshland, the CEO of the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee. “We want to win in everything. We want to make every sport better. Some could argue there are countries that go a mile deep in certain sports and really dominate. Our goal has been to improve Winter sport across the board.”
The aerials medal, then a bronze in speedskating from Mia Manganello later in the day, lifted the U.S. to 31 overall for the Olympics with one day left.
That's second to Norway, which had a record 18 gold medals and 40 overall through Saturday evening. Seventy-two percent of the golds came in the endurance sports of cross country, biathlon and Nordic combined. The biggest gold-medal hauls for the U.S. came in four disciplines — two each (18%) in Alpine skiing, freestyle skiing, figure skating and speedskating.
There are 38 more medal events on the program this year than there were in 2002. A lot of the new events have come at the snowpark — halfpipe, slopestyle and big air — which used to be America's domain but has now been taken over by Japan, which, for instance, won nine medals in snowboarding, compared to two for the U.S.
“We stated we wanted to be a podium nation,” Fin Kirwan, the USOPC's chief of Olympic sport, said of the U.S. goal of being top-three on the medals table. “We said it will likely take 30 medals and we got after it. The athletes delivered on their potential and, by turn, we hit the record on gold-medal performance, which shows that our very best were able to execute.”
Here are some looks and links to the rest of the 11 U.S. gold medal winners:
Alex Ferreira, freeskiing
Halfpipe skier rounds out his Olympic collection — gold, silver, bronze. Back home, he’ll keep going with streamer “Hotdog Hans” where he dressed up like an 80-something ski sensation.
Breezy Johnson, Alpine skiing
Her long journey included a knee injury four years ago on the same mountain where she won the gold.
Elizabeth Lemley, moguls
Nicknamed “Lizard,” she joins a long line of great U.S. moguls skiers, including 2010 champion Hannah Kearney and her teammate, Jaelin Kauf, who now has three silver medals.
Alysa Liu, figure skating
The 20-year-old stepped away after the 2022 Beijing Games, rediscovered her love for figure skating and happily claimed the title.
Elena Myers Taylor, bobsled
At her sixth Olympics, she finally broke through, becoming the oldest Winter Olympian to win gold at age 41.
Mikaela Shiffrin, Alpine skiing
The most winning skier of all time cashes in at the Olympics with slalom gold after a tear-stained shutout four years ago.
Jordan Stolz, speedskating (2)
Joined Eric Heiden at Lake Placid in 1980 as only the second man to capture the 500 and 1,000.
US figure skating team
Liu, Amber Glenn and Ilia Malinin are among the members of a team that brings home second straight gold; the last one took two years to capture after a Russian doping saga.
US women's hockey team
A tense thriller, highlighted by Hilary Knight's equalizer with 2:04 left, then Megan Keller's winner in overtime.

Houthi mobilize troops in Yemen with unclear target, as possible strike on Iran looms in - report
Unknown

05:17:17 KST

The Houthis may be mobilizing forces for an offensive, a report at Al-Ain media in the UAE said on February 21. The Houthis' objectives are unclear. However, the report of mobilization is important because it comes amid heightened tensions with Iran.
It also comes after the UAE and Saudi Arabia almost clashed over differing policies in Yemen. The Saudis have supported the government of Yemen, while the UAE has supported a group in southern Yemen called the Southern Transitional Council.
What does the Al-Ain report say? According to the report, the Houthis have mobilized on various fronts within Yemen. It may be an attempt to “ignite a new round of war.” What sources told Al-Ain is that “the Houthi militias have sent military reinforcements to Marib Governorate, where oil fields are located, and to the Hodeidah fronts on the Red Sea, in addition to reinforcements to the northern border fronts.”
Move against Saudi-backed forces?
This could indicate a Houthi move against the Riyadh-backed government forces in Yemen. It could also be part of a Houthi plan to take advantage of Saudi-UAE tensions or to pounce as US-Iran tensions grow. It’s also possible that Al-Ain is being fed misinformation designed to create tensions. Because there are so many possibilities, it is worth being skeptical about the reports.
The report goes on to say that the “sources explained that large Houthi military groups moved on Saturday from the city of Amran, located 50 kilometers north of Sana'a, led by the Houthi leader Mohammed Zaid Yahya Al-Makhdhi, nicknamed Abu Ali, to the northern border fronts of the country.”
In addition, “the sources indicated that the military force that the militias deployed to the Saada and Al-Jawf fronts on the northern borders of the country comes as part of the group’s military mobilization to all fronts,” while adding that the Houthis have also sent commanders to the Hodeidah governorate. This is an area near a port that shares the same name. This port was targeted numerous times by Israel last year when the Houthis were targeting Israel with ballistic missiles.
The report goes on to say that "the Houthis force had received intensive training at a Houthis ' training camp in Sana’a, before being deployed through Naqil Manakhah to Hodeidah. On February 18, the Houthi militias sent unprecedented reinforcements from Sana'a to the fronts of Marib Governorate, under the leadership of commander Khaled Mohammed Al-Nadhari, nicknamed Abu Ayman.”
Lastly, the report argues that Houthi fighters arrived at the Marib front. This area has been an active frontline in the past. Over the last three years, the clashes between the Houthis and the Saudi-backed Yemen government have been reduced. This is part of a wider shift in the region in which Riyadh also settled some of its problems with Iran. Riyadh has also grown closer to Turkey and Qatar over the past year, as it has distanced itself from the UAE’s policies in the region. This mostly led to a reduction in tensions with the Houthis.
Al-Ain concludes that “the unprecedented Houthi mobilization and ground attacks on the battlefronts threaten to collapse the fragile UN-brokered truce in place since 2022 and return the situation to square one, according to observers.” It is unclear if this is part of a wider attempt by Iranian-backed groups to create tensions in the region. Reports on February 21 said that Hezbollah is also considering escalation with Israel. Iranian-backed militias in Iraq have also threatened the US and Israel in the past.

Syria might close Roj Camp, last site holding ISIS-linked families, soon, officials say
Unknown
Unknown Publisher
2026-02-21
20:17:09 UTC
05:17:09 KST

The Roj camp in Syria may be closed in the coming days or weeks, according to an official in eastern Syria. Rudaw Kurdish media reported on February 21 that “Roj camp, which houses families of Islamic State (ISIS) fighters, will be fully closed in the near future, a northeast Syria (Rojava) official said on Saturday.”
The report comes after other reports have claimed that some 15,000 people left another large camp called Al-Hol. These are some of the 50,000 families of ISIS fighters who surrendered back in 2019. This large group of people mostly consisted of children. The women and children came from some 60 countries. There were also around 7,000 men.
When the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces began to clash with the Syrian government in January, there were concerns about what might happen with the estimated 25,000 people in Syria who were in around 30 prisons and camps run by the SDF. These facilities held ISIS male prisoners, as well as around 18,000 women and children. The women and children were mostly at two large camps called Al-Hol and Roj.
Over the last seven years, since ISIS was largely defeated in Syria in 2019, the ISIS families have slowly been repatriated by some countries. Many countries, particularly in Europe, did not take back their citizens. However, Iraq eventually took back thousands of its citizens. The ISIS families were left in limbo for a few reasons.
One reason was that although the anti-ISIS coalition had around 90 countries as members, none of them wanted to deal directly with the SDF because they didn’t view it as a government. On the other hand, they didn’t want the ISIS-linked women and children handed over to the Assad regime or freed. Thus, the people languished in prisons and camps.
The Syrian government joined the anti-ISIS coalition in November 2025. This meant it could not decide what to do with the ISIS detention facilities. US Central Command decided in January 2026, amid clashes between the SDF and Damascus, to move 7,000 ISIS male detainees to Iraq. This is because Iraq has experience investigating ISIS crimes. Many ISIS crimes, such as the mass murder of Yazidis, occurred in Iraq. The chaos in Syria also led some to be concerned that the ISIS men would escape.
Syria plans to let women, children go home
The women and children, judged to be less of a threat, were left behind at Al-Hol and Roj camps. Al-Hol fell into the hands of the Syrian government in January. Many of the women and children left the camp at this time, leaving a few thousand behind. Syrian officials have secured the camp and visited it. They appear to believe the people should have a right to leave. These women and children were never charged with crimes, and they have been denied any due process for seven years. Syria appears to prefer to let them go home, either to Syria, where some are from, or to their roughly 60 home countries.
Meanwhile, at Roj camp, the SDF is still in charge. It is in the spotlight because some 34 Australians there want to go back to Australia. Australia doesn’t seem keen on helping them. This is the usual policy of countries, leaving their citizens in Syria rather than dealing with them.
Rudaw reports that “Sheikhmous Ahmed, who supervises refugee and IDP camps in Rojava, told Rudaw that a joint decision has been made with the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) to empty the camp.” The report quotes him as saying, “For this purpose, coordination has taken place with the High Commissioner for Refugees regarding their transfer.”
Syrian families are already leaving and going home, apparently. It is not clear why the SDF continued to keep them in Roj camp or Al-Hol once the new Syrian government had emerged. “Roj camp remains under the control of the Autonomous Administration and is guarded by Asayish [SDF-linked] security forces. Ahmed stressed that the area around the camp is stable and free of ISIS cells, and that aid organizations continue to provide services on a daily basis,” Rudaw notes. There are some 730 foreign families from 42 countries in the camp. In addition, there are a handful of Iraqis and Syrians in the camp. “Approximately 2,225 people live in the camp, according to the Kurdish official.”
Now the SDF is moving to deal with the Roj camp and has the people go home and be repatriated. Once again, it is unclear why this process didn’t happen a year ago. “Previously, contacts were conducted through the [US-led] global coalition and the SDF’s foreign relations office,” Ahmed said. “Now, any country wishing to repatriate its citizens must directly contact the Autonomous Administration, and we are ready to provide all necessary facilitation.”

Trump's options on Iran: Trump weighs 'token' Iran enrichment in narrow nuclear compromise - report
Unknown

05:16:38 KST

The Trump administration is considering an Iranian proposal that would allow so‑called “token” uranium enrichment, according to senior US officials cited by Axios.
The potential concession would test the limits of longstanding US demands that Iran’s nuclear program not leave any possible path to a bomb.
Under the scenario outlined, Washington would evaluate a written Iranian offer in which Tehran retains minimal enrichment capacity but with strict safeguards to prevent any route to weaponization.
The report suggests this represents a narrow diplomatic opening between the red lines of the two sides, even as pressure mounts on the possibility of wider conflict.
At the same time, US President Donald Trump has been presented with military options that involve directly targeting the supreme leader, and US naval and air forces continue to arrive in the Middle East.
Potential US-Iran bargain on enrichment
Publicly, US officials have maintained that zero enrichment remains the standard for any deal with Tehran.
But US sources told Axios that the administration is open to a limited compromise, as long as it can be verified that any uranium enrichment is purely civilian and cannot be used as a stepping‑stone toward nuclear weapons development.
Tehran’s own position on enrichment appears to have evolved in recent talks. While Tehran has maintained a rigid stance on the issue, vowing that no external pressure will impact negotiations, Iranian officials have signaled willingness to reduce the level and perhaps the purity of uranium already enriched to 60 percent, a level far above what is needed for civil nuclear power but below weapons‑grade. This approach would hinge on monitoring by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
On Monday, Iran's foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, met the UN nuclear watchdog chief, Rafael Grossi, ahead of US-Iran nuclear talks to tackle their dispute over Tehran's nuclear program.
Days later, in an interview with MS NOW’s Joe Scarborough, Araghchi claimed that Iran was willing to implement “confidence-building measures” to “ensure that Iran's program cannot even be diverted to non-peaceful purposes” such as the possible construction of nuclear weapons.
Iran is said to be preparing a written counterproposal to send to Washington after approval in Tehran, Axios reported. The timing and details are unclear, but diplomats have indicated that the offer could outline limits on the number of centrifuges and the level of enrichment, framed to demonstrate compliance with peaceful use only.
Military options still on the table
Despite these diplomatic maneuvers, the US military buildup in the region continues to fuel uncertainty in Tehran and allied capitals. US officials have presented Trump with a series of operational options intended to either compel Iran to accept US terms or, if diplomacy fails, degrade Iran’s nuclear and military infrastructure.
On Thursday, US Senator Lindsey Graham said that planning was underway for a possible joint US-Israel attack on Iran. Trump later added that the US was considering an initial, limited strike on Iran to force Tehran to agree to his demands regarding a deal.
“President Trump will be ready to accept a deal that would be substantive and that he can sell politically at home,” one senior official said, warning that if Tehran “plays games, there won’t be a lot of patience.”

Italy's RAI apologizes after latest gaffe targets Israeli bobsleigh team

Italy's state broadcaster RAI was forced to apologize to the Jewish community on Saturday after an off‑air remark advising its producers to "avoid" the Israeli crew was broadcast before coverage of the Four-Man bobsleigh event at the Winter Olympics.
The head of RAI's sports division had already resigned earlier in the week after his error-ridden commentary at the Milano Cortina 2026 opening ceremony two weeks ago triggered a revolt among its journalists.
On Saturday, viewers heard "Let's avoid crew number 21, which is the Israeli one," and then "no, because ..." before the sound was cut off.
"I firmly condemn the statements made today by a RAI journalist regarding the Israeli bobsleigh delegation at the Milan-Cortina 2026 Winter Olympics," said Jonathan Peled, Israel's ambassador, on social media.
"There should be no room in sport for incitement to hatred, discrimination based on national, cultural, or religious beliefs, and any offensive rhetoric.
Italian broadcasters apologize after hateful comments about Israeli Olympic athletes
"We are confident that the RAI management will take all necessary measures to ensure that similar incidents are not repeated," he said.
RAI CEO Giampaolo Rossi said the incident represented a "serious" breach of the principles of impartiality, respect, and inclusion that should guide the public broadcaster.
He added that RAI had opened an internal inquiry to swiftly determine any responsibility and any potential disciplinary procedures.
In a separate statement, RAI's board of directors condemned the remark as "unacceptable." The board apologized to the Jewish community, the athletes involved, and all viewers who felt offended.
RAI is the country's largest media organization and operates national television, radio, and digital news services.
The union representing RAI journalists, Usigrai, had said Paolo Petrecca's opening ceremony commentary had dealt "a serious blow" to the company's credibility.
His missteps included misidentifying venues and public figures, and making comments about national teams that were widely criticized.

Ellyse Perry's 350th international match has been soured as India claimed a 17-run win in a series-deciding T20 in Adelaide.
Indian opener Smriti Mandhana top-scored with 82 off just 55 deliveries and featured in a 120-run stand with World Cup hero Jemimah Rodrigues.
India's 6-176 was the highest ever women's T20 international score at the Adelaide Oval.
Australia's women cricketers have slipped to a 17-run loss to India in their series-deciding Twenty20 fixture.
India claimed a 2-1 series triumph after posting 5-176 on Saturday night at Adelaide Oval, the highest women's T20 international score at the venue.
Australia mustered 9-159 in reply, losing traction after their initial three wickets fell in a 13-ball span.
The match was Ellyse Perry's 350th international match.
"It was a bit of a bugger, we couldn't get the result for her tonight," Australia captain Sophie Molineux said of Perry.
"She's a special person, a special cricketer, she has done so much for the game and continues to."
Australian openers Georgia Voll and Beth Mooney cracked 18 runs from the first over, delivered by Renuka Singh Thakur.
But Voll (10) and Mooney (six) were dismissed in a space of six balls.

Australian great Perry scored only one. She advanced to spinner Shreyanka Patil and attempted a big drive but missed and was bowled.
Perry's dismissal left the hosts reeling at 3-32 in the fourth over and Phoebe Litchfield and Ash Gardner steadied with a 31-run stand.
But Litchfield (26 from 17 balls) was caught in the deep from consecutive switch-hits. She smacked a four from the first one to leave the hosts 4-63 in the ninth over.
The Australians were 4-78 at the midpoint and Gardner gave her side a sniff, making 57 from 45 balls before she too was caught in the deep.

Gardner's departure started another Australian slump of 4-15.
"We actually thought we kept them to a good score. It was a pretty good wicket," Molineux said.
"We just lost some pretty important wickets at the wrong point in time."
Earlier, Indian opener Smriti Mandhana top-scored with a superb 82 from 55 balls and featured in a 120-run partnership with No.3 Jemimah Rodrigues (59 from 46).
Australia struck early when quick Kim Garth (1-25) dismissed Shafali Verma (seven) in the third over.
Mandhana and Rodrigues then produced their fine stand, powering the tourists to 1-86 at the midpoint of their innings.
The 29-year-old Mandhana registered her half-century from only 38 balls by smacking Darcie Brown over the midwicket fence for six.
The partnership was finally broken in the 17th over when Mandhana lofted Annabel Sutherland (2-34) into the legside only for Gardner to make swift ground from deep midwicket and take a catch on the run.
The nations meet again on Tuesday in Brisbane for the first of three 50-over fixtures, ahead of a Test match starting March 6 at the WACA Ground in Perth.
Those matches will be the last for ex-Australian skipper Alyssa Healy before she retires.
"[Healy] is going to bring an injection of some real excitement," Molineux said.
"It's going to be her last four games for Australia and we're going to do everything possible to send her off on the right note."
The trophy at the end of the multi-format series is decided on a points system, with two points for a T20 and 50-over victory and four points on offer for a Test triumph.

Brazil and India agree to boost cooperation on rare earths
Brazil and India have signed a new deal to cooperate on rare earths and other critical minerals
- Bookmark
Brazil and India sealed a deal Saturday on critical minerals and rare earths, enhancing cooperation on crucial resources between two major countries of the global south as they seek to diversify their trading relationships.
The non-binding memorandum of understanding on rare earths establishes a framework for cooperation between the two countries, focusing on reciprocal investment, exploration, mining and artificial intelligence applications, among other issues.
Brazil has the world’s second-largest reserves of rare earth minerals, used in a wide range of products, including smartphones, electric vehicles, solar panels and jet engines.
“Increasing investments and cooperation in matters of renewable energy and critical minerals is at the core of a pioneering agreement that we have signed today,” Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva told journalists.
The two countries also agreed legal frameworks on a range of topics including entrepreneurship, health, scientific research and education.
Lula arrived in India for a state visit on Wednesday that will last through to Sunday, seeking to deepen ties with India which, like Brazil, is a founding member of the BRICS+ bloc of developing nations. He participated in a summit on artificial intelligence.
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited Brazil in July last year, while the trip to India was Lula’s second state visit.
Lula was accompanied by 11 ministers, including those of foreign affairs, finance, health and agriculture, as well as a large delegation of business leaders. The Brazilian leader on Saturday said it may be the biggest delegation of his trips abroad so far, which he called a sign of his commitment to India.
The deal on rare earths is part of a broader strategy from both India and Brazil to become more strategically autonomous from China and the U.S. through diversification, said Oliver Stuenkel, an international relations professor at the Getulio Vargas Foundation, a think tank and university.
Brazil has been pursuing that strategy for years, said Stuenkel, which is why Lula was able to stand up to President Donald Trump last year when the U.S. leader imposed a 50% tariff on Brazilian exports to the country over the trial of his ally, former President Jair Bolsonaro.
“The reading is that, given how turbulent and unpredictable things have become, the more partners, the better,” Stuenkel said.
The U.S. later removed most tariffs on Brazil and the sanctions imposed on the judge who was overseeing the case.
Roberto Goulart Menezes, an international relations professor at the University of Brasilia, said that last year’s confrontation with the U.S. is when Brazil germinated the idea of putting rare earths and critical minerals on the bargaining table.
“Brazil began to reposition its understanding of the importance of these elements beyond their commercial dimension, recognizing their geopolitical relevance,” said Goulart.
Lula is expected to visit his counterpart in Washington D.C. in the coming months. “For Brazil, this agreement represents a kind of pilot before negotiating with a country with which Brazil has an asymmetrical relationship,” Goulart said.

Two Israeli businessmen held for 18 days in Zambia on terror suspicion after hotel explosion

Two Israeli businessmen in their mid-30s were detained for 18 days in Zambia on suspicion of involvement in terrorism after an explosion in their hotel room in the capital, Lusaka, authorities and their attorney said.
The incident dates back to September, when the two men, who work for an agricultural company in Malawi bordering Zambia, were staying at the InterContinental hotel in Lusaka.
According to their account, they placed a bottle of fertilizer in the room’s refrigerator, intending to take it back with them to Malawi. For reasons that remain unclear, the substance exploded inside the refrigerator, completely burning the room and causing damage to adjacent rooms.
The two men left Zambia shortly afterward and returned to Malawi.
Four months later, they re-entered Zambia and were arrested at a border crossing after authorities determined they were wanted in connection with the explosion. They were taken for questioning by Zambia’s counterterrorism unit on suspicion of links to terrorism, based on the blast in a room registered in their names.
The two men said they had received the bottle of fertilizer from another employee of their agricultural company and were instructed to keep it refrigerated. They told investigators they were unaware the substance could ignite or explode.
The counterterrorism unit rejected their explanation and also suspected they had intended to smuggle a drone, according to their attorney.
The men were held in difficult conditions in two separate detention facilities to prevent them from coordinating their accounts. Each was held in a small cell with 14 other detainees.
Israel’s ambassador to Zambia, Ofra Farhi, and the embassy’s security officer visited the detainees, and at their request conditions of detention were improved. The ambassador and security officer also met with investigators and officials from Zambia’s Interior Ministry.
After more than two weeks of questioning, the counterterrorism unit ruled out terrorism suspicions. On Friday, the two businessmen were deported from Zambia and barred from returning.
Attorney Mordechai Tzivin, who specializes in representing Israelis facing legal trouble abroad, said: “I am pleased with the release and thank the law enforcement authorities in Zambia for reaching the conclusion that these are legitimate businessmen — that no wrongdoing was found in their actions and that the suspicion of involvement in terrorism was proven unfounded — as well as representatives of the Foreign Ministry and the embassy in Zambia for their intensive efforts and meetings with senior Zambian officials and the Zambian ambassador to Israel.”

Julien Macdonald proves the ‘king of glamour’ is back at London Fashion Week
Ella Eyre and Montana Brown were among those sitting front row.
- Bookmark
Julien Macdonald made a high-shine return to London Fashion Week, staging his autumn/winter 2026 comeback on the interior rooftop of The Shard with a collection that reaffirmed his reputation as fashion’s self-styled “king of glamour”.
Perched high above the capital, guests nursed martinis as the Welsh designer sent out a procession of sequinned, sculpted silhouettes against the glittering night skyline.
Singer Ella Eyre was among those seated front row, watching as Macdonald delivered a show steeped in his signature high-octane energy.
It marked Macdonald’s first London Fashion Week runway since restructuring his business in 2023, and the message was unmistakable: unapologetic, maximalist glamour is back.
Macdonald, 54, who launched his label in 1997 and has previously held high-profile roles at Chanel and Givenchy, has long been synonymous with red-carpet showstoppers. His return leaned fully into that legacy, delivering a collection of high-impact eveningwear designed for drama rather than understatement.
The show opened with fluid, body-skimming gowns in metallic tones, including a liquid gold halter-neck dress that plunged dramatically at the front and twisted into a draped, thigh-split skirt.
The silhouette elongated the body, the fabric catching the light with every step, evoking the kind of paparazzi-ready moment Macdonald’s celebrity clientele – from Beyonce to Jennifer Lopez – have made their own.
Sequins were deployed liberally across the collection. A sharply cut, long-sleeved column dress in burnished bronze shimmered under the spotlights, its structured shoulders lending to Macdonald’s siganture statuesque quality.
Elsewhere, micro silhouettes dominated: a black, crystal-embellished two-piece with sheer shorts and cut-out detailing left little to the imagination, styled with pared-back heels to keep the focus on the body.
Feathers, which have been trending on the runway, gave a theatrical flourish to the collection.
A mint-green, crystal-studded bodysuit was paired with a matching feathered robe that trailed behind the model, its texture softening the overt sensuality of the barely-there base layer.
In another look, a sheer black gown with feathered hem detailing glided down the runway, balancing transparency with movement.
There was little concession to winter in the traditional sense. Despite the autumn/winter billing, Macdonald’s world remains resolutely summer – or at least permanently party-bound.
Backless gowns, plunging necklines and high-cut bodysuits dominated, with sheer panels and strategic cut-outs forming a recurring motif. One pale green, sequin-drenched gown featured a deep V neckline gathered at the waist and a front slit that revealed just enough leg, merging red-carpet polish with beach-club ease.
The setting at The Shard amplified the excitement for this comeback show. With London’s skyline twinkling beyond the glass, the show felt less like a seasonal presentation and more like a celebration – a statement of resilience and return.
If much of this season’s schedule has leaned into restraint then Macdonald offered a fun alternative of high-octane, unapologetic, old-school glamour.
The designer has signalled a shift towards a more accessible luxury ready-to-wear model, focusing on versatile embellished pieces. While the collection remained firmly in the eveningwear sphere, several looks – streamlined sequinned dresses and sharply cut cocktail numbers – suggested a commercial sensibility beneath the glitz.
Macdonald was named British Fashion Designer of the Year in 2001 and appointed chief designer at Givenchy the same year, succeeding Alexander McQueen. More than two decades later, his formula of sequins, skin and skimpy silhouettes remains largely unchanged.
Julien Macdonald’s return delivered something of a jolt of joy above the London skyline.

Hezbollah brases for war as Iranian Revolutionary Guard take command

Hezbollah is stepping up military and security meetings as it braces for a possible war against Israel, according to a report by the Saudi-owned Al Arabiya network.
Sources close to the Lebanese terrorist organization told the network that Hezbollah is now effectively being run by officers from Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps rather than by Lebanese officials.
The officers, the sources said, are not only overseeing efforts to rebuild the terrorist organization after months of fighting but are also directly supervising operational plans and holding meetings with Hezbollah commanders in more than one area to issue instructions and guidance.
According to the report, some of the Iranian officers have been in Lebanon for some time, while others arrived recently amid the possibility of a US attack on the Islamic Republic of Iran.
The sources also disclosed that Iranian officers recently met with Hezbollah's missile unit in the Beqaa Valley, which was targeted in an Israeli strike on Friday. They assessed that a broader Israeli attack against Hezbollah is "inevitable" and that it is "only a matter of time" before a conflict erupts.

Ukraine’s MFA responds to blackmail by Hungary and Slovakia: Ultimatums should be sent to Kremlin, not to Kyiv
This is stated in a statement issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine, according to Ukrinform.
“Such actions, in the context of massive and targeted Russian strikes on Ukraine's energy infrastructure and Moscow's attempts to deprive Ukrainians of electricity, heating, and gas during extreme cold weather, are provocative, irresponsible, and threaten the energy security of the entire region,” the Foreign Ministry said.
The statement stresses that by acting in this way, the governments of Hungary and Slovakia are not only playing into the hands of the aggressor but are also harming their own energy companies that operate on a commercial basis.
The Foreign Ministry noted that Ukraine remains in constant contact with representatives of the European Commission regarding damage to energy infrastructure caused by daily Russian strikes.
Ukraine has also conveyed information to the governments of Hungary and Slovakia about the consequences of these attacks for the Druzhba oil pipeline infrastructure. It is emphasized that, under the constant threat of new missile attacks, security and stabilization repair work is ongoing. Ukraine has also proposed alternative solutions for supplying these countries with non-Russian oil.
“Ukraine has always been, is, and will remain a reliable energy partner of the EU and a transit country for energy resources. At the same time, in light of the unfounded and irresponsible threats coming from Budapest and Bratislava in recent days, Ukraine is considering the possibility of activating the Early Warning Mechanism provided for in the Association Agreement between Ukraine and the European Union,” the ministry said.
In this context, the Foreign Ministry calls on the governments of Hungary and the Slovak Republic to engage constructively and behave responsibly, stressing:
“Ultimatums should be sent to the Kremlin, and certainly not to Kyiv.”
As previously reported by Ukrinform, on February 20, Hungarian Foreign Minister Péter Szijjártó wrote on social media that his country would block the EU’s allocation of funds to Ukraine under a €90 billion loan until the transit of Russian oil through the Druzhba pipeline was restored.
Meanwhile, Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico stated on Saturday that if Ukraine did not resume oil transit to Slovakia, he would initiate a halt to electricity supplies to Ukraine on Monday.

Salsa legend Willie Colón dies at age 75, family says
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
Feb 21 - American salsa legend Willie Colon, the pioneering trombonist, vocalist and composer, died on Saturday at age 75, his family said in a statement.
"While we grieve his absence, we also rejoice in the timeless gift of his music and the cherished memories he created that will live on forever," the family said on Colon's Facebook page.
The cause of death was not disclosed.
Born in the Bronx to Puerto Rican parents, Colón recorded dozens of albums including La Gran Fuga (The Big Break) in 1970 and El Juicio in 1972, according to Fania Records, a label that promoted salsa music.
He signed with Fania at age 15 and two years later, in 1967, released his first album El Malo, which has sold more than 300,000 copies, according to his biography on the LA Philharmonic website.
Colón's music combined elements of jazz, rock and salsa, incorporating the rhythms of traditional music from Cuba, Puerto Rico, Brazil, and Africa, the biography said.
"A significant overarching theme in Colón’s music—which draws from many cultures and several different styles—is an exploration of the competing associations that Puerto Ricans have with their home and with the United States," it said.
"He uses his songs to depict and investigate the problems of living in the U.S. as a Puerto Rican and also to imply the cultural contributions that Puerto Ricans have to offer."
In 2004, he received a lifetime achievement award from the Latin Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences.
A longtime social activist, Colón was a member of the Latino Commission on AIDS and the United Nations Immigrant Foundation and was a board member at the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute, according to the biography. REUTERS

Willie Colón, a legendary trombonist and pioneer of salsa music, has died. He was 75.
His death on Saturday was confirmed in a Facebook post by his longtime manager, Pietro Carlos.
News of the singer’s condition circulated on the web in recent days. Yonkers Voice News reported Colón was admitted to NewYork-Presbyterian Westchester hospital in Bronxville, N.Y., on Tuesday with respiratory problems and he appeared fragile.
Born William Anthony Colón Román on April 28, 1950, to Puerto Rican parents in New York City, Colón first picked up the trumpet in school. It seemed like a natural choice for the former bugle-playing Boy Scout, who attended the youth program at the suggestion of his grandmother.
“So I could learn how to be a good boy,” said Colón in a 1988 interview with Associated Press.
By age 13, Colón had started a band and played at some weddings and in the bustling nightclubs of New York City. At one point, he forged a cabaret card, a mandated ID for musicians and entertainers between 1940 and 1967 who worked in establishments serving alcohol, which required individuals to be 18 years and older.
The thrilling 1960s Latin music scene in New York consumed Colón, who was deeply inspired by Latin jazz pioneer and bandleader Eddie Palmieri, once part of a main act at the Palladium Ballroom who went on to form La Perfecta, a Cuban conjunto that revolutionized the New York Latin music scene with its inclusion of two trombones, played by Barry Rogers and Jose Rodriguez, instead of the costly four-set trumpets.
But Colón’s instrumental preference changed once he heard the bodied timbre of Mon Rivera’s all-trombone brass lineup marching to a bomba beat. “It would knock my socks off,” said Colón in a 1988 interview with Associated Press, leading the singer to teach himself how to play the instrument.
By age 15, Colón was signed to Fania Records. Two years later at age 17, he went on to release his debut album, “El Malo,” a record that defined the fierce sounds of New York’s salsa scene, which Colón later described as the Latin equivalent of rap.
According to his former label, the name of “El Malo” was bestowed upon Colón by older musicians who sought to mock his trombone range at the time, though the young bandleader would find a way to use the label to his advantage.
On the LP, Colón’s sound moved away from the polished mambo sounds of orchestral bands decades prior, in large part due to Puerto Rican singer Héctor Lavoe, whose vocals can be heard in tracks like the gritty “El Malo” that vows to knock out any wanna-be street phony.
The pair would go on to record a total of 14 albums through 1973, with Lavoe’s talents for improvisation complementing Colón’s raw, aggressive trombone.
“Salsa came from the same kind of situation that rap does,” Colon said in a 1992 interview with The Times. “It was kind of a hybrid of a bunch of different elements. Hector had just come from Puerto Rico and didn’t speak English. I didn’t speak much Spanish, I was a little New York kid. We got together and just started with the same kind of irreverent, rebellious attitude, writing songs about the baddest guy on the block, drugs and sex. Before that, the lyrics and whole attitude of Latin music was, ‘Look at me dance, listen to those drums, I’m cutting sugar cane.’ It was a rural, folkloric emphasis; we changed it to an inner-city kind of culture.”
Colón’s impact went beyond live music. The album cover of “El Malo,” which showed two serious profiles of Colón, depicted the singer as a sly bad boy, and ultimately gave rise to his gangster persona, which would be a throughline in future projects, including his sophomore 1968 album, “The Hustler” which featured the band with fitted suits, smoking cigars and placing bets in a pool hall. His 1970 album “Cosa Nuestra” featured Colón smoking a cigar while overlooking a dead body in broad daylight in Manhattan’s East River Bikeway. Most famously, his 1971 album, “La Gran Fuga,” depicted the singer on a fake FBI “Most Wanted” poster.
These mob-like depictions occurred long before cult-favorite films like Francis Ford Coppola’s 1972 “The Godfather” and Brian De Palma 1983’s “Scarface” became the prominent gangster storylines various male acts venerate in their music.
By 1973, Colón and Lavoe split — allegedly due to Lavoe’s drug addiction leading to many missed concert performances — although the two would remain frequent collaborators until the latter’s death in 1993 due to complications of AIDS.
The Nuyorican musician would introduce Blades as the new singer of his orchestra, whom he had met years prior while visiting Panama during carnivals. They collaborated briefly on Colón’s 1975 LP “The Good, the Bad, the Ugly,” cementing their partnership in the 1977 album “Metiendo Mano,” which delved into socio-political themes, notably in their track “Pablo Pueblo,” which shares the story of a working class man with broken dreams halted by toils of daily life. Other tracks like “Plantación Adentro,” detailed the story of Camilo Manrique, a fictionalized enslaved character who died at the hands of a Spanish colonizer in 1745.
Many considered this album Colón’s first foray into intellectual salsa — in large part because of Blades, who had a knack for storytelling and political interests (he unsuccessfully ran for president of Panama in 1994) — that addressed colonialism and class disparities. Together they released three albums, including their 1978 “Siembra,” one of the bestselling salsa albums at that time; from the start, their track “Plastico” fused the popular disco music of the moment while addressing superficial beauty standards and colorism in Latin America.
According to 1996 reporting by The Times, “Siembra” delivered pulsating salsa rhythms that “carried messages of freedom at a time when most of Latin America was oppressed by military dictatorships.”
By 1982, Blades and Colón parted ways, but they collaborated again on projects like their 2005 LP “Tras La Tormenta” — which led the bandleader to sing for the first time in his career, “I had to start from zero, and it took me many years to feel comfortable,” Colón said.
This newfound independence gave rise to some of Colón’s most famous songs, including his 1995 track “Talento de Televisión,” an upbeat song with his signature trombone wailing in the backdrop as he sang about an attractive woman with a lack of talent.
Many across Latin America might be familiar with his 1989 song “El Gran Varon” — which narrated the story of a trans woman who is rejected by her father and presumably dies of AIDS — a landmark salsa song that brought awareness to LGBTQ+ themes during the AIDS crisis. Colón would later serve as a member of the Latino Commission on AIDS. “El Gran Varon” is an anthem to this day.
Colón released more than 40 albums in all.
He also acted, taking roles in films including 1982’s “Vigilante,” the 1983 sports drama “The Last Fight,” as well as one-episode stints in TV shows like “Miami Vice” and “The Cosby Show.” He was even featured in Bad Bunny’s “Nuevayol” music video, cutting a slice of cake; the 31-year-old superstar pays homage to the singer in its lyrics: “Willie Colón, me dicen el malo, ey. Porque pasan los años y sigo dando palo”/ “Willie Colón, they say I’m bad, because the years come and I’m still hitting.”
In his later years, he became more involved in politics. In 1994, he unsuccessfully went up against U.S. Rep. Eliot Engel of the Bronx in the Democratic primary. He also ran as a Democrat for Public Advocate in 2001, focusing on community issues, education and AIDS awareness, but failed to gain the popular vote. In 2008, he endorsed Hillary Rodham Clinton over Barack Obama in the primary election.
On May 26, 2014, after graduating from Westchester County Police Academy, Colón was sworn in as a deputy sheriff for the Department of Public Safety, later becoming deputy lieutenant.
As President Trump took office in his first term, Colón’s politics shifted in support of the right-wing candidate, and he said he would be open to performing at his inauguration in 2017.
Billboard magazine named him one of the most influential Latino artists of all time in 2018. Colón’s death sparked an outpouring of condolences across the Latin music world.
Oscar D’León, a Grammy-nominated salsa artist, frequently performed alongside Colón as the genre rose to prominence internationally. He hailed Colón as an architect of the genre.
“How difficult it is to say goodbye to a giant! Today, salsa mourns the passing of my great brother and colleague, Willie Colón,” D’León wrote in Spanish on Instagram.
“Willie, you leave an indelible legacy in each of us. That trombone of yours, with its rebellious and unique sound, forever changed the history of our Latin music. As a trombonist, you created a school, but as a composer and arranger, you were an absolute genius, a true architect of salsa. You are and always will be one of the greatest pillars of our genre.”
Grupo Niche, the legendary Colombian salsa orchestra, was one of many music groups across Latin America that praised Colón’s contribution to salsa music, extolling him as “an absolute icon of our culture.”
“Songs that marked generations, stories that became anthems, and an artistic force that transformed salsa forever,” a post on the orchestra’s Instagram said.
Marc Anthony, the best-selling salsa artist of all time who admired Colón, also offered a brief tribute on Instagram.
“Maestro, thank you for your legacy,” Anthony wrote in Spanish along with a photo of the two performing together. “Your music will live forever.”
Colón is survived by his wife, Julia Colón, and his four sons and grandsons.

Far-right anti-Islam march sparks counterprotests in Manchester
Hundreds of Britain First protesters faced larger antifascist crowds in a tense Manchester city centre standoff.
Manchester, United Kingdom – Chants of “send them back” echoed through a damp underpass as hundreds of far-right anti-Islam protesters prepared to march through the streets.
Union Jacks fluttered in the wind as protesters – some visibly under the influence of alcohol – chanted a series of anti-immigration slogans and derisive comments about British Prime Minister Keir Starmer.

In response to the demonstration organised by Britain First, a far-right political party that calls for mass deportation and the removal of migrants and Muslims from the UK, a counterprotest was also planned for midday on Saturday.
It formed a much larger crowd made up of antifascist protesters who gathered a few streets away, carrying antiracist banners and waving an array of flags, including the Palestinian flag.
Ruby, 20, a student from South London, took a five-hour coach ride to show her support for the counterprotest and told Al Jazeera that attending was a “no-brainer”. She asked that her surname not be published, fearing repercussions.
‘A master race’
Ruby said her grandparents, originally from Montserrat, were part of the Windrush generation – immigrants invited to the UK between 1948 and 1971 from Caribbean countries – and, despite having given so much to their adopted country, are now feeling increasingly unwelcome.
She said her grandparents had told her they were witnessing a return to the levels of racism they experienced when they came to the country in the 1950s.
It was a sentiment echoed by Llowelyn, 16, a counter-protester from Wales who said her father, who is British Guyanese, has received more verbal abuse based on his race in the past few years than at any other point.
The tension was palpable before the two marches were due to begin, with far-right agitators livestreaming to their followers as they entered the area assigned to the counterprotest.
John – a stocky, tenacious counter-protester from Wales – confronted them with arms outstretched as police officers looked on.
“They come here to cause a ruckus and make money of it online, but I come here to protect the left. These guys [far-right agitators] try and intimidate … minorities because they think they are a master race”, he told Al Jazeera.
As the Britain First march began, flanked by police and led by Paul Golding, a portly, combative far-right activist who has previously been imprisoned for religiously aggravated harassment, the celebratory mood quickly turned aggressive as they came across counter-protesters in the city centre.
“Leftie scum,” screamed one member of the Britain First crowd as they harassed three young people who staged a sit-down, forcing riot police to encircle and pull them to safety.
‘Divisive, racist positions’
The two marches finally met in an expletive-ridden crushendo as police struggled to hold ranks.
Britain First protesters prodded counter-protesters with flag poles, and some slipped through the porous police lines as they shouted anti immigration and anti-Palestine slogans.
A number of counterprotesters and bystanders expressed frustration that the police allowed the march to go ahead.
“We, as Jews and internationalists, are having to confront Britain First, the fascists who are organising on the streets, who have been permitted to market their divisive, racist, dictatorial positions on our streets,” Pia Feig, of Jewish Action for Palestine, told Al Jazeera.
Audrey, a teacher and counterprotester who was pushed away by police after being shoved by a Britain First protester, said the police always “protected” the far-right groups.
A police officer told Al Jazeera that the day required extensive planning and was a particularly difficult operation, as the two groups kept changing their planned route.
He said on condition of anonymity that handling the two conflicting protests, a rally in support of Ukraine, and managing crowds at large football fixtures held this weekend had stretched the local police force thin.

UK royals face worst crisis in generations as Epstein fallout leads to ex-prince’s arrest
Expert says family has ‘no clear route forward’ after Andrew becomes first senior royal to be arrested since the 1640s
LONDON (AP) — King Charles III’ s brother was under arrest. Police were searching two royal properties, and news commentators were endlessly discussing the details of a sex scandal with tentacles that stretched to the gates of Buckingham Palace.
So how did Britain’s royal family spend Thursday afternoon? The king sat in the front row on the first day of London Fashion Week. Queen Camilla attended a lunchtime concert, and Princess Anne visited a prison.
The decision to continue normal royal duties was more than just an example of British stoicism in the face of the monarchy’s biggest crisis in almost a century.
It was the opening act of the House of Windsor’s fight for survival as the arrest of the former prince Andrew threatens to undermine public backing for the monarchy.
After pledging to support the police investigation into his brother’s friendship with the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, the king stressed his intentions.
“My family and I will continue in our duty and service to you all,” he said in a statement signed “Charles R.,” using the abbreviation for Rex, the Latin word for king.
Biggest crisis since 1936 abdication
The simple fact that Charles made the statement showed the scale of the problem created by the arrest of the king’s 66-year-old sibling, now known as Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, who was held for 11 hours and then released under investigation, meaning he was neither charged nor exonerated.
The event was so unprecedented that commentators had to reach back to the 1640s and the arrest and execution of King Charles I during the English Civil War to find a parallel.
Mountbatten-Windsor’s arrest on suspicion of misconduct in public office is shaping up to be the monarchy’s biggest crisis since Edward VIII abdicated in 1936 to marry an American divorcee, Wallis Simpson.
That scandal weakened public support for the monarchy, which did not fully recover for 15 years. The turnaround came only after Edward’s successor, King George VI, refused to flee Britain during World War II, demonstrating his solidarity with a nation ravaged by Nazi bombs.
Even before she ascended the throne, Queen Elizabeth II followed her father’s lead and publicly pledged her life in service to Britain.
But while the impact of Edward’s abdication lingered for years, the crisis reached a crescendo in a few days. And the solution in that case was relatively simple: Edward stepped aside, and his oldest brother took his place.
By contrast, the drama surrounding Mountbatten-Windsor is ongoing, with no end in sight.
No ‘clear route forward’
The current crisis stems from revelations about the relationship between the former prince and Epstein that were uncovered when the US Justice Department released millions of pages of documents last month from its investigation into Epstein.
Police have previously cited reports that Mountbatten-Windsor sent trade information to Epstein, a wealthy investor, in 2010, when the former prince was Britain’s special envoy for international trade.
At least eight UK police forces have said they are looking into issues raised by the documents.
Compared with previous royal scandals, “this time there doesn’t seem to be any clear route forward,’’ said Ed Owens, author of “After Elizabeth: Can the Monarchy Save Itself?” “There’s no blueprint to follow” in terms of how the monarchy and associated organizations deal with the allegations.
The last time the monarchy had to manage these kinds of questions was after the death of Princess Diana, Charles’ ex-wife. Elizabeth and Charles were criticized for failing to respond to the outpouring of public grief as tens of thousands of people swarmed to Kensington Gardens to lay flowers outside the late princess’ home. Some even called for Charles to step aside as heir to the throne in favor of his son William.
The queen later commissioned focus groups to better understand the public mood and determine why people felt so strongly about a person they never met. The crisis forced the royals to recognize that Diana’s common touch had connected with people in ways that had not yet occurred to the House of Windsor.
Those lessons have since inspired other royals, including Diana’s sons, Princes William and Harry, to be more informal and approachable.
But this moment is different, in part because it is taking place in a rapidly changing media environment at a time when people are demanding transparency from their leaders.
Family could face uncomfortable questions
Moving forward also means facing uncomfortable questions about what the institution — and the family members themselves — may have known about Mountbatten-Windsor’s activities. The palace has sought to draw a bold line separating the former prince and the rest of the monarchy by stripping him of his titles, including the right to be called a prince.
In another blow for the former prince, the British government is considering formally removing him from the line of succession to the crown. Despite losing his status and his honors, Andrew remains eighth in line to the throne. That can only be changed with legislation.
Charles is the first monarch “that has to meet our expectations of figures in public life, which is to be accountable and to explain yourself,” said Craig Prescott, a royal expert at Royal Holloway, University of London. “And you always have to work to earn the support of the public. And that is a particular challenge when you’re facing a controversy such as Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor.”
Critics argue that the monarchy was slow to respond to the pressure, given that Mountbatten-Windsor’s links to Epstein have been discussed for more than a decade.
The best outcome for the monarchy is for the police investigation to focus solely on the information in the Epstein files and how that relates to Mountbatten-Windsor, said Peter Hunt, a former BBC royal correspondent. The worst outcome would be if police expand their inquiries to what the broader institution might have known and when.
“Were questions raised about his behavior as a trade envoy over those 10 years? Were they answered? What did people do about them?’’ Hunt said on the BBC.
And perhaps there’s more to learn.
“Will there be files?’’ he asked.
If so, we have a request.

What is the rules-based order and is Trump really threatening it?

04:36:46 KST

When German Chancellor Friedrich Merz declared that the rules-based international order "no longer exists", he joined a growing chorus of global leaders issuing similar warnings.
In his opening speech at the Munich Security Conference last weekend, Merz told other world leaders that "our freedom is not guaranteed" and the world had returned to an era of "big power politics".
His remarks echoed those of Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, who weeks earlier told the World Economic Forum in Davos that the world was in the "midst of a rupture, not a transition".
Carney warned that middle powers, such as Australia and Canada, needed to work more closely together because "if we’re not at the table, we’re on the menu".
"Stop invoking rules-based international order as though it still functions as advertised. Call it what it is — a system of intensifying great power rivalry, where the most powerful pursue their interests, using economic integration as coercion," Carney said.
While neither leader mentioned US President Donald Trump by name, both speeches came amid a widening rift between the United States and its Western allies.
Trump’s aggressive rhetoric about annexing Greenland — a territory of Denmark — along with his use of tariffs and criticism of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization alliance have shaken confidence in the post-World War Two global order.
As Trump issued a new threat to Iran this week, that a deal on nuclear must be reached within 10 days, he raised the risk he will act in disregard of the wishes of the UN Security Council, on which the US is a permanent member.
SBS News spoke with two geopolitical experts who had differing opinions on whether Merz and Carney accurately described the decline of the rules-based order or overstated the crisis.
What is the rules-based order and is it being challenged?
The rules-based order refers to the international system in which countries interact according to agreed rules, norms and multilateral institutions rather than through force or coercion.
Established after World War Two and led by the United States, the system promotes free trade, security cooperation and sovereignty of states.
Tom Chodor, a senior lecturer in politics and international relations at Monash University, told SBS News the US has historically underpinned the system through what he described as a "hegemonic approach".
"Hegemony is a basis for a rules-based order, because you need one state that's more powerful than everyone else but willing to compromise and to offer concessions," he said.
While authoritarian states have long challenged the system, most notably by the Eastern Bloc during the Cold War, Chodor argues it is now the US that is upending the order.
"It's imposing its will on other countries and not offering them much in return if they agree to do what the US wants them to do," he said.
Trump has pulled out of dozens of international organisations and agreements, questioned the purpose of the United Nations and set up a US-led Board of Peace to implement a peace plan for Gaza.
The US has also expanded its military presence near the Middle East in recent weeks, raising the prospect of new strikes on Iran, following last year's attack on Iranian nuclear facilities — an action some experts argued breached international law.
Australian National University professor Donald Rothwell said Trump was not authorised by the UN to attack Iran last year, therefore violating its charter, and also acting in violation of the clause on the right to self-defence.
Russia's invasion of Ukraine has also challenged the core principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity of the rules-based order.
Meanwhile, the rise of China and its expanding global influence have disrupted the post–Cold War era in which the US stood as the sole superpower.
Although middle powers could attempt to uphold the rules-based order without the US, Chodor said that it becomes far more difficult when major powers actively undermine those efforts.
He cited a proposed International Maritime Organization plan that would have required shipping companies to pay a levy on carbon dioxide emissions.
While most countries backed the regulation, a final vote scheduled last October was postponed for a year amid US pressure, including threats of tariffs, sanctions and visa restrictions against countries that supported the measures.
"You can negotiate nice rules amongst yourselves, but if the most powerful country attacks those rules ... that system you negotiate can’t function," Chodor said.
Chodor said Australia was particularly exposed to a "shakedown" from the US through security arrangements such as AUKUS, which will see Australia acquire nuclear-powered attack submarines through the trilateral partnership with the US and United Kingdom.
"If the US suddenly decides that they want us to pay $15 billion into the shipping industry ... we really don't have an option but to say yes, because without that, our capacity to project force collapses," he said.
He said the alliance also meant Australia was less likely to speak out against the US when it undermined the rules-based order, damaging Australia's credibility with other countries.
'More robust, more enduring'
Not everyone agrees that the system is in terminal decline.
Dr John Blaxland, professor of international security and intelligence studies and director of the Australian National University’s North America Liaison Office, told SBS News the rules-based order was more robust than it was credited for.
He said countries continued to follow rules governing trade resolution, international transactions and maritime regulation.
"These are things you can mock, you can say 'it's all over'," he said.
"They're still functioning .... we all have a vested interest in that continuing, even the United States.
"The rules-based order is, in fact, more robust, more enduring, more profound than people are prepared to give acknowledgement to."
Unless there was a global conflict, Blaxland believed it was unlikely that a fully fractured multi-polar world would emerge, noting that countries are more interconnected than ever before.
He noted China's rise, a counter-weight to US dominance, had occurred during the era of globalisation and was underpinned by the rules-based order.
"It has been a huge beneficiary of that order, and has shown no signs of wanting to destroy it," he said.
A day after Merz’s speech, Blaxland noted US secretary of state Marco Rubio's address to the Munich conference struck a far more conciliatory tone towards Europe than Trump’s earlier rhetoric.
Rubio said Europe and the US "belong together", reassuring allies it was "neither our goal nor our wish" to end the transatlantic partnership.
"We do not need to abandon the system of international cooperation we authored, and we don't need to dismantle the global institutions of the old order that together we built. But these must be reformed. These must be rebuilt," Rubio said.
Blaxland described the speech as a "circuit breaker" and could signal the repairing of US and European relations.

Merz says will travel to US with EU’s agreed position to discuss tariffs

BERLIN, February 21. /TASS/. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has announced his plans to travel to Washington to discuss with US President Donald Trump the situation around US tariffs.
"This is an interesting decision that many had been expecting: the Supreme Court in Washington has pointed out the limits of the administration's powers in matters of customs policy," Merz said in an interview with ARD television after the Christian Democratic Union convention in Stuttgart. He clarified that the verdict does not concern sectoral duties, but rather the general tariff rate.
According to Merz, his talks with the US president will be preceded by consultations with the European Union to elaborate "an absolutely clear European position." "Customs policy is the European Union’s competence, not of its individual member states. I will travel to Washington with an agreed European position," he stated.
"First and foremost, these (tariffs - TASS) harm the country that imposes them," he emphasized. Germany, in his words, is also feeling the strain, as it is supplying fewer goods. "But in the end, it is consumers in the US who will have to pay more," Merz explained, calling the US court's verdict positive news. "The separation of powers in the US still seems to be functioning, and that is good news."
According to the Bild newspaper, the German chancellor will visit the United States in early March. His meeting with President Donald Trump is scheduled for March 3.
he US Supreme Court on Friday ruled that the US president had exceeded his authority by imposing tariffs on other countries under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). However, the highest court did not clarify whether the US should refund the money previously paid as tariffs. Following the court verdict, Trump signed an executive order imposing 10% tariffs on imports from all countries. The tariffs will take effect on February 24 and remain in force for 150 days.

Far Left protest planned against Buchenwald Memorial on Liberation Day

A planned far-left protest against the Buchenwald concentration camp memorial on the anniversary of its liberation has sparked outrage across Germany, with officials denouncing the move as an affront to the memory of Holocaust victims.
According to a report in the German Bild, citing Switzerland's Neue Zürcher Zeitung, radical organizations are calling for demonstrations on April 11, the day the camp was liberated in 1945. The groups accuse the memorial's management of "spreading Israeli propaganda" and of not being "hostile enough toward Israel."
The protest is being organized under the slogan "Keffiyehs in Buchenwald." Among those involved are the student wing of Germany's Left Party (Die Linke), the anti-Israel group Jewish Voice for a Just Peace in the Middle East and the German Communist Party (DKP).
In statements published by the organizers, the Buchenwald memorial site is accused of promoting "historical revisionism and genocide denial" and of serving as a vehicle for advancing an alleged "Israeli narrative."
The controversy follows an incident last year in which a woman seeking to stage a protest at the site while wearing a keffiyeh, a scarf widely associated with Palestinian nationalism, was denied entry. A German court later upheld the decision. The protest organizers claim the memorial's management is effectively criminalizing pro-Palestinian activists.
According to the report, one of the leading activists behind the campaign belongs to a communist organization that previously expressed public support for the October 7 massacre carried out by Hamas. In a statement issued after the attack, the group described it as a "legitimate uprising by all means necessary."
The remarks triggered widespread public anger in Germany, particularly given Buchenwald's central place in the country's culture of remembrance. Tens of thousands of Jews were murdered at the camp during the Holocaust, making it one of the most significant symbols of Nazi atrocities.
Felix Klein, the German government's commissioner for combating antisemitism, sharply condemned the initiative, calling it "a new low in the reversal of roles between victim and perpetrator." He described the planned demonstration as "a frontal assault on the dignity of commemoration and on the memory of the victims of the Holocaust."
The Buchenwald Memorial Foundation also voiced concern over what it called an attempt "to exploit the memory of the camp for contemporary political purposes," stressing that the site is committed to preserving historical memory and opposing all forms of antisemitism or incitement.

Trump to hike global tariffs to 15% from 10%, 'effective immediately'

President Donald Trump on Saturday said he would increase global tariffs to 15% from 10%, one day after the Supreme Court struck down a broad swath of the president's trade agenda.
In a Truth Social post, Trump said the new tariffs will be "effective immediately." He also warned that additional levies would follow.
"I, as President of the United States of America, will be, effective immediately, raising the 10% Worldwide Tariff on Countries, many of which have been "ripping" the U.S. off for decades, without retribution (until I came along!), to the fully allowed, and legally tested, 15% level," he wrote.
"During the next short number of months, the Trump Administration will determine and issue the new and legally permissible Tariffs," he added.
Trump's announcement claimed that the new tariffs will take effect without delay, but it is unclear if any official documents have been signed detailing the timing. A White House fact sheet issued Friday said the original 10% tariffs would go into effect on Tuesday, Feb. 24, at 12:01 a.m. ET.
The White House did not immediately respond to a CNBC request for clarification.
Trump, who is scheduled to deliver his State of the Union address to Congress on Tuesday, was dealt a blow Friday when the Supreme Court decided in a 6-3 tariff ruling that the president wrongfully invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to implement his levies.
On Friday, Trump responded hours after the ruling with a 10% global tariff that he invoked under Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974. The statute allows the president to impose temporary levies for 150 days. Any extension requires congressional approval.
The president was scathing in his remarks against the Supreme Court decision, calling the ruling "ridiculous, poorly written, and extraordinarily anti-American" in a social media post.
He also attacked Justices Neil Gorsuch and Amy Coney Barrett after they voted with the majority in the ruling.
Congressional Democrats rejoiced following the decision, with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., saying in a statement that the tariffs were "chaotic and illegal." Tariffs and the broader economy are expected to be key issues for the Democrats on the campaign trail for this year's midterm elections in November.
Republicans were more divided on the issue. Some slammed the Supreme Court for its decision, while others argued that Congress has the constitutional authority to implement levies.
On Friday, stocks rallied initially following the Supreme Court decision, before pulling back and then recovering again. Investors expect the ruling could allay tensions between the U.S. and its trading partners, and possibly refund affected companies and reduce inflation.
How the U.S. government will proceed with refunds remains a question. By one estimate, the U.S. government could owe more than $175 billion in refunds to importers following the Supreme Court decision.

FIFA chief’s Board of Peace appearance doesn’t breach political neutrality rules — IOC
Gianni Infantino, who has repeatedly met with Trump, is working on soccer-based ‘sport recovery investment program in Gaza’ that keeps with Olympic mission, says Games’ global body
MILAN, Italy (Reuters) — FIFA president Gianni Infantino’s presence at the inaugural meeting of The Board of Peace this week alongside United States President Donald Trump and other heads of state does not violate any Olympic Charter rules on political neutrality, the International Olympic Committee said on Saturday.
The boss of global soccer’s governing body, who is also an IOC member, took part in Thursday’s meeting of the Board of Peace, which is focusing on reconstruction work in Gaza and aims to rebuild the territory once Hamas disarms.
“The IOC has been in contact with FIFA,” an IOC spokesperson said. “We understand that FIFA is supporting, through football, a comprehensive sport recovery investment program in Gaza, Palestine, by providing sporting infrastructure, education and elite development proposals.”
“This is entirely in keeping with the role of an international sport federation. The IOC, through Olympic Solidarity, which is our development vehicle, has been and continues to support sport development in the region,” the spokesperson said.
The Olympic Charter states that members must always act independently of commercial and political interests. They also cannot accept “from governments, organizations, or other parties, any mandate or instructions liable to interfere with the freedom of their action and vote,” the Charter says.
Trump’s Board of Peace has been controversial. It includes Israel but not Palestinian representatives, and Trump’s suggestion that the Board could eventually address challenges beyond Gaza has stirred anxiety that it could undermine the UN’s role as the main platform for global diplomacy and conflict resolution.
Infantino appeared on stage with several heads of state, sported a red hat with “USA” on the front and the numbers 45-47, for the two non-consecutive presidencies of Trump.
Infantino also displayed the FIFA collaboration agreement with the Board of Peace, which includes building 50 mini-pitches near schools and residential areas in Gaza, five full-size pitches across multiple districts, a state-of-the-art FIFA academy and a new 20,000-seat national stadium.
Trump has met Infantino several times, with the United States set to co-host this summer’s soccer World Cup along with Mexico and Canada.
The US President was also awarded FIFA’s inaugural peace prize in December for his efforts to promote dialogue and de-escalation in some of the world’s biggest hotspots, the soccer body said at the time.
IOC President Kirsty Coventry, elected in 2025, has not yet met Trump. The 2028 Summer Olympics are due to be held in Los Angeles.

Italian broadcaster apologizes after commentator calls to ‘avoid’ Israeli bobsleigh team
RAI Sport’s interim director says on-air remark during Winter Olympics coverage was ‘unacceptable’ and that an internal review has already been launched
Amy Spiro is a reporter and writer with The Times of Israel
Israel’s Olympic bobsleigh team has once again found itself in the center of controversy, following remarks made by an Italian commentator on the RAI public broadcaster during competition on Saturday.
The comments were followed by an immediate apology from RAI’s executives and a promise to fully investigate the incident, less than a week after a similar incident with Swiss commentators garnered intensive media coverage.
In the off-camera comment ahead of Saturday’s four-man bobsleigh event in Cortina, an Italian commentator said: “Let’s avoid crew 21, which is Israeli.” It is not clear if the remark was a “hot mic” comment not meant to air, or if the commentator intended to say it during the live broadcast.
Shortly after the comments aired, Marco Lollobrigida, the interim director of RAI Sport, issued a statement apologizing and promising to investigate the incident.
“The off-air remark that was broadcast before the four-man bobsleigh race at the Milano Cortina 2026 Winter Olympics on RAI 2 contained an unacceptable expression that in no way represents the values of public service broadcasting or of RAI Sport,” said Lollobrigida. “On behalf of the directorate, I extend sincere apologies to the Israeli athletes, the delegation, and all viewers. Immediate internal reviews have been launched to determine responsibility. Sport must unite, not divide.”
Lollobrigida only just took over the role, after the previous RAI Sport director, Paolo Petrecca, resigned on Thursday following his gaffe-ridden commentary of the Olympic opening ceremony, in which he misidentified a number of public figures and made racially insensitive comments about several athletes.
Giampaolo Rossi, the managing director of RAI, also issued an apology on Saturday, saying that the incident during the bobsleigh commentary runs “contrary to the principles of impartiality, respect and inclusion that must characterize public service broadcasting,” adding that a probe will be “aimed at initiating disciplinary proceedings.”
Last week, during the Israel team’s run in the two-man bobsleigh event, a Swiss commentator came under fire after he used the entirety of the team’s run to berate captain AJ Edelman’s support of Zionism and Israel, and question if he should have been allowed to compete at the Olympics at all.
Swiss broadcaster RTS later pulled the clip from its digital platforms, saying that while the commentary was “factual,” its “length” was not appropriate for a sporting event.
On Wednesday, the Olympic Committee of Israel demanded RTS issue an apology and consider removing the commentator, Stefan Renna, from future broadcasts.
In response to a request for comment from The Times of Israel, a spokesperson for RTS said that “in the interest of journalistic rigor, we will clarify with our editorial teams the appropriate format for sports commentary. We regret that this episode may have caused offense.”
Ahead of Saturday’s runs, Edelman wrote on X: “In case there are any Swiss commentators waiting for their opportunity today — anything you quote me as saying about Zionism or how just Israel is, I’m proud I said. Thank you for spreading the message.”
The Winter Olympics will wrap up on Sunday with only a few events left to be contested, including the decisive heats in the four-man bobsleigh event.
Following Saturday’s first two heats, Israel is in 24th place out of the 27 teams, after three of them crashed mid-course and did not finish the race. Only the top 20 teams will advance to the fourth heat.
Israeli skier Barnabas Szollos will represent Israel as its flag-bearer during Sunday night’s closing ceremony, accompanied by the bobsleigh team’s athletes.

Palestinian Berlinale awardee to German government: ‘You are partners in the genocide’
Film festival’s closing ceremony continues to be marred by protests over jury president’s refusal to condemn Israel, after weeklong event was beset by ‘stormy seas’ of Gaza war
“Yellow Letters,” directed by German filmmaker Ilker Catak, won the Berlin Film Festival’s Golden Bear for best film Saturday, at a ceremony reflecting the controversy over Gaza that has dogged this year’s edition.
Some award winners spoke out in favor of the Palestinian cause and accused Israel of “genocide,” pushing back after jury president Wim Wenders had sparked outrage earlier by trying to steer the festival away from the issue.
Festival director Tricia Tuttle acknowledged Saturday that this year’s edition had been “emotionally charged” after days of sometimes acrimonious debate on how far filmmaking should intervene in politics.
Catak’s film tells the story of a Turkish director and his actor wife, suddenly barred from working because of their political opinions.
Wenders called the film “a terrifying premonition, a look into the near future that could possibly happen in our countries as well.”
While set in Turkey, the film was shot in Germany, an artistic choice to make the point that threats to liberty are universal.
The runner-up Silver Bear Grand Jury Prize went to “Salvation” by Emin Alper, who in his speech expressed solidarity with several high-profile opposition figures in prison in Turkey, including jailed Istanbul mayor Ekrem Imamoglu.
Alper’s film, inspired by a true story, shows the consequences of a feud over land between two clans in a remote mountain village.
He took the opportunity to speak up for “the people of Iran suffering under tyranny” and “Kurds in Rojava and the Middle East struggling for their rights for almost a century — you are not alone.”
Alper also spoke of “the Palestinians in Gaza living and dying under the most terrible conditions.”
‘Partners in genocide’
Alper was not the only award-winner to express support for the Palestinians.
Syrian-Palestinian director Abdullah Al-Khatib won Best First Feature Award for “Chronicles From the Siege.”
He accepted the award with a keffiyeh draped over his shoulder and gave an impassioned speech in which he addressed the German government by claiming: “You are partners in the genocide in Gaza by Israel.”
He received cheers for his words but also prompted some heckling, reflecting the tension over Gaza that has often overshadowed this year’s event.
Speaking at a press conference at the beginning of the festival last week, Wenders answered a question about the German government’s support for Israel by saying: “We cannot really enter the field of politics.”
At the same press conference, he had said that films had the power to “change the world” but in a different way from politics.
But his comments in response to the question on Israel prompted a storm of outrage.
Award-winning Indian novelist Arundhati Roy, who had been due to present a restored version of a 1989 film she wrote, pulled out of the event, branding Wenders’ words “unconscionable” and “jaw-dropping.”
On Tuesday, an open letter signed by dozens of film industry figures, including actors Javier Bardem and Tilda Swinton and director Adam McKay, condemned the Berlin festival’s “silence on the genocide of Palestinians” and accused it of being involved in “censoring” artists who oppose Israel’s war against Hamas, which was sparked by the Palestinian terror group’s onslaught of October 7, 2023.
Israel bitterly denies allegations of genocide. It has said it seeks to minimize civilian fatalities and stresses that Hamas uses Gaza’s civilians as human shields, fighting from civilian areas, including homes, hospitals, schools and mosques.
Tuttle, in her second year at the helm of the Berlinale, has firmly rejected the accusations, describing some of the claims in the letter as “misinformation” and “inaccurate.”
Speaking on Saturday at the awards ceremony for prizes from the festival’s Independent Juries, Tuttle described the past 10 days as “stormy seas.”
Wenders addressed the controversy on Saturday.
“The language of cinema is empathetic. The language of social media is effective,” he said.
Addressing political activists, he said: “All of us applaud you. You do necessary and courageous work.”
“But does it need to be in competition with us? Do our languages need to clash?” he asked.
Meanwhile, Mexican director Fernando Eimbcke, whose film “Moscas” (Flies) was in official competition, used the occasion to protest civilian deaths in Gaza as well as US President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown.
“More than 17,000 kids have been killed in Gaza in the last two years,” he said, citing Hamas health ministry data, which cannot be verified and does not differentiate between combatants and civilians.
“I should raise my voice and I ask all the governments and organizations to raise their voices too,” he said.
He also referenced the arrest of a five-year-old Ecuadorian boy by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), which sparked widespread outrage.
“ICE should stop persecuting and terrifying kids like Liam Conejo Ramos — ICE out!” Eimbcke said.
‘Queen at Sea’
Other award winners on Saturday included German actress Sandra Hueller, who received the Silver Bear for Best Performance for her title role in Markus Schleinzer’s “Rose.”
The black-and-white drama tells the story of a woman passing herself off as a man in rural 17th-century Germany to escape the constraints of patriarchy.
“Queen at Sea” by American director Lance Hammer, which stars Juliette Binoche as a woman caring for her mother with dementia, picked up two awards.
The film portrays the devastation Alzheimer’s disease inflicts on a patient’s loved ones.
Tom Courtenay, 88, and 79-year-old Anna Calder-Marshall, who plays the ailing mother in the film, shared the Silver Bear for Best Supporting Performance.
The film also picked up the Silver Bear Jury Prize, considered the third most prestigious award.
Grant Gee picked up the Best Director award for “Everybody Digs Bill Evans,” his black-and-white biopic of the legendary jazz pianist.

Airlines canceled more than 5,000 flights through Monday and waived cancellation and change fees for airports spanning Virginia to Maine ahead of another massive winter storm on the East Coast, set to once again put carriers to the test at the tail-end of winter break.
The National Weather Service issued a blizzard warning for much of New Jersey, the New York City area, and parts of Maryland, Connecticut, Rhode Island and Massachusetts. The storm could dump more than 2 feet of snow in some areas as well as bring wind gusts of more than 40 miles per hour. The NWS warned that travel will be trecherous with low visibility.
About two-thirds of the flights to New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport and LaGuardia Airport were canceled on Sunday as were around 40% of the departures, according to FlightAware. Disruptions are set to worsen on Monday with snow continuining to fall. More than 70% of Monday departures were canceled at Boston Logan International Airport.
Airlines routinely cancel flights ahead of major storms to avoid having aircraft and crews out of place and to make it easier to restart operations after the storm passes.
Delta Air Lines, American Airlines, JetBlue Airways, United Airlines and Spirit Airlines waived fees and fare differences for passengers if they can travel as late as Feb. 26. Southwest Airlines said customers are eligible for a change without paying a difference in fare if they can rebook to fly or fly standby within two weeks.
Winter Storm Fern in January, followed by bitter cold, caused mass travel disruptions across a large swath of the U.S.
American Airlines had struggled to recover, drawing harsh criticism from flight crews, some of whom were stranded and had to sleep at airports, heightening tension between frontline employees and the company's CEO, Robert Isom.
The storm cost American between $150 million and $200 million in revenue, the carrier said last month on an earnings call.

The new space race: how satellites are reshaping Germany's defence

Germany is rearming — and not only on Earth. Last year, Defence Minister Boris Pistorius earmarked around €35 billion for space capabilities. Inspector Thomas Daum explains why space has become a new battlefield.
As the world's security landscape changes, space is no longer seen simply as a domain for research and commerce, but also as a central pillar of Germany's national security and military deterrence.
According to the Inspector of Cyber and Information Domain of the German Armed Forces, Vice Admiral Dr Thomas Daum, space has now become a battlefield in its own right.
The Bundeswehr currently operates between eight and ten satellites, primarily for reconnaissance – including the SAR-Lupe and SARah systems – as well as for communications. This fleet is now considered outdated, though.
Speaking to Euronews at the Munich Security Conference, Daum said satellites are of "considerable importance for the functioning of our systems on the ground" and extend far beyond purely military use. "If satellites fail, you wouldn't be able to withdraw cash," he said. There is a risk that "our systems in space could be attacked".
Against that backdrop, a "day without space" – in other words, a large-scale satellite failure – would, he warned, "essentially be a disaster". Such an attack would deliberately disable satellites, with immediate consequences on the ground, severely disrupting critical infrastructure and key services.
Deterrence in orbit
As in other areas of defence, Berlin's answer is deterrence. Last September, Defence Minister Boris Pistorius pledged roughly €35 billion by 2030, part of it earmarked for a space-based reconnaissance capability known as "SPOCK", which the Bundeswehr has been using since the start of the year.
The system, built by the Finnish firm Iceye in partnership with Germany's Rheinmetall, relies on a network of radar satellites using synthetic aperture radar (SAR). Unlike optical satellites, they can capture images of the Earth's surface in all weather and around the clock – tracking movements and changes on the ground regardless of cloud cover or darkness.
For Daum, deterrence in space follows the same logic as on land, at sea or in the air: capability signals intent. If you show you can operate – and interfere – in orbit, you signal that an adversary's systems are not beyond reach.
That does not necessarily mean blowing satellites out of the sky. In practice, so-called non-kinetic measures are often more relevant. Optical reconnaissance satellites, for instance, can be temporarily "blinded" from the ground by dazzling their sensors. These satellites rely on high-resolution cameras or telescopes; disrupt the sensor, and the satellite cannot see.
Another method is jamming – transmitting interference signals to disrupt communications satellites. The hardware remains intact, but its usefulness is degraded. "The impact is felt on the ground," Daum said. "If a reconnaissance satellite can't track the movement of your forces, you gain a tactical advantage."
Sustainability - even in space
There are political reasons, too, why these capabilities are deliberately designed to avoid causing physical destruction. Germany signed up to the US-led Artemis Accords in 2023, committing itself to the principle of not creating space debris.
In practical terms, that means an adversary's satellite cannot simply be shot down. The emphasis instead is on reversible measures – limiting or disrupting its use without leaving fragments in orbit. For now, that remains the official line.
But, according to Daum, there are political voices beginning to question the so-called "zero debris" principle. "Just because we have the capability to destroy a system doesn't mean we would use it," he told Euronews.
At the same time, he argues, demonstrating that capability sends a message. Signalling that "we possess the same capabilities as our adversaries" feeds into the logic of deterrence by punishment – the idea that an opponent must factor in the risk of retaliation.
"That can of course have a deterrent effect," Daum said. "But it would ultimately require an adjustment of our space security strategy – and that is a political decision."
A network of thousands of small satellites
Beyond reconnaissance, secure and resilient communications are just as critical – in peacetime as well as during crises. The Bundeswehr is heavily dependent on satellite communications. For long-distance links, it has so far relied largely on geostationary satellites, either its own or leased capacity.
If, for example, a German warship deploys from Europe to Africa, communications are routed through this infrastructure, Daum explained. The project known as "SATCOMBw Stage 4" represents the largest single space programme in the Bundeswehr's history. Its aim is to connect tanks, ships, aircraft and troops worldwide via satellite communications – and, in particular, to secure operations on NATO's eastern flank, including the permanently stationed German brigade in Lithuania.
Yet SATCOMBw remains a conventional system built around a small number of large satellites. It is not comparable to constellations such as Starlink, which are made up of thousands of small, interconnected satellites in low Earth orbit. Rather than relying on a handful of high-value assets, Starlink operates a dense network of smaller units that communicate with one another.
This creates far more access points and significantly increases resilience and flexibility. The strategic value of such systems has become especially clear in the war in Ukraine. Both Russia and Ukraine have, to varying degrees, relied on the satellite network operated by SpaceX in recent years – particularly for coordinating and operating drones.
Officially, Starlink services were not authorised for use in Russia. Nevertheless, from 2023 onwards, Starlink terminals began appearing with Russian units, reportedly entering the country via intermediaries in the Gulf or Central Asia.
Over the past two weeks, SpaceX has moved to block Russian forces from accessing Starlink services. Ukraine has said the restrictions have "significantly impaired" Russian operations. Moscow denies this, insisting there has been no impact on its drone warfare capabilities.

Iran university students hold anti-regime rallies at campuses in Tehran, Mashhad
Head of top Tehran engineering school calls for criminals to be ‘dealt with’ after Basij officers reportedly clash with students, who greet them with calls of ‘death’ to Khamenei
Iranian students chanted anti-government slogans at rallies for people killed in the regime’s bloody crackdown on protesters last month, local and diaspora media reported Saturday, as groups opposed to the clerical leadership faced off with its supporters and security forces.
Videos geolocated by AFP to Tehran’s top engineering university showed fights breaking out in a crowd as people shouted “bi sharaf,” or “disgraceful” in Farsi.
Footage posted by the Persian-language dissident TV channel Iran International, which is based outside the country, also showed a large crowd chanting anti-government slogans at Sharif University of Technology.
According to Iran International, protesters clashed with members of the regime’s Basij paramilitary force, chanting “death” to Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and “long live the king,” referring to the monarchy toppled in Iran’s 1979 Islamic Revolution.
Local news outlet Fars said that what was supposed to be a “silent and peaceful sit-in” of students killed last month was disrupted by people chanting anti-regime slogans. A video posted by Fars showed a group chanting and waving Iranian flags facing off with a crowd wearing masks and being held back by men in suits. Both groups were holding what appeared to be memorial photographs.
Iran International quoted Sharif University President Masoud Tajrishi calling for perpetrators of “illegal acts” to be “dealt with.”

“The enemy wants the university to become virtual, but we will not allow it,” Tajrishi was quoted as saying. “We want to show that we can manage the university. Anyone who carries out illegal acts at the university must be dealt with.”
Meanwhile, students at Tehran’s Beheshti University held a sit-in in solidarity with the people slain or imprisoned during the regime’s protest crackdown, according to a statement by the student union cited by Iran International.
And in the city’s Amirkabir University of Technology, demonstrators yelled “long live the king,” according to footage published by the outlet, which cited the student union later saying that security forces blocked the school’s exit and detained students.

— ايران اينترنشنال (@IranIntl) February 21, 2026
Other footage published by Iran International showed students at Mashhad University of Medical Sciences chanting “freedom.”
Iranians reprised their protest slogans this week to mark 40 days — the traditional Shiite mourning period — since the killing of thousands of protesters in a crackdown that peaked on January 8 and 9.
The unrest first broke out in December over prolonged financial strain, but exploded into mass anti-government demonstrations.

The death toll from the protests cannot be verified.
The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) has recorded more than 7,000 killings in the crackdown, the vast majority protesters, though the toll may be far higher.
Iran International itself has put the death toll at over 36,000.
Iranian authorities, who have undercounted deaths in previous rounds of unrest suppressed by the regime, acknowledge more than 3,000 deaths, but say the violence was caused by “terrorist acts” fueled by Iran’s enemies.
The demonstrations came as Iran’s authorities are under pressure to make a deal on the country’s nuclear program with the United States, which has amassed forces within striking distance.
US President Donald Trump has repeatedly threatened military action against Iran, first over its protest crackdown last month and more recently over its failure to rein in its nuclear program.
“World powers are lining up to force us to bow our heads… but we will not bow our heads despite all the problems that they are creating for us,” Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian declared Saturday in a speech carried live by state TV.

Five key takeaways from the Supreme Court's landmark decision against Trump's tariffs
Unknown

14:44:42 UTC
23:44:42 KST

The Supreme Court's decision Friday to throw out a large number of tariffs that President Donald Trump imposed on imports was widely expected. What's far less certain is the longer-run impacts as the economy and markets again adjust to a changed landscape.
Trump and other White House officials have promised to employ other authorities to implement the tariffs, with the president already announcing a 10% levy under a section of the Trade Act of 1974.
However, other questions remain: What will be the impact on prices? Will companies that paid the tariffs covered in the high court's decision seek refunds? How will the Federal Reserve react?
Here are five takeaways from the ruling and the associated fallout.
1. The economic impact
In a word, the macro reverberations are expected to be limited, especially pending Trump's next moves and what happens with the refunds issue.
RSM chief economist Joseph Brusuelas characterized the likely economic fallout as "narrow," though there are "enormous potential winners from this ruling," particularly in the tariff-sensitive retail and manufacturing sectors.
Growth slowed substantially in the fourth quarter, with GDP accelerating at just a 1.4% annualized rate. But that was largely due to the government shutdown, with faster growth likely in the first quarter of 2026.
"Fiscal conditions already point to a sizable positive impulse in 2026, driven by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act and an easing monetary policy backdrop," said Jason Pride, chief of investment strategy and research at Glenmede. "The tariff ruling may incrementally enhance this stimulus, reinforcing expectations for above-trend economic growth."
Pride warned that there could be a temporary drag on exports if companies rush to import products ahead of Trump's next tariff moves, as they did in early 2025.
2. Some help for inflation
The court decision came the same day that the Commerce Department reported core inflation ran at a 3% annual rate in December, according to the Fed's primary forecasting gauge. Central bank officials have estimated that tariffs are worth about half a percentage point to inflation, an impact that will be only temporary at least as it figures into the way inflation is calculated.
So losing the tariffs reduces, for now, a potential economic headwind that could figure into the Fed's decisions on interest rates this year.
Interestingly, markets on Friday rolled back their bets on rate cuts a bit, now placing a higher likelihood of the next reduction coming in July rather than June, as previously indicated, according to CME Group data. Traders still largely expect two cuts this year, with about 40% odds of a third — little changed from before the decision.
"We think that the Supreme Court's decision to strike down IEEPA tariffs will not have major macro implications for the U.S. economy or the Fed," Evercore ISI analysts said in a note.
3. Relief for the market
For much of the past year, Trump's more severe tariff declarations have periodically sent financial markets reeling — then spinning back higher after he ultimately backed off many of the most aggressive measures.
True to form, stocks rallied Friday, glossing over worries about the pace of growth and inflation, and raising hopes for corporate earnings. Treasury yields drifted higher but the move was contained as investors debated the merits of growth versus inflation.
"More broadly, the decision underscores a shift toward slower, more procedurally constrained trade policy, reducing headline volatility, but increasing the importance of fiscal mechanics and supply considerations for fixed‑income markets," said Dan Siluk, head of global short duration and liquidity and portfolio manager at Janus Henderson.
4. What about those refunds?
Wall Street reaction was mixed on the prospect for tariff refunds.
Morgan Stanley estimated that the U.S. probably would pay back about $85 billion to affected parties. RSM's Brusuelas pegged the number at between $100 billion and $130 billion, while analyst Ed Mills at Raymond James put the outlay still higher, at about $175 billion, in line with a University of Pennsylvania model.
One question is process. The Supreme Court's decision did not address the issue specifically, likely leaving it to lower jurisdictions. Justice Brett Kavanaugh noted the likelihood of a "mess" sorting out the issue. Brian Gardner, chief Washington policy strategist at Stifel, speculated that refunds won't happen retroactively at all after the issue makes its way through lower courts.
"We remain skeptical that the government will refund/pay a large sum, but, again, this issue remains unresolved," Gardner said in a note.
5. What now?
The path from here will be complicated, but Trump in a news conference Friday indicated no willingness to back down in the effort to impose tariffs, which he has repeatedly called "the most beautiful word" in the dictionary.
One important point is that it's not as if tariffs are going away.
Trump used the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to cover about 60% of the tariffs he has implemented, so the rest stand. From there, the administration can cite a number of provisions in the trade law to levy the duties.
However, he will need to go to Congress for approval on many of them, and there are also time limits attached to some of those measures.
"Given Trump's public ire against previous court rulings and tariff criticisms, we would not be surprised to see a meaningful tariff escalation/response from the White House sooner rather than later," wrote Chris Krueger, managing director at TD Cowen Washington Research Group. Krueger expects the 2026 tariff effort to be "all gas, some [temporary[ brakes ... stay tuned."

US court okays Louisiana law requiring Ten Commandments to appear in classrooms
US state’s Republican governor hails ‘comeback’ of ‘common sense’ after appeals court lifts earlier block on bill, rejecting plaintiffs’ concerns about government-endorsed religion
AP — A US appeals court has cleared the way for a Louisiana law requiring poster-sized displays of the Ten Commandments in public school classrooms to take effect.
The 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals voted 12-6 to lift a block that a lower court first placed on the law in 2024. In the opinion released Friday, the court said it was too early to make a judgment call on the constitutionality of the law.
That’s partly because it’s not yet clear how prominently schools may display the religious text, if teachers will refer to the Ten Commandments during classes or if other texts like the Mayflower Compact or the Declaration of Independence will also be displayed, the majority opinion said.
Without those sorts of details, the panel decided it did not have enough information to weigh any First Amendment issues that might arise from the law. In other words, there aren’t enough facts available to “permit judicial judgment rather than speculation,” the majority wrote in the opinion.
In a concurring opinion, Circuit Judge James Ho, an appointee of Republican US President Donald Trump, wrote that the law “is not just constitutional — it affirms our nation’s highest and most noble traditions.”
The six judges who voted against the decision wrote a series of dissents, with some arguing that the law exposes children to government-endorsed religion in a place where they are required to be, presenting a clear constitutional burden.
Circuit Judge James L. Dennis, an appointee of Democratic US president Bill Clinton, wrote that the law “is precisely the kind of establishment the Framers anticipated and sought to prevent.”
The ruling is the result of the court’s choice to rehear the case with all judges present after three of them ruled in June that the Louisiana law was unconstitutional.
The reversal comes from one of the nation’s most conservative appeals courts, and one that’s known for propelling Republican policies to a similarly conservative US Supreme Court.
Republican Governor Jeff Landry celebrated the ruling Friday, declaring, “Common sense is making a comeback!”
The ACLU of Louisiana, one of several groups representing plaintiffs, pledged to explore all legal pathways to continue fighting the law.
Arkansas has a similar law that has been challenged in federal court. And a Texas law took effect on September 1, marking the widest-reaching attempt in the nation to hang the Ten Commandments in public schools.
Some Texas school districts were barred from posting them after federal judges issued injunctions in two cases challenging the law, but they have already gone up in many classrooms across the state as districts paid to have the posters printed themselves or accepted donations.
The laws are among pushes by Republicans, including Trump, to incorporate religion into public school classrooms. Critics say it violates the separation of church and state, while backers say the Ten Commandments are historical and part of the foundation of US law.
Joseph Davis, an attorney representing Louisiana in the case, applauded the court for upholding America’s “time-honored tradition of recognizing faith in the public square.”
Families from a variety of religious backgrounds, including Christianity, Judaism and Hinduism, have challenged the laws, as have clergy members and nonreligious families.
The Freedom From Religion Foundation, another group involved in the challenge, called the ruling “extremely disappointing” and said the law will force families “into a game of constitutional whack-a-mole” where they will have to separately challenge each school district’s displays.
Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill said after the ruling that she had sent schools several correct examples of the required poster.
In 1980, the Supreme Court ruled that a similar Kentucky law violated the Establishment Clause of the US Constitution, which says Congress can “make no law respecting an establishment of religion.” The court found that the law had no secular purpose but served a plainly religious purpose.
And in 2005, the Supreme Court held that such displays in a pair of Kentucky courthouses violated the Constitution. At the same time, the court upheld a Ten Commandments marker on the grounds of the Texas state Capitol in Austin.

The car went underwater after hitting a patch of thin ice. Seven Chinese tourists, including a couple with a 14-year-old boy, have died.
8 people died on Lake Baikal after a car with Chinese tourists fell through the ice near Olkhon Island.
According to local media, the UAZ car was travelling on ice outside an official ice crossing. In the area of movement there was a crack and an area with thin ice, as a result of which the car fell through and went under water to a depth of about 18 metres.
Only one tourist managed to get out, he has already given evidence to investigators. The driver and seven tourists died, including a couple with a 14-year-old child.
Divers are working at the scene of the tragedy. It is reported that the bodies of all victims have been localised.
A criminal case has been opened over the incident under the article on the provision of services that do not meet safety requirements and caused the death of people.
In winter Baikal becomes a popular tourist destination: excursions and car routes are organised on the ice. However, ice thickness can change dramatically due to wind, currents and temperature differences, as well as due to increasingly warm winters.

Hezbollah says Israeli strikes on eastern Lebanon on Friday have killed eight of its members

Two Hezbollah have confirmed to the Associated Press that eight of their members, including local-level officials, were killed in Friday’s Israeli attacks on the eastern Baalbek region. The IDF says the strikes eliminated members planning operations against Israel.
Hezbollah says Israeli airstrikes on Lebanon late on Friday have killed eight of their members, including several local officials. The strikes targeted an area near the village of Rayak in the northeast of the country.
The attack, which targeted a residential building, destroyed the top floor of a three-storey complex.
A Hezbollah official, speaking to the Associated Press on condition of anonymity, said that three of the dead were local commanders and identified them as Ali al-Moussawi, Mohammed al-Moussawi and Hussein Yaghi.
Israel also confirmed on Saturday that its attacks have “eliminated” Hezbollah members, in an attack which it said targeted “command centres” in the Baalbek area.
In a post on X, the Israeli Defence Forces said the targeted members were “operating to accelerate readiness and force build-up processes, while planning fire attacks toward Israel and advancing terror attack”.
“Their actions constituting a violation of the understandings between Israel and Lebanon,” continued the IDF.
Yaghi was the son of prominent Hezbollah official and one of its founders, Mohammed Yaghi, who died in 2023. Mohammed Yaghi was also a close aide to the late Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, who was killed in an Israeli airstrike in September 2024.
Lebanon’s Health Ministry said Saturday that Israeli strikes on eastern Lebanon killed 10 people, including three children, and wounded two dozen others.
A doctor at the nearby Rayak Hospital corroborated the official account, saying they had received the bodies of 10 people and were treating 21 people who had sustained injuries.
The doctor said that two of those killed in the strikes – which he says took place shortly after sunset on Friday – were non-Lebanese; a Syrian man and an Ethiopian woman.
He also added that eight of those wounded were also foreign nationals, including five Syrians and three Ethiopians.
The death toll from Friday’s strikes was unusually high and comes at a moment of intensified tensions in the region as the United States has threatened to strike Iran — a backer of both Hezbollah and Hamas — if negotiations over Tehran’s nuclear program fail to produce a deal.
Israeli strikes on Lebanon have occurred almost daily despite a ceasefire being in effect since November 2024.
The deal, brokered by former US President Joe Biden, aimed to establish a truce after more than a year of hostilities and cross-border exchanges between Hezbollah and Israel.
Hezbollah started the attacks after Israel launched its offensive on Gaza following a Hamas-led operation in southern Israel on 7 October, 2023. Israel responded with regular strikes and shelling.
Tensions escalated from a low-scale conflict to a full-scale war in September 2024. The existing truce reduced the attacks, but hasn’t fully stopped them.
Israel has accused Hezbollah of trying to rebuild and says its attacks are aimed at preventing the group’s rearmament, and exclusively target their members and infrastructure. The Lebanese government says dozens of civilians have been killed in strikes since the ceasefire.

Parliamentary election campaings begin in Hungary

Candidates and their supporting organisations have two weeks to collect the necessary signatures of support.
The campaign period for the April parliamentary elections in Hungary began this weekend. Posters can now be put up, campaigning is free and candidates are now collecting their recommendation forms from local election offices.
Individual candidates must collect at least 500 valid signatures to be on the ballot paper. They must be registered by 6 March at the latest, and the nomination forms must also be delivered to the electoral offices by that date. This gives candidates and their supporting parties two weeks to collect signatures.
Voters who wish to vote for a national list on 12 April can also submit their nominations as of now. Political formations and national minority self-governments have had the opportunity to register their candidacy and register as nominating organisations with the National Election Committee since 3 February.
According to the Electoral Procedures Act, campaigning is any activity that is likely to influence or attempt to influence the will of the electorate. This could be posters, direct canvassing of voters, political advertising and political canvassing, and electoral meetings.
However, the activities of electoral bodies, personal communication between citizens as individuals, and the activities of the Constitutional Court, local governments and other state bodies in the course of their statutory duties are not considered electoral campaigns.
A fierce campaign is expected
Opinion polls show that we are facing the closest election in the last 20 years, and therefore probably the most intense campaign period. Firms close to the government regularly measure Fidesz's lead, with the Nézőpont Institute, for example, reporting a week ago that the governing party would get 46% and Tisza 40% if the elections were held now.
Independent pollsters, on the other hand, have a stable lead for Tisza. According to a survey conducted by the 21 Research Centre two weeks ago, Tisza leads Fidesz by 7 percentage points among the total population, 10 percentage points among those who can vote for a party and 16 percentage points among those who are sure voters. The Our Country, the Democratic Coalition and possibly the Hungarian Two-Tailed Dog Party still have a chance of entering parliament.
Very difficult to predict the outcome
The results of the opinion polls should be watched with caution for the time being, not only because there is obviously a huge variance and electoral preferences could change a lot in the remaining 50 days, but because it also important to see how the parties' popularity will be converted into votes on 12 April (i.e. which party can mobilise its voters) and how the votes will translate into parliamentary seats.
The latter will be decided by the Hungarian electoral system. Under the current system, experts say that the favourable constituency design gives Fidesz 2-3% of the list result, so even in the most extreme case, Tisza Party may get more votes but Fidesz may win more parliamentary seats and form a government. In addition, the polls do not include votes from beyond the borders, which will almost certainly improve the result of the current governing party.
Both Viktor Orbán and Péter Magyar touring the country
Election campaigning by the major parties has already started well ahead of the 50-day campaign period. Fidesz candidates and popular politicians are appearing at events, János Lázár is holding more and more Lázár info sessions, and Prime Minister Viktor Orbán is taking to the stage at a weekend rally and appearing at unannounced venues during the week, usually in front of a limited audience and behind closed doors. The rallies are organised by the Digital Citizens' Circles, a Fidesz initiative, and are called anti-war rallies. This weekend the prime minister is appearing in Békéscsaba.
The pre-election rush is also underway at Tisza. On Monday, Péter Magyar embarked on a 55-day "It's now or never" tour of the country, with the Tisza Party president holding speeches at pre-announced, open-to-the-public venues across the country in the coming weeks. On Friday, it was also revealed that he will be the Tisza Party's list leader and candidate for prime minister, having been unanimously nominated by the party's leadership and 106 candidates for the post. The Tisza Party will hold a campaign launch event in Budapest on Saturday, followed by the continuation of Péter Magyar's campaign in Kaszaper, Mako and Szeged on Monday.
A lot of misleading information on the internet
The prominent role of artificial intelligence-generated content is perhaps the biggest novelty of this year's campaign compared to previous ones. In recent months, a number of AI videos have appeared on pro-government social media sites and in online advertisements. The main character of the videos is usually Péter Magyar, and the plot is that the opposition politician is proving one of the claims made about him by government officials. Many of the posters on the streets are also based on a similar method.
The computer-generated videos sometimes appear on the prime minister's Facebook page and on official Fidesz platforms. A few days ago, for example, a video (source in Hungarian), posted on the Fidesz Facebook page, of a Hungarian girl crying for her father, who is shot in the head, caused a huge stir. The message of the video, which now has more than half a million views, is that anyone who doesn't vote for Fidesz is risking war.
Similar content is not only used by the government side. A few days ago, an AI campaign (source in Hungarian) was launched on the Facebook page of Ellenszél, a media outlet close to the Democratic Coalition, in support of one of DK's main promises (to disenfranchise Hungarians living outside the country). The videos, which have hundreds of thousands of views, show a Hungarian from outside the country declaring that he will vote for Fidesz and that he doesn't care what happens in Hungary because he doesn't live there - and then laughing.
The campaign, which Political Capital has highlighted (source in Hungarian), has sparked a furore online, with hundreds of thousands of views of each video and hateful comments suggesting that many people believed they were watching real people. Furthermore, when viewed on a computer, there is no warning that the video is artificially produced, and even on a smartphone there is only a small caption warning that it is. We expect to see a lot more of this fake content on the internet during the campaign.

Guns, fashionable clothes and death threats: How gangs in Haiti ensnare children
A 16-year-old Haitian boy has been talking about how he was lured into working for a criminal gang but then threatened with death when he said he would not fight against the police.
Joseph is one of an increasing number of children who are joining gangs in Haiti, a Caribbean island nation which is experiencing overlapping security, humanitarian and governance crises.
Some 1.4 million people have been forced to flee their homes because of gang violence and thousands more have died.
More robust protection measures for children in gang-affected communities are being highlighted in a new report released by the UN in Haiti.
Read Joseph’s account of gang life:
“I grew up in a poor neighbourhood where gangs controlled everything. I saw armed men in the streets all the time. Some were well-dressed, had nice cars, and were surrounded by women. They were the ones who made the rules in our neighbourhood.
For us children, it was normal. We didn’t have many opportunities to play sports or have fun, and there really wasn’t any hope for the future.
One day, towards the end of August 2024, I was hanging out with a friend and he told me that he was part of a gang. He talked to me about all the positive things the gang gave him, like money and the feeling of being important. He told me I should join them too. I hesitated because I knew it was dangerous, but I decided to give it a try.
Attacking the police
Shortly after I joined, a gang member gave me a radio and asked me to monitor the police and inform the gang of their movements. Then the gang leader gave me a firearm.
There were rumours of a major police operation, and I was told that I would have to fight the police. I was afraid, because I did not want to be killed. I told the gang leader that I wanted to go home. He became very angry and struck me with the weapon. He hit me repeatedly until he broke my hand. He told me that if I tried to leave, he would kill me.
Even though I was very afraid to confront the police, I managed to escape shortly afterwards. Someone in my community told me about an organization that could help me get medical care and support. I contacted them in September 2024 and, since then, they have been helping me through counselling and support to cope with everything I went through.”

From April, several previously underserved parts of Sofia are set to gain direct links to the metro through more than 40 kilometers of new and reorganized bus routes. Reports submitted by Deputy Mayor for Transport Viktor Chaushev to the Sofia Municipal Council, scheduled for discussion on February 26, outline the expansion.
For the first time, the residential areas of Kosanin Dol, Lozen Park, Gorna Banya and the zone around Naroden Gero Street will be incorporated into the city’s regular public transport network. The objective is to provide residents with easier access to metro stations, commercial sites, schools and administrative services, while reducing reliance on private vehicles and easing congestion in heavily trafficked districts. Mayor Vasil Terziev stated that despite financial constraints and longstanding management challenges in transport companies, the municipality is continuing to broaden coverage and upgrade services.
In the Pancharevo region and the southeastern outskirts, two new feeder lines are planned. Bus No. 180 will run between Business Park metro station and the Kosanin Dol bus station, while No. 182 will connect Business Park metro station with the village of German and Lozen Park residential area. These additions will integrate Kosanin Dol’s villa zone and Lozen Park into the network and establish a direct link to the first metro line. Suburban routes currently numbered 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 are to be renumbered within the 181–188 range, creating a clearer structure for lines serving the Pancharevo direction.
Further measures target southern and southwestern Sofia. A new line No. 65 will operate between Krasno Selo metro station and Boyanska Tsarkva, ensuring a direct connection between the Gardova Glava area and metro line M3. Another new route, No. 806, will link Gorna Banya metro station with the Gorna Banya bus station, covering territory that previously lacked public transport access.
Changes also affect existing services. Line No. 805 will be discontinued and replaced by No. 95, which will connect Studentski Grad with Manastirski Livadi – West via the newly developed section of Todor Kableshkov Boulevard and its dedicated bus lane. Line No. 107 will adopt a revised route with two-way traffic along Naroden Gero Street and improved interchange with trams on Tsar Boris III Boulevard. Route No. 801 will be optimized to enhance access to schools and healthcare facilities in Manastirski Livadi, Buxton and Gotse Delchev, while No. 804 will be extended to Knyazhevo bus station to facilitate transfers to tram lines 5 and 11.
Collectively, the proposals expand public transport into areas previously without service and strengthen links to the Business Park, Krasno Selo and Gorna Banya metro stations, as well as to key tram corridors. Plans also include installing a fast-charging station for electric buses, modernizing stop information systems and refining traffic organization in strategic locations. According to Chaushev, the initiative aims to deliver faster, more dependable and more accessible urban mobility, offering residents a practical alternative to car travel.

Search efforts for the three fishermen who went missing off the coast near Sozopol are set to resume, weather permitting, after their vessel was located on the seabed. The boat, reported overdue on Wednesday, was found roughly five kilometers offshore between Sozopol and Primorsko, at a depth of around 38 to 40 meters. An initial underwater inspection did not reveal any sign of the crew.

The operation involved remotely operated underwater vehicles and naval diving specialists, who confirmed the wreck’s position. However, strong currents and extremely poor visibility limited the scope of the examination, allowing only a partial survey of the site. The Navy indicated that further work will depend on improved hydrometeorological conditions, with forecasts suggesting a possible window after Monday. An additional diving team and specialized equipment from Varna were deployed to the Burgas naval base in anticipation of deteriorating weather, and an early-morning attempt to continue the inspection was subsequently halted.
The missing men have been identified as 58-year-old captain Hristo Spasov, his 25-year-old son and another crew member. According to reports, a fishing vessel equipped with sonar first detected the wreck at the coordinates corresponding to the disappearance. Volunteer fishermen joined divers in examining the area, where a sheen believed to be diesel fuel was observed on the sea surface.
Authorities are closely monitoring the environmental situation. The Ministry of Environment and Waters stated that safeguarding the marine ecosystem remains a priority and that, so far, no confirmed pollution has been recorded in the affected section of the Black Sea. On February 19, a cutter from the Executive Agency for Maritime Administration, accompanied by an inspector from its Burgas directorate, surveyed the area without identifying oil contamination. A separate check by the Executive Agency for Fisheries and Aquaculture, prompted by signals of a possible oil slick, likewise found no evidence of pollution.
Despite confirmation that the fishing vessel lies submerged near Maslen Nos, the whereabouts of the three men on board remain unknown as rescue and inspection activities await more favorable sea conditions.

Israeli officials believe US, Iran at unbridgeable impasse as they near open conflict

Israeli officials believe US, Iran at unbridgeable impasse as they near open conflict
Report says US might allow Tehran ‘token’ nuclear enrichment, but gaps between sides widely seen as irreconcilable; one military scenario ‘takes out the ayatollah and his son’; Congress may vote on curtailing Trump
Iran and the United States continued to slide rapidly toward military conflict at the weekend, as hopes faded for a diplomatic solution to their standoff over Tehran’s nuclear program and regional actions, officials on both sides and diplomats across the Gulf and Europe said.
Israel and Iran’s Gulf neighbors now consider a conflict to be more likely than a settlement, the sources said, with Washington building up one of its biggest military deployments in the region since the invasion of Iraq in 2003.
Israel’s government believes Tehran and Washington are at an impasse and is making preparations for possible joint military action with the United States, though no decision has been made yet on whether to carry out such an operation, said a source familiar with the planning.
It would be the second time the US and Israel have attacked Iran in less than a year, following US and Israeli airstrikes against military and nuclear facilities last June.
Regional officials say oil-producing Gulf countries are preparing for a possible military confrontation that they fear could spin out of control and destabilize the Middle East.
Two Israeli officials told Reuters they believe the gaps between Washington and Tehran are unbridgeable and that the chances of a near‑term military escalation are high.
Some regional officials said Tehran was dangerously miscalculating by holding out for concessions, with US President Donald Trump boxed in by his own military buildup — unable to scale it back without losing face if there is no firm commitment from Iran to abandon its nuclear weapons ambitions.
“Both sides are sticking to their guns,” said Alan Eyre, a former US diplomat and Iran specialist, adding that nothing meaningful can emerge “unless the US and Iran walk back from their red lines — which I don’t think they will.
“What Trump can’t do is assemble all this military, and then come back with a ‘so‑so’ deal and pull out the military. I think he thinks he’ll lose face,” he said. “If he attacks, it’s going to get ugly quickly.”
Two rounds of Iran-US talks have stalled on core issues, from uranium enrichment to missiles and sanctions relief.
When Omani mediators delivered an envelope from the US side containing missile‑related proposals, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi refused even to open it and returned it, a source familiar with the talks said.
After talks in Geneva on Tuesday, Araghchi said the sides had agreed on “guiding principles,” but the White House said there was still distance between them.
Iran is expected to submit a written proposal in the coming days, a US official said, and Araghchi said on Friday he expected to have a draft counterproposal ready within days.
But Trump, who has sent aircraft carriers, warships and jets to the Middle East, warned Iran on Thursday it must make a deal over its nuclear program or “really bad things” will happen.
He appeared to set a deadline of 10 to 15 days, drawing a threat from Tehran to retaliate against US bases in the region if attacked. The rising tensions have pushed up oil prices.
US officials say Trump has yet to make up his mind about using military force, although he acknowledged on Friday that he could order a limited strike to try to force Iran into a deal.
“I guess I can say I am considering that,” he told reporters.
The possible timing of an attack is unclear. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio is due to meet Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on February 28 to discuss Iran. A senior US official said it would be mid-March before all US forces were in place.
Two US officials told Reuters that US military planning on Iran had reached an advanced stage, with options including targeting individuals as part of an attack and even pursuing leadership change in Tehran, if ordered by Trump.
“Thirty-two thousand killed”
After the US and Israel bombed Iran’s nuclear facilities and some military sites last June, Trump again began threatening strikes in January as Tehran crushed widespread protests with deadly force.
Referring to the crackdown on Friday, Trump said there was a difference between the people of Iran and the country’s leadership. He asserted that “32,000 people were killed over a relatively short period of time,” figures that could not immediately be verified.
Time Magazine and opposition outlet Iran International have reported such numbers, citing information from officials in the Islamic Republic. The US-based group HRANA, which monitors the human rights situation in Iran, has so far recorded 7,114 verified deaths and says it has another 11,700 under review.
“It’s a very, very, very sad situation,” Trump said, adding that his threats to strike Iran had led the leadership to abandon plans for mass hangings weeks ago.
“They were going to hang 837 people. And I gave them the word, if you hang one person, even one person, that you’re going to be hit right then and there,” he said.
Hours after Trump’s statements on the death toll, Araghchi said that the Iranian government has already published a “comprehensive list” of all 3,117 killed in the unrest.
“If anyone doubts the accuracy of our data, please speak with evidence,” he posted on X.
Token enrichment
On Friday, a senior US official was quoted by Axios as saying the Trump administration was open to considering a proposal that would allow Iran to retain a “token” nuclear enrichment capability if Tehran’s route to an atomic bomb is fully sealed off.
The news site said that while there could be a small opening for a deal, US officials say the proposal that Iran is expected to submit in the coming days must clear a very high bar to win over skeptics in the administration and the Middle East.
“President Trump will be ready to accept a deal that would be substantive and that he can sell politically at home. If the Iranians want to prevent an attack, they should give us an offer we can’t refuse. The Iranians keep missing the window. If they play games, there won’t be a lot of patience,” the senior US official says.
Another senior Trump adviser quoted in the report stressed that the US president “hasn’t decided to strike yet. I know that because we haven’t struck. He might never do it. He might wake up tomorrow and say, ‘That’s it.'”
According to the adviser, Trump has been presented with a range of military options for Iran.
“They have something for every scenario. One scenario takes out the ayatollah and his son and the mullahs,” the adviser elaborated, referring to Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei and his son Mojtaba. “What the president chooses no one knows. I don’t think he knows.”
Another adviser said, “Trump is keeping his options open. He could decide on an attack at any moment.”
A senior US official flatly denied an unsourced report in Iran International claiming that Iran had presented a proposal during the latest round of nuclear talks in which it agreed to halt nuclear enrichment for three years and commit to not using its ballistic missiles to attack Israel.
Asked to confirm the report, the senior US official called it “completely false.”
Congressional involvement
The US Congress could vote as soon as next week on whether to block Trump’s ability to strike Iran without lawmakers’ approval.
Members of Congress, including a few of Trump’s fellow Republicans as well as Democrats, have tried — and failed — repeatedly to pass resolutions that would bar Trump from military action against foreign governments without lawmakers’ approval.
The US Constitution grants Congress, not the president, the power to send US troops to war, except for limited strikes for national security reasons. Reuters reported last week that the military is preparing for the possibility of sustained, weeks-long operations if Trump orders an attack.
Trump’s Republicans hold slim majorities in both the Senate and House and have blocked the resolutions, arguing that Congress should not restrict Trump’s national security powers.
Democratic Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia and Republican Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky filed a Senate resolution late last month to block hostilities against Iran unless explicitly authorized by a congressional declaration of war.
“If some of my colleagues support war, then they should have the guts to vote for the war, and to be held accountable by their constituents, rather than hiding under their desks,” Kaine said in a statement.
An aide to Kaine said there was no timetable yet as to when the Senate might take up the resolution.
In the House of Representatives, Republican Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Democrat Ro Khanna of California said they planned to force a vote on a similar resolution next week.
“Trump officials say there’s a 90% chance of strikes on Iran. He can’t without Congress,” Khanna said in a post on X.
The New York Times reported that hundreds of US troops had been evacuated from Al Udeid base in Qatar, citing unnamed Pentagon officials.
Troops have also been evacuated from bases in Bahrain that house the Navy’s 5th Fleet, The Times said, adding that there were no longer any American troops at bases in Iraq, Syria, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Jordan and the United Arab Emirates.
Shortly after the story was published, however, Fox News said it was false, citing an unnamed, well-placed US official. News Nation also said CENTCOM flatly denied the report.
The move would be seen as a precautionary step ahead of a potential US strike on Iran, as Tehran is likely to retaliate to such an attack by targeting US personnel in the region.
The endgame
Araghchi gave no specific timing as to when Iranians would get their counterproposal to the US, but said he believed a diplomatic deal was within reach and could be achieved “in a very short period of time.”
“What we are now talking about is how to make sure that Iran’s nuclear program, including enrichment, is peaceful and would remain peaceful forever,” he said.
He added that technical and political “confidence-building measures” would be enacted to ensure the program would remain peaceful in exchange for action on sanctions, but he gave no further details.
“The president has been clear that Iran cannot have nuclear weapons or the capacity to build them, and that they cannot enrich uranium,” the White House said when asked about Araghchi’s comments.
European and regional officials believe the scale of the US deployment to the region would enable Washington to launch strikes on Iran while simultaneously defending its military bases, allies and Israel.
The core US demand remains unchanged: no uranium enrichment on Iranian soil. Iran, for its part, says it must keep its nuclear capability and refuses to discuss its ballistic missiles. It denies planning to build a nuclear weapons arsenal.
If talks fail, defense analyst David Des Roches said, US activity in the Gulf already signals how any strike would begin: blind Iran’s air defence and then hit the Revolutionary Guards Navy, the force behind years of tanker attacks and threats to close the Strait of Hormuz, the route for a fifth of global oil.
But some Arab and European officials say they are unsure what Trump’s endgame is, and European governments want the US to spell out what strikes would be meant to achieve — to degrade Iran’s nuclear and missile capabilities, deter escalation, or pursue something more ambitious such as “regime change.”
Some regional and European officials question whether military action can alter the trajectory of Iran’s ruling establishment, led by Khamenei and protected by the powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps.
Some say that, with no obvious alternative political force in Iran and the leadership’s resilience largely intact, it is perilous to assume strikes could trigger regime change.
Military action may be easier to start than to control, and much harder to translate into a strategic outcome, they say.

Foreign Investments in Bulgaria Rise 14% in 2025
Foreign direct investment in Bulgaria recorded steady growth in 2025, increasing by 14.2 percent compared with the previous year and reaching a total of 3.261 billion euros
Ardino Municipality has once again introduced a partial state of emergency, marking the seventh such measure since the start of the year. Mayor Izet Shaban ordered the step following a rise in the Arda River and severe damage to the concrete surface of a reinforced bridge on the republican road network near the village of Kitnitsa. The structure has become unusable, cutting off the only road link to six settlements – Rusalsko, Lyubino, Latinka, Avramovo, Pesnopoy and Spoluka. The order prohibits the movement and stay of motor vehicles in the affected zones until safety conditions are restored, with the stated aim of protecting residents.
At the same time, heavy snowfall created serious disruptions in Northwestern Bulgaria. The main E-79 road between Montana and Vratsa remained uncleared and untreated, leaving numerous trucks stranded in both directions and obstructing traffic for extended periods. Long queues of heavy vehicles and passenger cars stretched across much of the international route. Congestion was particularly severe near the junction for Kravoder and Glavatsi, while icing complicated travel on the alternative route through Krivodol. Drivers also reported impassable sections between Vratsa and Borovan, where trucks failed to climb near Banitsa, as well as blockages along the Mezdra–Botevgrad road in the Lyutidol area. The Petrohan Pass stayed open but under difficult winter conditions. Earlier, a serious crash occurred near the village of Barzia, though official details about its cause have not yet been released.
In southern Bulgaria, traffic through the gorge between Varvara and Gara Kostandovo on the road to Velingrad was temporarily suspended after rockfalls triggered by heavy rain. Authorities cited the continued risk of falling debris as the reason for the closure. The route will reopen once it is cleared and deemed safe. Drivers are being redirected via the Peshtera–Batak–Rakitovo–Gara Kostandovo–Velingrad road or the Belovo–Yundola alternative. Police teams from Septemvri and Velingrad are stationed at both ends of the affected section to manage traffic.
Snowfall in Sofia prompted anti-icing operations across the capital. Treatment began early in the morning in Pancharevo and expanded to Vitosha, Kremikovtsi and Iskar districts. Priority is being given to streets used by public transport and to municipal roads serving Plana, Zheleznitsa and Pasarel. Additional routes in Kremikovtsi – including those to Seslavtsi, Buhovo, Yana, Gorni and Dolni Bogrov, Botunets, Chelopechene and Vrazhdebna – are also being processed. Work is underway in Studentski, Krasno Selo, Mladost and Lyulin, with 45 snow-clearing machines deployed. In Vitosha Nature Park, the roads toward Aleko hut and Zlatnite Mostove have been sanded. Public transport continues to operate under winter conditions, except for trolleybus line 9, which is temporarily diverted to Vasil Levski Boulevard. Municipal authorities urge drivers to use winter-equipped vehicles and maintain moderate speeds, while property owners are reminded to clear adjacent sidewalks.
Weather forecasts indicate overcast skies nationwide, with rain transitioning into snow as temperatures fall. Southern and far eastern areas are expected to see mixed precipitation, including icy conditions in some locations. Central and Eastern Bulgaria may experience significant snowfall. Moderate to strong northeasterly winds will create blizzard conditions and snowdrifts. Minimum temperatures on Saturday will range from minus 3°C in the north to 7°C in the south, around minus 1°C in Sofia, with little daytime variation.
Along the Black Sea coast, rain will gradually mix with snow overnight, especially on the northern shoreline where icing is possible. Strong northeasterly winds are forecast, with daytime highs between 4°C and 7°C. Sea water temperatures are 4°–6°C and wave heights will reach 3 to 4 points.
Mountain regions will remain cloudy with substantial snowfall in the Rhodopes and Central Stara Planina.

Second Bulgarian Company Joins Frankfurt Stock Exchange
Sirma Group, a Bulgarian technology holding, has officially entered the international financial arena, becoming the second domestic company to be listed on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange
Bulgarian model Lyudmil Dimitrov has reached a milestone in his career by walking the runway for Calvin Klein at New York Fashion Week. Representing the Yvette Fashion agency, the 24-year-old became the first Bulgarian male model to appear in a Calvin Klein show, held at The Shed in Hudson Yards. Dimitrov has been collaborating with the brand for a year, participating in catalog shoots and campaigns for its men’s line, and his appearance on the runway further establishes him as one of Bulgaria’s rising faces in international fashion.
A notable aspect of his participation is that he was among only ten male models worldwide selected to walk in the women’s collection, which highlights the brand’s focus on the body, elegance, and the pursuit of aesthetic perfection. Calvin Klein’s creative director, Veronica Leoni, described the collection as a homage to the hedonistic elegance of the late 1970s and early 1980s, emphasizing intimacy, form, and the pleasure of beauty.
The show attracted prominent figures in fashion and entertainment, with front-row attendees including Dakota Johnson, Brooke Shields, Lily Collins, François Arnault, Alexa Chung, Mario Sorrenti, and influencer Camila Coelho. Among the highlights backstage was a meeting with Anna Wintour, who personally congratulated the models, including Dimitrov, on their participation.
Following his New York appearance, Dimitrov has scheduled fashion engagements in Paris, Dallas, and the South of France. Born in Sofia, he has been with Yvette Fashion for six years. Standing 187 cm tall, he was discovered on Sofia’s Vitosha Boulevard by agency booker Dian Dinev.
Dimitrov has previously worked with major global fashion names such as Tiffany & Co., Ralph Lauren, Dolce & Gabbana, Jacquemus, Bottega Veneta, Iceberg, Diesel, Rag & Bone, and Bershka. He has also graced the cover of 10 Men Australia and appeared in editorials for Style Italy and Carnale Room.
His agency affiliations extend worldwide, including VNY Models in New York, Select Model Management in Paris, The Lab Models in Milan, Fifth Models in Barcelona, Run Model Management in Brussels, DSM in Hamburg, MIKAs in Stockholm, and Priscilla in Sydney, reflecting his established international presence on the fashion circuit.

Bulgaria’s Pedophilia Registry Raises Human Rights Concerns, Warns Legal Expert

Foreign Investments in Bulgaria Rise 14% in 2025
Foreign direct investment in Bulgaria recorded steady growth in 2025, increasing by 14.2 percent compared with the previous year and reaching a total of 3.261 billion euros
Assoc. Prof. Iva Pushkarova, a lecturer in Criminal Law, warned that Bulgaria’s decision to make part of the National Registry of Pedophilia public raises serious human rights concerns. Speaking to Bulgarian National Radio, she stressed that no European country maintains such registries, unlike in the United States, where they have generated numerous human rights issues. Pushkarova emphasized that the move conflicts with the European Convention on Human Rights and is unlikely to have a sustainable future. Instead, it risks exposing Bulgarian citizens to increased social pressure, fear, and hostility, undermining the trust and cooperation essential to a democratic society.

According to Pushkarova, preventive measures should remain the focus of child protection policies rather than post-crime public exposure of offenders. She highlighted that current European supranational guidance offers ample direction on prevention, aiming to shield children from becoming victims rather than targeting perpetrators after crimes occur. Measures that provoke negative social effects, she noted, only deepen societal distrust and fear in Bulgaria.
Pushkarova also stated that Bulgaria does not need a separate Child Justice Act, as existing legislation already provides for the protection, assistance, and criminal prosecution of children. She referenced the 2021 murder case of Evgeniya Vladimirova, in which public protests arose after the Sofia Court of Appeal reduced Orlin Vladimirov’s sentence from life imprisonment to 20 years and fully acquitted his father, Plamen Vladimirov. Pushkarova noted that the principle of personal concealment, which shields close family members from punishment if they help offenders evade justice, remains a traditional institution in Bulgarian law.
She criticized recent legislative proposals aimed at increasing penalties for sexual crimes against minors and raising the age of consent from 14 to 16. Pushkarova argued that the changes appear unprincipled and populist, lacking proper analysis or consistency. She noted that the Bulgarian Penal Code already meets supranational requirements and includes clear rules for determining punishments, but current proposals risk distorting penal policy by punishing minor offenses more harshly than serious crimes, potentially incentivizing offenders to commit graver acts to reduce their liability.
Regarding the statute of limitations, Pushkarova warned that recent proposals could weaken criminal prosecution by undermining established European practices that allow continuation of cases after victims reach adulthood. She emphasized that alternatives discussed in ministry working groups would offer stronger protections and more balanced policies than the current legislative approach. Overall, Pushkarova concluded that the proposed measures risk worsening child protection in multiple ways rather than improving it.
