An instructor for a Texas scuba diving class where a 12-year-old girl drowned admitted to investigators he hadn’t slept in nearly 30 hours at the time of her death, according to a new report.
Dylan Harrison, 12, died in August 2025 after drowning during a class at The Scuba Ranch, a training lake in Terrell, Texas, according to Fox 4 News. Now, new allegations have come to light about her instructor, William Armstrong.
Armstrong was reportedly teaching a class of eight students, including Harrison, when the incident occurred. Harrison went missing during the class, and her body was found at a depth of 45 feet, Fox 4 News reports.
Armstrong was arrested on Friday, February 6, and charged with injury to a child, according to the outlet. He was released after posting a $150,000 bond and reportedly made no comments to reporters as he left the Kaufman County Jail.
An affidavit obtained by Fox 4 News said Armstrong admitted to investigators he had “been awake straight for approximately 29 hours, working three jobs” when Harrison drowned.
According to Fox 4 News, the document indicates no one was in the water searching for Harrison, and Armstrong was standing on the dock without diving gear on, when rescue officials arrived at the scene.
Investigators also collected Harrison’s dive watch, which appeared to indicate she wasn’t weighted properly, Fox 4 News reports. Weighting is a key safety measure that helps divers control their buoyancy, as well as the speed at which they dive and resurface, according to Scuba Diving International.
Armstrong has since been “permanently suspended” from teaching at The Scuba Ranch, according to the outlet. Armstrong also worked as an assistant chief deputy at the Collin County Sheriff’s Office, but has since resigned from his role, Fox 4 News reported.
In a statement shared with Fox 4 News in October, a spokesperson for The Scuba Ranch said the organization has been “fully cooperating with the ongoing investigation and remains committed to supporting all efforts to understand what happened.”
“We pray this family receives the answers, justice, and closure they deserve, and that all of the dive community would be strengthened through what we learn from this tragedy,” the spokesperson said.
The Independent has contacted The Scuba Ranch and an attorney representing Harrison’s family for comment. The Independent was unable to identify an attorney for Armstrong.

US forces board oil tanker in Indian Ocean that fled Caribbean blockade
The United States intercepted a new oil tanker in the Indian Ocean that had fled the blockade ordered by US President Donald Trump against sanctioned ships leaving or heading to Venezuela, the Pentagon announced on Sunday.
US forces boarded an oil tanker in the Indian Ocean that violated US President Donald Trump's blockade of sanctioned vessels in the Caribbean and fled the region, the Pentagon said Sunday.
The Panamanian-flagged Veronica III "tried to defy President Trump's quarantine – hoping to slip away. We tracked it from the Caribbean to the Indian Ocean, closed the distance, and shut it down," the Pentagon said on X.
The post included a video of US forces boarding a helicopter and then boarding the tanker ship.
The Pentagon intercepted the Aquila II in similar fashion about a week ago.

In December, Trump ordered a "blockade" of sanctioned oil vessels heading to and from Venezuela. At least nine ships have been seized thus far.
But those ships seized in recent months make up only a tiny fraction of the total number of sanctioned "shadow fleet" vessels operating worldwide to evade sanctions, which a senior US Coast Guard officer said number up to 800.
The Veronica III left Venezuela on January 3 – the same day that US special forces captured Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro in a raid – carrying around 1.9 million barrels of oil, TankersTrackers.com said.

The ship is listed under US sanctions relating to Iran, according to the website of the US Treasury's Office of Foreign Asset Control.
"The Department of War will deny illicit actors and their proxies freedom of movement in the maritime domain," the Pentagon said on X.

Erdogan postpones UAE visit, saying leader has 'health problem'
Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Sunday announced he was postponing a visit to Abu Dhabi because Emirati leader Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan had a "health problem" - then deleted the message.
The message, posted by Erdogan's team on X, said he had talked with Al Nahyan by phone.
"During the course of the call, President Erdogan expressed his sadness over the health problem experienced by (President) Al Nahyan and wished him a prompt recovery", said the three-paragraph message.
Erdogan would travel to the United Arab Emirates at a later date, still to be determined, the message added.
Although the message - of which AFP has a screen grab - was quickly deleted from the account, it had already been picked up by official Turkish media.
Turkey's state broadcaster likewise took down its article on Erdogan that mentioned the Emirati leader's health problem.
The official Emirati news agency, WAM, reported on the telephone conversation between the two leaders, but did not mention that Erdogan's visit had been postponed.
Contacted by AFP, neither the Turkish presidency nor the Emirati authorities - who have themselves made no statement on their president's health - have yet answered.
The Emirati leader's team on Saturday evening released photos taken the same day showing Al Nahyan, known as MBZ, smiling and apparently in good health, with Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, the emir of Qatar.

Opinion | Can Manila’s South China Sea strategy of defiance and diplomacy hold?
China and the Philippines are both signalling openness to diplomacy alongside continued military flexing, but this may not be sustainable
In the South China Sea, conference rooms and contested shoals operate on parallel tracks. Whether this compartmentalisation can hold or whether the next incident drags everyone into a crisis is fast becoming a regional question, not merely a bilateral one.
Yet events at sea that week told a different story. US-Philippine joint patrols operated near Scarborough Shoal, followed by Chinese patrols. As both capitals seek to shape the narrative, space for quiet de-escalation is shrinking.
In some ways, this two-track dynamic offers Beijing and Manila flexibility. Diplomats point to dialogue as evidence of responsible statecraft. Security establishments show resolve without triggering escalation. Domestic audiences see their government standing firm.

Teen daughter of a Chicago man detained in an immigration case dies from a rare cancer
A Chicago teen who spoke out for her father’s release after he was detained last fall by immigration officials has died after battling a rare form of cancer

A Chicago teen who spoke out for her father's release after he was detained last fall by immigration officials in a deportation case has died after battling a rare form of cancer.
Ofelia Giselle Torres Hidalgo, 16, died Friday from stage 4 alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma, the family said in a statement. Funeral arrangements are private.
The teenager had been diagnosed in December 2024 with the aggressive form of soft tissue cancer and had been undergoing chemotherapy and radiation treatment.
An immigration judge in Chicago ruled three days before Ofelia's death that her father, Ruben Torres Maldonado, was conditionally entitled to receive "cancellation of removal” due to the hardships his deportation would cause his children who were born in the United States and are U.S. citizens, according to the statement sent by an attorney representing Torres Maldonado.
The ruling provides Torres Maldonado with a path to becoming a lawful permanent resident and eventual U.S. citizenship, the statement said.
Ofelia was present via Zoom at last week's hearing.
“Ofelia was heroic and brave in the face of ICE’s detention and threatened deportation of her father,” said Kalman Resnick, Torres Maldonado's attorney. “We mourn Ofelia’s passing, and we hope that she will serve as a model for us all for how to be courageous and to fight for what’s right to our last breaths.”
Torres Maldonado, a painter and home renovator, was detained Oct. 18 at a Home Depot store in suburban Chicago as the area was at the center of a major immigration crackdown dubbed “Operation Midway Blitz,” which began in early September.
Ofelia was undergoing treatment when she appeared in October in a video posted on a GoFundMe page set up for the family.
“My dad, like many other fathers, is a hard-working person who wakes up early in the morning and goes to work without complaining, thinking about his family,” she said in the video. “I find it so unfair that hardworking immigrant families are being targeted just because they were not born here.”
In a wheelchair, she attended a hearing for her father in October. The family’s attorneys told a judge at that time that she was released from the hospital just a day before her father’s arrest so that she could see family and friends. They added that Ofelia had been unable to continue treatment “because of the stress and disruption.”
Torres Maldonado's attorneys petitioned for his release as his deportation case went through the system. A judge ordered a bond hearing after ruling in October that his detention was illegal and violated Torres Maldonado's due process rights.
A judge later cited Torres Maldonado’s lack of criminal history while allowing his release on a $2,000 bond.
Lawyers said Torres Maldonado entered the U.S. in 2003. He and his partner, Sandibell Hidalgo, also have a younger son.
The Department of Homeland Security had alleged he had been living illegally in the U.S. for years and has a history of driving offenses, including driving without a valid license, without insurance and speeding.

FBI confirms DNA recovered from glove found near Nancy Guthrie's home
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
TUCSON, Arizona, Feb 15 - Investigators have obtained a DNA sample from a discarded glove that was found near Nancy Guthrie's Arizona home and appears to match the pair worn by a masked prowler seen in video footage caught by her doorbell camera before she was abducted two weeks ago, the FBI said on Sunday.
The preliminary findings from a private crime laboratory in Florida were received by the FBI on Saturday and were awaiting "quality control and official confirmation" on Sunday before investigators run the results through a national database of known DNA profiles, the FBI said in a statement.
The process typically takes 24 hours from when the Federal Bureau of Investigation receives a DNA sample.
The glove was one roughly 16 collected by investigators in recent days in a search zone within two miles of the Tucson-area residence of 84-year-old Nancy Guthrie, the mother of U.S. television journalist Savannah Guthrie.
Most of the gloves collected by investigators for examination turned out to have been dropped on the ground by searchers in the vicinity, the FBI said.
But the one with a DNA profile recovered from it is "different and appears to match the gloves" worn by the man in a ski mask seen trying to disable Guthrie's door camera in the early morning hours shortly before she was abducted, according to the FBI statement.
Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos said on Friday that he was certain that the man in the video, who was also wearing a gun in a holster and an over-stuffed backpack, was the primary suspect investigators were looking for to solve the high-profile case.
Nancy Guthrie was last seen on January 31 when family dropped her off at her home near Tucson after she had dined with them, and relatives reported her missing the following day, authorities have said.
Nanos has said the elder Guthrie was extremely limited in her physical mobility and could not have left her home unassisted, leading investigators to conclude early on that she had been taken against her will.
At least two purported ransom notes have surfaced since she vanished, both of them delivered initially to news media outlets.
Traces of blood found on her front porch were confirmed by DNA tests to have come from Guthrie, officials said last week. Law enforcement and family members have described her as being in frail health and in need of daily medication to survive. She also had a pacemaker.
The sheriff said on Friday that DNA from people other than Guthrie or those known to have been in close contact with her had also been collected from her property, but there has been no official word on any further findings from those samples.
Savannah Guthrie, co-anchor of the popular NBC News morning show "Today," has posted several video messages with her brother Camron Guthrie and sister Annie Guthrie pleading for their mother's return and appealing for the public's help in solving the case. In one video, they expressed a willingness to meet ransom demands.
Nanos told Reuters on Friday that no proof of life has surfaced since the abduction but he was quick to add: "There's not been any proof of death either."
The presumed kidnapping has drawn intense media attention as well as expressions of sympathy and support from President Donald Trump. REUTERS

Why a crash in the final 'takes a bit of sting out' of Aussie snowboarder's Olympics

Why Australian Adam Lambert's medal-losing crash in the final made him feel better about his Winter Olympics
It seemed that only a disaster would cost Australia a second medal at the Winter Olympics in Livigno on Monday.
Unfortunately, that is exactly what happened — although that's not how Adam Lambert saw it.
Lambert and Josie Baff had cruised through the mixed team snowboard cross event, with Olympic champion Baff in particular looking in sublime form.
The pair produced two hugely impressive displays to make their way to the final.
In mixed snowboard cross, the men race first, with the women following, handicapped by the amount of time their partner finished behind the leader.
With Baff arguable the form rider of the Games, all Lambert needed to do was get down to the bottom in contention with the leaders.
And, right up until the final corner, that's exactly what appeared to be happening, with Lambert hot on the heels of Italian Lorenzo Sommariva.
But then came that disaster.
"So I came around turn five and I had speed on Lorenzo," Lambert said.
"I would have preferred to have been on his left.
"But unfortunately I kind of just landed on his right, landed on his tail a little bit and then I had to go inside in turn six, and Lorenzo also was as far inside as he could be.
"My nose mounted his tail and his tail slipped out and as his tail slipped out, I lost all contact with my toe-side edge.
"So that's what set me down."
With Lambert down, the maximum time deficit was applied to Baff up at the side of the run, 4.16 seconds, a time calculated according to the length of the course.
A penny for the thoughts of Baff, marooned up at the top of the course while her rivals sped away.
"I was thinking, wow, 4 seconds is a really long time," Baff said.
She's not wrong.
Baff had made up a deficit of half a second in the semifinal comfortably, which the 23-year-old said gave her confidence she could pull off a miracle.
"I knew that I was strong, my starts were way better today — I think I was less nervous and I was kind of going back to my normal starts.
"So I was like, 'you know what, anything's possible and I'm going to trust that these three might have some contact lower down and I want to be in that race if anything does happen''.
"I guess that was the mindset here, and also I don't ever give up, not until I cross that line.
"So I just kind of went in with that [attitude] and I could see, I was like, wow, I'm getting closer. I actually am getting closer. I thought this could still work.
"But unfortunately, 4 seconds is a long time."
Lambert acknowledged that Baff was capable of extraordinary things, but even that was beyond her.
"I know Josie could have pulled back half a second — she probably could have pulled back a second and a half she's been riding so well — but 4 seconds is just slightly too much."
It left the Australians in the worst possible place to finish at an Olympic Games — fourth in a four-team final.
As the three teams they had been racing with shoulder-to-shoulder just moments before went up and claimed their medals and accepted the plaudits from the massive crowd, Lambert and Baff trudged through the mix zone.
These Games have been tough on the snowboard cross riders, especially Lambert.
Cameron Bolton is his roommate and best friend. Seeing him be airlifted away from Livigno with a broken neck clearly affected the 28-year-old, at least in part resulting in his mixed form and early exit in the men's competition.
The fact he came within touching distance of an Olympic medal must sting, but despite the obvious disappointment, Lambert was philosophical.
"It's a tough place to be, fourth at the Olympics," Lambert said.
"But we're also at the Olympics and we're also in the finals.
"There's only so many people that get to be on the podium and I'm proud to have been in the final to begin with."
Lambert — who only won his first FIS World Cup event earlier this year after eight seasons — said it was "too soon" to know whether this mistake would keep him up at night.
It may be the case that, after toiling for so many years without claiming a World Cup victory, Lambert has a different relationship with winning to others, taking a more holistic view of the sport.
Regardless, Lambert still said representing Australia in a final was "beautiful".
"I'm feeling a lot better about it [my Olympics] after today," Lambert said.
"I feel like, even with my crash in the final, I showed a little bit more of my style of riding and my ability.
"I'm really proud to have been able to do that and it does take a bit of a sting out of the last two days.
"It's a beautiful thing to be able to be out here and be representing the country and get so far into an event.
"Fourth place is — it's just short of the medals, but it's fourth place.
"It's still very good."

Glove found near Nancy Guthrie’s home appears to match one worn by suspect, FBI says
The glove was sent off for DNA testing. The 84-year-old vanished from her Arizona home on January 31 in an apparent abduction
A glove containing DNA found about two miles from the house of Today show host Savannah Guthrie’s mother appears to match those worn by a masked person outside her front door in Tucson the night she vanished, the FBI said on Sunday.
The glove, found in a field near the side of the road, was sent off for DNA testing. The Federal Bureau of Investigation said in a statement on Sunday that it received preliminary results on Saturday and is awaiting official confirmation.
Nancy Guthrie, 84, was last seen at her Arizona home on January 31 and was reported missing the following day. Authorities said her blood was found on the front porch. Purported ransom notes were sent to news outlets, but two deadlines for paying have passed.
The discovery was revealed days after investigators had released surveillance videos of the masked person outside Guthrie’s front door.
A porch camera recorded video of a person with a backpack who was wearing a ski mask, long trousers, jacket and gloves.
On Thursday, the FBI called the person a suspect. The agency said he was carrying a 25-litre “Ozark Trail Hiker Pack” backpack.

How Iran plans to 'woo' Witkoff and Kushner in Geneva

It's the economy, stupid: Iran's new negotiating strategy facing the US combines nuclear talks with an offer to integrate American companies into the Iranian economy.
Iranian officials first raised the proposal during the initial round of talks in Oman. At the upcoming meeting in Geneva, they are expected to present an organized plan centered on allowing US firms to enter Iran's oil industry, rehabilitate its refineries and take part in additional projects, regional diplomatic sources told Israel Hayom.
Hamid Ghanbari, deputy head of economic diplomacy at Iran's Foreign Ministry, confirmed to local media that Tehran has offered Washington economic cooperation ranging from permitting US firms to operate in Iran's oil and gas fields to investing in mining projects and even purchasing passenger aircraft from American manufacturers.
Iran holds some of the world's largest natural gas reserves but has struggled for years to develop them due to corruption and sweeping international sanctions.
According to Ghanbari, the negotiations "include shared interests in areas such as energy, joint oil and gas fields, fast-yield mineral investments, urban development and aircraft purchases." He argued that for any long-term agreement to endure without being violated, it is essential that the US secure substantial and rapid economic returns.
Ghanbari added that the previous agreement, the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, failed in part because the US did not reap tangible economic benefits from it. Any new deal, he suggested, would require opportunities for quick and significant returns for Washington in order to make it resilient.
In exchange for these economic incentives, Iran is demanding swift measures to unfreeze tens of billions of dollars in Iranian assets held in Western banks and to ease sanctions in step with progress in the talks. Iran's frozen funds worldwide amount to tens of billions of dollars. Diplomatic sources noted, however, that after the previous deal led to the release of Iranian assets, much of the money was funneled into military buildup, missile development and the financing of regional terrorist organizations.
The Iranian approach appears designed to engage President Donald Trump and his envoys, Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, on business rather than on strictly military and security grounds.
The talks are set to take place in Geneva on Tuesday. After the first round concludes, the sides will decide whether to continue discussions later in the week or return home for consultations.

India crushes Pakistan by 61 runs in marquee game in T20 World Cup. No handshakes again
Archrivals India and Pakistan declined to shake hands before and after the most-anticipated game of cricket’s Twenty20 World Cup
- Bookmark
Archrivals India and Pakistan declined to shake hands before and after the most-anticipated game of cricket's Twenty20 World Cup, with India easily winning by 61 runs on Sunday to secure its Super 8 spot.
India opener Ishan Kishan scored 77 off 40 deliveries in a match in Colombo which almost didn't take place after Pakistan had threatened a boycott earlier this month before reversing its decision.
Pakistan captain Salman Ali Agha and India captain Suryakumar Yadav didn't shake hands at the toss, which Pakistan won and chose to field. India and Pakistan players had refused to shake hands at last year’s acrimonious Asia Cup tournament in the United Arab Emirates that took place amid diplomatic and military tensions between the two neighbors.
India made a competitive 175-7 on Sunday on a sticky pitch at R. Premadasa Stadium. In reply Pakistan was bowled out for 114 in 18 overs. Despite the heavy defeat, Pakistan can still advance from Group A. It plays Namibia in its last group game.
Sunday’s game was the first time the teams have met since the Asia Cup, won by India.
Early setback for India
Agha’s decision to bowl first surprised many because the ground has a history of not favoring run chases.
“Our bowlers didn’t bowl well according to the situation and when it came to batting we didn’t apply ourselves, they didn’t give us a chance to go deep in the game,” Agha said.
Yadav was pleased with how losing the toss had turned out.
“Batting first was a better option on this wicket," he said.
But India's batting suffered an early setback when its most aggressive batter Abhishek Sharma was dismissed without scoring. Agha bowled the first over with four consecutive dot balls and had Sharma caught by Shaheen Shah Afridi.
Kishan pulled India back with a six and two fours in the following over and he dominated an 87-run stand for the second wicket off 46 deliveries with Tilak Varma.
Kishan's innings included three sixes and 10 boundaries before being bowled by off spinner Saim Ayub.
Ayub took two consecutive wickets in his last over to finish with his career-best T20 bowling of 3-25.
Yadav (32 off 29) and Shivam Dube (27 off 17) made useful contributions for India.
Poor start for Pakistan’s chase
Seam bowler Hardik Pandya gave India an ideal start with a wicket-maiden over, dismissing Sahibzada Farhan in the fourth delivery.
Jasprit Bumrah took two wickets in the next over — Ayub (lbw for 6) and Agha (caught by Pandya for 4).
Spinner Axar Patel bowled Babar Azam (5), leaving Pakistan 34-4.
Usman Khan resisted with a 34-ball 44 but was stumped when he stepped out to hit Patel.
Pandya, Bumrah, Patel and Varun Chakravarthy took two wickets each.
We'll meet again?
Agha said his team must now focus on securing its place in the last eight.
Second-place U.S. and third-place Pakistan have four points each in Group A but Pakistan still has a game to play.
“You have to see the bigger picture," Agha said, "we need to win that game and qualify … and then a new tournament starts.”
India and Pakistan could meet again in the semifinals or final. That game would also be played in Sri Lanka, which is co-hosting the tournament with India.
All eyes on Colombo
In the lead-up to the match in Colombo, Agha said he believed it was up to the Indian players to decide whether they would shake hands with his team before and after Sunday’s game.
Yadav, for his part, had been non-committal.
Pakistan’s government considered not playing Sunday’s match after the International Cricket Council kicked Bangladesh out of the World Cup for refusing to play matches in India, citing security concerns.
Pakistan only agreed to play after intense discussions with the ICC. The fixture is a major revenue earner for the ICC.
Political and military tensions have meant the two teams have not played a bilateral series for years.
India has not traveled to Pakistan since 2008 and Pakistan visited India for the 50-over World Cup in 2023 but has since played ICC tournaments at neutral venues.
India has defeated Pakistan 13 times in the 17 T20 games they have played. It now also has an impressive 8-1 record in the nine T20 World Cup matches since the first edition in 2007.
West Indies makes it 3 in 3, US keeps slim hopes alive
At Mumbai, West Indies notched its third successive win in Group C when it thumped Nepal by nine wickets and qualified for the Super 8 stage.
West Indies had already beat Scotland and England to take command of Group C.
Nepal showed plenty of promise in its first game when it lost narrowly to England, but then two heavy defeats against first-timer Italy and Sunday against West Indies saw it eliminated.
Fast bowler Jason Holder grabbed 4-27 and restricted Nepal to 133-8. Shai Hope then smashed an unbeaten 61 off 44 balls and Shimron Hetmyer scored 46 off 32 balls as West Indies cruised to 134-1 in 15.2 overs.
Sanjay Krishnamurthi kept American hopes of Super 8 qualification alive with a maiden T20 half-century – 68 not out off 33 balls – against Namibia in their Group A clash.
Skipper Monank Patel also scored 52 off 30 balls as the U.S. notched up its tournament highest score – 199-4 in 20 overs.
In reply, Namibia was restricted to 168-6, losing its third game and is now eliminated from the competition.
The U.S. won its final game by 31 runs.

Morocco's FAR complete CAF Champions League quarters line-up
Moroccan military club FAR Rabat forced a 0-0 draw at Egyptian giants Al Ahly on Sunday and secured the last CAF Champions League quarter-finals place.
Drawing in Cairo lifted FAR to nine points, one more than rivals Young Africans of Tanzania, whose 3-0 victory over Algerian visitors JS Kabylie in Zanzibar City was in vain.
Ahly supporters in a 45,000 Cairo crowd vented their frustrations by flinging bottles toward the pitch as the dominant home team failed to convert territorial superiority into goals.
Angolan Laurindo 'Depu' Aurelio scored in each half for Young Africans before Congolese Chadrack Boka notched a third goal.
Record 12-time African champions Ahly topped Group B with 10 points, and will be among the four seeded teams for the quarter-finals draw on Tuesday.
The others are defending champions and fellow Egyptian club Pyramids, surprising Stade Malien of Mali and Sudanese side Al Hilal.
Hilal reached the last eight of the premier African club competition despite playing home matches in Rwanda because of the civil war in Sudan.
The unseeded quartet are FAR and Renaissance Berkane from Morocco, Mamelodi Sundowns of South Africa and Esperance from Tunisia.
It ranks among the strongest last-eight fields in the 62-year competition with Ahly, Pyramids, FAR, Esperance and Sundowns have all lifted the trophy. Malien and Hilal have finished runners-up.
Berkane are Champions League debutants after winning the second-tier CAF Confederation Cup three times and finishing runners-up twice in the past seven seasons.

At least four people were killed on Sunday evening in an Israeli drone strike targeting a vehicle in the eastern Lebanese town of Majdal Anjar near the Lebanese-Syrian border despite a ceasefire, Lebanon’s official National News Agency reported.
The agency said an Israeli drone struck a car between the al-Masnaa border crossing and the village of Jdeidet Yabous, along the Lebanon-Syria border, resulting in fatalities and an unidentified number of injuries.
The sound of four strong explosions was reported heard in nearby villages, the agency added.
The attacks come amid repeated Israeli violations of a ceasefire agreement reached in November 2024.
Israel continues to occupy five Lebanese hilltops seized during the latest war that began in October 2023, in addition to other Lebanese areas it has held for decades.
The offensives have killed more than 4,000 victims and wounded 17,000 in Lebanon.

Ukrainian drone attack targets multiple Russian oblasts, Bryansk reportedly left largely without electricity
Russian officials reported a large-scale drone attack targeting multiple regions on Feb. 15, including Moscow, Bryansk, and Belgorod Oblasts.
Moscow Mayor Sergey Sobyanin claimed that Russian air defenses shot down 13 drones heading toward the capital, with emergency services responding to debris at impact sites.
Temporary flight restrictions were introduced at Domodedovo airport but were later lifted, according to state media.
Bryansk Oblast Governor Alexander Bogomaz said the region had been under sustained UAV attack since early morning, claiming that 120 drones were destroyed there. He later noted that strikes on energy infrastructure left five municipalities and parts of the city of Bryansk without heat and electricity.
Russia’s Defense Ministry earlier reported that 102 Ukrainian drones were intercepted between 9 a.m. and 1 p.m. Moscow time across Bryansk, Kaluga, and Tula oblasts, as well as near Moscow.
Separately, Russian Telegram channels reported an apparent Ukrainian strike on the city of Belgorod, with regional Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov saying preliminary information indicated significant damage to energy infrastructure. Emergency services are assessing the extent of the damage.
No information was immediately available on the extent of the damage caused or on any possible casualties.
The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify these claims at the time of publication.
Ukraine regularly uses long-range drones to target military and industrial targets in Russia, including oil refineries, weapons factories, and ammunition depots.
The strikes are part of Ukraine's broader campaign of attacks inside Russia aimed at weakening Moscow's ability to sustain its war against Ukraine.

Marco Rubio Doesn’t Get It

Marco Rubio Doesn’t Get It
The Trump administration continues to lambast friends and empower foes.
Marco Rubio offered a more supportive message to Europe at the Munich Security Conference yesterday than J. D. Vance did a year ago. Wolfgang Ischinger, the chair of the conference, thanked him for the message of reassurance, adding, “I’m not sure you heard the sigh of relief in this hall.” This despite the fact that Rubio, like Vance, clearly misunderstands Europe and is in denial about the threats facing the United States and the transatlantic alliance.
In 2025, Vance said that the threat he worried the most about for Europe is not Russia, China, or any other external actor. It was the “threat from within,” particularly perceived restrictions on free speech. Vance’s attack landed like a bombshell in Europe. In the weeks that followed, Vance’s role in the Oval Office showdown with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and the Signalgate leak (in which he wrote “I just hate bailing Europe out again”) reinforced his reputation as Europe’s strongest critic in the Trump administration.
Serving as the administration’s more diplomatic good cop, Rubio used his time at Munich to emphasize ties between Europe and the United States. He told the audience: “We want allies who are proud of their culture and of their heritage, who understand that we are heirs to the same great and noble civilization, and who, together with us, are willing and able to defend it.” Further emphasizing unity and shared purpose, he added, “We will always be a child of Europe.”
Rubio also tried to contextualize President Trump’s “direct” approach as part of the noble “task of renewal and restoration,” essential for both the alliance and for Europeans themselves. “We in America have no interest in being polite and orderly caretakers of the West’s managed decline,” Rubio declared. Europe, he explained, had too much faith in open borders and international institutions when the only true defense of the world order is hard power—and the military investment that demands.
This story about Trump rescuing Europe from its short-sighted pacifism and general malaise is one you hear regularly, including from Europeans such as NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, but it’s not true. Consider the following.
On defense, Europe has been rearming rapidly over the past decade. Non-U.S. NATO members increased their defense spending by $70 billion a year during the first Trump administration, then by $190 billion in the Biden administration. The steep rise was largely in response to the growing threat from Russia, but it indicates that Europeans were seriously investing in their own defense well before Trump’s reelection.
It would be similarly wrong to claim that Europeans have outsourced Ukraine’s defense to the United States, given that Europe has been the biggest provider of aid to the country, allocating mor than 132 billion euros from January 2022 to December 2024, compared with 114 billion euros from the U.S., according to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy. Europe’s contribution has grown since Trump took office again, and U.S. aid flatlined.
Even before Trump returned to power, the European Union’s asylum policy had shifted toward tighter border controls, faster processing, and a growing effort to assess asylum claims before allowing migrants in. The EU had also begun “de-risking” the economies of member nations by limiting Chinese investment, backing American export controls on advanced chip-making equipment to China, and reducing dependence on Chinese supply chains.
But the real problem was not what Rubio got wrong about Europe. It was what he chose not to say at all.
The big geopolitical story of this moment, other than Trump, is the increasing alignment and cooperation between Russia, China, and North Korea. Beijing and Pyongyang are now actively involved in a major war in Europe. China is helping Russia reconstitute its military and North Korea has sent weapons and troops. Russia has returned the favor by offering valuable military technology and know-how to both countries. Senior U.S. military and political officials have told me that they are particularly worried about North Korea’s cooperation with Russia and what it means for peace on the Korean peninsula.
This authoritarian alignment is the most profound threat that the United States and its allies, in Europe and the Indo-Pacific, face. Yet there was no mention of Russia or China in Rubio’s speech. He touched on both in the questions and answers but did not characterize them as strategic competitors or a threat to the alliance. This seems to be part of a pattern for the administration. In January, Undersecretary of Defense for Policy Elbridge Colby gave a major speech in South Korea without ever mentioning North Korea. It’s like something out of Harry Potter—the threat cannot be named.
More perniciously, the Trump administration wants to readmit Russia to the G7 and has asked Russia and China to join Trump’s Board of Peace (Russian leader Vladimir Putin said yes, China said no). Meanwhile, Trump officials have seemed keen to alienate the EU and dismiss the “rules-based order” as nothing more than “cloud castle abstractions,” despite the fact that these are the very allies and ideals that the U.S. needs to compete with China and contain Russia.
Before arriving in Munich, Rubio told the press that “the old world is gone” and that “we live in a new era in geopolitics.” He is right, but he misunderstands why. The old order is fraying not because Europe is weak or complacent or guilelessly reliant on diplomatic institutions, but because authoritarian powers are increasingly willing to work together to forcefully reshape the world order. In this landscape, cohesive alliances, military deterrence, and economic resilience are essential.
By devoting his speech to the perceived shortcomings of America’s friends instead of the threats posed by the country’s adversaries, Rubio revealed not only the Trump administration’s flawed diagnosis of this geopolitical moment but its dangerously naive strategy for managing what is becoming—thanks largely to Trump—a treacherously multipolar world.

Femke Kok and Jutta Leerdam Power Speedskating-Mad Nation To Glory

Before the Olympic 500-m women’s speedskating competition on early Sunday evening in Milan, the orange-clad Dutch enthusiasts at the venue—about 94.7% of long-track fans here have Holland connections—had no problem sharing their desired outcome of this race. They wanted a flip-flop.
Jutta Leerdam, who broke the Olympic record on Feb. 9 in the 1000 m—and, you likely have heard, is engaged to social media influencer-slash-boxer Jake Paul—already had her gold. Hopefully, she’d finish second in the 500, which is the strong suit of her teammate, Femke Kok, the 1000-m silver medalist. The Dutch were all-in on Kok for the shorter sprint. It was time for Kok to claim her prize.
Plus, many Dutch supporters don’t seem all that enamored with Leerdam’s famous fiancée. “He’s a little too extra for the Dutch,” says Yvette Reijtenbagh, who was wearing an orange beanie embroidered with the Netherlands flag. (When I asked her if she was from the Netherlands, she replied dryly, “No. Iceland.”)

“He’s showboaty,” says Else Baartman, 57, a secretary who lives in the northern part of the country. “He’s a little over the top,” notes Daniel Houben, a 37-year-old actuary from Holland who now lives in Switzerland. Perhaps Houben caught Paul’s entry into the Milan Speed Skating Stadium, surrounded by an entourage a half-dozen deep, including two humongous security guards and a guy filming his every move.
Unlike in the men’s 500 and 1000 races, which American Jordan Stolz won over Dutch rival Jenning de Boo in dramatic fashion, Team Netherlands left satisfied on Sunday. Kok, who has been dominating the 500 all season long, broke an Olympic record of her own; her time of 36.49 seconds is also the new fastest-ever time at sea level. Her margin of victory over silver medalist Leerdam, .66 seconds, is the largest in the 500-event since the 1972 Games in Sapporo, Japan.
“We are a really small country,” says Kok. “But we can do speedskating.”
No doubt. Stolz’s chase of four gold medals is gobbling up most of the sport’s Olympics headlines. But between long-track and short-track, the Netherlands tops the table in Milan: the Dutch have won 5 golds, and 11 total medals (Italy is second, with 3 golds and 5 total, respectively).
American Erin Jackson, the defending Olympic champion, finished fifth. She was paired with Kok in the final group. Jackson’s strong first 100-m—she called it the best start of her career—had her in medal contention. But Jackson stumbled out of a turn and couldn’t make up enough time to reach the podium. “For her to be able to basically do what I did last Olympic cycle, come in ranked number one, winning consistently, and then to do it at the Olympics, yeah, it's really awesome,” says Jackson.
The Dutch champions are cut from different cloths. Kok has a lower-key public presence than her teammate. Her Instagram posts mostly feature ice life: one thumbnail shows in a produce section. You can find Leerdam, however, on a private plane, lounging at a resort with Paul, or in a fashion shoot. That may explain, in part, why Leerdam has 6.2 million followers on the platform, while Kok has 285,000.
They do express admiration for one another. “We wanted to push each other to the highest level,” says Kok. With a pair of Olympic records in hand, mission accomplished. “She’s a different person than me, but we're still good, you know?” says Kok. “In the beginning, when we came up, the media was like making it, ‘oh, she's this, you're that. But we're not like this. We have respect.”
It helps that Leerdam, who will leave Milan with a pair of medals, has wholly earned her celebrity. “She’s a phenom,” says American Sarah Warren. “She had a ton of eyes on her, and she put it down, and she stood up to the pressure.”
Leerdham navigates a different set of challenges than her competitors, namely tabloid attention. “It's not always easy, especially with the media, because they want stories, and if they don't have stories, they make up stories,” she says. “That is sometimes hard to deal with as an athlete, if you just want to focus on skating fast or on your races.” Leerdam cites a rumor claiming that she and Stolz were training together. She actually thought this was a good idea, so she and Stolz did skate a few laps, she says, about a week or so ago.
Someone asked Leerdham, now that the competition is over, if she planned on enjoying Milan in the coming days. “I don't really know yet what the plan is,” says Leerdham. “We will see.”
Odds are, we’ll all find out soon enough.

Katie’s story: her abusive ex-partner said ‘kill yourself’. When she did, police dropped domestic violence inquiry

Hours before Katie Madden took her own life, she had a tense phone call with her former partner Jonathon Russell. Russell was on bail after allegedly assaulting Madden – he was banned from contacting her – but the conversation took place nevertheless.
There was a witness to the call who gave evidence to the inquest into Madden’s death. Mason Jones, a friend of Madden’s, said Russell was “vile” and “abusive”. Although Jones said he could not remember the exact words Russell used, he said: “I recall Jon saying at least once that he was in control of the town and would end her life if she didn’t do it herself.”
In evidence, Russell denied saying this, but he did admit he had encouraged Madden to kill herself before this.
In the days leading up to Madden’s death, her mother, Bernadette Sutton, had told police and social services that she was concerned about the threat Russell posed to her daughter. “By this point, I thought he would kill her or she would take her own life,” Sutton said, in a statement.
Nigel Parsley, the coroner, concluded that Madden died by suicide while the balance of her mind was disturbed, but he also cited her relationship with Russell, with whom she had two children, as a contributory factor.
“Kate’s toxic relationship, in conjunction with Kate’s known mental health conditions, affected her state of mind and therefore contributed to her death,” he said.
The circumstances surrounding Madden’s death are no doubt tragic, but they are also an example of an increasingly controversial area of UK justice, one which has been described as a blind spot in the law’s ability to see the growing numbers of suicides among domestic abuse victims as something more: evidence of potential crimes.
Analysis seen by the Guardian suggests that growing numbers of victims of domestic violence are taking their own lives. Campaigners are now calling for the circumstances that led to these deaths to be investigated.
The Guardian recently reported on the case of Georgia Barter, whose suicide after a decade-long campaign at the hands of her former partner Thomas Bignell was judged by a coroner to be unlawful killing – only the second time in English legal history that such a conclusion has been reached. Despite this, no police investigation into Bignell’s role in Barter’s death has ever been launched and the Crown Prosecution Service says there is insufficient evidence to bring charges.
Inquests have a different burden of proof to criminal courts, finding on the balance of probabilities, rather than the criminal threshold of beyond reasonable doubt. There is no criminal due process and nobody is convicted or acquitted.
In Katie Madden’s case, although the coroner acknowledged that a toxic relationship contributed to her death, he did not make any finding of unlawful killing. Almost two years on, Madden’s family say Russell has not been investigated in relation to any of the inquest findings or any alleged abuse. This is despite admitting at the inquest that he gave Madden a black eye weeks before she died.
Police closed the assault investigation just days after Madden was found hanged at her home in Lowestoft, Suffolk. “The idea that it would just be dropped because she died – it should never be the case,” her mother says.
‘Her happy ever after’
“You just couldn’t have wished for a better mum and person,” Sutton says of her daughter. “She was very generous. She would give anybody her last penny. She would give anybody a lift.”
Growing up, Sutton remembers her daughter as a “bundle of fun and a very lively girl” who often had her head in a book. It was when Madden was about 12 that Sutton noticed a “massive change” in her daughter. “She wouldn’t get out of bed,” Sutton says. “She wouldn’t tell me anything.” Much later, Sutton discovered Madden had been sexually abused.
As her teenage years passed, Madden began drinking heavily and going missing. Sutton felt powerless to protect her daughter and she spent a brief period in care. At 16, she dropped out of school after becoming pregnant with her first child, she began self-harming and using cannabis. She also tried to take an overdose – her first attempt at suicide.
She was diagnosed with anxiety, depression, borderline personality disorder and emotionally unstable personality disorder. Sutton says Madden had spells of stability, was devoted to her children, and eventually got her own house in Lowestoft.
However, she also recalls that many people “took advantage” of her daughter, using her home to drink alcohol and take drugs. “Most of Katie’s friends, I wouldn’t even call friends, I would call them acquaintances,” Sutton says. “She never really understood how vulnerable she was. I said to her: ‘Can you not see that these people are taking advantage of you and your roof over their heads?’”
However, by late 2016, Sutton remembers Madden as being in a “good place”. It was then she met Russell. She told her mother she thought she had finally got her “happy ever after”.
Throughout the course of our three-hour interview, Sutton refuses to say Russell’s name, describing him only as the “alleged perpetrator”. She recalls being uneasy in his company from the outset. When she first met her daughter’s new partner over a meal, she says she “wasn’t 100%” but tried to convince herself she was being overprotective. “Mothers sit on the fence to begin with,” she says.
Madden soon fell pregnant with the couple’s first child, who was born in 2018. It was around this time she received a disclosure through Clare’s law, otherwise known as the domestic violence disclosure scheme, warning Madden of Russell’s past.
At Madden’s inquest, Russell agreed that he had “significant previous involvement” with the police, including one conviction for “physically assaulting a woman”.
A referral was made to a multi-agency safeguarding hub in light of the Clare’s law disclosure but the case was closed before any safety planning took place. In evidence, a senior social worker from Suffolk county council’s adult social services said this was because it looked like “a misdirected referral” as it did not indicate Madden “was subject to abuse or a crime”.
In a statement, the local authority said “lessons were learned by all agencies” after Madden’s death and added that it had “strengthened” its referral process “ensuring that safeguarding concerns about parents and children are shared promptly and appropriately” between departments. The council also said it had introduced “domestic abuse workers with dedicated training to better support adults in a child’s life who may be experiencing domestic violence”.
Madden had a second child with Russell in 2020. From this point, Sutton recalls, their relationship was “on and off”, something she remembers her daughter found hard to navigate. “Katie fell in love, this was her happy ever after,” Sutton says. “And suddenly it’s all [fallen] apart for a number of reasons.”
The next few years were punctuated by mental health crises. In November 2021, Madden spent four weeks in intensive care after crashing her car into a brick wall, scared her children would be removed from her. In June 2022, she asked for the children to be taken into care. “Katie’s children were her everything, but she felt that she was fighting so many battles,” Sutton says. A clinical psychologist suggested Madden would benefit from specialist cognitive behavioural therapy but she never received funding for it from any of the public services she was in touch with.
Sutton told the inquest that during this time, Madden was “fenced off” by Russell, and would sometimes spend days in bed without her phone as Russell “would smash it”. The inquest was also told that, in February 2023, Russell struck Madden on the face with her phone. Two months later, the court heard, Madden arrived at a contact meeting with her children with a cut to her eye and told Sutton she had been assaulted by Russell after a night out.
At the inquest, Russell accepted he had given Madden a black eye. He had been arrested on suspicion of assault occasioning actual bodily harm and forbidden from contacting her.
In the weeks that followed, Madden’s mental health problems spiralled. On 3 June, Sutton contacted her daughter to make arrangements for a picnic in the park with her children. Madden simply replied with a love heart.
The following evening, Sutton’s doorbell rang. It was a police officer. She knew instinctively what had happened. “I told her that she didn’t need to tell me,” Sutton says. “I told her what she’d come for.”
‘I said, go kill yourself’
Mason Jones was one of the last people to see Madden alive. In a statement, he told the inquest that he had only been friendly with her for about a month before she died. On the morning of 3 June, he recalled waking up to a string of messages from Madden, who seemed upset by some social media posts suggesting that Russell was with another woman in a hotel. At 7am, Madden and Jones went on a drive. Jones said he wanted to buy drugs to manage pain related to a medical condition.
Jones recalled that Russell “seemed to instigate” contact with Madden, despite his bail conditions. In his evidence, Russell claimed Madden called him. In response to Jones’s allegation that Russell said he was “in control of the town and would end [Madden’s] life if she didn’t do it herself”, Russell became agitated. “I didn’t say that,” he replied. “Get me the evidence … I wouldn’t say that. I’m a father. Why would I say that?”
He was asked by the coroner what the “general contents” of the call were. He said: “It was very erratic at the start. She was crying … she was just very panicky … I tried to reassure her but then it escalated into an argument. I ended up saying bad stuff.”
The coroner asked if Russell had told Madden she should hang herself. “I didn’t say hang herself,” he said. “There was a couple of references where I said, go kill yourself. Instantly, I went back on myself, and said, don’t be silly, don’t do that.”
Jones said he and Madden went to another friend’s house, where Madden “continued to argue” with Russell by phone before returning home. At about 12.45pm, she sent a message to Jones which read: “Thanks for putting up with me.”
Later that afternoon, Joe Hart, a friend of Russell’s, visited Madden’s home as she was looking after his dog. He told the inquest that Russell had told him Madden had “a noose around her neck”, but said: “At the time, I didn’t think it was a serious statement.”
Hart did not get a reply at Madden’s house. He threw an empty milkshake bottle at her bedroom window to try to get her attention but there was no response.
Neither man alerted the police, or Madden’s family. Hart said this was “because of what Katie was like … she’d quite regularly go off the map after she’d been wrecked”.
Russell disputed knowing Madden had a noose around her neck. He told the inquest: “She said that she was going to kill herself, she didn’t say she had a noose around her neck.”
When Russell was asked if he had failed to raise the alarm because he wanted Madden dead, he said: “You shouldn’t be speaking like that. I’ve got two children with her. Come on, man, that’s wrong. I didn’t want her dead. I dream about her every single day.”
Hart returned to the property at about 5pm on 4 June, the inquest heard. He said he contacted Russell, who encouraged him to break in if there was no response. When he entered the house, Hart found Madden hanged and called the emergency services.
‘There is no better detective than a mother’
On the way to Madden’s home, PC Bradley Congleton was told there was a history of domestic violence between Madden and Russell, which had culminated in a live assault investigation. He recovered Madden’s phone from the property. When he charged it, he told the inquest, he found messages from Russell encouraging Madden to kill herself. “There is no doubt in my mind, that is what he said to her,” Congleton said.
Congleton’s focus appears to have been on preparing a timeline of what had happened at the actual scene. In his evidence, Congleton said he considered it a priority to trace Russell to check his movements. At first, Russell would only speak to Congleton through an open window, the officer said. He recalled Russell saying that Madden had told him in her last hours that she “didn’t want to be alive any more” and was “intoxicated through drink and drugs”. Russell told Congleton he had been concerned but not been able to attend the address due to his bail conditions.
“I just cannot even begin to think how Katie was feeling,” Sutton says. “I know she was feeling hopeless … she was made to believe that everything was her fault.”
About a fortnight after Madden’s death, when Sutton was clearing out her daughter’s house, a letter arrived from the police, addressed to Madden. It said the assault case against Russell was being dropped.
“They must have known that Katie passed away,” Sutton says. “And they sent her that letter for me to open. And I was so upset, angry and cross about it, I ripped it up and I was so gutted that I did.”
Sutton says she contacted police as she had “a gut feeling there was more harm” in her daughter’s case. She was given Madden’s phone. “I read and listened to her messages,” she told the inquest. She described Russell’s messages as “awful”. “He told her to kill herself,” she told the court. “This is something he had said on many occasions.”
“There is no better detective than a mother,” Sutton says. “What Katie was saying would haunt me for the rest of my life. I just remember Katie saying in one of those voice notes, ‘You are giving me more reason to do it. You are not welcome at my funeral.’”
Sutton said she wanted police to review Madden and Russell’s communications in case they were able to build a case against Russell for coercive control; she claims officers told her they only had the capacity to examine a month’s worth of data. She recalls an officer who tried to “reassure us as a family” that the information about Russell would be held on file. “That’s no good to me,” she says.
The Guardian sent Suffolk police a series of questions about Madden’s case. The force said it was unable to answer them as her death was the subject of a domestic homicide review that had yet to conclude. Domestic homicide reviews examine the deaths of adults suspected to have suffered violence, abuse or neglect at the hands of a partner or family member. They are intended to identify lessons for the multiple agencies involved, rather than decide on whether any criminal investigation is merited.
The Guardian was not able to reach Russell for comment.
Madden was cremated in an intimate family ceremony. “She was never the centre of attention,” Sutton says. “She would never have wanted to be on parade.”
‘How many more women have got to die?’
After Madden’s inquest Parsley, the coroner, issued a prevention of future deaths report addressed to the police, social services, the NHS, the home office and the Department for Health. He said there was “no formal system in place” to support Madden, even though she was “known to be vulnerable” after the Clare’s law disclosure and that multi-agency safeguarding referrals made in respect of her children were “viewed in isolation, with no system in place to assess any additional risks posed to Kate herself”.
He said that the public bodies Madden was in contact with each suggested another should pay for her cognitive behavioural therapy, which she ultimately never received.
Sutton, who works in the NHS, says she hopes lessons will be learned after the tragedy and criticised “the lack of communication, the lack of empathy, the lack of professional curiosity, the lack of risk assessment, the lack of the standard stuff that should be happening” when it comes to dealing with alleged victims of domestic abuse.
Despite the police finding messages on Madden’s phone from Russell in which he told her to kill herself, the Guardian understands no police investigation into their relationship or the circumstances surrounding her death has been launched since her inquest.
“How many more women have got to die?” Sutton says. “Whether they take their own lives, or whether someone takes their life for them, how many more women, before something is done? How bad does it have to get before someone is prosecuted?”

Revealed: The true toll of female suicides in UK with domestic abuse at their core

The number of women who are driven to suicide by domestic abusers is being under-reported, and their cases overlooked by police, in what has been described by experts as a “national scandal”.
Domestic violence suicides are already growing at such a rate that a woman in an abusive relationship is now more likely to take her own life than be killed by a partner.
But research into the number of women who take their own life in such circumstances has suggested official statistics could track as few as 10% of the true number of cases.
According to the Domestic Homicide Project, a programme led by the National Police Chiefs’ Council (NPCC), there were 98 suspected suicides following domestic abuse in 2024, compared to 80 intimate partner homicides.
But research by a suicide prevention programme in Kent found that 33% of all suspected suicides in the region between 2018 and 2024 were affected by domestic abuse.
If the numbers in Kent reflect the national picture, it could mean as many as 900 victims of domestic abuse are taking their own lives every year – up to 10 times as many as previously thought.
Tim Woodhouse, the programme manager and a University of Kent academic, who led the research, said: “We need some sort of national taskforce to get a grip on this,” adding that it was “bonkers that we are basing national estimates on one researcher’s evidence”.
He said his work was “just trying to open people’s eyes that this is happening way more often than people think – it is, in terms of numbers, a national scandal”.
The data collected by the NPCC, he said, was a “good start”, but “they’re not counting very many of the right suicides, they’ve got very tight exclusion criteria so they’re massively underplaying the number”.
Recording domestic suicides is just one part of campaigners’ struggle to have causes of death in these cases more thoroughly investigated. It remains the case that there has only been one criminal conviction for manslaughter in UK legal history where a woman has died by suicide following domestic abuse.
Lawyers believe this number also shows coroners may have been too quick to dismiss deaths as suicides without properly considering whether they could be unlawful killings.
Campaigners have called for all suicides where domestic abuse is suspected to be investigated as potential homicides from the outset, in order to ensure the best evidence is collected and preserved, as well as more multi-agency work to protect victims from abusers in the first place.
To illustrate the scale of the crisis, the Guardian is publishing a series of pieces about the people, most of them women, who have died by suicide following domestic abuse.
In the case of Georgia Barter, her suicide after a decade-long campaign at the hands of her former partner Thomas Bignell was judged by a coroner to be unlawful killing.
An inquest in Walthamstow, north-east London, heard evidence that Bignell had kicked, stamped on and sexually assaulted Barter, but he was never charged with any offences in relation to his alleged abuse. Despite the coroner’s findings, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) has previously said there is insufficient evidence to bring charges.
Today we also reveal the case of Katie Madden. At an inquest, her former partner Jonathon Russell admitted he had given Madden a black eye and, hours before her death, told her to commit suicide. No criminal investigation into Russell’s role in Madden’s death has been launched.
In many cases, prosecutors do not see a basis for investigating wrongdoing and fail to bring any criminal charges at all after a domestic abuse suicide. It means alleged abusers are rarely investigated for offences such as violence or coercive control – despite a wealth of evidence often being presented to a coroner in an inquest. Families have also found police have dropped domestic abuse investigations after the victim has died.
Pragna Patel of Project Resist said: “Too many bereaved families who have lost loved ones to domestic abuse-related suicides are being failed by a criminal justice system that is not fit for purpose.” Her organisation has brought together bereaved families to launch a campaign to seek changes in the criminal justice system.
“At the heart of the injustice is not the failure of training, the absence of ‘professional curiosity’ or the lack of laws, but a systemic culture of discrimination, arrogance, indifference and apathy,” she added.
More recently, there have been concerted efforts from the NPCC and the Crown Prosecution Service to bring charges in such cases.
There are now two men being prosecuted for manslaughter following a suicide after domestic abuse, and both organisations have stressed they are keen to bring more cases to court.
However, lawyers, campaigners and families have said there are issues with individual police forces and officers failing to understand the impact of domestic abuse or to adequately investigate cases immediately after a death.
“Sadly, police forces too often miss opportunities to disrupt escalating domestic abuse and protect victims,” Kate Ellis, the joint head of litigation at the Centre for Women’s Justice, said.
“Too often we see police forces failing to take any criminal action against perpetrators, or consider protective measures that could be put in place, even when domestic abuse cases are graded as high risk. These errors can have fatal consequences.”
“We believe that some domestic abuse-related suicides are preventable, particularly in cases where the police are on notice of the abuse,” she added. “Coercive and controlling relationships tend to follow similar patterns, so it is vital that police identify these patterns and act quickly.
“We are also concerned that many suicides in apparent domestic abuse contexts are not recognised or investigated by the police as potential homicides, even when there is significant evidence of prior domestic abuse.”
Southall Black Sisters has been campaigning for abuse-related suicide to be recognised as homicide for more than 40 years, and introduced an amendment in the crime and policing bill, supported by more than 50 MPs.
The organisation has specifically raised concerns about the possible overrepresentation of suicide driven by domestic abuse and “honour”-based abuse within Black, minority and migrant communities.
“Women in these communities have additional barriers to overcome in order to escape abuse caused by intersecting racism and misogyny,” Hannana Siddiqui, the director of policy, campaigns and research, said.
To date, there has only been one criminal conviction for manslaughter where a woman has died by suicide following domestic abuse. Nicholas Allen pleaded guilty to the charge in 2017 after his former partner Justene Reece took her own life. Allen had stalked her after she left him and moved to a women’s refuge.
In March, Ryan Wellings was cleared of the manslaughter of Kiena Dawes by a jury at Preston crown court. Dawes took her own life, leaving a note on her phone saying: “Slowly … Ryan Wellings killed me.” Wellings was convicted of assault and coercive and controlling behaviour, and jailed for six and a half years.
Georgia Barter’s mother, Kay, said: “It’s been almost six long heartbreaking years since I lost my beautiful daughter Georgia. Still the fight for justice goes on. I would like to ask this government ‘when did this country stop respecting or protecting women and girls?’ Now is the time to show them you care.”
She added: “The only successful conviction for manslaughter where a person’s partner died by suicide was in 2017 almost ten years ago. That is shocking. I’m sure I speak for myself and the countless grieving families out there – we demand change now.”
Frank Mullane from the campaign group Advocacy after Fatal Domestic Abuse (AAFDA) said: “It might not be enough to rely on the police improving their investigations and the CPS optimising its prosecution, to ensure perpetrators face justice after domestic abuse related suicides.
“The defence team will exploit the merest mention of mental health difficulties and the jury may struggle to convict for manslaughter. A new law, specific to suicide caused by domestic abuse, will make it easier for the jury to identify causation. It will give confidence to the CPS to bring cases and it will educate the public.”

Leading Australian musicians share how this competition boosted their careers

How the ABC Young Performers Awards helped launch the careers of these Australian musicians
The ABC Young Performers Awards have been running since 1944. The competition has launched the career of some of Australia's most successful musicians.
Many have achieved recognition on international stages, including composer and violist Brett Dean, pianist Simon Tedeschi, percussionist Claire Edwardes, violinist Emily Sun and more.
In 2026, the Young Performers Awards have returned to ABC Classic.
To find out what it's like to be in the competition, we spoke to past winners about their preparation, journey through the rounds and the opportunities the awards unlocked.
Percussionist Claire Edwardes on preparing to compete
Loading...Claire Edwardes is one of Australia's most recognisable percussionists.
She's particularly respected for her work championing contemporary classical music by women and other marginalised voices.
Edwardes is the Artistic Director of contemporary classical group Ensemble Offspring.
She entered the competition in 1999 while waiting to start her postgraduate degree in the Netherlands.
"The competition gave me something to focus on and work towards," Edwardes says.
In 1999, being a percussionist wasn't something many aspiring musicians considered as a career choice, so Edwardes competed in a category known as "other instruments".
But she went above and beyond to prepare her repertoire.
"I wrote out by hand a piano reduction of Joseph Schwantner's Concerto for Percussion and orchestra, because it really showed the breadth of all the different things I was capable of," Edwardes says.
She even sought some advice from Christopher Lamb, an American percussionist who premiered the music in 1995.
Edwardes won against serious contenders, including pianist Andrea Lam and violinist Alexandra Osborne, who are both also highly successful musicians today.
The percussionist spent the next seven years playing as a soloist with all of the symphony orchestras around Australia.
"That never would have happened if I hadn't won the Young Performers Awards," she says.
Violinist Emily Sun on how the competition boosted her career
Loading...Emily Sun is an internationally sought-after violinist who regularly performs on some of the world's most beautiful stages including here in Australia.
She first became known to audiences through the 2011 documentary Mrs Carey's Concert, which followed a group of students preparing for a major performance at the Sydney Opera House.
Sun has a long history of involvement with the Young Performers Awards, being one of the finalists in 2011 and finally winning the competition in 2018.
"Winning the YPA [Young Performers Awards] marked a huge turning point for me in my performing career," Sun says.
"It gave me the confidence and opportunities to perform across Australia in concerto, recital and chamber settings."
As part of the prize, Sun became ABC Classic's Artist in Residence, which included recording an album and appearing in features on air and digital platforms.
"I definitely came out of it as a different artist," Sun says.
Her success has grown beyond the competition.
In 2023, Sun became a custodian of The Adelaide, a rare 250-year-old Italian violin crafted by famed luthier Giovanni Battista Guadagnini.
Clarinettist Lloyd Van't Hoff on the musicians he met
Loading...Clarinettist Lloyd Van't Hoff, who won the competition in 2015, says that his biggest takeaway was making connections with other musicians.
Van't Hoff grew up in Charters Towers in Far North Queensland. Meeting a dedicated and inspiring music teacher when he was 11 changed his life.
His family moved to Brisbane so Van't Hoff could pursue tertiary studies at the Queensland Conservatorium of Music and the Australian National Academy of Music (ANAM) in Melbourne.
When he decided to audition for the Young Performers Awards, Van't Hoff was "really at a loss" after finishing his studies.
"I felt this expectation from my peers, teachers and family who had all invested in my musical education," he shares.
Even though Van't Hoff initially felt intimidated by the prospect of the competition, he gave it a go.
"[Luckily], I had all of this repertoire that felt pretty cozy," he says.
In 2015, most of the rounds took place in Tasmania.
Professional musicians collaborated with competitors on the semifinal chamber music rounds, and the Tasmanian Symphony Orchestra played with the grand finalists.
"A lot of the people I met during the competition were people who then opened doors for me."
He was invited to collaborate with more established ensembles such as the Flinders Quartet, and formed his own group, the Arcadia wind quintet.
Van't Hoff says there was "a tremendous sense of camaraderie" between the competitors of the Young Performers Awards.
"We're all friends for life," Van't Hoff says.
Flautist Eliza Shephard on the knock-on effects from winning
Loading...The most recent Young Performers Awards winner from 2022, flautist Eliza Shephard, is carving a path to be one of Australia's most exciting performers.
She's also an educator, improviser and recording artist.
"I'm loud and proud about my [love of] contemporary music," Shephard says.
Shephard's most influential teacher, Virginia Taylor, was herself a Young Performers Awards winner in 1988.
By the time Shephard entered the competition, she had already completed postgraduate studies at ANAM, as well as a four-month-long course in New York focusing on contemporary flute-playing technique, which influenced her repertoire choices.
While most musicians completed the competition within a year, Shephard's cohort had to navigate COVID-19 lockdowns and pandemic restrictions.
It turned the competition into "a long, drawn-out process", Shephard says.
To comply with the pandemic restrictions, the competitors had to be recorded and filmed performing to empty studios.
"I asked if I could have someone there just so it would feel like a performance," Shephard shares.
The ABC allowed each performer to bring a support person to their semifinal and grand final rounds, on the condition that they wouldn't interrupt the recording process.
Shephard's youngest sibling came to support her.
"They had to wear a mask, and they weren't allowed to clap," Shephard remembers.
"At the end of each piece, they used the Auslan sign for applause."
Shephard says the biggest lesson she learnt from the competition was how to showcase who she is as a musician through her repertoire choices, technique and curatorial ability.
Beyond the Young Performers Awards, Shephard has spearheaded the March of the Women, a recording project now entering its seventh year.
The project aims to increase the representation of female composers and championing female flute players.
Shephard recently commissioned six Australian female composers to write new music for her, enabled through the cash prize she received from the Young Performers Awards.
"A portion of my winnings went to help fund percentages of these commissions," Shephard says.
"The YPA [Young Performers Awards] had a big knock-on effect in my career, which is very amazing to sit and be with."
Entries are now open for the ABC Young Performers Awards for musicians 31 years and under.

MOSCOW, February 15. /TASS/. Two new mpox cases have been confirmed in Russian tourists who arrived from Thailand, St. Petersburg’s regional directorate of Russia’s consumer rights watchdog Rospotrebnadzor said.
"Rospotrebnadzor’s regional directorate for St. Petersburg and the Leningrad Region informs that two mpox cases have been confirmed in citizens who returned from vacationing in Thailand," it said.
The two have been taken to an infectious diseases hospital, it said adding that they are in satisfactory condition.
According to Rospotrebnadzor, their contacts have been placed under medical supervision.
"The infection’s propagation has been prevented," it said but warned that risks of mpox imports still exist.
Earlier, three mpox cases were confirmed in the Moscow Region. One of the patients has already been discharged from hospital, the other two continue receiving treatment.
Mpox, formerly known as monkeypox, is a rare viral disease endemic to remote regions near tropical forests in Central and Western Africa. The first case of an animal transmitting the disease to humans was recorded in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 1970. According to the WHO, this virus is usually transmitted to humans by wild animals, such as rodents and primates, while its secondary spread among humans is limited. Usually the lethality coefficient during mpox outbreaks ranges from 1% to 10% with the majority of fatalities affecting younger age groups.
Mpox is most often accompanied by a skin rash or mucosal lesions, which can last from two to four weeks. Additional symptoms include fever, headache, muscle aches, back pain, low energy and swollen lymph nodes.

4 killed in Israeli drone strike targeting vehicle along Lebanese-Syrian border
Israeli military says strike hit Islamic Jihad operatives in Majdal Anjar area
ISTANBUL
Four people were killed Sunday evening in an Israeli drone strike targeting a vehicle in the eastern Lebanese town of Majdal Anjar near the Lebanese-Syrian border despite a ceasefire, Lebanon’s official National News Agency reported.
The agency said an Israeli drone struck a car between the al-Masnaa border crossing and the village of Jdeidet Yabous, along the Lebanon-Syria border, resulting in fatalities and an unidentified number of injuries.
The sound of four strong explosions was reported heard in nearby villages, the agency added.
The Israeli military said in a statement that it carried out a strike against members of the Islamic Jihad Movement in the Majdal Anjar area of Lebanon.
There was no comment from the group on the incident.
The attacks come amid repeated Israeli violations of a ceasefire agreement reached in November 2024.
Israel continues to occupy five Lebanese hilltops seized during the latest war that began in October 2023, in addition to other Lebanese areas it has held for decades.
The offensives have killed more than 4,000 victims and wounded 17,000 in Lebanon.

Nazi era and Hitler socially acceptable again? Berlin 1936 Olympic T-shirt controversy explained

The T-shirt sold on the Olympic Games' online stores has caused widespread controversy across Germany as people accused the IOC of dismissing brutal Nazi-era and Adolf Hitler association.
The Men's "Natural 1936 Berlin Games Olympic Heritage T-Shirt" is sold out in the online Olympic shop. It was listed on the online store for 39 euros and has caused controversy after fans criticised selling merchandise related to what are referred to as the "Nazi Games".
German outlet Der Tagesspiegel emphasises that people who purchased the clothing article appear to have been drawn in by the design and that "it can be assumed that the vast majority of wearers do not want to use the shirt to draw critical attention to the Nazi propaganda show."
The T-shirt however, due to the political context of the 1936 Berlin games, is likely to be very popular among neo-Nazis and right-wing extremists.
Green Party politician Klara Schedlich has called on the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to stop selling the T-shirt.
"IOC, are you serious?" and "Propaganda as Olympic merchandise?", asked the 26-year-old politician.
"This shows that the IOC has absolutely no understanding of history," says Schedlich, who is also against Berlin's renewed bid for the Olympics.
According to Deutsche Welle, the T-shirt shows an excerpt from the original poster that Franz Würbel designed for Adolf Hitler in 1936 to promote the games.
Are Nazi symbols becoming socially acceptable?
In the USA, Elon Musk has shown the Hitler salute and repeatedly supported the right-wing populist AfD. He has also called for Germany to leave the past behind.
The billionaire was also summoned by the French judiciary in April for denying the Holocaust on his platform X.
High-ranking US Border Patrol agent Greg Bovino, who has since been removed from Minnesota by US President Donald Trump, wears a coat that reminds many of the SS uniforms of the Nazi era.
Nazi symbols outlawed in Germany
Thuringia's AfD party leader Björn Höcke has already been convicted twice for using a Nazi slogan, but the court decisions against him are not yet final. Höcke is therefore still allowed to appear in public.
In Germany, references, even hidden ones, that publicise the Nazi era are prohibited. For example, the letters SS may not appear on car licence plates.
Under National Socialism, SS stood for "Schutzstaffel" and was initially Hitler's bodyguard. It was later responsible for the persecution and murder of Jews and dissidents, the organisation of the death camps and for crimes committed during the Second World War.
The IOC does not want to withdraw the controversial T-shirt from its online stores. The historical problem of Nazi propaganda in connection with the 1936 Olympic Games in Berlin is being analysed at the Olympic Museum in Lausanne.
"At the same time, we must not forget that 4,483 athletes from 49 countries competed for medals in 149 events in Berlin," said an IOC press release.
The 1936 Berlin Games
The games exemplified Nazi racism across the board. It was widely reported that Adolf Hitler only wanted to shake hands with the German medallists at the 1936 Olympic Games. The IOC objected to this.
US athlete Jesse Owens, won the most medals in Berlin in 1936, taking gold in the 100 metres, 200 metres, the 4x100 metre relay and the long jump. In doing so, the then 22-year-old US athlete disproved the Nazis' racial ideology for all to see.
It is important not to forget the Holocaust and the crimes of National Socialism. However, with fewer and fewer contemporary witnesses able to recount the horrors of the Nazi era, this is becoming more difficult. This is why historical context is needed - including that of the 1936 Olympic Games.

The chilling moment elderly man abducted from Sydney home as hostage video released
CCTV footage has captured the moment an 85-year-old was abducted from his northern Sydney home on Friday morning, as the kidnapping suspected to be a case of mistaken identity enters its fourth day.
Chris Baghsarian, an elderly widower and grandfather, was abducted from the bedroom of his North Ryde property about 5am on Friday, prompting police to issue a direct plea to the abductors, who they believe kidnapped the wrong person. Baghsarian lives alone in his property.
Police found signs of forced entry to the home, and are investigating whether the intended target was a figure linked to the Alameddine organised crime network living nearby.
CCTV footage shows two men, one in a high-vis shirt and the other in a dark hoodie, exiting a dark SUV and striding towards Baghsarian’s property, triggering the sensor light at the front of the property. They then appear to force the elderly man out of the home while the getaway driver moves closer to the rest of the crew.
Neighbours called police after hearing a commotion at Baghsarian’s property on Friday morning. One witness, Felix Cho, told Nine News that he heard “screaming that just kept going”, as glass smashed and dogs barked before the vehicle drove down the street.
Video has since emerged of an injured Baghsarian at an unknown location.
Baghsarian is pictured in the video in the grey tracksuit pants and flannelette shirt he was wearing when he was abducted.
A vehicle matching the description of the getaway car was found burnt-out in South Turramurra shortly after the abduction.
Detective Acting Superintendent Andrew Marks said neither Baghsarian nor his family were involved in organised crime.
“They’re quite surprised that this has happened and what they want is the safe return of their father,” Marks said on Saturday.
“We always fear for the safety of the hostage.”
Concern for the elderly man’s welfare has intensified following the release of the video. He requires daily medication and medical treatment.
State crime detectives are being briefed on the kidnapping on Monday morning, as police continue to search for Baghsarian. Marks has urged the abductors to share the man’s whereabouts, saying they would do so if they have “any common decency”.

Iranian Foreign Minister heads to Geneva for renewed talks with US
Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi left for Geneva on Sunday, where talks between Iran and the United States are set to continue, his ministry said in a statement. According to the Foreign Ministry, these “indirect” talks will be held on Tuesday under the mediation of Oman, where a first session took place on February 6, and are expected to focus on Iran's nuclear program.
Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi headed to Switzerland on Sunday for the second round of renewed talks with the US later this week, his ministry said.
Araghchi "left Tehran for Geneva late Sunday heading a diplomatic and technical delegation to conduct the second round of nuclear talks and hold a number of diplomatic consultations," the ministry said in a statement.
"Indirect Iran-US nuclear talks will be held on Tuesday with the mediation and good offices of Oman."
During his visit to Geneva, Araghchi is expected to hold talks with his Swiss and Omani counterparts as well as the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Grossi, and other international officials, the foreign ministry statement said.

Tehran and Washington restarted negotiations in Muscat on February 6, months after previous talks collapsed when Israel launched an unprecedented bombing campaign against Iran last June that started a 12-day war.
Considerable uncertainty surrounds the fate of Iran's stockpile of more than 400 kilogrammes of 60 percent enriched uranium that was last seen by nuclear watchdog inspectors in June.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday that any deal between the two must involve the removal of all enriched uranium from Iran as well as Tehran's ability to enrich more.
"There should be no enrichment capability ... dismantle the equipment and the infrastructure that allows you to enrich in the first place," he said during a speech in Jerusalem.
Meanwhile, Iran's deputy foreign minister told the BBC that Tehran would consider compromises on its uranium stockpile if Washington lifts sanctions that have crippled the Islamic republic's economy.

"If we see the sincerity on their (American) part, I am sure we will be on a road to have an agreement," said Majid Takht-Ravanchi.
The latest talks came with Washington having threatened Tehran with military action and deployed an aircraft carrier group to the region following Iran's deadly crackdown on anti-government protests last month.
On February 6, Araghchi led the Iranian delegation in indirect nuclear talks with US Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff and US President Donald Trump's influential son-in-law Jared Kushner in Muscat.

Switzerland has played a key role in diplomatic relations between Iran and the US for decades.
It has represented US interests in Iran since Washington broke off relations with Tehran after the 1980 hostage crisis, a year after the Iranian revolution.
Iranian deputy foreign minister for economic diplomacy Hamid Ghanbari said Tehran was seeking a deal with the United States that would generate economic benefits for both countries, particularly in sectors such as aviation, mining and oil and gas, the Fars news agency reported.
"For the agreement to be viable, it is essential that the United States also be able to benefit from it in areas with strong and rapid economic return potential," he was quoted as saying.

Türkiye moves to regulate social media to protect children: family minister

Türkiye is getting ready to introduce new regulations to protect children on social media platforms, the country’s family and social services minister said on Sunday.
On the Turkish social media platform NSosyal, Mahinur Ozdemir Goktas said the government is close to putting the measures into effect, citing growing concerns about the impact of constant digital stimulation on children.
"Just like many countries around the world, we are very close to implementing social media regulations aimed at protecting our children," she said.
Goktas warned that people’s attention spans have dropped to about eight seconds, a trend she said harms children more than adults.
She added that children’s attention spans have declined by at least 30 percent over the past decade, impacting their concentration, friendships and academic performance.
These changes have also made teaching more difficult, she said, adding that similar social media rules for children are being debated or introduced in countries around the world.
She said Türkiye is working to create a safer internet environment for children, calling on parents and teachers to support the effort. "Together, we can make a safe internet possible for our children," she added.

At least 11 Palestinians killed in Israeli attacks across Gaza
US President Donald Trump says that the first meeting of his newly created ‘Board of Peace’ will take place on Thursday.
At least 11 Palestinians have been killed in the Gaza Strip in the latest Israeli attacks that continue in violation of the “ceasefire”, hospital sources have said.
Israeli forces targeted tents sheltering people in the Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza on Sunday, killing at least five Palestinians, hospital sources told Al Jazeera.

At least five others were killed in Israeli attacks west of Khan Younis in the south of the Strip, according to hospital sources.
Separately, Sami al-Dahdouh, a commander of the armed wing of Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), was killed in an Israeli attack in the Tal al-Hawa neighbourhood east of Gaza City.
Hamas spokesperson Hazem Qassem condemned the Israeli attacks as a “new massacre” and a “criminal escalation”.
He said they were a “clear attempt to impose a bloody reality on the ground and send a message that all efforts and bodies concerned with establishing calm in Gaza are meaningless, and that the occupation is continuing its aggression despite all parties speaking of the necessity of adhering to the ceasefire agreement”.
Israeli attacks have killed more than 600 Palestinians and wounded more than 1,600 others since the United States- and Qatar-mediated “ceasefire” between Israel and Hamas came into effect on 10 October, part of US President Donald Trump’s plan to end Israel’s two-year genocidal war against Palestinians in Gaza.
Israel has violated the “ceasefire” at least 1,620 times from October 10, 2025 to February 10, 2026, the Government Media Office in Gaza reports. Israel also accuses Hamas of violating the agreement. It says four soldiers have been killed.
Board of Peace
The latest attacks come as Trump announced that the first meeting of his newly created “Board of Peace” will take place on Thursday in Washington, DC.
Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social on Sunday that members have pledged more than $5bn towards rebuilding war-shattered Gaza, and committed “thousands of personnel to the International Stabilization Force and Local Police to maintain Security and Peace for Gazans.”
The US has asked countries to pay $1bn to join the Board of Peace, suggesting five countries may have already pledged to do so.
“There are reports that the United Arab Emirates has been the first to step forward with this billion-dollar pledge. There are also reports that Kuwait may be coming on board. That leaves three other countries, ostensibly, that have not been made public yet,” Al Jazeera’s Rosiland Jordan said.
It was not clear how many of the board’s 20 members would be in attendance at the meeting.
Initially envisaged as a mechanism for ending the Gaza war, Trump’s board has taken shape with his ambition for a much broader mandate of resolving conflicts around the world, in what appears to be a US attempt to bypass the United Nations.
Several key US allies have declined to join the board.
Trump also said in the post that “Hamas must uphold its commitment to Full and Immediate Demilitarization”.
Hamas’s Qassem called on the Board of Peace to pressure Israel to stop violating the ceasefire and “compel it to implement what was agreed upon without delay or manipulation”.

Hungary: Magyar launches anti-Orban election campaign
February 15, 2026Hungarian opposition leader Peter Magyar launched his party's election campaign in Budapest on Sunday, vowing to end the 16-year rule of Prime Minister Viktor Orban, tackle corruption and reorientate Hungary back towards western Europe.
Magyar, a former influential member of Orban's nationalist Fidesz party, took over leadership of the center-right Tisza party in 2024 and quickly established himself as the biggest challenge to Orban in over a decade.
In June 2024, Tisza – which is an abbreviation of the Hungarian words for "respect" (tisztelet) and "freedom" (szabadsag) – won around 30% of the vote in European Parliament elections and most independent polls show it with a significant lead ahead of election day on April 12.
"We're standing on the threshold of victory with 56 days left to go," Magyar told supporters in Budapest on Sunday. "Tisza stands ready to govern."
Hungary: who is Peter Magyar?
A 44-year-old former lawyer, Magyar has accused Orban's right-wing populist government of mismanaging Hungary's economy and social services, and of allowing corruption to run riot, leaving Hungary one of the poorest countries in the European Union.
"Not only has the Hungarian economy not taken off; it has hit a dead end," he said.
He has also criticized Orban's antagonism towards the EU and continuing proximity to Russian President Vladimir Putin despite Russia's ongoing invasion of neighboring Ukraine.
After holding meetings with several European leaders at the Munich Security Conference (MSC) over the weekend, he said he would put an end to Hungary's "drift out of the European Union" under Orban.
"Hungary's place is in Europe," he said. "Not only because Hungary needs Europe, but also because Europe needs Hungary."
However, he also reiterated that a Tisza government would continue to oppose any accelerated Ukrainian accession to the EU and retain a border fence erected by Orban in 2015 as part of a continuation of anti-immigration policies.
Hungary: Magyar pledges to combat corruption
Nevertheless, despite some EU-scepticism, Magyar has vowed to combat corruption and strengthen Hungary's democratic institutions and independent judiciary in order to regain access to billions of euros' worth of suspended EU funding.
"It is time to call corruption what it is: theft," he said, promising "total transparency in contracts involving public funds" and the "recovery" of all the money Hungary "has been deprived of over 16 years."
During the campaign so far, Magyar has specifically targeted Orban's traditional strongholds: small, conservative-leaning towns and villages across the country but far away from major cities like Budapest, focusing on bread and butter issues such as low wages and rapidly rising living costs.
He has challenged Orban to a TV debate – thus far without response – saying the "outgoing prime minister" is only capable of "agitation" and "threats," accusing him of spying on opponents.
"If they can search through my private life, then they can rummage through everyone's," said Magyar.
Orban: work only 'half done'
Opposition and rights groups regularly accuse Orban of silencing critical voices in the judiciary, academia and media, as well as cutting the rights of minority groups.
Just this weekend, local authorities in Budapest once again permitted the staging of the annual neo-Nazi "Day of Honor" gathering while clamping down on small anti-fascist counter-demonstrations instead.
The ruling Fidesz party hasn't published an official election manifesto, arguing that, after governing for 16 years, voters know what policies to expect.
Orban on Saturday vowed to press on with a crackdown on what he called "pseudo-civil organizations, bought journalists, judges, politicians," saying his work was only "half done."

Feb 15 - A contract worker died following an incident at Rio Tinto's SimFer mine at the Simandou iron ore project in Guinea, the world's largest producer of iron ore said late on Sunday, without providing further details.
The miner said work had been suspended at the SimFer mine site after the accident on Saturday. Chief Executive Simon Trott said he will travel to Guinea this week.
“Nothing is more important than the safety of everyone who works with us," Trott said. "We are determined to learn from this incident and to do everything we can to provide the safest possible workplace and prevent tragedies like this from happening.”
A Reuters review of internal documents, conducted last year, found six local workers had been killed between June 2023 and November 2024 in the construction of a port and a 670-kilometre railway leading to the mines in remote rural Guinea.
Since November 2024, at least two additional fatalities have been reported at the project.
A Rio Tinto spokesperson, asked about the Reuters findings last year, did not comment directly on the toll, but said in an emailed statement that the company was "working each and every day with our partners ... to share knowledge and expertise so safety is continuously improved across Simandou – which is a uniquely complex project."
Rio Tinto owns a 53% stake in the SimFer consortium, which holds the rights to half the vast Simandou concession - Blocks 3 and 4 - while Chinese state groups own the rest of the consortium.
A separate group led by Baowu Winning Consortium Simandou owns 85% of the operating company for the other half of the concession - Blocks 1 and 2. REUTERS

Extended war threat raises questions over IDF readiness

Nuclear negotiations between the United States and Iran are set to resume Tuesday in Switzerland, the same day the Muslim holy month of Ramadan begins, as defense officials warn of heightened tensions that could escalate into a broader regional conflict.
Security officials are preparing for what they describe as a potentially volatile period, while again cautioning about the growing burden on regular and reserve forces amid ongoing disputes over military conscription.
According to data presented in recent months by Brig. Gen. Shay Tayeb, head of the Planning Division in the IDF’s Personnel Directorate, the military is currently short at least 12,000 troops across units and roles, including about 7,500 combat soldiers. Cabinet Secretary Yossi Fuchs recently said that each additional regular battalion would reduce the need to deploy between four and seven reserve battalions.
In a recent meeting with newly enlisted ultra-Orthodox recruits, the head of the Personnel Directorate said the military must fill its ranks while enabling them to maintain their religious way of life. “The operational need requires us to fill the ranks,” he said.
Underscoring manpower challenges, the IDF announced last week the creation of a new multi-arena maneuver division, to be established from existing training bases within the Ground Forces. About 1,200 personnel, most of them reservists, have already joined its headquarters. The division is expected to conduct exercises over the coming year, including a large-scale drill. Its headquarters will operate from Julis Base near Ashkelon.
Security forces have also completed preparations for Ramadan. Unlike previous years, officials say terrorist activity in the West Bank has been steadily declining, and Central Command maintains control over refugee camps in the northern West Bank area. Ahead of Ramadan, special forces have carried out arrests, and police and the military have intensified efforts against terrorists and incitement, including identifying individuals viewed as potential sources of escalation.
Thousands of Palestinians from the West Bank are expected to travel to pray at the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound in Jerusalem, prompting heightened security measures. The military is reinforcing the separation barrier and known breach points, while police are assisting in efforts to detain individuals residing in Israel without permits. Additional security is being deployed to agricultural outposts and roads in the West Bank amid concerns over possible terrorist attacks.
In recent weeks, the IDF spokesperson has issued regular statements emphasizing readiness along all borders, saying forces are prepared “in defense and offense” and are closely monitoring developments across the Middle East.
Meanwhile, CBS reported that President Donald Trump told Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in December that he would support strikes on Iran’s ballistic missile program if a diplomatic agreement is not reached. The report said senior U.S. military and intelligence officials have since discussed how Washington could assist, including through aerial refueling and securing overflight permissions.
Diplomatic sources said Trump is weighing options ranging from rapid political change in Tehran to a prolonged military confrontation, which he is believed to prefer avoiding. According to the sources, if Iran is seen as delaying negotiations without seriousness, Washington could shift toward military action. Close coordination is ongoing between Washington and Jerusalem regarding possible scenarios, including U.S. requests for joint action, requests for Israel to refrain from involvement, or authorization for Israeli strikes on ballistic missile infrastructure.
Iran has signaled it is unwilling to discuss its missile program as part of the negotiations, viewing it as a core strategic asset. Defense assessments indicate Tehran is unlikely to relinquish that capability under U.S. pressure.
The missile threat remains central to security planning. During previous rounds of fighting, Israel faced hundreds of launches, intercepting most but sustaining damage, reinforcing concerns about attrition tactics aimed at exhausting air defense interceptors. Air defense units, composed of seven battalions operating across five layers, are on alert alongside U.S. forces and potentially other partners.
Pro-Iranian militias in Iraq, Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthi movement in Yemen have continued issuing threats in recent weeks, warning of consequences if Iran is attacked.

Sudanese army says it destroyed RSF air defense system in West Kordofan
Military says ‘heavy losses’ inflicted on paramilitary forces in Abu Zabad area
KHARTOUM, Sudan
Sudan's army said Sunday that it had destroyed an air defense system belonging to the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) in the West Kordofan state in the southern part of the country.
A military statement said that forces carried out a “qualitative operation” in the Abu Zabad area that resulted in the destruction of an RSF air defense system and inflicted “heavy losses in lives and equipment.”
The army did not provide further details about the operation or the scale of the reported losses.
It said its forces would continue operations “until the country is cleansed of the (RSF) militia.”
There was no comment from the rebel group as of yet.
In addition to the Darfur region, Sudan’s three Kordofan states -- North, West and South -- have seen heavy fighting between the Sudanese army and the RSF.
The conflict, which began in April 2023, has killed tens of thousands and displaced about 13 million people, creating one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises and famine conditions, according to UN reports.

WASHINGTON, February 15. /TASS/. The US administration has reassured Israel that it will support its strikes on Iran in case talks on the Iranian nuclear dossier fail, CBS news reported citing sources.
According to the sources, US President Donald Trump announced this position during a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at his Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida in late December 2025. High-ranking Pentagon and intelligence officers are considering potential support for Israel’s new strikes on Iran, the television channel said adding that these discussions are focused on how the United States can help. Refueling of Israeli warplanes and obtaining permissions for their flights over third countries are looked as potential options.
Trump stated on January 26 that Washington had sent a "big armada" towards Iran and expressed hope that Tehran would engage in dialogue and make a deal, renouncing nuclear weapons. The US leader warned that "the next attack will be far worse" than the summer 2025 strikes on Iran. "Don't make that happen again," he added.
Iran and the US held another round of talks on Tehran’s nuclear program in Oman on February 6. Tehran’s delegation was led by Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, and the US delegation was headed by Special Presidential Envoy Steve Witkoff.

Senior Jewish American leader William Darroff urges conservatives to confront Tucker Carlson

William Daroff, the CEO of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations, urged leaders in the American conservative movement to publicly condemn Tucker Carlson, comparing him to Charles Coughlin, the influential 1930s radio priest known for antisemitic broadcasts. Daroff spoke Sunday evening at a Jerusalem gathering attended by Benjamin Netanyahu, alongside American Jewish leaders visiting Israel as part of the Conference’s annual leadership mission.
In the remarks, Daroff described what he called a deepened bond between Israel and the United States since the October 7 attacks, telling Netanyahu that “American Jews and Israelis have felt their hearts beat as one.” He said the weeks after the Hamas attack produced a surge of unity, along with a harsher clarity about the threats facing Jewish communities.
Daroff then pivoted to Carlson, describing him as “the Father Coughlin of our age,” and argued that mainstream conservative leaders should respond the way Catholic authorities eventually did with Coughlin. “What stopped Father Coughlin was when the Catholic Church, which had supported him, stood up and stopped him and called him out,” Daroff said, according to a transcript and contemporaneous reporting. “Today, the American conservative movement should do exactly the same,” he added.
Coughlin, once among the most prominent voices on American radio, promoted antisemitic and pro-fascist themes during the 1930s, reaching a mass audience before his public activity was curtailed during World War II through pressure from both US authorities and church leadership.
'We are one people'
The Conference’s 51st national leadership mission, led by chair Betsy Berns Korn, brought senior representatives of its member organizations to Israel for meetings with political, military, and civic leaders, as well as briefings on the war and Israel’s strategic challenges.
In his speech, Daroff also framed Israel-Diaspora relations in peoplehood terms, telling the audience: “We are one people bound by shared destiny and responsibility.” He called unity between Israeli and American Jewry “essential,” and said that when one part of the Jewish world comes under attack, “all of us feel it.”
At the close of the event, Daroff thanked Netanyahu for what he called his “leadership” and “friendship” with the American Jewish community, and presented a sculpture to the prime minister on behalf of the delegation, describing it as a work by noted Jerusalem artist Sharon Binder. He also referenced former Conference leader Malcolm Hoenlein during the presentation.
Carlson, a former Fox News prime-time host who now runs his own interview and commentary platforms, has remained a major voice in US conservative media.

The 11th commandment: Choose it or lose it - opinion
Unknown
Unknown Publisher

05:29:21 KST

Last Shabbat, as I stood in the synagogue for the reading of the 10 Commandments, a sudden thought crossed my mind: Something is missing here!
The custom of reading aloud the 10 Commandments – the Decalogue – goes back to ancient times. In the Temple in Jerusalem, the 10 Commandments were part of the morning prayer service and were recited just before the saying of the “Shema.” Thus the two essential signposts of Jewish practice – the belief in one God and the essential moral and spiritual code of Judaism – were broadcast on a daily basis.
But at some point, the rabbis decided to eliminate the 10 Commandments from the liturgy. This was a reaction to the heretics, who pointed to the prominence of the Decalogue as proof that this is the only truly important part of the Torah that need be followed. While the 10 Commandments still can be found in many siddurim, and some people do still read them every morning, the architects of the prayer book concurred that we must indeed be wary of overemphasizing the 10 Commandments.
This was clearly the view of Maimonides. He strenuously objected to the widespread custom of congregants standing up for the readings of the 10 Commandments, in both the Exodus and Deuteronomy versions. His responsum on this subject is quite adamant:
“It is proper to abolish this minhag wherever it has taken hold, and to teach the people to sit, as they usually do, in order that there should not result a belief that one part of the Torah is superior to another; this is a belief that is wrong and evil and deplorable in the extreme.”
The rabbinic response to Maimonides notes that the flash and flourish of the giving of the Torah on Mount Sinai, amid the fearful display of thunder and lighting, certainly play to the uniqueness of these powerful words written in stone. But the rabbis suggest that this is precisely because the Decalogue is much, much more than just 10 mitzvot, basic as they may be; they contain, in capsule form, all the 613 commandments that are to be found in the entire Torah.
So, for instance, “Thou shall not steal” also includes the prohibition of kidnapping, charging usurious interest, graft, influence peddling, and even gneivat da’at, “misleading others.”
“Thou shall not commit adultery” takes into account incest, immodesty, sexual abuse, and all forms of moral corruption. And the commandment to observe Shabbat? That includes all the many, many mitzvot that are connected to each of the Jewish holidays.
Spiritual portal that opens a connection with god
The 10 Commandments are, in effect, a spiritual portal that opens the door to a connection with God, but it is the greater body of the mitzvot that walks one through that pathway. In fact, the Hebrew word for Jewish law is Halacha, closely connected to halacha, “walking.” As a graphic illustration of this notion, there are exactly 620 Hebrew letters in the 10 Commandments; they represent the 613 mitzvot, plus the seven universal Noahide laws (sheva mitzvot bnei Noah).
But I want to suggest that there is an unwritten, 11th commandment that hovers above all the others: the mitzvah to live in the Land of Israel. This is a pervasive, all-encompassing Divine directive – a mitzvah “that is equal to all the Torah” – that permeates and activates the life of the Jewish people. Just living in Israel, at any level of observance, elevates the Jewish soul and automatically, even without our awareness, imbues within us a spirit of godliness and holiness. We walk the streets named for the prophets; we feel the festivals in the air. We not only study Jewish history; we live it. It is what I call “Moses by osmosis.”
Even in the most difficult of times, Israel inspires and nurtures us. When our son Ari fell in battle, the remarkable Rabbi Shlomo Riskin was the first rabbi to come to our shiva. He consoled us with the well-known prayer “Hamakom y’nahem et’hem b’toch she’ar aveley Tziyon v’Yerushalayim” (“May God comfort you among all those who mourn for Zion and Jerusalem.”) “Why is God referred to here as Hamakom – ‘the place’?” he asked. “It is because the place itself – Israel – will assuage your pain, knowing that Ari gave his life in order to defend and protect our holy land and all its citizens; there is no act of heroism greater than that.”
The very first time that God speaks to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob individually, He intimates to them that Israel is our natural habitat, given to the Jewish people for an eternal inheritance, and that the mitzvot cannot reach their fullest observance outside of Israel.
Each and every sidra (“portion”) in the Torah contains a reference to Israel, and the Talmud says explicitly that redemption can come only when we achieve three primary goals: sovereignty in the land; the obliteration of evil that endangers ourselves and all good people; and the rebuilding of the Temple. We’ve accomplished the first; we’re working hard on the second even as you read this; and the third, we pray, is just around the corner.
Why, then, does the Torah not explicitly spell out the obligation for every Jew to come to live here?
Some suggest it is because it is such an obvious, essential part of Jewish life that to enunciate it would be superfluous. But I have another idea.
I suggest that while the other commandments are obligatory – “forced” upon us from Sinai, whether we like them or not – this one imperative is there for us to voluntarily embrace. Like wise parents, who at times hold themselves back and allow their children to make decisions on their own, as an important part of their maturation, God is placing this long-awaited opportunity before us, carefully watching and waiting to see what we do: Will we choose it, or will we lose it?

NGOs waited decades to brand Israel with ‘genocide' label, watchdog head tells 'Post'

05:29:01 KST

NGOs with an anti-Israel bias have been waiting for an opportunity to label Israel with terms such as ‘genocide’ for over 20 years, and the Gaza war finally gave them the opportunity, Dr. Gerald Steinberg, founder and president of NGO Monitor, told The Jerusalem Post on Sunday.
“We saw that with the coordinated 'genocide' campaign launched about a year after October 7. Discussions about using such terminology had circulated in NGO frameworks for over 20 years. They were prepared to use it as soon as they believed the opportunity arose,” he said.
Steinberg stated that by and large, the NGOs share a pattern of “political demonization of Israel, obsession with Israel, and reinforcement of each other’s messaging.”
The anti-Israel bias that exists within NGOs was brought back into the spotlight following the announcement that former Oxfam UK CEO Halima Begum is taking legal action against the organization for antisemitism. She has accused the group of pushing for the Israel-Hamas war to be labeled a genocide without sufficient evidence.
“It’s important to understand that there are hundreds of NGOs registered with the United Nations that claim to promote human rights or humanitarian aid while also maintaining active political advocacy roles,” Steinberg explained.
“Oxfam, for example, has an annual budget of about $1.3 billion. That’s enormous. It’s a powerful organization with a large public relations operation that significantly influences public and political opinion, including at the United Nations.”
However, he added, it is unprecedented for the leader of a major organization like Oxfam to acknowledge that these campaigns were planned in advance.
“That reflects a broader recognition of how far these NGOs have gone beyond reasonable criticism,” he said.
Steinberg further insisted that NGOs should be viewed by the international community as powerful actors shaping global narratives rather than small, altruistic volunteer groups.
“This entire industry requires careful, independent investigation. The lack of oversight has allowed a political agenda to override humanitarian claims,” Steinberg said.
Anti-Israel bias in NGOs happened gradually, Steinberg explained
The anti-Israel bias isn’t something that appeared overnight, Steinberg explained, adding that the takeover of the NGO industry was gradual, but today, organizations founded for different purposes have been transformed by activists whose fundamental objective is delegitimizing Israel.
When asked about possible ties to terror from NGOs operating within the Gaza Strip, Steinberg told the Post that NGO Monitor tracks over 300 organizations, and that some of the volunteers for these groups have become “virulent propagandists.”
“One example is Dr. Abu Sitta, who has been in and out of Gaza since at least 2018. On October 9, he accused Israel of “mass killing” and “indiscriminate killing” - language that escalated toward genocide accusations,” Steinberg said.
“Doctors Without Borders provided him a platform. He became a primary source in global media for the claim that Israel bombed a hospital, killing 500 people. That allegation was later shown to involve a Hamas rocket misfire in a parking lot, with around 50 casualties. But once that narrative spreads, the damage is done.”
In Gaza, DWB recently left Nasser Hospital, and the IDF has stated that the hospital has been used as a base by Hamas.
DWB recently stated that they suspended non-critical operations due to armed individuals moving through the hospital and management concerns.
“This was widely known. Journalists and the IDF documented hospital use by Hamas years ago. It’s implausible that these NGOs were unaware,” Steinberg said.
“The question is why they’re acknowledging it now. I believe it’s related to Israeli requirements that NGOs submit staff names for vetting. Israel is demanding cooperation with security frameworks and screening of personnel to prevent terror infiltration. That pressure appears to be having some effect… If they knew hospitals were being used by Hamas and that aid was diverted to build hundreds of kilometers of tunnels - and remained silent - that makes them complicit.”

US would back Israeli attacks on Iran if talks fail, Trump told Netanyahu: Report

U.S. President Donald Trump told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in December that Washington would back Israeli strikes targeting Iran’s ballistic missile program if diplomatic efforts with Tehran fail, according to U.S. media.
Discussions in Washington have shifted away from whether Israel could strike, moving instead toward how the U.S. might facilitate such a mission through technical and diplomatic means, said multiple people familiar with the matter, according to a CBS News report.
Key elements of this proposed cooperation include aerial refueling for Israeli aircraft to extend their operational range and the complex task of securing overflight permissions from neighboring sovereign nations.
Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates have said they would not permit their airspace for strikes on Iran.
The report emerged as Washington significantly steps up its military presence in the region, deploying the USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group with plans to send the USS Gerald R. Ford aircraft carrier as well.
A second round of negotiations between Iranian and American delegations is scheduled for Tuesday in Geneva, with Omani representatives serving as mediators.
Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Sunday that Trump "prefers diplomacy" on Iran, adding that U.S. envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner are traveling for "important meetings."
"We'll see how that comes out," Rubio added.

The Palestine Action ruling leaves Britain’s Jewish community exposed - comment
Unknown

05:28:57 KST

For Britain’s Jewish community, the UK High Court’s ruling on Palestine Action is not an abstract constitutional debate. It raises a far more pressing question: who protects minorities when intimidation falls short of terrorism?
The High Court ruled on Friday that the government's decision to proscribe Palestine Action was "disproportionate" and unlawful and proposed that the order be overturned. Specifically, it found that the ban breaches Article 10 of the Human Rights Act, which protects freedom of expression.
The judges decided that, while the anti-Israel protest group engaged in "criminality," not enough of its actions amounted to terrorism. The Court did not deny that criminal offences had occurred; it ruled that the threshold for terrorism, and therefore proscription, was not met. For now, the group remains banned to give the government time to consider an appeal.
Palestine Action brought a legal challenge against its proscription after it was banned in July last year. The group maintains that its actions were not terrorism, and that it merely carried out "property damage against the weapons trade and against weapons that would have been used to massacre people in Palestine."
"Most people understand that is not terrorism. Acting to save lives is a necessity," Palestine Action founder Huda Ammori told Sky News. Over 2000 people have been arrested in the UK since the ban was enacted.
Home Secretary stood by the decision
Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood stood by her government's decision, saying it followed a "rigorous and evidence-based decision-making process" and that the ban does not prevent peaceful protest in support of the Palestinian cause. "Supporting the Palestinian cause is not the same as supporting Palestine Action," she said.
She also announced that she will fight the judgment in the Court of Appeal.
The ruling underscores that in the UK, even decisions framed as national security matters are subject to judicial review, and that the courts will scrutinize whether proscription is proportionate.
As the Board of Deputies of British Jews said, judicial oversight is "vitally important" in matters of national security. And yet this decision has a deep and pervasive impact on the Jewish community, whose way of life was affected by Palestine Action's campaigning. Jewish restaurants, businesses, and communities were targeted by Palestine Action for almost two years, causing fear, discomfort, and also incurring high costs (such as the need to repair vandalised buildings or remove graffiti).
Sans proscription, what measures will be in place to protect the Jewish community from repeated vandalism, graffiti, destruction, and harassment? Much of this activity was framed as a legitimate anti-Israel protest. But for those on the receiving end, such a distinction offers little comfort. At the end of the day, it is Jewish communities that suffer when their windows are smashed, or when kosher products are removed from shelves, or when cafes are forced to close because of constant targeting.
While there is some validity to the argument that arresting every person who supported Palestine Action was a waste of police resources, it at least sent a message that the government and law enforcement were taking steps to crack down on behaviour that intimidates Jewish and Israeli communities in the UK.
Coming so soon on the heels of the acquittal of six Palestine Action activists on aggravated burglary charges, a case in which a police officer suffered a serious spinal injury, the ruling may reinforce the perception among activists that the legal risks of disruptive protest are manageable.
Prosecutions for antisemitic crimes remain relatively rare. When high-profile cases end in acquittals, confidence in the system inevitably erodes, as the community questions whether it can rely on the criminal justice system to protect it.
It was never about peaceful protest
The debate now risks collapsing back into a narrow argument about freedom of speech, as if Palestine Action was simply about writing lengthy op-eds. But it was never about peaceful protest or holding up a banner; it's in the name - Action - and in many cases, this action was violent, destructive, and disruptive.
The High Court is right to guard civil liberties. But liberty without security is hollow for minorities who find themselves repeatedly targeted.
If a proscription is deemed disproportionate, the government must demonstrate what proportionate protection would look like. Otherwise, Britain’s Jewish community will be left asking whether the law protects not only their rights in theory, but their safety in practice.

A manicure, a memorial and the music of David  - opinion

On Tuesday night, 10 days after the return of Ran Gvili’s body, members of my Jerusalem synagogue Shira Hadasha gathered in an evening of song and to store away, in personalized fabric cases, the many accoutrements related to the return of the hostages. These, it was suggested, could be opened at appropriate times, such as on October 7, on Passover “to teach it to our children,” or on Memorial Day.
Everyone was encouraged to write their own messages. I have my share of yellow ribbon pins, yellow ribbons from my car, and a dog tag in gold attached to a necklace with birds flying free. But the symbol of identification that was most personally meaningful to me was on my fingernails – where the hostage yellow ribbon was created and recreated over the past two years in gel polish on my ring fingers.
So on Wednesday, I took a deep breath, and sat across from Hadassah Hospital-based manicurist Annael Toledano to remove the ribbons from my nails. It wasn’t a full manicure, so it was over in two minutes. It was emotional for her, too.
In January 2024, my friend, Jerusalemite Shari Greenwald Mendes – who volunteers for the IDF reserve unit tasked with preparing the bodies of fallen female soldiers for burial – spoke to a visiting mission of Hadassah leaders from the United States. She had just returned from testifying at the United Nations.
Greenwald Mendes described the appalling conditions of the bodies that she and her teammates treated with love and respect. An architect attuned to color, Greenwald Mendes spoke of the only bright colors amid the dark hues: pink, blue, and red polished nails. Many of the young women soldiers had polished their nails or gone for manicures for Simchat Torah, even though they would be spending the holiday at their army bases and not with their families, boyfriends, or synagogues.
The team paused to picture those women on October 6, and took a moment to honor them. Sitting to my right at the talk was Jerusalemite Madelaine Black, who volunteers at Hadassah Hospital. “Let’s polish our nails yellow in their memory and for the hostages,” she said. “Let’s spread the word.”
Tie a yellow ribbon, paint some yellow nails
And so it started – a campaign for yellow nails that began in Jerusalem, and then spread to the Diaspora. I think I was the first to polish my nails yellow, and Toledano, who provides uplifting manicures to harried staff and scared patients, suggested taking it one step further. She turned the pinkie fingers yellow, and then painted a three-dimensional-looking ribbon on both ring fingers.
She started offering it to clients, and even created a stand on International Women’s Day at the hospital. Then we were off to Hostages Square in Tel Aviv, offering yellow polish to visitors and families of hostages. I made a vow that I would continue until the last hostage was home, thinking then that it would be a matter of weeks or months. Hadassah women led the charge of nails in the US, and my Facebook feed filled with yellow.
Wherever I went in the Jewish world, women and men (who wanted to show their wives) took photos of the ribbon. When I met OPI nail polish co-founder Suzi Weiss-Fischmann in the summer of 2024, she was giving out yellow polish at the Hadassah Convention in Las Vegas, and I had the opportunity to tell her the moving origin story, which she hadn’t known.
What would I do when the hostages came home, I was frequently asked. I would turn those nails orange, I always answered, in honor of Shiri, Ariel, and Yarden Bibas. We wouldn’t find out they were murdered for another year, in January 2025.
From yellow to orange
So, it was on Thursday that I went with orange nails to see the newest woman-to-woman musical David the Servant King, my first time in a lovely theater in Jerusalem’s Talpiot Industrial Zone. Who knew? I was among 495 women there, nearly all in the modest dress and assorted head coverings of contemporary Orthodox Jews. There were enough young women for the tickets to include a request “not to bring babies.” There was also a list of biblical, Talmudic, and Midrashic sources in the playbill.
I felt exhilarated to be sitting among all these women from a sector that has played an out-sized role fighting in the war. They’re also probably the only audience in the world familiar with the aggadic interpretations dramatized in the play. One of Jerusalem’s great women Torah teachers was sitting in front of me, and I had the opportunity to ask her about her wounded nephew, whom I’d met in rehab.
Like the Bibas family, King David was reputedly a redhead, and the musical emphasizes his fraught childhood and unlikely kingship. All parts are played by women, a reverse of Shakespeare’s productions, and the actresses had training in adapting their movements to look more like men.
Playwright and lyricist Shlomit Koffler Weinreb first imagined the King David musical in 2017. She believes it was a heavenly inspiration shared with the creators of the House of David series for Amazon Prime, which had premiered in February 2025, and the enormously successful animated movie David, released that December. Esteemed journalist and author Melanie Phillips, also a Jerusalemite, has spoken of the “return of the heroic David warrior” – the valorous men and women who fought this war above and below ground and who maintained the thorny home front.
Readers of this column know that I am a longtime fan of the genre of women-to-women theater, music, and dance, in which Orthodox women who don’t perform before men express otherwise hidden and unexpressed talents. It’s hard for me to believe that it was 44 years ago that I went to my first women-to-women rock concert to raise funds for the family of Chaya Malka Abramson, recovering from a horrendous gas fire in the Old City of Jerusalem.
Koffler Weinreb was a composer, guitarist, and vocalist in her own women-to-women band called Ayelet Hashachar (“morning star”) in Baltimore. She plays a stirring prophet Samuel in David the Servant King. Tamar Rabinowitz, a co-creator and vocalist of that same women’s band, brings to life David’s resolute mother, Nitzvevet. Their band’s first performance on September 9, 2001, two days before 9/11, was a fundraiser for victims of terror in the Second Intifada.
David is played by the magnetic singer, actress, and scriptwriter Avital Macales. When, in the musical, Samuel anoints the future king, and the chorus sings the familiar words from Psalms and “Hallel” – in the midrash, from the mouth of David’s mother: “The stone the builders despised has become the cornerstone” – the tears in my eyes were not only for the ancient king of Israel but also for my unfairly reviled magnificent homeland and for our irrepressible people.
The writer is the Israel director of public relations at Hadassah, the Women’s Zionist Organization of America. Her latest book is A Daughter of Many Mothers, with Holocaust survivor and premier English-language witness Rena Quint.

Jewish summer camps in Canada face pressure campaign over alleged 'Israeli military' ties

Anti-Israel groups in Canada are encouraging protest action against Jewish camps for their “explicit support for the Israeli military” and “genocide.”
“When children’s camps support a genocidal state, it’s time for gigantic change,” the groups (including Canada BDS) wrote in a joint statement on Friday.
The groups claim to have “identified” at least 17 summer camps throughout Canada that “support the State of Israel in some way.” Of the 17, 10 are in Ontario, three in Quebec, and 1one each in Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, and Nova Scotia.
The pro-Palestine groups said that the camps actively fundraise for “war relief” efforts. For example, they reported that Camp Moshava Ennismore in Toronto has hosted an IDF soldier “who posted clips of himself in Gaza ‘joking’ about eating humanitarian aid,” and that Camp Timberlane (also in Toronto) posted at least one photo with a member of the Israeli military in Israel.
The protest groups then went on to accuse three accredited camps in Quebec and one in Nova Scotia of “explicit support for the Israeli military,” citing, for example, the fact that one of the camps commemorates Yom Hazikaron (Remembrance Day), or that some camp counselors are IDF veterans, or simply Israeli citizens.
Accusations of a 'Zionist who publicly supports Israel'
Additionally, the groups claim that Ontario Camps Association’s (OCA) Executive Director Joy Levy “is a Zionist who publicly supports Israel [and] its military, and promotes anti-Palestinian racism.”
Other examples of so-called “support” include the adoption of the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) working definition of antisemitism, or the use of Hebrew in camp materials.
The protest groups even took fault with “food appropriation,” accusing Camp Solelim of appropriation of West Asian and Palestinian culture by advertising “The smell of zatar sprinkled on top of pita roasted over an open campfire…”
In a separate statement, the pro-Palestine groups said that the camps are not problematic “because they encourage connection to Jewish identity” but because “they encourage support for a genocidal, settler-colonial State.”
Given that the camps all have accreditation under their respective provincial camping association, the protest groups called for supporters to send letters to the leadership of the Quebec and Nova Scotia camp associations to tell them to revoke the accreditation of camps that hire, host, or support current or former Israeli military personnel.
They also urged followers to send a letter to the Board of Directors at the Ontario Camps Association to “hold Levy, their executive director, accountable for anti-Palestinian racism and support for a genocidal military, and demand an end to accreditation for camps that hire, host, or support current or former Israeli military personnel.”
Levy, on behalf of OCA, released a statement on Friday expressing deep concern about the campaign’s claims, which it called “discriminatory and antisemitic in nature.”
Libels and tropes related to Israel, Zionism, and Jewish people
“The accusations, aimed at our executive director, members of the OCA team, and several member camps, draw directly on stereotyped libels and tropes related to Israel, Zionism, and Jewish people – including ‘genocide’ and ‘colonizers,’ symbolic categories that are so often spread with specifically malicious intent.”
“The stated objective of that campaign is to pressure accreditation bodies to revoke or reconsider the standing of Jewish camps and to seek disciplinary action against staff,” Levy said, adding that such campaigning undermined the welfare and safety of Jewish children and the legitimacy of the leadership of the OCA (and elsewhere), Jewish camp administrators in Canada, and Canadian Jewish life in general.
“OCA is a provincial standards and accreditation body. We do not adjudicate international geopolitical conflicts, nor do we evaluate member camps based on their religious or cultural identity,” she added.
“We will not allow antisemitism, intimidation, discrimination, or harassment to take root within Ontario’s camp community.”
This is not the first time that Jewish summer schools have been the focus of anti-Israel campaigning. A few months ago, the database Find IDF soldiers, which documents Canadians who served in the Israeli military, released a new database named GTA to IDF, which details the institutions that the soldiers attended, implying that these institutions are breeding grounds for IDF conscription. Two specific camps – Moshava Ennismore and Ramah – were named.
“Publishing a directory of Jewish schools, community centers, and communal organizations framed as if their ties to Israel are incriminating is inciting and dangerous,” Austin Parcels, manager of research and advocacy at B’nai Brith Canada, told The Jerusalem Post at the time, adding that such lists become “a catalogue for hostile actors who are looking for targets.”
“These are Jewish organizations. Treating that basic fact as if it reveals something hidden or corrupt is an attempt to manufacture suspicion around Jewish identity itself. When you turn the most elementary fact of Jewish identity into suspicion, you are not revealing anything. You are giving people who want to harm Jewish institutions the ammunition they are looking for.”

Evidence with DNA near Nancy Guthrie’s home appears to match suspect
- The FBI has found a glove two miles from Nancy Guthrie's Arizona home, who was last seen on January 31.
- The glove could be linked to an “armed” individual seen in surveillance footage outside her home the morning she disappeared.
- The person in the footage, wearing a mask and gloves, appeared to tamper with Guthrie's doorbell camera.
- Investigators believe the found glove matches those worn by the individual in the surveillance footage and have sent it for DNA testing.
- The FBI reportedly said about 16 gloves have been found near Guthrie’s home, most of which were later identified as gloves used by searchers.

ICE releases detained Filipino after ‘unreasonable failures of care’
Greggy Sorio, who lost a toe and 10kg while held by ICE in Seattle, still faces a deportation order and the threat of removal from the US
A Filipino man awaiting the result of a deportation order has been released from Tacoma’s Northwest ICE Processing Centre following a federal court order that called the man’s detention unconstitutionally “punitive”.
While in Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody, Sorio – also known as “Kuya G” – developed a bone infection that led to healthcare providers amputating one of his toes and a portion of his foot.
“I just want to say thank you to everyone. I’m speechless,” Sorio, 37, said during a celebration hosted by the Tanggol Migrante Movement, according to a statement from the organisation, which described Sorio’s release as “an unexpected announcement”.
Though the court order released Sorio from the Tacoma detention centre, he still faces a deportation order and the threat of removal from the US.
Sorio moved to the United States on a green card in 2007. He is originally from Lingayen, Pangasinan, in the Philippines.

Tom Homan says a small ‘security force’ will remain in Minnesota to respond to ‘agitators’
White House border czar won’t defend Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in interview, but declines to answer questions about her reported relationship with top-ranking official
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
Donald Trump’s border “czar” Tom Homan appeared across the Sunday news show circuit and presented a view for the future of immigration enforcement in Minneapolis as the Trump administration says it is withdrawing hundreds of officers from the state and ending an enforcement surge following the deaths of two Americans.
Homan recently took over as the top federal immigration enforcement authority on the ground in Minnesota following the removal of Gregory Bovino, ICE’s acting commander, from the role this month. His appointment followed calls from both Democrats and Republicans in Washington for federal officials to shift their tactics and outrage over the deaths of Renee Good and Alex Pretti in confrontations with ICE and Border Patrol agents.
Though he announced this past week that the surge in Minneapolis was ending, Homan said on Sunday that a force would remain in the city to conduct operations in the future. Homan said that the agents remaining behind would include a “security force” whose purpose would be to stop protesters and others from interfering with ICE and Border Patrol enforcement operations.
"There will be a small force, a security force...that will respond when our agents are out and get surrounded by agitators,” said Homan. “They will remain for a short period of time to make sure the coordination, the agreements we have with local and state law enforcement stay in place."
Homan also said that agents tasked with investigating a fraud scheme in the state will remain, as will a team investigating an incident where activists conducted a protest at a church and were arrested alongside journalist Don Lemon, who was documenting the protest.
As his role grows in prominence, Homan is also facing questions about tumult reported within the ranks of Donald Trump’s DHS team, and in particular surrounding the ongoing work of Kristi Noem as DHS secretary. Noem is reportedly suspected by Trump and others to be in a relationship with Corey Lewandowski, her de facto chief of staff, which she denies but a factor that nonetheless adds a layer of frustration to a tenure as DHS secretary that has been loudly derided on the Hill, including by some Republicans.
Noem, already facing calls for her firing in Washington, was the subject of a Wall Street Journal exposé this week that detailed an agency in a constant state of chaos under her and Lewandowski’s management.
The piece cited many problems but also highlighted how the secretary apparently disliked Homan grabbing TV screens over her.
“Noem routinely berated staff if she saw Homan on TV and kept track of both their appearances to make sure she was on TV more than him,” the WSJ reported. “On at least one occasion, she asked aides to ensure she drew a bigger crowd at a conference than Homan, who was speaking on a different day.”
On Sunday, Homan declined to answer questions about Noem’s tenure as DHS secretary, while not defending her record from calls for her resignation from Congress.
“Look; it’s one team, one fight. I’m not playing into that media. They're trying to divide this administration,” Homan claimed, before he admitted that he did not agree with Noem on her decision-making 100% of the time. The border czar claimed that any disagreements he had with Noem were worked out in internal discussions.
He added that the record-low number of border crossings spoke for themselves.
Some aspects of Homan’s different approach to running the show in Minneapolis were on display on Sunday, regardless. Asked by CBS’s Face the Nation guest host Ed O’Keefe, Homan took a clearly different strategy to the give-no-ground approach that Noem and others have taken in response to allegations of wrongdoing by individual ICE or Border Patrol agents as he was asked by O’Keefe about agents placed on leave for giving misleading testimony.
Instead of defending the agents, Homan insisted that those cases had been sent to internal affairs for review and added that he had brought on more internal affairs staff to investigate claims of wrongdoing.
“Well look, you know, my first press conference in Minnesota I said I was bringing more internal affairs officers in, just to ensure officers were doing the right thing,” Homan said. “As the ICE director said on Friday, people will be held accountable.”
“Disciplinary action or prosecutions will occur” if accounts of ICE or Border Patrol agents committing violations of the law are found to be credible, Homan said.
Donald Trump himself has sought to balance his administration backing off Minneapolis in response to growing anger with a desire to deny any appearance of weakening or softening as it pertains to ICE and Border Patrol’s enforcement or operational standards.
“We’re going to de-escalate a little bit,” the president said in an interview in late January. In an interview with NBC Nightly News a few days later, he added: "I learned that maybe we could use a little bit of a softer touch. But you still have to be tough.”

At Munich, a U.S. Change in Tone Leaves Ukraine’s Allies Unconvinced
Unknown

MUNICH, Germany — The unofficial mascot for the 2026 Munich Security Conference was an elephant.
But if the elephant in the room was the question of whether the United States was trampling over the world order and its relationship with Europe nearly four years into Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, it was not ignored, but repeatedly confronted.
A year after U.S. Vice President J.D. Vance stunned European leaders at the same gathering by accusing them of abandoning democratic values and freeloading on the U.S.’ protection, Secretary of State Marco Rubio struck a more conciliatory tone.
The mood at this year’s conference was less apocalyptic than last year’s “shock therapy,” as European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen put it.
But several attendees, many speaking on condition of anonymity, told The Moscow Times that they were not entirely reassured.
“We want Europe to be strong. We believe that Europe must survive, because the two great wars of the last century serve for us as history’s constant reminder that ultimately, our destiny is and will always be intertwined with yours, because we know that the fate of Europe will never be irrelevant to our own,” Rubio told a crowd at the luxurious Bayerischer Hof Hotel.
But his was still seen as a continuation of the administration's MAGA rhetoric, decrying “mass immigration,” a “climate cult” and framing the U.S. not just as the most powerful country in the democratic world, but as part of a “shared civilization” with Europe, “forged by centuries of shared history, Christian faith, culture, heritage, language, ancestry” and “the sacrifices of previous generations.”
For some European leaders, who increasingly accept that the continent must reduce its reliance on Washington and assert itself as a more equal partner, that rhetoric landed uncomfortably.
German Chancellor Friedrich Merz criticized Washington’s tariff policies and what he described as the projection of U.S. “culture war” issues into European politics.
“MAGA means anti-EU. It means anti-liberal world order. It means anti-climate change. That’s the ideological undercurrent” guiding U.S. foreign policy,” said Finnish President Alexander Stubb, who is thought to have one of the best relationships with U.S. President Donald Trump out of anyone in the alliance.
How much damage Rubio could undo was limited, as many European leaders have direct experience with the Trump administration.
Danish Prime Minister Mette Fredriksen said she believes that Trump still wants to own Greenland, despite having toned down his threats to take it by force.
Eyes on east and west
The conference took place the day after a meeting of NATO defense ministers in Brussels, where they discussed progress toward capability targets set at last year’s summit in The Hague. NATO announced that a further $500 million would be pledged to purchase U.S.-made weapons for Ukraine through the Prioritized Ukrainian Requirements List (PURL), including air defense missiles to protect cities and infrastructure from Russia’s intensifying drone and missile attacks.
As Ukrainian civilians continued to freeze in apartments that have been without heating for weeks due to Russian strikes on energy infrastructure, Ukrainian officials sought to emphasize Moscow’s problems on the battlefield after Western figures suggested Russia lost 9,000 more men on the battlefield last month than they recruited.
At the Ukraine House exhibition, co-hosted by the presidential office near the main venue, visitors met Ukrainian drone developers and watched an AI-generated video depicting simulated Russian Geran drone attacks on major European cities.
On the main stage, President Volodymyr Zelensky called for security guarantees for Ukraine lasting at least 20 years. He said Washington had offered 15-year assurances but had not specified how it would provide them, including whether it would support a European reassurance force in Ukraine.
He called on the international community to “exert maximum pressure on Russia” by pushing down global oil prices to further hit a key source of revenue for Moscow’s war effort.
He also said Ukraine would hold elections — a condition pushed by Trump and the Kremlin — if a two-month ceasefire with security guarantees were agreed.
The next round of talks between Russia, Ukraine and the United States is scheduled for Tuesday and Wednesday in Geneva.
After almost a year of talks in which Russia repeated its demand for Ukrainian territory and rejected external security support for Kyiv as a threat, the contours of any deal remain vague.
Rubio said it was unclear how “serious” Russia was about ending the war. “
“They say they are — and under what terms they are willing to do it and whether we can find terms that are acceptable to Ukraine that Russia will always agree to. But we’re going to continue to test it,” he said.
Equally uncertain is how the international community would engage with Russia if a deal were reached. The Kremlin has signaled that peace would depend on ending Russia’s economic isolation, including lifting sanctions and pursuing new economic agreements with the U.S.
Attendees who spoke to The Moscow Times did not provide a clear picture of how the world should treat a post-war Russia. But none were looking for a return to the pre-war status quo.
“Let’s have a peace deal first and then see what happens after that,” Rutte said. “But for NATO, it’s clear as we see things now, Russia is a long term threat to the whole of NATO’s territory.”
“We leant over backwards to integrate Russia into the broadly understood West…” Polish Foreign Minister Radosław Sikorski said. “I'm afraid under the current leadership of Russia, a return to normal relations with the West is unlikely. Colonial wars, if you look historically, are only ended by a different team than started them.”
Russian opposition activist Mikhail Khordokovsky also saw no prospects for a lasting peace as long as President Vladimir Putin holds power in the Kremlin.
“For him, war is necessary, because then we need to avoid talking about normal life,” he said.
A Message from The Moscow Times:
Dear readers,
We are facing unprecedented challenges. Russia's Prosecutor General's Office has designated The Moscow Times as an "undesirable" organization, criminalizing our work and putting our staff at risk of prosecution. This follows our earlier unjust labeling as a "foreign agent."
These actions are direct attempts to silence independent journalism in Russia. The authorities claim our work "discredits the decisions of the Russian leadership." We see things differently: we strive to provide accurate, unbiased reporting on Russia.
We, the journalists of The Moscow Times, refuse to be silenced. But to continue our work, we need your help.
Your support, no matter how small, makes a world of difference. If you can, please support us monthly starting from just $2. It's quick to set up, and every contribution makes a significant impact.
By supporting The Moscow Times, you're defending open, independent journalism in the face of repression. Thank you for standing with us.
Remind me later.

FBI: DNA recovered from glove found near Guthrie home that appears to match glove worn by suspect
FBI: DNA recovered from glove found near Guthrie home that appears to match glove worn by suspect
A glove containing DNA found about two miles from the house of “Today” show host Savannah Guthrie’s mother appears to match those worn by a masked person outside her front door in Tucson the night she vanished, the FBI said Sunday.
The glove, discovered in a field beside a road, was sent for DNA testing. The FBI said in a statement that it received preliminary results Saturday and was awaiting official confirmation. The development comes as law enforcement gathers more potential evidence as the search for Guthrie’s mother heads into its third week. Authorities had previously said they had not identified a suspect.
Nancy Guthrie, 84, was last seen at her Arizona home on Jan. 31 and was reported missing the following day. Authorities say her blood was found on the front porch. Purported ransom notes were sent to news outlets, but two deadlines for paying have passed.
The discovery was revealed days after investigators had released surveillance videos of the masked person outside Guthrie’s front door. A porch camera recorded video of a person with a backpack who was wearing a ski mask, long pants, jacket and gloves.
AP correspondent Julie Walker reports on a break in the Nancy Guthrie disappearance case.
On Thursday, the FBI called the person a suspect. It described him as a man about 5 feet, 9 inches tall with a medium build. The agency said he was carrying a 25-liter “Ozark Trail Hiker Pack” backpack.
Late Friday night, law enforcement agents sealed off a road about two miles (3.2 kilometers) from Guthrie’s home as part of their investigation. A series of sheriff’s and FBI vehicles, including forensics vehicles, passed through the roadblock.
The investigators also tagged and towed a Range Rover SUV from a nearby restaurant parking lot late Friday. The sheriff’s department later said the activity was part of the Guthrie investigation but no arrests were made.
On Tuesday, sheriff deputies detained a person for questioning during a traffic stop south of Tucson. Authorities didn’t say what led them to stop the man but confirmed he was released. The same day, deputies and FBI agents conducted a court-authorized search in Rio Rico, about an hour’s drive south of the city.
Authorities have expressed concern about Nancy Guthrie’s health because she needs vital daily medicine. She is said to have a pacemaker and have dealt with high blood pressure and heart issues, according to sheriff’s dispatcher audio on broadcastify.com.
Earlier in the investigation, authorities had said they had collected DNA from Nancy Guthrie’s property which doesn’t belong to Guthrie or those in close contact with her. Investigators were working to identify who it belongs to.
The FBI also has said approximately 16 gloves were found in various spots near the house, most of which were searchers’ gloves that had been discarded.

‘West exploits women’: Iran, Hezbollah use Epstein scandal to push anti-US narrative

Media outlets and officials across the Arab world are closely following developments in the Jeffrey Epstein case, with Iran and its regional allies using the scandal to advance longstanding accusations of Western moral corruption and to direct criticism at the United States and Israel.
Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Esmail Baghaei was asked about the case Sunday and described it as “a sign of a very deep moral crisis in the governing system of Western countries, especially given the involvement of many senior political figures.”
He added that from another perspective, the affair was also a criminal matter and a tragedy that had hurt public sentiment worldwide. Referring to Israel, Baghaei said suspicions were growing that the case had been “a long-term project to advance the political goals of certain actors, especially the Zionist regime.”
Iranian state-affiliated and pro-regime outlets have amplified such claims. During rallies marking the 47th anniversary of the Islamic Revolution, video circulated showing demonstrators burning a statue in Tehran’s Revolution Square. Iran’s Tasnim news agency claimed it was a statue of Epstein.
Images from the scene, however, showed the statue depicted Baal, a deity historically associated with child sacrifice in ancient mythology. A Star of David had been placed on the statue’s head, and it was described in some reports as representing evil.
Press TV, a channel affiliated with the Iranian government, said in its Hebrew-language platform that Iranians had burned a statue of Baal “as a symbolic act due to anger over the Epstein scandal and child sacrifice.” It also claimed that Epstein had named a bank account “Baal,” referencing what it described as a figure worshipped in ancient times.
The Houthi movement in Yemen, aligned with Iran, has also prominently featured the case in its messaging. Its outlets have focused on allegations of Western corruption and abuse, while also highlighting a widely circulated image of Epstein with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman amid tensions between the Houthis and Saudi Arabia.
Houthi leader Abdul-Malik al-Houthi said Feb. 5 that “Trump, the criminal unbeliever, and the leaders of America, Britain and the Zionist Jews” commit grave crimes. In a later speech, he described documents related to Epstein as evidence of what he called attempts by enemies to spread corruption.
Senior Houthi official Hazam al-Assad wrote on social media that Western countries had spent years criticizing Islam over issues such as child marriage and child recruitment while allegedly engaging in abuse themselves. In other posts, he questioned whether U.S. escalation against Iran was an effort to deflect from the scandal.
Another Houthi figure, Mohammed al-Farah, wrote on social media that one could be president of a country that calls itself a beacon of democracy while lacking moral values.
Pro-Houthi comedian Mustafa al-Momari also referenced the case in videos, criticizing Arab media for focusing on Houthi recruitment of minors while asking why they were not speaking about “children recruited to Epstein’s island.” Yemeni cartoonist Kamal Sharaf, who supports the Houthis, published cartoons and videos about the affair, including material widely viewed as antisemitic in connection with the Tehran statue-burning.
Lebanon’s Al-Manar television, affiliated with Hezbollah, aired a report titled “Epstein’s Scandals: The West as It Really Is,” quoting a political science and international law expert who said the scandal revealed the true face of Western systems that speak of values, freedom and democracy while allegedly violating them.
In Egypt, the controversy surfaced in a different context. The Interior Ministry announced Feb. 10 that it had canceled a party at a Cairo nightclub called “A Day on Epstein’s Island.” The event, which reportedly offered free entry for women, drew public criticism. Authorities said the gathering had not received required permits and that the organizer, a Cairo-based event producer, was arrested.

Trump tells Hamas to proceed with 'full and Immediate' disarmament

05:21:10 KST

U.S. President Donald Trump on Sunday urged Hamas to move forward with disarmament under his plan for postwar Gaza, and said members of his so-called "Board of Peace" had pledged $5 billion to the Palestinian territory's reconstruction.
"Very importantly, Hamas must uphold its commitment to Full and Immediate Demilitarization," Trump said in a post on his Truth Social platform, ahead of a February 19 meeting of the board in Washington.
Disarmament is a key part in the second phase of the U.S.-brokered ceasefire plan sealed in October between Israel and the Palestinian militant group to end the war triggered by Hamas's attack on Israel in October 2023.
The United Nations endorsed the plan in November.
The second phase stipulates that Israeli forces gradually withdraw from Gaza and Hamas should disarm, with an international stabilization force deployed to ensure security.
Hamas has repeatedly said that disarmament is a red line, although it has indicated it could consider handing over its weapons to a future Palestinian governing authority.
Both sides accuse each other daily of ceasefire violations.
Although originally intended to oversee Gaza's rebuilding, the charter for the "Board of Peace" does not seem to limit its role to the Palestinian territory.
"The Board of Peace has unlimited potential," Trump said Sunday in his post.
After an initial meeting on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos last month, the board is due to meet Thursday in the U.S. capital.
Countries have been asked to pay $1 billion for permanent membership of the board, and the invitation for Russian President Vladimir Putin, whose country invaded Ukraine in 2022, has drawn criticism.
Key U.S. allies including France and Britain have expressed doubts.
Trump said the $5 billion in pledges by member states would be formally announced then, and that members also "have committed thousands of personnel to the International Stabilization Force and Local Police to maintain Security and Peace for Gazans."
Trump has said the organization will work "in conjunction" with the United Nations.
"The Board of Peace will prove to be the most consequential International Body in History," he said.
Under the ceasefire plan, a Palestinian technocratic committee has also been set up with a goal of taking over governance in the battered Gaza Strip.

US would back Israeli strikes if Iran talks fail, Trump told Netanyahu in December: Report
Washington discussing how US might facilitate Israeli strikes on Iran through technical, diplomatic means, according to CBS
ISTANBUL
US President Donald Trump informed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during a December meeting that Washington would back Israeli strikes on Iran's ballistic missile program if negotiations with Tehran collapse, US media reported Sunday.
Discussions in Washington have shifted away from whether Israel could strike, moving instead toward how the US might facilitate such a mission through technical and diplomatic means, said multiple people familiar with the matter, according to a CBS News report.
Key elements of this proposed cooperation include aerial refueling for Israeli aircraft to extend their operational range and the complex task of securing overflight permissions from neighboring sovereign nations.
Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates have said they would not permit their airspace for strikes on Iran.
The report emerged as Washington significantly steps up its military presence in the region, deploying the USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group with plans to send the USS Gerald R. Ford aircraft carrier as well.
A second round of negotiations between Iranian and American delegations is scheduled for Tuesday in Geneva, with Omani representatives serving as mediators.
Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Sunday that Trump "prefers diplomacy" on Iran, adding that US envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner are traveling for "important meetings."

Niger’s president arrives in Algeria amid signs of easing tensions
Visit follows restoration of diplomatic representation after more than 10 months of strain between Algiers and Niamey
ALGIERS, Algeria
Niger’s President Gen. Abdourahamane Tiani arrived in Algeria on Sunday for an official working visit, holding talks with Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune, in a move seen as signaling an end to more than 10 months of diplomatic tension between the two countries.
Algeria’s presidency said in a brief statement on the US social media company Facebook that Tebboune received Tiani, who is leading a high-level delegation, without providing further details.
State television reported that Tebboune welcomed his Nigerien counterpart at Houari Boumediene International Airport in Algiers, describing the visit as reflecting the “depth of historical relations” between the two nations.
Footage on state TV showed an official welcoming ceremony, including the playing of both countries’ national anthems and an honor guard.
Senior Algerian officials attended the reception ceremony, including Senate Speaker Azzouz Nasri, Army Chief of Staff Gen. Said Chanegriha, Foreign Minister Ahmed Attaf, and Energy and Mines Minister Mohamed Arkab, according to state television.
Tebboune and Tiani later held bilateral talks in the airport’s VIP lounge with members of both delegations present. No immediate details were released on the substance of the discussions or the length of the visit.
Local media and analysts said the official welcoming and high-level talks indicate a definitive closing of the rift that strained relations for over 10 months.
On Thursday, Algeria announced the immediate return of Ahmed Saadi, its ambassador to Niger, after a reciprocal downgrade of diplomatic ties since last April. The move followed the resumption of duties by Niger’s ambassador to Algeria, Aminou Malam Manzo, also on Thursday.
Mending fences
The diplomatic rift began last April, when Niger, Burkina Faso and Mali, members of the Alliance of Sahel States, recalled their ambassadors from Algeria after Mali accused Algiers of shooting down one of its drones.
Algeria said at the time that the aircraft had violated its airspace on an offensive trajectory, marking the third such breach.
Algeria responded by recalling its ambassadors from the three countries under the principle of reciprocity. It later said Niger’s decision stemmed from solidarity within the Sahel alliance rather than a bilateral dispute.
Ties began to thaw late last year. In November, the Nigerian president sent Tebboune a message marking Algeria’s Revolution Day. In January, Algerian Energy Minister Mohamed Arkab visited Niger to review joint oil projects, the first senior-level Algerian visit since the diplomatic downgrade.
Algeria and Niger share nearly 950 kilometers (590 miles) of border and cooperate on major regional projects, including the Trans-Saharan Highway and a proposed gas pipeline that would transport Nigerian natural gas to Europe through Niger and Algeria. It is a huge project that could allow the transport of 30 billion cubic meters annually.

Gaza mother’s grim ordeal: A search for missing son among mutilated bodies
Gaza families seek closure as they search for loved ones among bodies returned by Israel under ‘ceasefire’ deal.
Gaza City, Gaza Strip – With exhausted steps and eyes filled with tears, Hanaa al-Mabhuh moves between the hall displaying photographs of bodies and the morgue at al-Shifa Hospital in a grim search for any trace of her missing son.
The 56-year-old mother wipes away tears with the back of her hand and stares at the decomposed faces on the screen, torn between the desire to find out what happened to her youngest child, while at the same time fearing he might be among the dead handed over by Israel under a US-brokered ceasefire deal.

Thousands of Palestinians from Gaza have been seeking information on loved ones who went missing since the war began after the deadly October 7, 2023 raid by Hamas.
Driven by her need for closure, Hanaa returns to scan the images on the screens one more time.
“This boy is a piece of me,” Hanaa tells Al Jazeera, referring to 18-year-old Omar, who disappeared along with one of his cousins, Alaa, when they went to inspect the ruins of their home in Jabaliya refugee camp in northern Gaza last June. Omar, a high school student, was the youngest among his seven siblings.
“Every child is precious to his family, but my son is a part of me,” she adds, tears streaming down her cheeks as she walks toward the morgue.
The family contacted the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and several human rights organisations to try to find out what happened to Omar and his cousin, but to no avail.
Hanaa says the wait has been heartbreaking.
“We do not know whether they are prisoners, or whether they [the Israelis] killed them and took their bodies or detained their bodies along with those bodies they release in batches.”
“We are running as if in a mirage and we do not know anything,” says Hanaa, falling silent as if trying to catch her breath.
Endless search
Since Israel began returning Palestinian bodies to Gaza through the Karem Abu Salem (Kerem Shalom) crossing, Hanaa has become one of hundreds of family members moving between hospitals and reception points seeking any clues to the fate of their loved ones.
The latest batch of bodies came on February 4. Gaza’s Health Ministry said 54 bodies and 66 boxes containing human remains, released by Israel via the ICRC, had been received.
The remains arrived at al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City, where medical and technical teams began initial examinations and documentation before presenting them to families for possible identification.
Human rights organisations say handovers occur through the Red Cross in accordance with international rules, but these procedures do not always include detailed documentation or the circumstances of death, increasing the burden on Gaza authorities to classify bodies and attempt identification amid limited capacity to conduct DNA testing.
Since the latest handover, Hanaa has gone to the hospital several times to review lists and photographs of the bodies.
“I have not left any place without going to it. I even went to Khan Younis in the south of the Strip to check the photos,” she says.
The bodies were returned under the United States-brokered October 2025 truce agreement between Israel and Hamas, which stipulated that the remains of 15 Palestinians would be exchanged for the bodies of every Israeli held in Gaza.
As of last month, Israeli authorities continue to hold the bodies of more than 770 Palestinians in what is known as the “cemeteries of numbers and morgues“, according to the National Campaign for the Recovery of Martyrs’ Bodies and Disclosing the Fate of the Missing.
Hanaa’s suffering does not stop at reviewing Palestinian bodies. She also checks the lists of prisoners released by Israel from time to time, contacting the ICRC to try to confirm if her son’s name appears.
“By God, the Red Cross has memorised me and my voice from how much I call and ask. They tell me: ‘Sister, aren’t you the one who called last time?’ I tell him: ‘Yes, my brother. Forgive me, it is not in my hands.’ He sympathises with me,” she says.
Despite the gruelling effort, there is still no decisive answer about her son’s fate.
“My heart as a mother wishes that my son is alive. But I prepare myself for the worst possibilities, and even this psychological preparation has brought no result,” Hanaa says.
‘Why do they leave us lost?’
Hanaa says the hardest part is not only the loss, but the state of confusion and disorientation she lives through, along with hundreds of members of other families still searching for their relatives.
“Why do they leave us lost like this? We don’t know where they went or what their fate is,” she says.
Another grim aspect is witnessing the “pitiful condition” in which the bodies are returned by Israel’s military. “All the features are completely buried, and I cannot even distinguish my son’s features.”
Hanaa says she believes the mutilation is “deliberate” to increase the pain of Palestinian families. “It is as if they want to leave us in grief for a lifetime … to mourn our children without end,” she says, tears unceasing.
“My son was in the prime of his youth, like a flower, when he was lost. He was preparing to sit for his high school exams with his cousin. What did they do to disappear like this and for us not to know their fate until now?”
Since the war began in October 2023, the fate of bodies held by Israel has emerged as a central humanitarian and legal issue in the conflict. Israel does not publish a unified list of named bodies it holds.
According to a statement by the Red Cross, it has “facilitated the transfer of 360 Palestinian bodies to Gaza since October 2023”, supported the handover of 195 Israeli captives, including 35 deceased, and the return of 3,472 Palestinian prisoners alive.
Only 99 returned Palestinian bodies have been definitively identified, according to the Health Ministry. The rest remain unidentified or are still undergoing identification procedures.
The ministry said some corpses show gunshot wounds to the head and chest, shrapnel injuries, fractures to the skull and limbs, in addition to advanced decomposition – greatly complicating forensic identification.
Appeal for international help
Hanaa called on international organisations to intervene to assist grieving families such as hers to determine the fate of their children.
“We cannot calm down or stabilise psychologically or socially. We are under enormous psychological pressure,” she says.
“They plowed the earth completely and exhumed graves searching for Israeli bodies with equipment and tests. But our children, no one asks about them. By what logic does this happen?”
At Gaza’s forensic department, a small team handles this heavy burden under conditions that exclude tools of “definitive confirmation”, leaving staff and families in a wide space of doubt.
Ahmed Abu Taha, head of the bodies and missing persons files at the Health Ministry, tells Al Jazeera that 120 corpses recently arrived in Gaza via the ICRC. Some came complete, while others were simply bone fragments and other human remains.
Out of the 120, only two bodies were identified, and even those were not scientifically conclusive.
“Confirmatory” tests such as DNA analysis, forensic anthropology, and forensic odontology are unavailable in Gaza’s destroyed healthcare system, meaning only “presumptive” testing can be conducted, which is less precise, says Abu Taha.
“The steps begin with presumptive testing – looking at distinguishing marks, clothes, whether male or female, estimating age, identifying distinguishing features such as amputations or tattoos… Then you move to confirmatory testing. But unfortunately, in Gaza we only have presumptive testing.”
This type of testing “is prone to many errors” including misidentification, he adds.
When error becomes tragedy
The most painful aspect, Abu Taha says, is the impact an “error” has on families waiting desperately to find the body of a missing child. Repeated misidentifications have been recorded, causing shock and reopening wounds for many Palestinians.
Abu Taha recounts one story that deeply affected him and illustrates the psychological and emotional damage inflicted on families amid the absence of accurate DNA tests.
“On one occasion, members of a family came and identified a body as their son. They presented evidence that closely matched the body. The forensic team examined it and found similarities, and indeed the body was handed over to that family.”
Grieving relatives completed the formal procedures for receiving the body, obtained a death certificate, then proceeded with funeral rites and burial. They announced a wake to receive mourners.
But a shock came when, only two days after the burial, another family presented more conclusive evidence that showed the deceased person belonged to them.
Abu Taha says the harrowing incident has been repeated inside Gaza’s beleaguered hospitals.
He is calling for international intervention to pressure Israel to allow the entry of identification equipment and DNA testing tools as an ethical and humanitarian matter to end the suffering of families struggling to identify loved ones and give them a proper burial.
“The file of the bodies is not merely a numerical issue,” Abu Taha says.

Negotiations with Greens on super tax changes ongoing
Circling back to Jim Chalmer's interview on ABC's Radio National Breakfast for a moment.
The treasurer was asked how negotiations with the Greens on a bid to double the tax on super fund earnings above $3 million from 15 per cent to 30 per cent, and to 40 per cent on earnings from funds with a balance higher than $10m.
Chalmers said he met with Greens spokesperson Nick McKim last week but those discussion hadn't reached a conclusion.
"I certainly appreciate the constructive way that they're coming at this," he said.
"They know that it's been introduced to the House. It'll be in the Senate before long. Our hope is that it will be resolved as soon as possible."
Dumping Ley won't make it harder for a woman to lead the Liberals: Hume
Deposing Sussan Ley as Liberal leader won't make it harder for a woman to lead the party in the future, new deputy Jane Hume says.
"No, not at all," she told Nine. "In fact, I think Sussan Ley would see that as an enormous insult if we spoke about this only in terms of gender.
"The most important thing we can do now is reset, because this is an existential crisis for us."
Taylor repeats it was a 'mistake' not to take tax cuts to election
Back to Angus Taylor and Jane Hume's joint morning media tour. The new opposition leader has reiterated it was a mistake for the Coalition not to take tax cuts to the last election.
Taylor and Hume were shadow treasurer and shadow finance minister at the last election. Asked if they think they're tainted by the result, Taylor said he's owned up to the error.
"We all make mistakes. The important thing is to say, to admit it, to make sure we don't make them again," Taylor told Nine.
"The thing we've learned here is that Australians want to see a Liberal Party that is a party of convictions not a party that goes with the politics of convenience."
Chalmers continues to insist he has no plans for capital gains tax discount changes
Meanwhile, the treasurer is continuing to insist the government has no current plans to make changes to the capital gains tax discount.
The government is considering whether to scale back the tax break ahead of the May budget.
"We haven't changed our tax policies," Jim Chalmers told ABC's Radio National Breakfast.
"We know there are intergenerational issues in our economy and in our budget. We're dealing with them in other ways, building more homes, making it easier to save for a deposit at the same time we cut income taxes."
It's likely Chalmers will continue to repeat this line that their policies haven't changed right up until, you know, the policies change.
We've seen this before: remember the reworked stage three tax cuts, anyone??
Chalmers accuses Liberals of playing politics on migration
Jim Chalmers is accusing the Coalition of playing politics with migration after the new leadership team flagged a tougher policy in a bid back voters.
New overseas migration has dropped in recent months after spiking when Labor came to government in 2022. Speaking with ABC's Radio National Breakfast, the treasurer defended the government's approach.
"We've made it very clear that the spike that we saw towards the end of the Coalition period in office and at the start of our time in office was not sustainable, that we needed to get net overseas migration down," he says.
The treasurer went on the attack and accused the Liberals of not taking the lessons from the last election.
"It's so important that we're doing this in a considered and methodical way rather than trying to play politics with it, which is what our opponents are doing," he says.
Nuclear should be in the mix, Taylor says
Angus Taylor and Jane Hume are also stopping by the morning shows together.
The new Liberal leadership team told Seven they're not under any illusions about the task ahead of them to turn the party's electoral fortunes around as opinion polls suggest Coalition voters have turned to One Nation.
"One Nation is really a party of grievance but people are rightly aggrieved right now ... they're looking for answers. They weren't finding it in the Liberal Party. That's why this reset is needed," Hume says.
After he was elected leader on Friday, Taylor flagged a focus on migration and deregulation.
Asked whether the Liberals would return to the nuclear power policy it took to the last election, Taylor said it should be part of Australia's energy mix.
"I think we need to open up our energy system to all available technologies," he says.
"The ideology we have seen from Labor where they only like some fuels, they hate others, is leading to huge increases in prices."
Chalmers mocks Taylor's request for spending audit
Jim Chalmers has hit the morning television circuit, where he's brushing off a call for a joint taskforce to tackle spending cuts.
The treasurer poked fun at the letter the new opposition leader sent to the prime minister as he rejected the proposal.
"He talked a big game on Friday. He said it was the Liberal Party's change or die moment. It turns out all he had in mind was to write a strongly worded letter to Anthony [Albanese]," he told Nine.
Asked what was wrong with the idea, Chalmers argues the government already knows its got more work to do ahead of the budget in May.
Taylor writes to PM to call for joint spending audit
New opposition leader Angus Taylor wants the government to set up a bipartisan taskforce to find areas to trim in the upcoming budget.
Taylor wrote to the PM to request the group be established to "identify practical, responsible and jointly supported measures for spending restraint".
"Record levels of government expenditure are contributing to higher inflation, upward pressure on interest rates and a growing public debt burden that will ultimately fall on future generations of Australians," Taylor said.
"Given the scale of the fiscal challenge and the need to provide urgent cost-of-living relief to Australian families, this structured, bipartisan mechanism offers a credible pathway to restoring fiscal discipline, rebuilding confidence, reducing the high rate of inflation and helping to ease pressure on interest rates."
Liberal Party divided over future direction
Internal machinations in the right wing of the Liberal Party are threatening to divide the party further after a tumultuous start to the political year that culminated in a change of leadership.
New leader Angus Taylor is seeking to unify the party that has already divorced its Coalition partner this year, and his elevation to the top job all but confirms the Liberals will shift further to the right in a bid to counter One Nation's surging popularity.
A tougher immigration policy is central to his vision as opposition leader, declaring on Friday, "the door must be shut" to people who don't align with "Australian values".
The party is yet to announce any policies, but senior sources have told Four Corners that the Liberal Party is actively discussing a controversial approach to immigration inspired by a recent UK Labour policy.
Good morning 👋
Hello friends and welcome to our federal politics live blog. It's great to have you joining us this morning.
I'm Courtney Gould, joining you from the ABC's team here in Parliament House ready to bring you all the latest.
Well, I hope you all had a nice break after the drama and intrigue that came along with last week's Liberal leadership spill. Newly minted Opposition Leader Angus Taylor will be out on the breakfast television circuit as he begins his bid to win over voters.
But what about the government, I hear you ask. We'll also be hearing from Treasurer Jim Chalmers first up. I'm sure he'll be asked a series of questions about reports he's considering an overhaul to the capital gains tax discount.
Let's just dive in and see where the day takes us, shall we?

Top US sanctions official poised to leave Treasury amid tensions: Report
Hurley’s departure follows friction with Treasury secretary over sanctions strategy
ISTANBUL
John Hurley, the Trump administration’s top sanctions official, is expected to leave his post at the Treasury Department following tensions with Secretary Scott Bessent over sanctions policy approaches and objectives, Bloomberg reported Sunday.
Hurley, the undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, could depart after months of internal discord over the methods and focus of US sanctions strategy, people familiar with the matter told the outlet.
Officials are considering several ambassadorial positions for Hurley in an effort to retain a trusted ally within the administration, according to sources cited by Bloomberg.
A senior administration official told Bloomberg that Hurley maintains a strong working relationship with Bessent at Treasury.
The Financial Times reported Friday that President Donald Trump is considering Hurley for the German ambassadorship.
There has been no official confirmation from US officials regarding the matter.
Washington has widely used sanctions as a foreign policy tool under the Trump administration, targeting countries including Iran, Venezuela and China over issues ranging from nuclear programs to economic activities.

Somali airstrike kills 15 al-Shabaab terrorists in southern Somalia
Airstrike targets terrorists planting improvised explosive devices along key road in Middle Shabelle region, says Somali Defense Ministry
ISTANBUL
The Somali Army carried out a targeted airstrike in southern Somalia, killing 15 al-Shabaab terrorists, the country’s Defense Ministry said Sunday.
In coordination with international partners, the airstrike targeted militants planting improvised explosive devices along a key road in the Middle Shabelle region, destroying a vehicle and weapons used in a plot to attack civilians, according to a ministry statement.
The al-Qaeda-affiliated terror group has been engaged in an insurgency against the Somali government for more than 16 years, frequently targeting security forces, officials, and civilians.
Since last July, the Somali army, with the support of the African Union Support and Stabilization Mission in Somalia and other international partners, has stepped up operations against al-Shabaab.
The African Union’s mission mandate was renewed by the UN Security Council in December for another year, with a UK-backed resolution extending its authorization until Dec. 31.

Türkiye condemns Israel's land registration move in West Bank

Türkiye on Sunday strongly condemned Israel's new decision on land registration in the occupied West Bank, calling it a violation of international law.
Earlier Sunday, the Israeli government approved a proposal to register vast areas of the occupied West Bank as “state property,” the first such measure since Israel occupied the territory in 1967.
Türkiye’s Foreign Ministry said in a statement that the move aims to impose Israel’s “authority over the occupied West Bank and expand settlement activities."
"This step, which seeks to forcibly displace the Palestinian people from their land and accelerate Israel's unlawful annexation efforts, constitutes a clear violation of international law and is null and void," the ministry said.
"Israel has no sovereignty over the occupied Palestinian territories," the ministry added, saying that the expansionist policies pursued by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government undermine peace efforts and damage prospects for a two-state solution.
Türkiye called on the international community to take a firm stance against Israeli attempts to create facts on the ground.
The ministry said Türkiye will continue to support efforts to "establish an independent, sovereign and contiguous" Palestinian state based on the 1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as its capital.
Israeli public broadcaster KAN reported that the proposal was submitted by far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, Justice Minister Yariv Levin, and Defense Minister Israel Katz.
“The initial goal is the gradual settlement of 15% of Area C by 2030,” daily Israel Hayom said ahead of the government decision.
Under the Oslo II Accord signed in 1995, Area A is under full Palestinian control, Area B is under Palestinian civil control and Israeli security control, while Area C, accounting for about 61% of the West Bank, remains under full Israeli control.
The Oslo II Accord limits land registration by the Palestinian Authority to Areas A and B, while prohibiting it in Area C.
The move was part of a series of measures approved by Israel’s Security Cabinet last week aimed at expanding illegal settlement building and increasing Tel Aviv’s control of the occupied West Bank.
According to Israeli media, the measures include repealing a law that barred the sale of land in the West Bank to illegal Israeli settlers, unsealing land ownership records, and shifting authority for building permits in a settlement bloc near Hebron from a Palestinian municipality to Israel’s civil administration.
Israel has intensified operations in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, since launching its military campaign in Gaza on Oct. 8, 2023. Palestinians view the escalation – including killings, arrests, displacement, and settlement expansion – as a step toward formal annexation of the territory.
In a landmark opinion in July 2024, the International Court of Justice declared Israel’s occupation of Palestinian territory illegal and called for the evacuation of all settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem.

Warner Bros weighs reopening sale negotiations with Paramount

Warner Bros weighs reopening sale negotiations with Paramount
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
NEW YORK - Warner Bros Discovery is considering reopening sale talks with rival Hollywood studio Paramount Skydance after receiving its hostile suitor’s most recent amended offer, people with knowledge of the matter said.
Members of the Warner Bros board are discussing whether Paramount could offer a path to a superior deal, people familiar with the board’s thinking said, a move that may ignite a second bidding war with Netflix
The board hasn’t decided how to respond and still has a binding agreement with Netflix, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing nonpublic information.
Paramount submitted amended terms last week that addressed several concerns.
The company will cover a US$2.8 billion (S$3.5 billion) fee owed to Netflix if Warner Bros terminates their agreement, and is offering to backstop a Warner Bros debt refinancing.
Paramount also said it will compensate Warner Bros shareholders if the deal doesn’t close by Dec 31, underscoring its confidence that the deal will get swift regulatory approval.
Warner Bros still has some concerns about Paramount’s offer, many of which it has outlined in past statements, but this is the first time the board has considered Paramount’s offer could lead to a better deal or prompt Netflix to up its bid. It has also faced pressure from shareholders to at least engage with Paramount.
Warner Bros has agreed to sell its namesake studio and HBO Max streaming business to Netflix in a US$27.75 a share deal.
Warner Bros has been racing to hold a shareholder vote on its Netflix agreement, while Paramount, the owner of CBS and MTV, has been appealing directly to Warner Bros shareholders through a US$30-a-share tender offer and is lobbying regulators to approve its deal.
Both Paramount and streaming leader Netflix have indicated they would be willing to raise their bids in order to secure a deal for Warner Bros, one of the largest US media companies.
Paramount Chief Executive Officer David Ellison has said the current offer isn’t his last and final bid, while Netflix’s leadership has told shareholders it could go higher as well.
Both companies are wary of spending too much. Shares of Netflix have declined more than 40 per cent
Mr Chris Marangi, co-chief investment officer at Gabelli Funds, said that while he was a bit disappointed Paramount didn’t raise its offering price this week, the latest changes to the terms suggest the company is finding “ways to be creative about structuring a deal.”
“Like the Warner Bros board, I want to see a sweetened offer,” said Mr Marangi, whose company owns Warner Bros shares.
If Warner Bros decides to re-engage with Paramount, it would need to notify Netflix first. Warner Bros would then try to get Paramount to increase its offer beyond US$30 a share. If Warner Bros decided Paramount’s new offer was superior, Netflix would have the right to match it.
Paramount triggered the auction of Warner Bros with an unsolicited offer in 2025.
The company increased the price several times before ultimately losing to Netflix. Paramount leadership has insisted its deal is better and has spent the last couple months wooing regulators and shareholders.
A number of Warner Bros shareholders, including Pentwater Capital Management and Ancora Holdings Group, have gone public with their belief that the board should engage with Paramount. But just 42.3 million shares were tendered to Paramount at last count, less than 2 per cent of those outstanding. BLOOMBERG

Türkiye set to introduce new social media rules to protect children, says family minister
'Just like many countries around the world, we are very close to implementing social media regulations aimed at protecting our children,' says Mahinur Ozdemir Goktas
ISTANBUL
Türkiye is getting ready to introduce new regulations to protect children on social media platforms, the country’s family and social services minister said Sunday.
On the Turkish social media platform NSosyal, Mahinur Ozdemir Goktas said the government is close to putting the measures into effect, citing growing concerns about the impact of constant digital stimulation on children.
"Just like many countries around the world, we are very close to implementing social media regulations aimed at protecting our children," she said.
Goktas warned that people’s attention spans have dropped to about eight seconds, a trend she said harms children more than adults.
She added that children’s attention spans have declined by at least 30% over the past decade, impacting their concentration, friendships, and academic performance.
These changes have also made teaching more difficult, she said, adding that similar social media rules for children are being debated or introduced in countries around the world.
She said Türkiye is working to create a safer internet environment for children, calling on parents and teachers to support the effort. "Together, we can make a safe internet possible for our children," she added.

DNA pulled from glove found near Nancy Guthrie’s home as FBI believe it may belong to suspect seen in doorbell cam
Nancy Guthrie was last seen at her Arizona home on January 31

The FBI said a glove found two miles from Nancy Guthrie’s Arizona home could match the gloves worn by an “armed” person seen in surveillance footage outside her front door the morning she disappeared, according to the Associated Press.
This comes after the FBI released new photos and videos from Guthrie’s doorbell camera of a suspect, who was wearing a ski mask and gloves, approaching her front door. Police said the man was armed and appeared to tamper with her camera.
The glove, which the agency said could match those worn by the suspect, has reportedly been sent off for DNA testing. While investigators have received the preliminary results, they’re still waiting on official confirmation, the AP reports.
The agency reportedly said about 16 gloves have been found near Guthrie’s home, most of which were later identified as gloves used by searchers that had been discarded.
Nancy Guthrie, the 84-year-old mother of “Today” show anchor Savannah Guthrie, was last seen at her home in the Catalina Foothills, a quiet community just outside of Tucson, Arizona, on January 31. She was reported missing the next day.
The masked individual seen at Nancy Guthrie’s front door has been described as a man with an average build who is between 5’9” and 5’10” tall. He was wearing a black, 25-liter ‘Ozark Trail Hiker Pack’ backpack, the FBI noted.
On Thursday, the FBI also announced a new reward of $100,000 for information “leading to the location of Nancy Guthrie and/or the arrest and conviction of anyone involved in her disappearance.”
This comes after law enforcement officials carried out operations in the Tucson area Friday related to Guthrie’s disappearance.
Investigators searched a residence about two miles from Guthrie’s home Friday night, with a warrant that was “based on a lead,” a Pima County Sheriff’s Department spokesperson said Saturday. No arrests were made.
Around the same time, officials conducted a separate traffic stop, also near Guthrie’s home. Investigators questioned an individual, but no arrests were made, the sheriff’s department spokesperson said.
The search for Guthrie is now entering its third week. Investigators “won’t quit” their efforts to find Guthrie, even if it takes years, Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos told The New York Times.
“Maybe it’s an hour from now,” Nanos said Friday. “Maybe it’s weeks or months or years from now. But we won’t quit. We’re going to find Nancy. We’re going to find this guy."
Her disappearance has sparked a massive search involving state and federal law enforcement agencies.
Guthrie relies on daily medication, and there could be “fatal” consequences if she doesn’t take it, Nanos has said. When she vanished, police also flagged that she has high blood pressure, a pacemaker and cardiac issues, according to a 911 dispatch audio.
Savannah Guthrie has said she believes her mother is still alive. The “Today” show anchor recently shared an old video of her mother on Instagram with the caption, “We will never give up on her.”
She also shared the footage of the masked man and asked for anyone with information to come forward. “Someone out there recognizes this person. We believe she is still out there. Bring her home,” she wrote on Instagram.
The Pima County Sheriff’s Department said anyone with information should contact 1-800-CALL-FBI, 520-351-4900, 88-CRIME or visit tips.fbi.gov.

Ansell profit jumps on tariff price rise
The protective goods maker Ansell has posted a 62% rise in first-half profit to $US89 million ($126 million).
Sales revenue rose above $1 billion after the company increased the cost of its goods to cover the impact of the US tariff regime that has targeted its products, which are largely produced in South-East Asia.
Underlying profit rose 18% to $US96 million ($136 million).
Outgoing CEO Neil Salmon described market conditions as subdued.
"We delivered a strong set of first half results in what were subdued market conditions," Mr Salmon said in a statement to the ASX.
"While we do not anticipate any meaningful improvement in market conditions, we continue to see growth opportunities in verticals and geographies favoured by increased public and private investment."
GPT rebounds with an almost $1 billion profit
Retail and office-focused property trust GPT has bounced back from a heavy loss last year to post a full-year $981 million profit.
The rebound from last year's $200 million loss was built on valuation gains and $1.4 billion in new partnerships and co-investments.
GPT's investment portfolio rose by $309 million over the year.
It achieved a 99.8% occupancy rate in its retail properties, while its office projects were 93% occupied.
GPT will pay a final dividend of 12 cents per security, bringing the total to 35.4 cps, a 4% increase on the previous year.
US reporting season winding down
The headline event on this week's US quarterly reporting calendar will be the retail giant Wallmart.
As Reuters notes, "the retailing bellwether offers Wall Street a view into consumer spending trends after data this week showed US retail sales were unexpectedly unchanged in December.
Other retailers will follow with their reports over the next few weeks, including Home Depot, Lowe's and Target.
With its stock up 20% this year, Walmart recently pushed its market capitalisation above $1 trillion.
It is by far the biggest company by market value in the consumer staples sector, which is up 15% in 2026.
US traders face a shortened week due to the Presidents' Day holiday on Monday.

BlueScope H1 profit more than doubles to $391 million
Takeover target BlueScope Steel has announced a 118% increase in first half profit of $391 million.
It's an increase of $212 million on the first half of 2025.
In announcement to the ASX, BlueScope said it expected an increase in earnings in the second half with underlying EBIT (earnings before interest and tax) in the range of $620 million to $700 million, up from $558 million in the first half.
The company also slashed its net debt to just $2 million from $28 million and announced an unfranked interim dividend of 65 cps.
Results: BHP vs Rio Tinto in a blue-chip deluge
Monday: JB Hi Fi, Treasury Wine Estates, a2 Milk, Aurizon, BlueScope, GPT, Stockland, Ansell, Bendigo & Adelaide Bank
Tuesday: BHP, Seek, Sims, Challenger, Reliance Worldwide, Baby Bunting, HealthCo, Healthcare & Wellness REIT
Wednesday: Suncorp, Mirvac, Santos, Fletcher Building, Lottery Corp, Magellan, Spark NZ, Vicinity Centres, Dexus, NAB (Q1)
Thursday: Rio Tinto, Wesfamers, Medibank, Telstra, Transurban, Goodman, Brambles, Sonic Healthcare, Whitehaven, Telix, Bega Cheese, NRW, HUB24, APA, Lifestyle Communities, Charter Hall, Downer EDI, IPH, Auckland Airports
Friday: QBE, Qube, Mineral Resources, Perseus Mining, Megaport, Netwealth, Polynovo, Latitude, Inghams
The ASX reporting season hits its stride this week with about 80 major companies releasing (mainly interim) results.
The widely held blue chips from the top 20 include the likes of Wesfarmers, Telstra, Goodman Group, Brambles and Santos, while BHP (half year) and Rio Tinto (full year) will go toe-to-toe in the clash of the global mining titans.
AMP's head of investment strategy, Shane Oliver, always keeps a close eye on the scorecard and says so far (20% of companies reporting) results have shown more than normal upside surprises and more companies reporting profits or dividends up on a year ago compared to what was occurring in 2023 and 2024.
Upside beats are running at 44%, with disappointments at a much-lower-than-usual 29%.
"This helped the share market rise over the last week, but it was a messy ride with more companies actually seeing their share price fall on announcement day than rise whereas in the June half reporting season it was the other way around," Dr Oliver said.
"The outsized negative share price reactions even to strong results highlights just how much good news has been factored into share prices."
a2 Milk profit up 9% on China sales
The NZ-based dairy producer a2 Milk has reported a 9.4% lift in half year net profit to $112 million.
Its underlying profit, stripping out on-off impacts, was up 19.6%.
a2's sales to the key Chinese (& other Asia) market rose 20.3% over the half. Australia/NZ sales were up 8.9%, while US sales increased 29%.
The company raised its sale growth guidance from low double-digit growth to mid-double-digit growth with improved margins.
a2 Milk's CEO David Bortolussi said the infant milk formula remains central to the company's growth strategy.
"We continue to execute our growth strategy with a focus on maximising opportunities in China infant milk formula, adjacent categories and new markets," he said.
a2 will pay a fully franked interim dividend of 11.5 cents per share, which is at the higher end of its payout policy range,
This week: Australian jobs and wages, US GDP and inflation
Australia:
Tue: RBA minutes
Wed: Wage Price Index (Q4), Westpac Leading Index (Jan)
Thu: Labour force (Jan)
International:
Mon: US — Markets closed
CN — Markets closed
JP — GDP (Q4)
Tue: EU — Business expectations (Feb)
UK — Unemployment, jobs (Dec & Jan)
Wed: US — Industrial production (Jan), FOMC minutes
Thu: US — Trade balance (Dec)
Fri: US — GDP (Q4), PCE inflation (Dec), PMI (Feb)
EU — PMI (Feb)
JP — CPI (Jan), PMI (Feb)
The local focus of the week will be the labour market, with key figures for both jobs and wages being released.
The Q4 Wage Price Index (Wednesday) is forecast to show wages rising by a solid 0.8% over the three months to January, following a 0.8% rise in the September quarter.
That result would deliver an annual wage growth of 3.4%.
The January labour force data (Thursday) should show the jobs market remains in shape.
The December figures reported a stronger-than-expected 65,000 new jobs over the month and unemployment dropping from 4.3% to 4.1%.
The CBA economics points out there is volatility in the series and for that reason forecasts more modest employment growth of about 15,000 and unemployment nudging back to 4.2%, "offsetting some of the outsized gains in December".
The RBA will also publish the minutes (Tuesday) for this month's board meeting, where it raised the cash rate by 25 bps.
Offshore, much of the focus will centre on US GDP and the Fed's preferred measure of inflation Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE), both out on Friday.
Societe Generale forecast US Q4 GDP growth should remain solid but impacted by the federal government shutdown late last year.
SG is forecasting US GDP growth of 1.9%, below the consensus forecast of 2.2%.
It says PCE inflation should come in at "a firm pace (of 0.3% over the month) with some upside risk due to the stickiness … of core services PCE inflation."
Wall Street edges higher, ASX poised for rebound
Wall Street's key indices faded over Friday's afternoon session, only making marginal gains despite lower-than-expected inflation figures.
The S&P 500 and Dow gained 0.05%, and 0.1%.
The Nasdaq crept over the advantage line very late in the session to end 0.2% higher.
Consumer inflation (CPI) coming in at 2.4% year-on-year offset stronger payroll data earlier in the week and shortened the odds of the Fed delivering at least two rate cuts this year.
European markets were generally weaker despite a 0.3% lift in Germany.
The broad Eurostoxx 600 retreated 0.1% while the global MSCI was down 0.2% hit by selling across Asia earlier in the day.
Over the week, the S&P 500 shed 1.4% while Europe made a marginal loss.
The ASX gained 2.4% over the week, supported by profit growth showing up in corporate results, but the ASX was well and truly outpaced by the 5% post-election rally in Japan.
Having suffered something of a setback on Friday, the ASX looks like making solid gains on opening with futures trading 0.6% higher at the close on Saturday morning.
The US CPI saw US Treasury bond yields slip to 10-week lows, while the Greenback was relatively flat, although marginally stronger against the Aussie dollar.
Gold (+2.5%) jumped back above $US5000/ounce on the back of the increased prospects of rate cuts.
The inflation-driven optimism flowed through to energy markets, offsetting supply concerns over the OPEC+ cartel again looking at increasing production.
The global benchmark Brent crude rose 0.3% to $US 67.75/barrel.
The base metal market softened on the London Metals Exchange with copper down 2.4%, aluminium down 0.2% and nickel down 3.5%.
Good morning
Good morning and welcome to another day on the ABC markets and finance blog.
Stephen Letts from ABC business team limbering up for a blow-by-blow coverage of the day's events, where every post is hopefully a winner, but none should be construed as financial advice.
In short, it looks like the local market is heading higher today despite an uninspiring end to the week on Wall Street, where the key indices faded after a bright start to the session.
ASX 200 futures at the close of trade early on Saturday morning pointed to a rise of around 0.6%.
Data wise, it's a quiet day locally, while Q4 GDP data will be released in Japan, which is expected to show the economy has returned to growth.
It's the start of the Lunar New Year, which will impact markets throughout Asia, while Wall Street will also be closed tonight.
Companies reporting this morning include JB HiFi, Treasury Wine Estates, a2 Milk, Aurizon, BlueScope Steel, Bendigo & Adelaide Bank, GPT, Stockland with interim results. Ansell will release its full-year figures.
Given we're not a bot (yet), we'll attempt to do as much as humanly possible to cover the deluge. You can always drop a comment if you think we've missed something.
As always, the game's afoot, so let's get blogging.

Is Trumpism losing steam?
As Trumpism forces both major US parties to wonder what they stand for, experts weigh in on November election prospects.
The Republican Party currently controls the White House and both houses of Congress in the United States. But will that change in November?
Among Republican voters, US President Donald Trump is still wildly popular, despite criticism over uneven economic conditions and brutal anti-immigration tactics. And within the Democratic Party establishment, there is no sign of a desire to shift towards a more progressive, less centrist platform – even as left-leaning Democratic Socialists make gains.
Host Steve Clemons asks Republican strategist John Feehery and Amy Dacey, former chair of the Democratic National Committee, about Trumpism and the election prospects of both parties.

Trump’s bizarre Valentine’s Day fundraising letter asked ‘do you still love me?’ — and E Jean Carroll said she received it

Trump’s bizarre Valentine’s Day fundraising letter asked ‘do you still love me?’ — and E Jean Carroll said she received it
Political action committees affiliated with the president has sent several Valentine’s Day-themed emails begging for donations
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
E. Jean Carroll, the writer who won an $83.3 million defamation lawsuit against President Donald Trump after he denied sexually abusing her, said she received a Valentine’s Day-themed fundraising email from a political action committee associated with the president that asks “do you still love me?”
The email, from “secret admirer Donald J. Trump,” begs people to read the “love letter” from the president and prove their devotion with a monetary donation.
“Roses are red, violets are blue. Do you still love Trump, as I love you?” the email from the PAC Never Surrender Inc. says.
“Before you read my letter – do you still love me and our great movement?” It adds, with a photo of Trump putting a Valentine's Day card in a mailbox. “I love you, and I was pretty sure you loved me back! Is everything ok?”
Carroll wrote on X: “Yes. This is a real email. No .I did not sign up on this mailing list. Yes. We are living in a crazy world.”
It is unclear why Carroll received the email if she never signed up for Trump’s campaign fundraising emails. Never Surrender Inc. is the president’s leadership PAC, which was converted from his 2024 presidential campaign after he won the election.
The Independent has asked Never Surrender Inc. for comment.
Carroll sued the president for defamation in 2019, during the first Trump administration, after the president denied her claim that he raped her in the 1990s. After a jury found Trump liable for sexual abuse, a separate jury awarded her millions for the repeated defamatory statements Trump made about her.
Carroll did not say whether or not she had received other Valentine’s Day-themed fundraising emails from Never Surrender Inc. The PAC has sent several over the month, similarly themed around a “love letter” which takes people to a donation website when opened.
In the past, Trump has relied on the money small donors give to PACs affiliated with him to pay his legal bills when he was embroiled in state and federal civil and criminal cases.
That includes fees for Alina Habba, who defended Trump in his federal civil defamation case with Carroll. Federal Election Commission records showed that the Make America Great Again Inc. super PAC and Save America PAC paid Habba’s firm roughly $4 million.
Never Surrender Inc. has sent hundreds of similar emails, purporting to be directly from Trump, asking supporters to show their love by taking a “poll” or leaving a personalized note that requires a monetary donation to be submitted.
Early on in February, Never Surrender Inc. sent an email saying, “I placed a special LOVE LETTER in the mailbox.”
“I love you, and I was pretty sure you loved me! But a few days ago, I sent a special LOVE LETTER for you and I haven’t heard back,” the email from February 4 reads.
Another one, from Valentine’s Day, reads “Do you need a hug?”
“Before Valentine’s Day is over, can you leave me a quick personal note? I’m dying to read it,” the email reads. It takes users to a similar donation website with a box available for people to leave a personalized note.

A critical point for Ukraine – and for Europe
United Kingdom
Unknown Publisher
2026-02-15
20:00:17 GMT
05:00:17 KST

Almost four years after Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the situation on the ground and in the diplomatic arena has become critical. Our report from Kyiv graphically depicts the plight of so many residents in Ukraine’s capital city, who face nightly Russian air raids, targeting primarily civilian power supplies, in mid-winter. The intensity of the attacks, the damage sustained for want of sufficient air defence, and the winter temperatures have all been markedly worse than in previous years.
The human aspect, as ever, is the most poignant: nursery-age children who have learned to distinguish outgoing from incoming fire; a parliamentarian relieved that his family lacked the money to buy a flat in an adjacent high-rise that turned out to be more vulnerable than his ground-floor flat in an older building; no hot water, no heating or power, for all but two of 24 hours, all detrimental for wellbeing and morale. If this is what it is like living an MP’s relatively privileged life in Kyiv, the conditions for others, including those living further east, in the actual battle zone, must be many times worse.
Yet Ukrainians fight on, demonstrating admirable, almost superhuman, fortitude in their determination not to cede land to the Russian aggressor, and especially not the fortress belt that Russia has not been able to win on the battlefield and is seen as crucial to Ukraine’s security, now and in the future. Those who argue that it is time to stop praising Ukrainian resilience and time instead to focus on the actions that have made that resilience necessary are not wrong. But without Ukraine’s resilience, this could be a very different story.
Nor is it only on the ground that the situation has reached a critical point. The diplomacy that dates from the start of Donald Trump’s second term in office appears to stand at a potentially pivotal point, too. Both the dangers and, alas, the rather fewer hopes for peace, were on display this weekend at the Munich Security Conference.
This time last year, Europe was reeling from the speech at that same conference of the US vice-president, JD Vance, and what appeared his shocking litany of charges against Europe. This year, the most senior US speaker was the secretary of state, Marco Rubio, who sounded a more emollient and reassuring note, underlining a continuing US commitment to Europe, and paying tribute to European cultural achievements.
But he also left two raw realities in place. There would be no going back on the demand that Europe take responsibility for its own defence. And Ukraine – which he did not mention once by name in his speech, although that was more than made up for during questions and side-meetings – was primarily a European problem, and would be entirely a European problem if the current, US-led, diplomacy failed. He also noted that any agreement would require “hard concessions” on the part of Ukraine.
If that was intended to be a signal in advance of a new round of talks, involving both Ukrainians and Russians, due to take place in Geneva this week, it received a distinctly frosty response from Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelensky and his team of officials, who were also in Munich. Their view was that the US consistently made more demands of them than of the Russians, that further territorial concessions were out of the question, and that the prospect of elections in Ukraine – mooted last week – was barely on the drawing board.
Discussions, on and off the podium, at Munich, underlined not only the fitful and inconsistent nature of Mr Trump’s so far failed peace efforts on Ukraine, but also the extent of Europe’s exclusion, despite European leaders having made valiant attempts to be heard in the early months of Mr Trump’s second-term presidency. Now, once again, they find themselves on the outside, but with their solidarity weaker than it was, with divisions about how much support can be afforded for Ukraine and whether perhaps to open a channel to Moscow.
As so often, the European case was made most persuasively by Poland’s foreign minister, Radoslaw Sikorski. Now that Europe was effectively paying for Ukraine’s defence, he said, which includes funding weapons purchases from the United States, then the Europeans deserved a say in any talks and in what happens next. It is a position that is hard to argue with, but which could also come back to haunt the Europeans, who would be left with the sole responsibility, should Mr Trump decide to give up.
This makes the state of diplomacy at least as perilous for Ukraine as the increasingly difficult situation on the ground in Kyiv and elsewhere. Mr Zelensky sees the United States as essential to any peace, because he believes that it alone has the power to implement the security guarantees Ukraine needs. The growing detachment of the US administration from the whole process, however, was clear for all to see at the Munich conference, which is why the talks set to convene in Geneva are make-or-break as almost never before and not just for Ukraine, but for relations between the US and Europe.

DNA pulled from glove found near Nancy Guthrie’s home as FBI believe it may belong to suspect seen in doorbell cam
Nancy Guthrie was last seen at her Arizona home on January 31

The FBI said a glove found two miles from Nancy Guthrie’s Arizona home could match the gloves worn by an “armed” person seen in surveillance footage outside her front door the morning she disappeared, according to the Associated Press.

French justice minister blames ‘ultra-left’ for youth’s killing that shocked France

French justice minister blames ‘ultra-left’ for youth’s killing that shocked France
Victim Quentin Deranque, aligned with far right, beaten while guarding protest of lawmaker from left-wing France Unbowed; party leader voices ‘shock,’ rejects blame for incident
The “ultra-left” in France was behind the fatal beating of a French youth aligned with the far right, Paris’s justice minister said on Sunday, after the killing inflamed political tension in the country ahead of elections.
Justice Minister Gerald Darmanin also accused hard-left politicians, including those from the France Unbowed party, the largest left-wing faction in parliament, of fueling violence with their language.
The victim, Quentin Deranque, aged 23, was hospitalized and placed into a coma on Thursday after being attacked in the southeastern city of Lyon. The office of the Lyon prosecutor on Saturday told AFP that Deranque had died of his wounds.
Supporters said he had been providing security at a protest against an appearance by Rima Hassan, a member of the European Parliament for France Unbowed, when he was assaulted by a gang of rival activists.
Investigators are working on identifying the perpetrators, the prosecutors’ office said on Sunday. An investigation has been opened into suspected aggravated manslaughter.
“It was clearly the ultra-left that killed him,” Darmanin told the Cologne-based RTL television.
“There are indeed speeches, particularly from France Unbowed and the ultra-left, which unfortunately lead to unbridled violence on social networks and then in the physical world,” he said.
“Words can kill,” Darmanin added, accusing Hassan and France Unbowed leader Jean-Luc Melenchon of “not having a word to say for the family of the young man.”
Later Sunday, Melenchon voiced his “shock” at the killing.
“We also send our empathy and compassion to his family and loved ones,” he said.
Melenchon, a three-time presidential candidate widely expected to run again in elections next year, added that his movement opposes violence, rejecting the blame placed on it as lacking “any connection with reality.”
Centrist President Emmanuel Macron has called for “calm” and “restraint.”
An alleged video of the attack broadcast by the French TF1 television shows a dozen people hitting three others lying on the ground, two of whom manage to escape.
“I heard shouts, people were hitting each other with iron bars and so forth. When I came to the scene, I saw individuals covered in blood,” a witness to the attack, who gave only the first name Adem, told AFP.
According to the Nemesis collective, which is associated with the far right, Quentin was providing security for its protesters and was assaulted by “anti-fascist” activists.
The family’s lawyer said in a statement that Quentin appeared to have been ambushed by “organized and trained individuals, vastly superior in number, and armed, some with their faces masked.”
The incident has further fueled tension between France’s far right and hard left ahead of municipal elections nationwide in March and the 2027 presidential race.
Three-time presidential candidate Marine Le Pen, who is still hoping to stand in 2027, despite a graft conviction, said on X that the “barbarians responsible for this lynching” should be brought to justice.
Demonstrations called by the far right in memory of Quentin took place in the southern city of Montpellier and Paris, where protesters unfurled a banner reading “Antifa murderers, justice for Quentin.”
The far right has pointed the finger at la Jeune Garde (Young Guard), an anti-fascist youth offshoot of France Unbowed.
But its founder, Raphael Arnault, a France Unbowed lawmaker, expressed his “horror” at the fatal beating, and the group denied involvement, saying it had “suspended all activities.”
France Unbowed lawmaker Eric Coquerel, speaking to Franceinfo, condemned “all political violence,” but said the activists responsible for Hassan’s security “were in no way involved in what happened.”
He pointed instead to a particular “context” in the southeastern city marked by violence from “far-right groups.”
At Saint George’s Church in Lyon, which the young man attended and where he volunteered for charities, priest Laurent Spriet called on Sunday for prayers “for the peace of Quentin’s soul.”
“Everything in its own time. Now is for compassion, for respect, for prayer, for letting the police and the justice system do their work,” he said.

MUNICH — European and American leaders spent three days pledging cooperation and offering to slap a new coat of paint on the façade of the transatlantic relationship. But the cracks are still showing.
The United States was less combative than a year ago in its showing at the Munich Security Conference, when Vice President JD Vance launched a scorching attack on Europe.
But the gathering showed that while the alliance continues to function, the old order that bound the two sides of the Atlantic for decades has broken down. There is no consensus on how the relationship can move forward given the regular seismic shocks the Trump administration revels in delivering to the system.

Immigration and taxes: Angus Taylor outlines agenda ahead of front bench announcement

Opposition Leader Angus Taylor will soon unveil his overhauled front bench as he signals a shift to the right with a focus on issues such as immigration.
The newly elected Liberal leader spent his first few days in the role sketching key priorities after ousting the party's first female leader, Sussan Ley, on Friday following weeks of infighting.
Policy announcements are expected to be accompanied by a refreshed front bench, with exiled conservatives and leadership agitators Andrew Hastie and Jacinta Nampijinpa Price poised to return.
"They're magnificent members of our team," Taylor said on Sunday of the pair, whose previous frontbench stints ended due to migration-related issues.
While offering few details on his party's approach, Taylor promised to pursue a stricter immigration policy, repeatedly flagging plans to reduce the nation's migrant intake and tighten screening.
"The (migration) numbers under Labor have been just extraordinary — way beyond what this country can absorb," he said.
"Standards have been too low, numbers have been too high and we haven't explicitly shut the door on people who reject our way of life."
The Hume MP said he would unveil a full policy "in the coming days".
Taylor has insisted the Coalition is not trying to become "One Nation lite" as it bleeds voter support to the anti-immigration party.
The first poll since Taylor became Liberal leader, published by Nine newspapers on Monday, showed Labor with 32 per cent of the primary vote and One Nation and the Coalition tied on 23 per cent.
The Resolve poll of 1,800 people conducted between 8 February and 14 February found a Taylor-led Coalition three percentage points ahead of an Opposition led by Ley.
One Nation recorded primary support of 27 per cent in the latest Newspoll, conducted before Taylor toppled Ley as leader, with the Coalition on 18 per cent.
Former senior immigration official Abul Rizvi said Taylor's pointed tough-on-immigration stance could be directly influenced by One Nation's rise.
"He reads the polls as closely as anybody," Rizvi said.
However, he noted strong character requirements already existed for migrants looking to enter Australia and they had only been tightened by anti-hate crime laws introduced after the Bondi terror attack.
Taylor and deputy Jane Hume have also repeatedly vowed to offer lower taxes, a renewed focus on housing affordability and the end of an "ideological approach" to energy policies.
Hume said Australia needed to be "open-minded" on nuclear energy if the country was to reduce emissions and make power cheaper.

Opposition Leader Angus Taylor has avoided committing to made public the internal election review into the Coalition’s 2025 wipeout.
Former leader Sussan Ley had promised transparency about what went wrong for the Coalition last year, which won 42 lower house seats to Labor’s 94.
But Taylor this morning declined to commit to the review’s release, repeatedly saying “that’s a matter for the party organisation”.
Party executives are considering burying the review, which warns that no leader should be able to run their own campaign as then leader Peter Dutton had, The Australian Financial Review reported this morning.
The review was delayed last month after Dutton claimed that elements of the report were defamatory to him and his staff, according to the ABC.

IDF strikes Islamic Jihad terrorists near Lebanon-Syria border

The IDF said Sunday it carried out an airstrike against Palestinian Islamic Jihad terrorists in the area of Majdal Anjar in Lebanon’s Bekaa Valley, near the Syrian border.
The military did not immediately identify the specific targets, but the strike was considered relatively unusual, as operations in Lebanon have largely focused on Hezbollah rather than Palestinian Islamic Jihad or Hamas.
Majdal Anjar is a predominantly Sunni town located about 33 kilometers from Metula, near the Syrian border. The area sits at a junction linking the Baalbek-Marjayoun road with the international highway connecting Beirut and Damascus. Due to its location, the town serves as a transit point for goods moving between Syria and Lebanon and onward to other Arab countries, and hosts numerous import-export businesses.
The strike came a day after the IDF targeted Hezbollah weapons depots and infrastructure in southern Lebanon. The Hezbollah-affiliated Al-Manar television channel reported at the time that fighter jets carried out a series of strikes in the village of Bouslaya, between Houmine al-Fawqa and Deir al-Zahrani, and in the Jabal al-Rihan area.
The IDF continued strikes against Hezbollah targets overnight, as part of ongoing efforts to thwart attempts by the terrorist organization to rebuild its capabilities. Operations have included fighter jet strikes, drone attacks on vehicles carrying terrorists, as well as artillery and machine gun fire.
Despite the continued military activity, there has been no significant diplomatic progress, and the situation along the northern front remains largely at a standstill pending broader regional developments, particularly involving Iran.
Even amid the stalemate, several upcoming meetings are expected to influence developments. The Lebanese government is scheduled to convene Monday, when Army Commander Rodolphe Haykal is expected to present an update on the army’s plan to consolidate weapons under state control.
According to recent reports, Haykal is set to outline the second phase of the plan, covering areas north of the Litani River. Hezbollah has refused to relinquish its weapons, arguing that U.N. Security Council Resolution 1701 applies only to areas south of the Litani. The terrorist organization maintains that the Lebanese government should instead focus on securing the withdrawal of remaining Israeli forces from southern Lebanon.

From Central Europe, Rubio Rejects NATO Exit Talk, Calls For Stronger European Role

BRATISLAVA -- Just one day after addressing the Munich Security Conference, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio used a brief stop in the Slovak capital to dispel fears of a US retreat from NATO, telling reporters that Washington remains firmly committed to the alliance.
Standing alongside Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico on February 15, Rubio dismissed concerns triggered by recent US troop adjustments in Europe.
“We're not leaving NATO. We're not leaving.... We may move a couple thousand troops from one country to another, but this has always been the case,” Rubio said, playing down speculation that redeployments signal a broader shift.
The number of US troops in Europe typically fluctuates between 80,000 and 100,000, depending on operations, training exercises, and rotational deployments. In fall 2025, the US announced that soldiers from the 101st Airborne Division, the majority of whom were deployed in Romania, would redeploy without being replaced.
Rubio also criticized what he described as alarmist interpretations of Washington’s call for higher European defense spending. “Every time we say this, people go crazy. They think that means you're going to abandon NATO, you're going to abandon your allies,” Rubio said, adding: “The point we're making is that the stronger our allies are, the stronger we are collectively.”
Instead of abandonment, Rubio framed his urging of European allies to spend more on defense as a recognition that NATO is more durable when its European members are more militarily capable.
“We are not threatened or feel that it's hostile to see NATO grow in its own capabilities, not independent of the United States, [but] in conjunction with the United States,” he said.
'We Want To Be Your Partner'
Rubio was explicit that Washington does not want Europe to remain dependent. “We're not asking Europe to be a vassal of the United States. We want to be your partner,” he said.
This message echoed themes the secretary of state advanced a day earlier in Munich, where he combined pointed criticism of Europe’s internal trajectory with an affirmation that the United States and Europe share a common destiny. In that speech, he warned that Europe must reverse what he described as cultural and economic decline and regain control over mass migration, while reaffirming transatlantic unity.
In Bratislava, Rubio’s tone was more transactional than doctrinal. He portrayed Central Europe as a focal point for deeper US engagement, underscoring shared interests in defense and energy cooperation.
He also played down disagreements -- including Slovak criticism of a recent US operation in Venezuela -- as inevitable among sovereign nations.
“A lot of countries didn't like what we did in Venezuela. That's OK. That was in our national interest. I'm sure there's something he'll do one day that we don't like, and we'll say, hey, we didn't like what you did. So what? That doesn't mean we're not going to be friends,” Rubio said.
Rubio’s visit to Slovakia lasted only a few hours before he departed for Budapest, where on February 16 he is scheduled to meet Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban.
The sequence of appearances -- from Munich to Bratislava to Budapest -- underscores the dual thrust of Rubio’s diplomacy: reaffirming US commitment to NATO even as Washington presses Europe to become stronger and less dependent and deepening ties with key Central European governments seen as aligned with the administration’s approach to transatlantic relations.

Hollywood groups condemn ByteDance's AI video generator, claiming copyright infringement
A new artificial intelligence video generator from Beijing-based ByteDance, the creator of TikTok, is drawing the ire of Hollywood organizations
- Bookmark
A new artificial intelligence video generator from Beijing-based ByteDance, the creator of TikTok, is drawing the ire of Hollywood organizations that say Seedance 2.0 “blatantly” violates copyright and uses the likeness of actors and others without permission.
Seedance 2.0, which is only available in China for now, lets users generate high-quality AI videos using simple text prompts. The tool quickly gained condemnation from the movie and TV industry.
The Motion Picture Association said Seedance 2.0 “has engaged in unauthorized use of U.S. copyrighted works on a massive scale.”
“By launching a service that operates without meaningful safeguards against infringement, ByteDance is disregarding well-established copyright law that protects the rights of creators and underpins millions of American jobs. ByteDance should immediately cease its infringing activity,” Charles Rivkin, chairman and CEO of the MPA, said in a statement Tuesday.
Screenwriter Rhett Rheese, who wrote the “Deadpool” movies, said on X last week that “I hate to say it. It’s likely over for us.” His post was in response to Irish director Ruairí Robinson's post of a Seedance 2.0 video that shows AI versions Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt fighting in a post-apocalyptic wasteland.
Actors union SAG-AFTRA said Friday it “stands with the studios in condemning the blatant infringement” enabled by Seedance 2.0.
“The infringement includes the unauthorized use of our members’ voices and likenesses. This is unacceptable and undercuts the ability of human talent to earn a livelihood,” SAG-AFTRA said in a statement. “Seedance 2.0 disregards law, ethics, industry standards and basic principles of consent. Responsible AI development demands responsibility, and that is nonexistent here."
ByteDance did not immediately respond to a message for comment Sunday.

Fast-spreading measles outbreak takes hold among under-10s in north London
Unknown

04:37:58 KST

A big measles outbreak in north-east London is affecting unvaccinated children under the age of 10, the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has confirmed.
UKHSA previously reported 34 laboratory-confirmed measles cases among children who attend schools and nurseries in Enfield from 1 January to 9 February, with some requiring hospital treatment.
Measles is a highly infectious viral illness that can spread very easily among people who are not fully vaccinated. While many people recover, the illness can lead to serious complications such as pneumonia, brain inflammation and, in rare cases, long-term disability or death.
Dr Vanessa Saliba, a consultant epidemiologist at the UKHSA, said: “Our latest data shows we are now seeing a big measles outbreak in north-east London, mostly affecting unvaccinated children under 10 in schools and nurseries, with some being hospitalised.
“Measles is a nasty illness for any child but for some it can lead to long-term complications and, tragically, death, but [it] is so easily preventable with two doses of the MMRV vaccine.” The MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) was replaced by the MMRV with the addition of chickenpox (varicella) to the vaccination.
Saliba urged families to ensure their children have not missed any doses. She said: “With Easter holidays fast approaching, it is a timely reminder to families travelling overseas to ensure all family members, especially children, are vaccinated, as measles is widespread in some countries with close links to the UK and there are ongoing outbreaks in parts of Europe.”
Global health officials announced earlier this year that the UK was no longer considered to have eliminated measles after reporting almost 4,000 infections since 2024.
The outbreak comes amid declining uptake of the MMRV vaccine across the UK, with only about 84% of children receiving both doses by the age of five, well below the 95% level needed to prevent outbreaks.
Enfield has one of the lowest MMRV vaccine uptake rates in the country, according to UKHSA figures from last August, which showed just 64.3% of five-year-olds in the borough received both doses in 2024-25.
The Sunday Times reported that more than 60 suspected cases of measles had been reported by seven schools and a nursery in Enfield.
A message posted on the borough’s Ordnance Unity Centre for Health GP surgery website described a “fast-spreading measles outbreak”. It said: “During this recent outbreak, one in five children have been hospitalised due to measles and all of them had not been fully immunised.”
Alev Cazimoglu, Enfield council’s cabinet member for health and social care, said: “The current outbreak has mainly affected children and some have required additional care with a short stay in hospital. Measles is one of the most infectious known diseases. It is approximately six times more infectious than Covid-19.
“Catching the measles is entirely preventable, but it spreads extremely quickly where vaccination levels are low. By checking your family’s vaccination status and taking up the free NHS vaccine, you are protecting not only yourselves but also vulnerable members of our community.”
Dudu Sher-Arami, Enfield’s director of public health, is writing to every parent in the area to try to contain the spread of the disease. Temporary vaccination centres have been established in schools across the borough in an effort to boost immunisation levels.
Sher-Arami told the Sunday Times the outbreak had the potential to cause a “much greater and bigger pan-London outbreak” as people travel across the city for work and school.
She said average vaccination figures – which are low across the city – masked significant pockets of very low uptake, which created prime areas for measles to spread.
Modelling of a large measles outbreak in London by the UKHSA suggests between 40,000 and 160,000 people could become infected. Last July a child died from measles in Liverpool after a small outbreak there.
Since the start of the year there have been 96 confirmed cases of measles in England, three-quarters affecting children under 10. Enfield has had the highest numbers, followed by Birmingham.
There is no specific treatment for measles, only the vaccination to prevent catching it.
Although the vaccination has been proven to be safe and effective, now-debunked claims that the injection was linked to autism have persisted on social media and among some minority ethnic communities, contributing to vaccine hesitancy.
Measles spreads through coughs and sneezes and by touching contaminated surfaces, making it extremely easy to pass on in schools. Early symptoms include a high fever, runny nose, sneezing, coughing and red, watery eyes. A blotchy red-brown rash usually appears a few days later, starting on the face before spreading across the body.

Trump says Board of Peace will unveil $5 billion in Gaza reconstruction pledges at inaugural meeting
US President Donald Trump said Sunday that members of his newly created Board of Peace have pledged $5 billion toward rebuilding war-ravaged Gaza and will commit thousands of personnel to international stabilization and police forces for the territory.
The pledges will be formally announced when board members gather in Washington on Thursday for their first meeting, he said.
"The Board of Peace will prove to be the most consequential International Body in History, and it is my honor to serve as its Chairman", Trump said in a social media posting announcing the pledges.
He did not detail which member nations were making the pledges for reconstruction or would contribute personnel to the stabilization force.
But Indonesia’s military said Sunday that up to 8,000 of its troops are expected to be ready by the end of June for a potential deployment to Gaza as part of a humanitarian and peace mission.
It's the first firm commitment that the Republican president has received.
Rebuilding the Palestinian territory will be a daunting endeavor. The United Nations, World Bank and European Union estimate that reconstruction of the territory will cost $70 billion.
Few places in the Gaza Strip were left unscathed by more than two years of Israeli bombardment.
The ceasefire deal calls for an armed international stabilization force to keep security and ensure the disarming of the Palestinian group Hamas, a key demand of Israel. Thus far, few countries have expressed interest in taking part in the proposed force.
The 10 October US-brokered ceasefire deal attempted to halt a more than 2-year war between Israel and Hamas. While the heaviest fighting has subsided, Israeli forces have carried out repeated airstrikes and frequently fire on Palestinians near military-held zones.
It is not clear how many of the more than 20 members of the Board of Peace will attend the first meeting.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who held White House talks with Trump last week, is not expected to be there.
Trump’s new board was first seen as a mechanism focused on ending the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.
But it has taken shape with his ambition for a far broader mandate of resolving global crises and appears to be the latest US effort to sidestep the United Nations as Trump aims to reset the post-World War II international order.
Many of America’s top allies in Europe and elsewhere have declined to join what they suspect may be an attempt to rival the Security Council.
Trump also confirmed that Thursday's meeting will take place at the US Institute of Peace, which the State Department announced in December it was remaining the Donald J. Trump U.S. Institute of Peace.
The building is the subject of litigation brought by former employees and executives of the nonprofit think tank after the Republican administration seized the facility last year and fired almost all the institute’s staff.

Epstein survivor thought she was ‘going to die’ while being assaulted on pedophile’s private jet
Juliette Bryant said she had ‘no way of getting away’ once she arrived on Epstein’s island
- Bookmark
A woman who was trafficked to Jeffrey Esptein’s private island said she thought she was going to die when he sexually abused her on a flight to the Caribbean.
Juliette Bryant, 43, said she was raped repeatedly by the pedophile financier after being recruited in Cape Town, South Africa, in 2002, when she was at university and an aspiring model.
She told Sky News that she believed her “dreams were all coming true” when she was recruited by a group of women at the age of 22, believing she would be able to “make a difference” for her family and improve their financial situation by modelling.
Juliette said she had initially been flown to New York before being told she would be travelling to the Caribbean with Epstein.
She told how the women who recruited her were waiting at Teterboro Airport in New Jersey, where she boarded the private jet and was seated next to Epstein.
She said: “As the plane took off, he started forcibly touching me in between my legs, and I just freaked out and I suddenly realised - oh my God, my family aren't going to see me again, these people might kill me’.
“I got such a fright, it was such a huge changing thing for me.
“I suddenly realised I had to be nice and be friendly, because I realised I was in great danger.”
Juliette said the women who recruited her for Epstein laughed when she was sexually assaulted on the flight.
“They saw and they just laughed,” she said. “I was really, really petrified. It really changed me, the whole thing, going through this.
“I just didn’t know what to do and I really thought that I was going to die.”
Juliette said she had “no way of getting away” once she arrived on Epstein’s private island - Little St James in the US Virgin Islands.
“They had my passport and by then we had landed on one of the Caribbean islands and then were taken on a helicopter to his island,” she said.
“There was just no way of getting away. I'm not strong enough to swim away. I wouldn't be able to swim off there."
She told Sky News she took more flights to Epstein's homes in New York, Palm Beach, Paris and New Mexico.
She said she is still reckoning with the impact of his abuse.
"I look on Facebook, I see Epstein's face. I look on X, I see Epstein's face,” she said.
“I look at the news, there it is again. You know, there are times when it's made me feel physically ill, to be honest, it is just constantly there and there is no way of escaping it."
The US Justice Department has released millions of files related to the case of Epstein, shedding further light on his expansive network of high profile figures.
The latest release – expected to be the last – contains some three million pages, including 180,000 images and some 2,000 videos attached to the case. It brings the total to 3.5m documents released.
Epstein, who pleaded guilty to soliciting prostitution from someone under the age of 18 in 2008, died in New York in 2019 ahead of a pending trial.

Ukrainian ex-minister caught at border in $100M corruption case

ALBAWABA - As part of a large investigation into corruption in Ukraine's energy sector, the country's National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU) has arrested former Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko.
Halushchenko was arrested while trying to cross the border, according to an official statement released on Sunday. Officials said that the investigation is going on quickly and in accordance with the law.
The case is about a supposed $100 million bribery scheme inside Ukraine's state nuclear energy agency. Investigators say that the operation involved high-ranking officials and businesspeople, including a former close friend of President Volodymyr Zelensky.
A Bigger Political Problem
The arrest happens during the ongoing "Midas" scandal, a political crisis that started in November and has already caused some high-level officials to quit. In the past few months, Ukraine's ministers of justice and energy have quit because they were thought to be involved in corrupt activities.
Andriy Yermak, the head of the Presidential Office and a key player in Ukraine's negotiations over the war with Russia, also quit in late November after investigators searched his home.
Recently, the investigation has grown to include members of parliament, former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko, and a former presidential adviser on a number of charges.
Secret Investigation
NABU said that the current case is the result of a 15-month undercover operation. Tymur Mindych is at the center of the accusations. He is said to be a longtime friend and former business partner of President Zelensky.
According to investigators, Mindych ran a network that moved about $100 million through a so-called "back office" in Kyiv. They say he took advantage of the situation created by Russia's ongoing war with Ukraine.
In the last part of the investigation, anti-corruption officers worked together to raid places in Kyiv and other areas, taking cash and documents.
Pressure for Change
Fighting corruption is still one of Ukraine's most important reform goals, especially since the country wants to join the European Union. To join the EU, a country must show that it is making progress in the areas of accountability, transparency, and the rule of law.

Western, Arab nations slam ‘de facto annexation’ of West Bank as Israel presses ahead

The government on Sunday approved the launch of a land registration process in the West Bank for the first time since 1967, advancing measures that have drawn international criticism, including accusations of “de facto annexation.”
The proposal was submitted by Deputy Prime Minister and Justice Minister Yariv Levin, Finance Minister and minister within the Defense Ministry Bezalel Smotrich, and Defense Minister Israel Katz.
Under the decision, large areas in the West Bank defined as state land will be formally registered in the name of the state. The Justice Ministry’s Land Registration and Settlement of Rights Authority will be authorized to carry out the process and will receive dedicated funding and staffing.
A government statement said the move would allow for “transparent and thorough clarification of property rights,” help resolve legal disputes and enable regulated infrastructure development and land marketing. It described the decision as a response to what it called unlawful land registration efforts by the Palestinian Authority in Area C, which under interim agreements remains under full Israeli control.
The measure was among several approved by the security cabinet last week ahead of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump. The decisions have prompted sharp reactions in Western capitals and across the Arab world.
The United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Jordan criticized the move. Britain condemned it, and Germany said it amounted to “de facto annexation.”
Despite the backlash, the government has continued advancing the process.
Katz described the renewal of land registration as a necessary security and governance measure. “Regulating land prevents unilateral actions, reduces illegal takeover attempts and undermines terrorist infrastructure that destabilizes security,” he said, adding that the step would provide legal and operational certainty for the military and security establishment.
Smotrich said the decision marked a continuation of efforts to strengthen settlement and control throughout the territory. “For the first time since the Six-Day War, we are restoring order and governance in land management in Judea and Samaria,” he said, using the biblical term for the West Bank. He added that regulated land settlement would reduce disputes, create legal clarity and prevent unilateral steps.
Levin called the move “a real revolution in Judea and Samaria” and said the government is committed to deepening its hold on all parts of the land.
The 1997 Hebron Protocol, signed as part of interim agreements with the Palestinians, outlined arrangements for authority and control in parts of the West Bank. Critics argue the new measures contradict the spirit of those understandings.

Ukraine’s ex-energy minister arrested while trying to cross border
German Galushchenko was detained by Ukraine’s anti-corruption bureau while trying to leave the country.
Ukraine’s National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU) says it has arrested the country’s former energy minister, German Galushchenko, who resigned in November amid a massive corruption scandal, as he tried to cross Ukraine’s border.
“Today, while crossing the state border, NABU detectives have detained the former Minister of Energy as part of the ‘Midas’ case,” the NABU said in a statement.

It did not name Galushchenko in its statement, but he served as the country’s energy minister last year and resigned in November.
“Initial investigative proceedings are ongoing, carried out in accordance with the requirements of the law and court sanctions. Details to follow,” the NABU added.
Galushchenko was one of several ministers who resigned in 2025 as the NABU unveiled an alleged money-laundering conspiracy in the country’s energy sector that investigators believe was orchestrated by an ally of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.
According to Ukraine’s Specialised Anti-Corruption Prosecutor’s Office (SAPO), the alleged $100m scheme was orchestrated by businessman Timur Mindich.
SAPO’s investigators say Galushchenko helped Mindich manage illicit financial flows in the energy sector, while contractors working with Energoatom were forced to pay bribes of 10 to 15 percent to avoid losing contracts or facing payment delays.
Ukraine’s previous two energy ministers had resigned amid the fallout from the scandal, which also claimed the job of Zelenskyy’s chief of staff.
The two ministers and the chief of staff have all denied wrongdoing.
Battling corruption is a key priority in Ukraine’s reform effort as it eyes membership in the European Union, which requires the country to shake off a decades-old scourge of graft.
Authorities in recent weeks have targeted lawmakers, former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko and a former presidential adviser over various charges.

FT: Uber Eats to launch in Finland after Foodora exit

Uber Eats will enter the Finnish market this year, according to the Financial Times. The US platform will roll out its food delivery service in Finland as part of a wider European expansion that also covers Austria, Denmark, the Czech Republic, Greece, Romania and Norway.
The Financial Times reported that Finnish consumers will gain access to the service during 2026.
The move comes only days after rival Foodora said it will withdraw from Finland.
Foodora will continue deliveries until 27 February. After that date the service will cease operations in the country. Foodora said earlier that it had struggled to compete with market leader Wolt.
In comments to the Financial Times, Susan Anderson, Uber’s head of delivery for Europe, said the company looks forward to expanding into territories with established operators.
“We think it is time to raise the bar, shake things up and offer better value across the sector,” she told the newspaper.
The Financial Times reported that the expansion forms part of Uber’s plan to generate an additional one billion dollars in gross bookings over the next three years.
The newspaper said Uber Eats has increased its market share in large European economies including Germany, France and the United Kingdom.
Anderson attributed recent gains to Uber’s ability to market its delivery service to users of its ride-hailing platform and to promote its membership scheme.
Uber has operated its ride-hailing service in parts of Finland for several years.
Uber also plans to expand automated delivery using drones and robots, Anderson told the Financial Times.

India rout bitter rivals Pakistan at T20 World Cup
India’s win against Pakistan takes the defending champions through to the next round of the T20 World Cup.
Defending champions India have thumped Pakistan by 61 runs in a grudge Group A match at the Twenty20 World Cup in Colombo, Sri Lanka, to secure their place in the Super Eight stage of the cricket tournament.
Suryakumar Yadav’s side made 175-7 after a flying start from Ishan Kishan’s superb 77, before bowling Pakistan out for 114 in 18 overs.
The defeat on Sunday extended Pakistan’s dismal record against India in World Cups.
India have now won eight of the sides’ nine meetings at T20 World Cups, as well as all eight of their encounters at ODI World Cups.
The cricket teams of the nuclear-armed, contentious neighbours only face each other in multi-nation tournaments at neutral venues under a longstanding compromise arrangement.
It has been more than 18 years since India and Pakistan last met in a Test match, and 13 years since either side crossed the border to play a bilateral series.

Gifts and soup from ‘Uncle Jeffrey’: The Epstein ties that ended the run of Goldman Sachs’ top lawyer

Gifts and soup from ‘Uncle Jeffrey’: The Epstein ties that ended the run of Goldman Sachs’ top lawyer
Goldman Sachs general counsel Kathy Ruemmler has had a storied legal career. As a federal prosecutor, she helped successfully prosecute Enron executives including Ken Lay and Jeffrey Skilling. She was part of President Barack Obama’s administration, working in various roles for much of his two terms in office, including as White House Counsel.
She was even briefly considered by President Obama as a candidate for attorney general.
Ruemmler, 54, announced that she plans to resign from the top legal post at Goldman after a trove of emails and correspondence between her and disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein showed the two individuals were especially close, years after Epstein’s 2008 conviction on sex crimes charges, when he became a registered sex offender.
Ruemmler previously played down her relationship with Epstein. She called him a “monster” and said she regretted ever knowing him. Ruemmler has repeatedly described their relationship as professional, citing her job as a private defence attorney before she ever joined Goldman Sachs.
But documents made public in recent weeks and reviewed by The Associated Press depict a deeper relationship than had previously been characterised by Ruemmler and Goldman Sachs. These included intimate email exchanges, social plans and gifts that went beyond formal legal work.
About 8400 documents involved Ruemmler or referenced her. Some correspondence shows Ruemmler was aware of the extent of the allegations that Epstein had faced involving underage girls in Florida. In some instances, she advised Epstein on how he might go about trying to repair his image and defend himself publicly against new claims of misconduct.
The gifts Epstein gave to Ruemmler have been documented in news reports: the spa treatments, the handbags from Hermes, an Apple Watch, a Fendi coat, among many others. But some of the interactions between Epstein and Ruemmler described throughout their correspondence indicate that Epstein and Ruemmler did not simply have a lawyer-client transactional relationship, as Ruemmler previously attested to.
“It makes him happy to see you happy,” Epstein’s assistant wrote to Ruemmler in 2016, after Epstein prepaid for a spa treatment for her.
In October 2018, Epstein directed one of his assistants to send flowers and chicken soup to Ruemmler because she has “not been feeling well”. It would not be the first time that Epstein would send her a small token of appreciation when she was sick. They talked about dating issues, made jokes about both the wealthy and everyday people, and shared laments about their careers and dating lives.
They would message each other about mundane things such as their mutual distaste for seeing babies in business class on flights and would repeatedly plan to have dinner or drinks in various places. Epstein even had Ruemmler as a backup executor of his will at one point.
Setting aside the immense wealth and privilege and Epstein’s legal troubles, many of the emails between the two would look no different from the banter that many Americans would share in their own text messages, emails or group chats.
“Well, I adore him. It’s like having another older brother!” she wrote in an email in 2015.
During her time in private practice after she left the White House in 2014, Ruemmler received several expensive gifts from Epstein, including luxury handbags and a fur coat. The gifts were given after Epstein had already been convicted of sex crimes in 2008 and was registered as a sex offender. Ruemmler was also involved in Epstein’s legal defence efforts after he was arrested a second time for sex crimes in 2019 and later killed himself in a Manhattan jail.
“So lovely and thoughtful! Thank you to Uncle Jeffrey!!!” Ruemmler wrote to Epstein in 2018.
She later joined Goldman Sachs in 2020 and became the investment bank’s top lawyer in 2021.
The firm’s leadership backed her publicly amid the revelations. But the embarrassing emails raised questions about Ruemmler’s judgment. Historically, Wall Street frowns on gift-giving between clients and bankers or Wall Street lawyers, particularly high-end gifts that could pose a conflict of interest. Goldman Sachs requires its employees to get pre-approval before receiving gifts from or giving them to clients, according to the company’s code of conduct, partly in order not to run afoul of anti-bribery laws.
Bloomberg News, The Wall Street Journal and other media outlets reported that Goldman’s partners, who are the firm’s most senior and well-regarded members going back to when the investment bank was privately held, had begun to question why the firm was holding Ruemmler in such high regard when other lawyers were just as qualified to hold the top legal job.
In her statement, Ruemmler said: “Since I joined Goldman Sachs six years ago, it has been my privilege to help oversee the firm’s legal, reputational and regulatory matters; to enhance our strong risk management processes; and to ensure that we live by our core value of integrity in everything we do. My responsibility is to put Goldman Sachs’ interests first.”
Goldman chief executive David Solomon said he respected Ruemmler’s decision to resign. The firm isn’t rushing Ruemmler out the door, and said in a statement that she would wind down her work at the bank “to ensure a smooth transition”, before her last day on June 30.

Cabinet OKs new West Bank land registration process, critics decry ‘de-facto annexation’

Cabinet OKs new West Bank land registration process, critics decry ‘de-facto annexation’
An initial NIS 244 million is allocated for land registration for years 2026-2030, process could take 30 years. Levin, Smotrich laud ‘deepening grip’ on West Bank
Jeremy Sharon is The Times of Israel’s legal affairs and settlements reporter
The cabinet authorized on Sunday the opening of a land registration process in the West Bank for the first time since 1967, with the ministers who initiated the measure saying it would enable the registration of broad swaths of land as state land available for Israeli development.
The resolution authorized an initial budget of NIS 244 million ($79 million) for the land registration process in the years 2026 to 2030 in Area C of the West Bank, where Israel has full military and civilian control, and the establishment of 35 positions in various ministries and state agencies to conduct the registration work.
The explanatory text of the resolution noted, however, that the registration process will be lengthy and take at least a year and a half for every plot of land, if not more, and that registering all non-registered land in Area C could take up to 30 years.
The process of establishing the registration mechanisms could itself take a year and a half, the resolution stated, but nevertheless set a goal of registering 15 percent of the unregistered land within five years.
The Palestinian presidency condemned the step, saying it constitutes “a de facto annexation of occupied Palestinian territory and a declaration of the commencement of annexation plans aimed at entrenching the occupation through illegal settlement activity.”
Jordan’s Foreign Ministry, in a statement, called on the international community to “assume its legal and moral responsibilities, and to compel Israel, the occupying power, to stop its dangerous escalation.”
Defense Minister Israel Katz, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, and Justice Minister Yariv Levin lauded the decision, saying it will create legal certainty in the territory and protect the national interest.
The cabinet decision follows a controversial decision by the security cabinet last week that expanded Israeli oversight and enforcement activities into areas A and B of the West Bank, where the Palestinian Authority has military or civilian control, and enabled private Israeli citizens to buy land in the territory, something not previously possible.
Up until 1967, only about one-third of all land in the West Bank was formally registered in land registration processes conducted during the period of the British Mandate and then under Jordanian control from 1949 to 1967.
Israel halted that process in 1968, a year after it captured the West Bank, and it has never resumed until now.
The new registration process will only take place in Area C, which constitutes some 60% of the entire territory and where, like the rest of the West Bank, some two-thirds of the land is not formally registered.
The Oslo Accords Israel and the PA signed in the 1990s placed Area C under Israeli security and administrative control, but they stated that the territory should be gradually transferred to Palestinian jurisdiction.
While stopping short of formally annexing the entire territory amid opposition from US President Donald Trump, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government has passed a slew of measures aimed at cementing Israel’s control over Area C — along with other parts of the West Bank.
The terms of the cabinet resolution initiated by the defense, finance, and justice ministers instructed the commander of the IDF’s Central Command — the de facto military governor of the West Bank — to authorize the Land Registry department in the Justice Ministry to carry out the land registration process. The Land Registry will establish a land settlement directorate to conduct the work.
Along with the initial budget of NIS 244 million for the next four years, 35 new positions will be created in the Justice Ministry, the Survey of Israel mapping agency, the Defense Ministry, and its Civil Administration department to carry out the work.
“This matter is consistent with the needs of the area, particularly in light of the passage of time and the uncertainty that has arisen with respect to some locations, while respecting local law to the extent possible,” the resolution stated.
It also said that the process came to counter a similar land registration process being conducted by the Palestinian Authority, including in Area C, which it said the PA was barred from carrying out under the terms of agreements signed with Israel.
The Peace Now and Yesh Din organizations, which campaign against the settlement movement, denounced the decision, saying it was another step in Israel’s de facto annexation of the West Bank, with the former appealing directly to US President Donald Trump to halt the move.
A source in Peace Now said that although in theory there could be a fair and objective land registration process for all parties in the West Bank, it would be very hard under current conditions and regulations for Palestinians to prove and assert their ownership claims.
The source said this shift would likely lead to the declaration of hundreds of thousands of dunams of land in the territory as state land, meaning it will be available to Israel for the development of settlements, infrastructure, and transportation.
While state land is supposed to be managed for the benefit of all civilians, Israel makes it available almost exclusively for settlers.
“The government has approved a massive land grab in the West Bank on the way to de facto annexation, in complete contradiction to the will of the people and the Israeli interest,” Peace Now said, in response to the decision.
“We are warning President Trump — Netanyahu is deceiving you. You said you would not allow annexation, but he is annexing right under your nose.”
Trump has said on several occasions, including last week, that he opposes the annexation of the West Bank by Israel, but organizations opposed to Israeli control of the territory have said that his position ignores measures taken by the current government that are de facto tightening Israeli control over the West Bank.
The cabinet ministers who initiated the new land registry process extolled the cabinet decision.
“The resolution constitutes a real revolution in Judea and Samaria,” said Justice Minister Levin, using the biblical term for the West Bank. “The Land of Israel belongs to the people of Israel. The Israeli government is committed to deepening its grip on all parts [of the land], and this decision is an expression of that commitment.”
Smotrich, the finance minister, said the measure was “continuing the revolution of settlement and the grip on all parts of our country,” and claimed the new land registration process would “prevent conflict, create legal certainty… and enable legal and responsible development” in the West Bank.

Poland should develop its own nuclear defences amid growing threat from Russia, says president
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
WARSAW - Poland should look at developing its own nuclear weapons in light of the growing threat from Russia
“I am a big supporter of Poland joining a nuclear project,” Mr Nawrocki said in the interview, adding that he cannot say if or when Poland will start work aimed towards having its own nuclear weapons.
“We are a country right on the border of an armed conflict, and we know what the attitude of the aggressive, imperial Russian Federation toward Poland is,” Mr Nawrocki added.
Mr Nawrocki’s comments come after German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said at the Munich Security Conference that he’s in talks with France over potential European nuclear defence. Mr Merz made a call to reorder the transatlantic relationship amid the turmoil of US President Donald Trump’s second term.
Mr Nawrocki said in the Polsat News interview that Poland should follow the path toward developing its own nuclear potential, with respect for all international regulations.
When asked if the US would allow Poland to take this direction, as Warsaw is a signatory of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, Mr Nawrocki said “I don’t know this, but we need to act in a direction so that we can start the work.”
Warsaw signed a treaty with France in 2025, which Prime Minister Donald Tusk said will open the way toward Poland potentially sharing protection from French nuclear missiles.
In September, more than 20 drones crossed Poland’s territory during a Russian airstrike on neighbouring Ukraine
Mr Nawrocki said it is too early for him to say if he would sign into law a draft that would streamline the SAFE funds in Poland. BLOOMBERG

How many feet are in 500 miles? Nobody knows, at least Nate Bargatze doesn't at the Daytona 500
Comedian Nate Bargatze served as the grand marshal for the Daytona 500
- Bookmark
Nate Bargatze considered squeezing a big, dumb joke into his command for drivers to start their engines at the Daytona 500.
“At first, I thought about doing like, how many feet are in 500 miles,” Bargatze said. “Nobody knows.”
Bargatze laughed when he said the proposed joke, which is a riff on his popular “Washington’s Dream” sketches on “Saturday Night Live," fell flat when he tested it Saturday night during a gig in Indianapolis.
“I was going to do another one with Jimmie Johnson being older to let the younger drivers know that his left blinker will be on the whole race,” Bargatze said. “Then when I got here and talked about it, it’s like, I think you just need to do, normal? You have all these hopes and dreams to do something funny.”
Bargatze kept it straight in his role as grand marshal for Sunday’s Daytona 500.
“It's going to be insanity,” Bargatze said. “It's been a dream to be asked to do this.”
Bargatze's day at Daytona — where he mingled with drivers such as Denny Hamlin — is just the latest dream job for one of the most popular stand-ups currently working. He hosted the Emmy Awards, released three Netflix specials and just won a Best Comedy Album Grammy Award for “Your Friend, Nate Bargatze."
His “Big Dumb Eyes World Tour” set a record for biggest one-year gross by a comedy performer in history and has set more than 40 arena attendance records.
They served as warm-up acts for his first starring role in a movie, “The Breadwinner.” Bargatze co-wrote the script for the film he said was influenced by his stand-up and old-school funny, family movies such as “Mr. Mom” and “Home Alone.”
“You want it to be broad, the whole family can come,” Bargatze said. “It's like what I do with stand-up, you kind of just want everybody to come.”
Mandy Moore plays Bargatze's wife in the comedy, which also includes Colin Jost and Will Forte and opens May 29.
“Obviously overwhelming,” Bargatze said. “I don’t know how to act. Learning that on the fly was a good time.”
The 46-year-old Bargatze resumes his stand-up tour this week in Rockford, Illinois, and he's set to host the ABC game show, “The Greatest Average American.”
The title seemed fitting when Bargatze was gifted one of only 500 specialty Daytona 500 hats. The hat was numbered 302. Average.
“It's not bragging,” Bargatze said. “I'm right in the middle. That's where the average American would be. It's humility. It's how you go.”

UK’s top prosecutor says ‘nobody above law’ as detectives investigate Andrew’s Epstein links
Unknown

04:24:24 KST

The UK’s top prosecutor has said “nobody is above the law” amid growing pressure on police to fully investigate Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor’s links with Jeffrey Epstein.
Thames Valley police said earlier this week they were in discussion with the Crown Prosecution Service over allegations of misconduct in public office against the former prince.
Stephen Parkinson, the director of public prosecutions, told the Sunday Times: “It’s my job to enforce the law and I do so without fear or favour, and that is unaffected by the status of the individual concerned.”
Parkinson said he had “total confidence” that detectives would examine any relevant evidence that might point to criminality. “From my perspective, I don’t find it a difficult offence to prosecute because the core of it is a gross breach of trust by someone performing the function of a public officer,” he said.
Mountbatten-Windsor’s conduct while UK trade envoy between 2001 and 2011 has come under scrutiny after emails released in the Epstein files suggested he shared confidential information with the convicted sex offender.
Emails have shown how David Stern, a business associate and friend of Mountbatten-Windsor, was in regular contact with Epstein and accompanied the former prince on his publicly funded visits to Beijing, Hong Kong and Shenzhen in the autumn of 2010.
It has been revealed that Stern would organise meetings for Mountbatten-Windsor based on Epstein’s suggestions.
This taxpayer-funded trip occurred just a few months before Mountbatten-Windsor met Epstein in New York in December 2010, which the disgraced royal previously claimed marked the end of their relationship.
Now evidence compiled by the Mail on Sunday has revealed how Mountbatten-Windsor used his government role to further Epstein’s business interests.
He reportedly leaked sensitive information about the Royal Bank of Scotland after it was bailed out by the government, and a senior palace aide is said to have leaked an official diplomatic cable about UK-China trade relations to a banker who was the former prince’s friend and business associate.
Another email shows how Epstein arranged for Mountbatten-Windsor to have dinner at a five-star hotel in Beijing with Jes Staley, a senior banker who was later exposed as the disgraced financier’s personal banker.
The newspaper also reported that Stern plotted with Epstein to do “discreet” deals with the Chinese government after Mountbatten-Windsor’s 2010 trade mission.
Epstein boasted about getting intelligence from Mountbatten-Windsor and Peter Mandelson, saying in an email: “I’ve got the UK sewn up.”
New photos show the former prince socialising with a Chinese model at a dinner in Beijing during the official trip where he was supposed to be representing the UK as trade envoy.
According to the Epstein files, Stern advised Epstein to illegally hide his child sexual abuse conviction to obtain a visa to China after the disgraced financier’s initial application was rejected.
The former prime minister Gordon Brown has called for a full police investigation. “In the past week, I have delved deep into the Epstein files to discover the extent of Mandelson and Epstein’s betrayal of Britain during the global financial crisis,” he wrote in the New Statesman.
“What I discovered about the abuse of women by male predators and their enablers – and Britain’s as yet unacknowledged role – has shocked me to the core. It demands an in-depth police investigation, and is by far the biggest scandal of all.”
Vince Cable, the former Liberal Democrat leader, has also said the police should check whether criminal corruption took place while Mountbatten-Windsor was trade envoy. Cable, who was business secretary for some of that period, said the former prince’s alleged behaviour was “totally unacceptable”.
“We need a police or DPP [director of public prosecutions] check on whether criminal corruption took place and a government investigation into how this was allowed to happen,” he said.
Thames Valley police previously said they were reviewing allegations that Epstein provided Mountbatten-Windsor with a woman to have sex with at Royal Lodge in 2010, as well as the allegations of misconduct in public office.
Mountbatten-Windsor, who served as the UK’s special representative for trade and investment between 2001 and 2011, has always denied any wrongdoing.

Starmer facing calls for inquiry over Labour think tank’s investigation into journalists
Labour Together, which helped the prime minister’s election to become party leader, reportedly paid £36,000 for the probe
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
Sir Keir Starmer is facing calls to order an inquiry into a Labour think tank’s investigation into journalists as he struggles to move on from the woes facing his premiership.
Foreign Office minister Stephen Doughty said it would be “only right” to have an probe into Labour Together, which helped Sir Keir win the Labour leadership.
The calls heap pressure on government minister Josh Simons, who commissioned the 2023 report on reporters investigating the group’s funding.
The Sunday Times reported that the contents of an investigation by PR consultancy Apco were informally shared with Labour figures in 2024, including current cabinet ministers and special advisers.
The paper said it contained pages of “deeply personal and false claims” about one of the journalists Gabriel Pogrund. It also discussed his Jewish background and included false claims about personal and professional relationships. It was also reported to have made “baseless claims” that the emails underpinning the journalists’ story were likely to have come from a hack of the Electoral Commission, suspected to have been carried out by the Kremlin .
Mr Simons was an ally of Morgan McSweeney, who previously ran Labour Together and who resigned from No 10 last week as the Mandelson scandal engulfed Downing Street. Mr Simons told the paper he said he had asked for information to be removed before passing the report to the intelligence agency GCHQ. No other British journalists were investigated as part of any document he or Labour Together ever received, he also said.
John McDonnell, Labour’s former chancellor, has called for an independent inquiry into the affair.
He said it was clear to him as ”secretary of the NUJ’s parliamentary group if true this is unacceptable”.
Another Labour MP, Karl Turner, called on the prime minister himself to look at the issue and said he should meet Mr McDonnell “to discuss” it.
Nadhim Zahawi, the former Conservative chancellor who has since defected to Nigel Farage’s Reform UK, led demands for Sir Keir to reveal what he knew of the investigation.
He said: “This is a huge story. If this was any other party, the calls for an investigation would be deafening..”
Mr Doughty told Times Radio: “It's only right that if there is an investigation, that's able to run its course, and that we understand what happened. I want to see a country where journalists are able to do their job without fear or favour.”

No clear path to ending the partial government shutdown as lawmakers dig in over DHS oversight

No clear path to ending the partial government shutdown as lawmakers dig in over DHS oversight
No clear path to ending the partial government shutdown as lawmakers dig in over DHS oversight
WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) — Lawmakers and the White House offered no signs of compromise Sunday in their battle over oversight of federal immigration officers that has led to a pause in funding for the Department of Homeland Security.
A partial government shutdown began Saturday after congressional Democrats and President Donald Trump’s team failed to reach a deal on legislation to fund the department through September. Democrats are demanding changes to how immigration operations are conducted after the fatal shootings of U.S. citizens Alex Pretti and Renee Good by federal officers in Minneapolis last month.
Congress is on recess until Feb. 23, and both sides appear dug into their positions. The impasse affects agencies such as the Transportation Security Administration, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, U.S. Coast Guard, the Secret Service, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and U.S. Customs and Border Protection.
The work at ICE and CBP goes on unabated because Trump’s tax and spending cut law from 2025 provided billions more to those agencies that can be tapped for deportation operations. About 90% of DHS employees were to continue working during the shutdown, but do so without pay — and missed paychecks could mean financial hardships. Last year there was a record 43-day government shutdown.
White House border czar Tom Homan said the administration was unwilling to agree to Democrats’ demands that federal officers clearly identify themselves, remove masks during operations and display unique ID numbers.
“I don’t like the masks, either,” Homan said, But, he said, “These men and women have to protect themselves.”
Democrats also want to require immigration agents to wear body cameras and mandate judicial warrants for arrests on private property.
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Democrats are only asking for federal agents to abide by rules followed by law enforcement agencies around the country.
“And the question that Americans are asking is, ‘Why aren’t Republicans going along with these commonsense proposals?’” Schumer said. “They’re not crazy. They’re not way out. They’re what every police department in America does.”
Sen. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla., said he could back Democrats calls to equip immigration officers with body cameras and would support efforts to bolster training. But he balked at their demands that federal officers remove masks and clearly identify themselves, noting some officers taking part in immigration enforcement operations have faced doxing and other harassment.
“What are you going to do, expose their faces so you can intimidate their families?” Mullins said. “What we want is ICE to be able to do their job. And we would love for local law enforcement and for states to cooperate with us.”
Republican Sen. Katie Britt of Alabama, a Trump ally who had pushed for a two-week extension of DHS funding while negotiations continued, said it was “shortsighted of Democrats to walk away” from talks.
Trump made enforcement of the nation’s immigration laws a centerpiece of his 2024 campaign for the White House and he promised to be aggressive in detaining and deporting people living in the United States without legal permission.
DHS reports it has deported more than 675,000 migrants since Trump’s return to office last year and claims some 2.2 million others have “self-deported” as the Republican president has made his immigration crackdown a priority.
“President Trump is not going to back away from the mission, the mission that American people said they wanted him to complete, and that is securing our border and making sure that we actually do interior enforcement,” Britt said.
Homan was on CBS’ “Face the Nation,” Schumer and Mullin appeared on CNN’s “State of the Union” and Britt was interviewed on “Fox News Sunday.”

'The Jewish Journey Through Loss': Combining halacha and psychology in order to heal - review
Unknown
Unknown Publisher
2026-02-15
19:21:18 UTC
04:21:18 KST

There are books that explain the halachot of mourning. There are books that explain the psychology of grief. Until now, these have been two separate shelves.
Dr. Batya Ludman and Gina Junger noticed that gap years ago and set out to bridge it. Their new book, The Jewish Journey Through Loss, published by Maggid Books under Koren Publishers Jerusalem, brings together what has too long been kept apart: the wisdom of Torah and the insights of psychology, working side by side to help mourners heal.
Ludman is a clinical psychologist who has practiced in Israel for decades. She grew up watching her parents serve on the chevra kadisha, and later joined it herself. Junger is a Jewish educator whose students, young and old, continue to shape her teaching. The two became chavrutot on the subject of death and grief, and their husbands marveled at how they could talk about it for hours. “With my psychological background and her perfect blend of Jewish understanding,” Ludman writes in the acknowledgments, “we seemed to complete each other’s ideas as well as sentences and make the sum of one and one so much greater than two.”
That partnership shows on every page. The book walks through the stages of mourning from illness through death, shiva, shloshim, the first year, and beyond. But it does not read like a Halacha guide or a psychology textbook. It reads like a long conversation between two people who have thought deeply about loss and want to share what they have learned.
Judaism's therapeutic approach to mourning
The central insight of the book is that the structure of Jewish mourning is itself therapeutic. “One of the most beautiful aspects of Judaism’s approach to death is its focus on ritual,” the authors write. “This prescribed structure, filled with incredible wisdom, lovingly embraces the mourner, moving you forward, step by step, through your pain.” Shiva keeps the mourner home and surrounded by community during the first shock of loss. Shloshim begins to ease them back into the world. The year of aveilus allows grief to settle gradually. This is not news to anyone who has sat shiva, but the authors make the connection explicit: The Halacha moves at the pace a person can absorb. It is not arbitrary. It is wise.
What sets this book apart is its attention to what mourners actually feel. The authors describe the guilt that surfaces unexpectedly, the exhaustion of telling the same story to every visitor, the moment months later when a smell or a song brings grief rushing back. They write about the disorientation of the first days, when everything you know has been turned upside down, and the Halacha gives you something to hold onto. They write about the strange relief some mourners feel, and the guilt that follows the relief. They write about anger at Hashem, and about the silence that sometimes says more than words.
The book is filled with vignettes drawn from the authors’ own lives and from the families they have worked with. A teenager who walks out of the room rather than hear the news about his mother. A young woman who never knows how to answer when someone asks how many siblings she has, because she lost a brother. A mourner who describes grief as a closet you learn to open and close, and over time, it becomes a little easier. These are not case studies. They are moments of recognition. Reading them, you think: ”Yes, that is what it is like.”
There are chapters on different kinds of loss. Losing a parent. Losing a spouse. Losing a child. Losing a sibling. Each one carries its own weight. The authors quote a teaching that with the death of a spouse, you lose your present; with the death of a parent; you lose your past; and with the death of a child, you lose your future. They do not rush past these distinctions. They sit with them.
There are also chapters on harder topics. Suicide. What to tell children. The isolation of mourning during COVID, when shiva happened on Zoom and the community could not walk through the door. And there is a chapter on grief after terrorism, written before Oct. 7 and then revised after the war began. One of the dedication pages memorializes David Schwartz, killed in battle on 27 Tevet 5784 defending Am Yisrael. The authors live in Israel and have watched their community absorb loss after loss. “Then along came COVID-19,” Ludman writes, “followed by the multiple losses experienced during and after a horrific war, and we suddenly had infinitely more we needed to say.”
That sentence captures something important about the book. It was not written from a distance. It was written from inside the experience, by two women who have accompanied mourners through the hardest days of their lives and who have faced loss themselves. Ludman thanks her patients “who allowed me to accompany them on their journey in both life and death, through loss and through healing.” Junger prays that the book will be “a tool for people to find comfort in their grief.” You can feel that intention throughout.
The tone of the book is warm and honest. The authors do not pretend to have all the answers. “We ask for your forgiveness,” they write, “if we don’t always anticipate correctly just how you may be feeling.” They know that grief is not predictable, that what helps one person may not help another, that feelings change quickly and without warning. They are not trying to fix anyone. They are trying to walk alongside.
For those who make shiva calls, the book offers practical wisdom. It explains why the Halacha tells us to wait for the mourner to speak first, and why presence often matters more than words. It describes what mourners wish visitors understood, and what well-meaning people sometimes get wrong. Reading those sections, I thought of visits I have made and wondered if I had helped or just added to the exhaustion.
For those who are grieving, the book offers something harder to name. Companionship, maybe. The sense that someone understands what you are going through, even the parts you have not said out loud. “While we are unable to take away your pain,” the authors write, “we sincerely hope that through this book we will ‘walk’ alongside you as you take your journey forward into the land of healing.”
The book also speaks to those who have not yet experienced major loss but want to be prepared. Ludman and Junger compare it to expecting a baby. You read books, you talk to friends, you think you know what to expect, but when it happens you discover how much you did not anticipate. Grief is similar. No one is fully ready. But some preparation helps.
One line near the end of the book stayed with me. “We don’t have a choice over the package that we each are given in life,” the authors write, “but we do have a choice as to what we do with that package.” That is the question the book keeps circling back to. Loss is not optional. But how we carry it, how we make meaning from it, how we let it shape us or not, those are choices. The Halacha provides a framework. The rest is up to us.
I finished the book thinking about the two women who wrote it. A psychologist and an educator. A chavruta that became a partnership. Two voices woven together so closely that you cannot always tell where one ends and the other begins. They set out to bridge the gap between the psychological and the halachic, and they succeeded. The result is a book that feels both deeply Jewish and deeply human.
It is not a book you want to need. But when you need it, you will be grateful it exists.

Trump told Netanyahu he would support Israeli strikes on Iran's missile program, CBS reports

United States President Donald Trump told Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during their meeting in Florida in December that he would support Israeli strikes on Iran's ballistic missile program if the US and Iran could not reach a deal, CBS News reported on Sunday, citing two sources familiar with the matter.
According to the report, renewed internal discussions among US military and intelligence officials are focused on how the US would help Israeli forces in the case Israel conducted a new round of strikes against the Iranian regime.
Examples of US assistance could include providing the IDF with aerial refueling or securing airspace permissions from countries along the potential route aircraft would take to strike, CBS cited two additional US officials as saying.
Thus far, Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, and Saudi Arabia have explicitly stated that they would not permit the use of their airspace for strikes.
US moving military assets close to Iran
The internal talks come as the US is actively moving military assets to the region.
The USS Gerald R. Ford, a US aircraft carrier, and its accompanying fleet of warships are being redeployed from the Caribbean to the Middle East, four US officials confirmed to CBS, in a move that “would place formidable firepower within range of Iran.”
Further US-Iran negotiations on a possible deal are set to take place in Geneva on Tuesday.

Gov't approves new international airport in Israel's South, amid Ben-Gurion congestion concerns

The government approved the establishment of a new international airport in southern Israel on Sunday, designating the Ziklag area in the Negev as its location.
This new airport in the South will be developed alongside an additional international airport in northern Ramat David. The government cited the main factor behind the development of the two new airports as growing congestion at Ben-Gurion Airport. It also said that the new airports would encourage economic growth in the country’s peripheral areas.
The government’s decision calls for accelerating planning of the airport in the South to match the pace of the progressing airport in the North, so the two can be developed simultaneously.
According to the proposal, the existing Ben-Gurion Airport in central Israel is approaching its maximum capacity of approximately 40 million passengers per year.
Without additional international civilian airports, the government said, Israel faces a serious risk of an aviation crisis. This would lead to a shortage of available flights relative to demand and potential pressure to increase ticket prices.
The government underscored the importance of advancing both the northern and southern airports in parallel. It added that the development of both air hubs would enable balanced economic growth across the North and South, creating numerous jobs in those areas.
Strategic importance
Further, the government noted the airports’ strategic importance in emergency scenarios, citing lessons learned during the war and Operation Rising Lion against Iran in June.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the move was part of a broader national vision.
“This is part of our vision, a real vision for developing and settling the Negev and eliminating the periphery,” Netanyahu remarked at the government meeting.
“I have always said, ‘Government infrastructure combined with private initiative.’ This is the classic connection in the case of this enormous anchor project.”
“Only in this way will we be able to provide a real response to the growing demand from tourists and the air traffic of many millions who arrive in Israel each year, and many more who will arrive, as well as Israeli citizens who travel abroad,” he added.
Transportation Minister Miri Regev (Likud) said Israel must already prepare for the heavy congestion expected at Ben-Gurion Airport until the additional airports are operational.
“Establishing two complementary international airports is an urgent national, economic, and security necessity,” she said.
Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich (Religious Zionist Party) echoed Regev’s remarks, adding that the state would allocate the necessary resources to execute both projects in the South and the North.
Ahead of Sunday’s decision, protesters demonstrated in northern Israel against the advancement of the airport in Ramat David. Demonstrators expressed concern that the plan could ultimately result in the construction of an international airport in the northern Jezreel Valley.
They argued such a move would severely harm vital agricultural land, Israel’s food security, the environment, agriculture, and public health. Protest leaders instead called on the government to develop the airport only in southern Israel.
The government’s decision on Sunday finalized the southern airport’s location in the Ziklag area rather than Nevatim, which had initially been considered.
Although the Ziklag site had previously been considered, it was originally rejected due to its proximity to Gaza-area flight paths frequently used by the Israel Air Force. Officials had raised concerns about its closeness to the Gaza border and potential security risks.
However, the defense establishment ultimately concluded that the risk was not substantial enough to halt the project.
Aviation industry sources have reported that the site could still pose logistical challenges, including potential strain on Israel’s air traffic control networks.

4 key insights from Munich Security Conference

04:21:00 KST

The United States strikes a reassuring tone; Europeans pledge stronger defenses while the Ukraine war grinds on and China makes bold promises.
At the Munich Security Conference, which wound up pm Sunday, AFP spoke to Rachel Ellehuus, director general of British defence think-tank the Royal United Services Institute, about her key takeaways.
A year after U.S. Vice President JD Vance stunned the MSC by attacking Europeans on democracy and civil rights, Donald Trump sent more moderate members, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Under Secretary of Defense for Policy Elbridge Colby.
"There was a deliberate attempt this year to send so-called grown-ups," Ellehuus said.
Both "signalled that they see Europe as a partner, that the U.S. believes that NATO is good for the U.S. and they want to make this partnership work", she said.
She said Colby delivered a "very direct" message: "The United States has many responsibilities, the Europeans are quite wealthy, and it is time for Europe to take the lead in conventional defence operations within NATO."
Nevertheless, trust has been lost and Nordic leaders worry about Trump's designs on Denmark's autonomous territory of Greenland and fear "there could be other surprises".
She also expressed worry about Colby's use of the term "flexible realism" and whether this means Washington will differentiate between "good NATO members" who have stepped up defence spending, like Germany and Norway, and those who have done less.
"I do worry that they're going to distinguish between allies and decide that some are more worth defending than others. And of course that undermines the entire principle of NATO."
"Another cause for concern," she said, was that Rubio "talked a lot about Christian values and the civilisational ties". She said this points to the "alignment among the far right" on both sides of the Atlantic.
German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, in his opening speech, delivered "a very strong push for a more European NATO".
British Prime Minister Keir Starmer meanwhile expressed "a desire for a closer relationship with continental Europe and the European Union", she said, adding this "was quite bold because politically that's a bit risky for him in the in the UK".
And French President Emmanuel Macron talked about a European defence beyond the EU which would be "much more inclusive of countries like Norway, Turkey and the United Kingdom".
"I thought all of those were good steps for the big European countries, becoming more aligned in terms of how they would step up in creating a more robust European defence."
Ellehuus nonetheless stressed that Europe faces many obstacles, from fiscal problems in France and the UK to delays and hurdles in European defence cooperation.
Most European leaders at the MSC do not believe a ceasefire will come any time soon in the Ukraine war started by Russia's 2022 full-scale invasion.
"The overarching sense was that Russia is not serious about ending the war, and the current negotiations are just an attempt by Russia to buy time to keep fighting," Ellehuus said about US-led talks.
At the MSC, "there were a lot of people in there who tried to undermine this narrative that the Russians are winning," she said.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky "called on the world to exert maximum pressure on Russia, for example more targeted sanctions to decrease the price of oil".
She pointed to large Russian losses for minimal territorial gains and said: "When you look at the economic indicators, some of the pressures on their society, they're not exactly winning."
China seeks seat 'being vacated by US'
As Trump vows to place "America first", China is "more than happy to move into the seat that is being vacated by the United States," she said.
Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi spoke of strengthening ties with Germany and rebooting relations with Canada. Despite being a close ally of Moscow, he said Beijing was willing to send "new humanitarian aid" to war-torn Ukraine.
Ellehuus said China "did a very nice job of presenting themselves as the guardians of multilateralism, as the protector of small and medium sized countries, as the guardians of the rules-based order".
She added that "nobody believes that, but they presented a very kind and gentle face, that could be tempting to some countries if they're upset with the United States".
Ellehuus said Europeans "are aware of the risk, but they are tempted by the economic benefits that could come from a closer economic and trade relationship with China, and they probably think that they can manage the downside".

No major progress on Gaza Phase II expected before late February, officials say

There are increasing signs from both Israeli and foreign officials that there will be no major progress toward US President Donald Trump’s Gaza ceasefire Phase II before late February at the earliest.
Recently, top IDF sources predicted it would take months, even in a best-case scenario, before the Palestinian technocratic committee announced by the Trump administration as a key part of Phase II in January would actually start to have a concrete impact on Gazans’ lives.
Then on Friday, Board of Peace Executive Committee leader Nickolay Mladenov said in Munich that there was no basis for his oversight committee or the Palestinian technocratic committee to take any actions in Gaza until the nearly daily disruptions of the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas stop.
Mladenov added that if they tried to start improving the situation in Gaza while fighting was still occurring, it would only embarrass them and render their efforts ineffective.
Hamas insists on associates holding power
Since January, there have been no announcements or reports of the committees taking over, even any civilian functions in Gaza, which Hamas has at least sometimes said publicly it is willing to pass on to them.
Rather, the only reports have been about disputes between the committee and Hamas about who will manage rebuilding efforts in Gaza on behalf of the committee, with Hamas insisting on their associates holding such power, even if the Hamas high command moves into the background on political issues.
In addition, Mladenov said the various civilian committees need the International Stabilization Force (ISF) and a new Palestinian police force – one not associated with Hamas – in place.
The earliest that the first piece of the ISF, some 5,000 Indonesian peacekeepers, is expected to arrive in Gaza is still weeks away.
Other than Mladenov, no Israeli or American officials have even been actively discussing the Palestinian police force, such that it is very unclear when and if it will deploy.
Mladenov also said that significantly more funding must come forward for rebuilding Gaza, something that it seems will only start as of the meeting in the US on Thursday.
Collectively, Mladenov’s statements seemed to confirm what IDF sources previously told The Jerusalem Post and others regarding the expected slow pace of any major impacts from Phase II in Gaza.
To date, the only concrete progress on the ground from Phase II has been the opening of the Rafah crossing.
However, even that opening has been much more limited than expected in terms of how many Palestinians are allowed in and out of Gaza, and no vehicles have been allowed through the crossing to date.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has made it no secret that he prefers to return to a major operation in Gaza instead of empowering the Palestinian technocratic committee, a Palestinian police force, and ultimately the PA.
Yet, US envoys Jared Kushner and Steve Witkoff heavily prefer to proceed with Phase II and to avoid a return to major hostilities.

'The Iranians are lying': Netanyahu says he's 'skeptical' about future US deal with Tehran
Unknown

04:20:47 KST

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he was "very skeptical" about any future deal with Iran and that he raised concerns with US President Donald Trump that "the Iranians are lying."
Speaking at the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations’ 51st Annual National Leadership Mission in Jerusalem on Sunday, Netanyahu said he just returned from the US, where he held "a very important meeting" with Trump focused on Iran.
The conference, which began on Sunday, is set to run through Thursday.
According to Netanyahu, Trump believes as though "Tehran feels like it missed a chance to reach a deal last time and wants to reach one this time." He stressed, however, that he had his doubts.
"Iran is reliable on one thing, that they lie and they cheat."
'For the security of Israel and the world'
Netanyahu went on to lay out what he considered essential components in any future deal with Tehran.
"If a deal is reached, it should have several components that we believe are important not only for the security of Israel but for the security of the US, the region, and the world," the prime minister said.
First, according to Netanyahu, a potential deal must ensure the removal of all enriched uranium from Iran’s territory, not merely stopping enrichment.
Second, all uranium enrichment equipment and infrastructure will have to be dismantled and removed from Iran, to ensure the country has no enrichment capability.
Third, the deal will have to limit Iran’s ballistic missiles to a range of 300 kilometers to ensure they cannot reach Israel or valuable assets in the region.
Finally, the deal will have to include disbanding the axis of terror, Iran’s proxy network in the Middle East, including Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Houthis in Yemen, and Hamas in Gaza.
Netanyahu: We're giving Trump's plan a chance
Speaking on Gaza, Netanyahu said Israel will try to implement Trump's peace plan in Gaza, despite voicing concerns.
"We're giving Trump's plan a chance," Netanyahu told the American Jewish leaders.
On the issue of disarming Hamas, which has faced numerous delays and difficulties, Netanyahu stressed it was non-negotiable.
"We have to complete the job," he said, adding that Israel has so far dismantled approximately 150 kilometers of the 500-kilometer network of Hamas tunnels in Gaza.
"Gaza will not pose a threat ever again," Netanyahu stated.
Trump’s peace plan states that “all military operations, including aerial and artillery bombardment, will be suspended, and battle lines will remain frozen.”
Addressing US aid, the prime minister said Israel is looking to shift the relationship "from aid to partnership."

Indonesia to begin deploying Gaza peacekeeping force in April - report

Indonesia’s contribution to the International Stabilization Force (ISF), which will handle aspects of peacekeeping in Gaza during the Trump administration’s Phase II of the ceasefire, will start deploying in April, and likely primarily deploy in June, AP reported on Sunday.
The same report set the number of soldiers in April at 1,000 and the full June force at around 8,000, which is higher than some prior numbers that the media has speculated about.
According to the report, aspects of the process for selecting and clearing soldiers to join the force are underway.
However, Indonesia also said that if conditions in Gaza were not ripe for deployment regarding any conflict with Hamas, the force might not ultimately travel to Gaza even if it was ready.
Already on February 9, Channel 11 had confirmed that Indonesia would be the first segment of the ISF in Gaza, though at the time the report had suggested the soldiers might arrive within weeks.
In prior months, Indonesia had been mentioned as a possible contributing country to the ISF along with the UAE, Egypt, Italy, Azerbaijan, Pakistan, Qatar, Turkey, and others, but until now, not a single country had moved from general promises to a concrete readiness to send troops.
Indonesian President Subianto to visit Washington
Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto will be visiting Washington for Trump’s Board of Peace summit on February 19.
Neither the ISF in general, nor Indonesia in particular, is expected to seek direct confrontation with Hamas or to proactively disarm them.
Rather, they are expected to supervise current ceasefire lines and possibly handle other border-related issues.
For example, Indonesian soldiers are expected to supervise some of the defense lines in the Khan Yunis and Rafah areas of southern Gaza.
The coming months will still require resolving complex issues, such as the rules of engagement, should Hamas make contact with the Indonesian chapter of the ISF.
Moreover, there are questions about which countries will follow Indonesia’s example, and when.
Finally, if Hamas has not started a serious disarmament process by early May – around the Trump administration’s 100-day deadline – it is unclear whether the ISF would continue or whether Israel might return to major ground operations in Gaza.

American, as well as Israeli officials, see little chance of deal between US and Iran

Just days before Tuesday’s meeting in Geneva between United States President Donald Trump’s envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner and Iran’s foreign minister, officials in both the US and Israel assess that the chances of a deal between Iran and the US are slim.
The Iranian foreign minister, leading a delegation of representatives from political, legal, technical, and economic fields, is expected to meet with International Atomic Energy Agency chief Rafael Grossi on Monday, who would oversee any nuclear agreement to ensure compliance.
Iran’s Deputy Foreign Minister Majid Takht-Ravanchi said in an interview with the BBC that Iran is willing to consider concessions to reach a nuclear deal with the United States if Washington shows readiness to discuss lifting sanctions.
“The ball is in the American court to prove they want an agreement, and if they are sincere, I’m sure we’ll be on the path to one.” Takht-Ravanchi clarified that reducing uranium enrichment to zero is not on the table for Iran. “It is not part of the negotiations,” he said.
Netanyahu addresses Trump meeting
Speaking at the Conference of Presidents (COP) on Sunday, Netanyahu discussed his recent trip to Washington to meet Trump and said their discussions focused mainly on Iran. “The president is determined to exhaust diplomatic options and believes Iran understands it missed an opportunity last time, and there is a high chance they won’t miss it this time,” the prime minister said, adding that he expressed skepticism about any deal with Iran.
“Even if a deal can be reached, it must include components that safeguard the security of Israel, the United States, and the world,” he said.
Netanyahu outlined what he believes the US should demand of Iran: “First, all nuclear enrichment must be prevented; all equipment and materials for developing nuclear weapons must be destroyed, along with all ballistic missiles. Iran must cease all support for terrorist activities. There must be effective and genuine oversight to ensure compliance.”
After returning from his meeting with Trump, Netanyahu held a series of discussions with security chiefs and a small group of ministers on regional issues.
Iran’s army chief of staff, General Abdolrahim Mousavi, said on Sunday that Trump must understand that any battle against Iran would teach him a historic lesson. “Any conflict with Iran will prevent Trump from imposing global hegemony once and for all. If Trump wants war, I wonder why he is talking about negotiations?”

Stephen A Smith reveals reason for Molly Qerim’s First Take departure
Qerim announced her departure in September

ESPN analyst Stephen A. Smith has revealed the reasons behind his former co-host Molly Qerim’s exit from the network.
Qerim, 41, announced her departure from the ESPN show in September after serving as host for 10 years. She officially stepped away at the end of 2025 and has since been replaced by Shae Cornette.
Her co-host Smith has now opened up about the circumstances surrounding her departure. In a recent episode of The White House With Michael Irvin podcast, Smith, 58, called her exit “incredibly unfortunate.”
“Molly decided that she wanted to leave, and she had some issues that I’m not going to discuss,” Smith said. “It wasn’t with me, but she had some issues that was foremost on her mind and she made the decision to abruptly resign.
“I can tell you that Molly and I worked together for 10 years — I loved Molly. I didn’t want her to leave. Listen, I think Shae Cornette is doing an outstanding job for us. She knows her sports backwards and forwards. She is the real deal. But on a personal level, I definitely miss Molly, as do a lot of us, because we’re friends, and she was great.”
In announcing her departure, Qerim wrote: “After much reflection, I’ve decided it’s time to close this incredible chapter and step away from First Take. Hosting this show has been one of the greatest honors of my career. Every morning, I had the privilege of sharing the desk with some of the most brilliant, passionate, and entertaining voices in sports — and with all of you, the best fans in the world.”
She expressed her gratitude for her colleagues and the monumental experiences she’s had as a result of the show.
“I’m so grateful for what this journey has given me: lifelong friendships, unforgettable memories, and the chance to be part of something truly special,” she added. “From the bottom of my heart, thank you for welcoming me into your homes.”
Before joining First Take, she contributed to ESPN’s digital and mobile platforms from 2006 to 2010, hosting College Football Live and Fantasy Football Now. She left the network in 2010, before returning five years later to host First Take.
ESPN responded to Qerim’s departure with a statement from the network’s President of Content, Burke Magnus.
“Molly has been an integral part of ESPN since 2006 and a key driver of First Take’s success since joining as a host a decade ago,” his statement read. “She elevated the show with her poise, skill, and professionalism while supporting others as a kind and encouraging teammate. We respect Molly’s decision, wish her the best in the future, and thank her for her extraordinary daily commitment to sports fans and ESPN.”

Ukraine war latest: Ukraine destroys half of Russia's 'key' Pantsir air defense systems, security service says
Key developments on Feb. 14-15:
- Ukraine destroys half of Russia's 'key' Pantsir air defense systems, security service says
- Ukraine hits Russia's BK-16 landing craft in Crimea and other targets in Russian-occupied territories, military says
- Zelensky, Rubio discuss air defense for Ukraine, possibility of leader-level peace talks
- Territorial concessions by Ukraine won't bring peace, Zelensky says in Munich
- Ukraine сonfirms strike on oil terminal in Russia's Krasnodar Krai, hits air defense system in Crimea
- Over 177,000 Russian soldiers killed in Ukraine identified by media investigation
The Alpha unit of Ukraine's Security Service (SBU) destroyed half of Russia's stockpile of the coveted Pantsir air defense system, the SBU announced Feb. 14.
"The 'Pantsir' is one of Russia's modern and key air defense systems. The cost of a single system ranges from $15 to $20 million. These anti-aircraft missile systems are the most effective in countering Ukrainian long-range drones," the announcement read.
The "systemic destruction" of the air defense system has the "strategic goal" of making Russia vulnerable to long-range strikes as Moscow continues to wage its war, the SBU said.
A diminished arsenal allows the Armed Forces to effectively strike Russian "military bases, warehouses, airfields, and other occupied facilities."
Ukraine regularly strikes military infrastructure deep within Russia and its own occupied territories in an effort to diminish Moscow's fighting power.
The SBU claimed on Jan. 19 that its long-range strikes during the year of 2025 either "destroyed or disabled" Russian air defense systems worth a total of approximately $4 billion.
On Feb. 12, Ukraine struck a Russian 55Zh6U "Nebo-U" long-range radar station, estimated to be worth approximately $100 million, near Yevpatoriia in occupied Crimea, the General Staff of Ukraine’s Armed Forces later reported on Feb. 13.
Meanwhile, the 1st Separate Center of the Unmanned Systems Forces (USF) on Feb. 12 struck an airfield in the village of Hvardiiske in Crimea, the Kirova electrical substation in Luhansk, and a data center in Prymorsk, Zaporizhzhia Oblast.
Ukrainian long-range cruise "Flamingo" missiles struck a major Russian arsenal storing missiles, ammunition, and explosives in Kotluban, Volgograd Oblast, overnight, Ukraine's General Staff reported on Feb. 12.
The facility belongs to Russia's Main Missile and Artillery Directorate (GRAU) and is described as one of the largest ammunition storage sites used by the Russian army. Powerful explosions and secondary detonations were recorded at the site.
In addition to the strike on the arsenal, Ukrainian forces on Feb. 12 hit the Progress Plant in Michurinsk, Tambov Oblast. The enterprise produces high-tech equipment for aviation and missile systems and is involved in supporting Russia’s military.

Ukraine hits Russia's BK-16 landing craft in Crimea and other targets in Russian-occupied territories, military says
Ukrainian forces successfully attacked a Russian BK-16 landing craft and other targets in Russian-occupied territories, the General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces said on Feb. 14.
The General Staff reported that Russia's BK-16 landing vessel, a high-speed landing craft for coastal operations and troop transport, was "successfully hit" on Feb. 12 in the Novoozerne area, Russian-occupied Crimea.
Some other military targets were also hit on Feb. 12, such as the RSP-10 radar station in Crimea and Russia's communications node in the occupied part of Zaporizhzhia Oblast, the General Staff said.
Additionally, on Feb. 13, Ukraine hit a Russian ammunition depot near the village of Novoeokonomichne in occupied Donetsk Oblast.
"The Ukrainian defense forces will continue to systematically carry out measures aimed at weakening the combat potential of the Russian aggressor," the General Staff said.
Crimea has been under Russian occupation since its illegal annexation in 2014.
Ukraine has stepped up strikes on military infrastructure on the peninsula and other newly occupied territories since the full-scale invasion began in 2022.

Editor's Note: This is a developing story and is being updated.
President Volodymyr Zelensky spoke with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference on Feb. 14, Presidential Office Spokesperson Serhii Nykyforov told the media.
The discussion focused on the situation on the battlefield, Russian attacks, and the damage caused to Ukraine's energy infrastructure. Part of the discussion included ways to support Ukraine with additional air defense missiles during the winter, according to the Presidential Office.
Rubio and Zelensky also discussed the next round of trilateral peace talks among the U.S., Ukraine, and Russia, set to take place in Geneva on Feb. 17–18.
"It's important that the planned negotiations in Geneva be productive, and I thank the United States for its constructive approach," Zelensky said after the meeting. "We also touched on the sequence of steps. It's important to make progress on issues of security guarantees and economic recovery."
The peace negotiations will eventually require a top-level meeting with the leaders of Ukraine, the U.S., and Russia, the Presidential Office said in a statement published after the talks.
"Ukraine believes that a meeting at the leadership level should ultimately be held to resolve the most problematic issues," the statement said.
Zelensky met with Rubio following his conference speech earlier in the day. Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha and Secretary of the National Security and Defense Council Rustem Umerov joined him in the talks.
Following the meeting, Zelensky also held a phone call with Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, U.S. President Donald Trump's envoys representing Washington in the ongoing negotiations. They discussed the upcoming talks, the recent rounds of negotiations in Abu Dhabi, and the meeting with Rubio.
"Not everything can be disclosed over the phone, and our negotiating team will present Ukraine's position next week," Zelensky said after the call on Feb. 14. He thanked the U.S. team for their "constructive attitude."
Both Zelensky and Rubio addressed the conference in separate speeches on Feb. 14. Zelensky stressed Ukraine's commitment to the ongoing peace negotiations among Kyiv, Moscow, and Washington, but said territorial concessions to Russia would not lead to peace.
Rubio also acknowledged that the question of control over Ukraine's eastern Donbas region has not been resolved in the current negotiations.
In a briefing after his speech, Zelensky told journalists that the U.S. had offered Ukraine a 15-year security guarantee, but that Kyiv was looking for a longer-term pledge.
"Today we have a proposal from the American side for 15 years," he said at a briefing. We want to have 20 years plus. Thirty, 50 ... We'll see what the administration and Congress will do."
The day before Zelensky's meeting with Rubio, Trump said that Zelensky needs to "get moving" to secure a peace deal with Russia.
"Russia wants to make a deal and Zelensky is going to have to get moving, otherwise he's going to miss a great opportunity," Trump claimed. "He has to move."
When asked about Trump's comments, Zelensky acknowledged on Feb. 14 that the U.S. president may be "preparing (the) atmosphere" ahead of the upcoming peace talks in Switzerland.
"Not losing our dignity, we can move," Zelensky said.

Territorial concessions by Ukraine won't bring peace, Zelensky says in Munich
President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Feb. 14 that territorial concessions by Ukraine would not bring peace, just as the 1938 Munich Agreement did not prevent World War II.
"It would be an illusion to believe that this war can now be reliably ended by dividing Ukraine — just as it was an illusion to believe that sacrificing Czechoslovakia would save Europe from a greater war," Zelensky said at the Munich Security Conference.
The Munich Agreement was a compromise reached by Nazi Germany, the U.K., France, and Italy in 1938, allowing German dictator Adolf Hitler to annex Czechoslovakia's Sudetenland region. The agreement was touted as an effort to prevent a war but did not achieve its goal, with Germany invading Poland the following year.
It has since become the primary historical example of the failures of appeasement — the policy of granting concessions to an aggressor in hopes of achieving peace.
In his speech, Zelensky compared Russian President Vladimir Putin to the "previous Putin, who began dividing Europe" — a reference to Hitler.
As part of the ongoing peace talks between Moscow, Kyiv and Washington, Russia is demanding Ukraine's withdrawal from the parts of Donetsk Oblast that it still controls.
Zelensky has repeatedly stated that territorial concessions are unacceptable to Ukraine. He reiterated on Feb. 14 that concessions are often discussed during peace talks only in the context of Ukraine, not Russia.
Regarding elections, Zelensky said that Ukraine can make changes to its constitution and hold elections if there is a ceasefire. He added that Ukraine could also agree to a truce if Russia holds an election.
He also stressed that Ukraine will do "truly everything" to make these negotiations successful.
"Ukraine wants the result of all these efforts to be real security and real peace. Real peace. Not what came out of Geneva in 2021. Not what the Russians hope for, from this so-called spirit of Anchorage."
Zelensky's comments are a reference to Russian-U.S. talks held in Geneva in 2021 and in Anchorage, Alaska, in 2025.
Zelensky also argued that the absence of Europe at the negotiation table is a "big mistake."
"And it is we — Ukrainians — who are trying to bring Europe fully into the process, so that Europe's interests and voice are taken into account," he added.
In later remarks to journalists, Zelensky said that the U.S. had offered Ukraine a 15-year security guarantee as part of a peace deal, but that Kyiv is looking for guarantees that last at least 20 years.
"Today we have a proposal from the American side for 15 years," he said at a briefing.
We want to have 20 years plus. 30, 50 ... We'll see what the administration and Congress will do."
Following the briefing, Zelensky held private talks with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio.
Estonian Foreign Minister Margus Tsahkna told the Kyiv Independent that Zelensky's message was "very clear".
"The first thing is that the Ukrainian people are fighting and not giving in. This is most important. And second, that Putin is not changing the goal," Tsahkna said.
Tsahkna added that the Ukrainian people are willing to stop the war, but not under any conditions, as "Putin is actually not willing to change the goals."
"Putin will continue the aggressive behavior, and Ukraine is protecting Europe," he said. "And the other way around, Ukraine is an opportunity for Europe."
NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said at the conference that Russia does not seek a peace agreement, as indicated by the appointment of Vladimir Madinsky, a controversial Putin aide and historian, to the Russian negotiating team.
The return of Medinsky signals a potential hardening of Moscow's stance during the negotiations, given his history of uncompromising rhetoric in previous rounds of talks.
During the conference, Zelensky also met Rutte to discuss the funding of the PURL initiative and its further development.
Signed by the U.S. and NATO in July 2025, the Prioritized Ukraine Requirements List (PURL) agreement lays out a mechanism for NATO member states and partners to purchase high-priority equipment for Ukraine.
"We are counting on continued funding for this initiative, which enables us to purchase missiles for air defense systems," Zelenky wrote on X.
Zelensky also thanked for a "highly productive meeting" in the Ramstein format. After the meeting, the allocation of €38 billion in military aid for Ukraine was confirmed, Zelensky said.

Ukraine confirms strike on oil terminal in Russia's Krasnodar Krai, hits air defense system in Crimea
Editor's note: This is a developing story and is being updated.
Ukraine carried out strikes on an oil terminal in southern Russia and a Russian air defense system in occupied Crimea overnight on Feb. 14–15, according to Ukraine's military intelligence (HUR).
In southern Russia, Ukrainian forces struck the Tamanneftegaz oil terminal near the village of Volna in Krasnodar Krai. A fire was recorded at the facility, HUR said, adding that the extent of the damage is still being assessed. The terminal is located near the Kerch Strait, east of Russian-occupied Crimea.
The confirmation follows earlier claims by Krasnodar Krai Governor Veniamin Kondratyev, who said Ukrainian drones had targeted several sites in the region, including an oil depot in Volna. He said two people were injured and that emergency crews responded to multiple fires in the region.
Volna is located just east of Crimea's Kerch Peninsula and about 325 kilometers (200 miles) from Ukrainian-controlled territory near Nikopol.
HUR also said Ukrainian forces successfully struck a Pantsir-S1 air defense missile system near the village of Kacha in occupied Crimea.
The Pantsir is one of Russia's key modern air defense systems. The cost of a single system ranges from $15 to $20 million. It is considered the most effective against Ukrainian long-range drones.
In addition, a repair unit belonging to a Russian artillery brigade was reportedly hit near Vilne in occupied Donetsk Oblast, and a concentration area of Russian personnel was struck near Liubymivka in occupied Zaporizhzhia Oblast.
Kyiv considers energy infrastructure to be a military target as they directly fund Russia's war. Ukraine regularly strikes military infrastructure deep within Russia in an effort to diminish Moscow's fighting power as the Kremlin continues to wage its war against Ukraine.
An oil terminal near the village of Volna was also struck on Jan. 21, sparking a blaze, killing three people and injuring eight others, Kondratyev and independent media previously reported.
On Feb. 12, Ukraine struck a Russian 55Zh6U "Nebo-U" long-range radar station, estimated to be worth approximately $100 million, near Yevpatoriia in occupied Crimea, the General Staff of Ukraine’s Armed Forces later reported on Feb. 13.
The Alpha unit of Ukraine's Security Service (SBU) has destroyed half of Russia's stockpile of the coveted Pantsir air defense system with the "systemic destruction" of the system, the SBU announced Feb. 14.

Over 177,000 Russian soldiers killed in Ukraine identified by media investigation
Russian independent media outlet Mediazona, in collaboration with the BBC Russian service, has confirmed the identities of 177,433 Russian military personnel killed in Ukraine as of Feb. 13.
Since the media outlets' last update in early February, the names of 9,291 Russian soldiers have been added to the list of casualties.
The journalists note that the actual figures are likely significantly higher, as their verified information comes from public sources such as obituaries, posts by relatives, regional media reports, and statements from local authorities.
The confirmed death toll now includes over 57,200 volunteers, 21,400 recruited prisoners, and 17,000 mobilized soldiers, according to the media outlets. A total of 6,414 officers have also been confirmed to have been killed.
While Moscow does not disclose its casualty figures at all, President Volodymyr Zelensky told France TV in an interview on Feb. 4 that at least 55,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed on the battlefield since the start of Russia's full-scale war. Kyiv largely avoided commenting on its losses for the first two years of the full-scale invasion, until Zelensky announced in February 2024 that 31,000 Ukrainian troops had been killed.
Zelensky also told France TV that Russia would continue to incur staggering losses if it attempted to conquer all of eastern Ukraine by force of arms. His comments come amid the latest round of trilateral peace talks between Ukraine, Russia, and the U.S., where the status of Ukraine's eastern Donbas territory remains a major point of contention in negotiations.
Despite the heavy losses, Russia has been able to make marginal advances in Ukraine's front line region as it is able to offset its casualties through fresh contract soldiers. The Ukrainian open-source mapping project DeepState reported that Russian forces occupied 4,336 square kilometers (1,674 square miles) of Ukrainian territory in 2025, accounting for less than 1% of the country
The General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces estimates that as of Feb. 13, Russia has lost around 1,250,950 troops in Ukraine since Feb. 22, 2022. The figures do not specify killed or wounded, though the overall consensus is that it includes dead, wounded, missing, and captured.
Mediazona published the complete list of identified casualties for the first time in February, marking three years since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. According to the publication, volunteers manually enter and verify each record to prevent duplicate entries in the database.

Suvi Minkkinen makes history with Olympic bronze in Milano-Cortina
Finland

Suvi Minkkinen secured a historic bronze medal in the women’s biathlon pursuit at the Milano-Cortina 2026 Winter Olympics on Sunday. The 31-year-old became the first Finnish woman to win an Olympic medal in biathlon.
She hit all 20 targets and climbed from sixth place at the start to the podium in Anterselva. Italy’s Lisa Vittozzi won gold on home snow, and Norway’s Maren Kirkeeide took silver.
Minkkinen started the 10km pursuit 50 seconds behind the leader after finishing sixth in the sprint. She shot clean in both prone stages and remained in contention at halfway.
In the first standing stage, she cleared all five targets and moved into fourth place.
On the final visit to the range, several leading athletes missed. Minkkinen stayed composed and delivered a fourth flawless series. She left the range in second place.
Kirkeeide, despite two misses earlier in the race, caught and passed Minkkinen on the final lap.
Minkkinen held off France’s Lou Jeanmonnot, who finished 15.1 seconds behind the Finn in fourth.
“Such good feelings. I was able to make a perfect race just as I had planned,” Suvi Minkkinen said after the finish.
“For four laps I focused on my own work. Today the level of focus I had was a dream state that is hard to reach. Today I reached it, and the reward is Olympic bronze.”
She said the result linked back to work done years earlier. “A couple of years ago I made a high-altitude training plan with these Games in mind, so that my body would work here in Anterselva. Now I can perform here at the highest level in the world.”
The bronze delivered Finland’s third medal of the Milano-Cortina Games and marks the second major championship podium of her career. She won sprint bronze at the World Championships in Lenzerheide last winter.
This is her third Olympic appearance. Before Milano-Cortina, her best individual Olympic result was sixth place, achieved in the sprint earlier in the week.
Finland has now won seven Olympic medals in biathlon. All previous medals came from men.
The last Finnish Olympic biathlon medal came 28 years ago in Nagano in 1998. On that occasion, Ville Räikkönen claimed bronze in the sprint.

Trump Is Frequently Giving Campaign-Style Speeches To Troops In His Second Term

President Donald Trump held a campaign-style rally on Friday at Fort Bragg, an active Army base in North Carolina, urging troops to vote for Republicans and criticizing Democrats.
Trump entered the base to Lee Greenwood’s “God Bless the USA” and ended the event with the Village People’s “Y.M.C.A.” He shared the stage with Michael Whatley, a former Republican National Committee chairman and Senate candidate, while touting his military spending plans and celebrating his restoration of the Fort Bragg name.
The rally took place before an audience of uniformed service members.

“You have to vote for us,” Trump told the troops Friday, highlighting his move to restore the Fort Bragg name after Congress directed the Pentagon to rename bases named after Confederate officers. Trump’s administration renamed the installation after Pfc. Ronald L. Bragg instead of Confederate Gen. Braxton Bragg.
“If we don’t win the midterms, they’ll take it off again,” Trump said. “They’ll take it off again. You can’t let that happen.”
A majority of the uniformed service members reportedly listened without visible reaction, aside from lifting their phones to record photos and videos.
Friday’s event was not the first time the President has delivered such overtly political remarks at military venues, testing the tradition of separating the armed forces from partisan politics. In his second term, Trump has increasingly ignored that separation, often using military bases as stops for campaign-style political speeches.
Defense Department policy bars active-duty service members from engaging in partisan political activity. Army guidance stresses that the institution must remain above politics in both practice and perception.
“The Army as an institution must be nonpartisan and appear so too,” the Army field manual states. “Nonpartisanship assures the public that our Army will always serve the Constitution and our people with loyalty and responsibility.”
The President is under no such restriction, but most have adhered to the military’s apolitical standards.
TIME has reached out to the White House for comment.
Here is a brief history of Trump’s speeches at military events and bases during his second term:
Oct. 5, 2025 — Naval Station Norfolk, Virginia
Trump marked the Navy’s 250th anniversary in Norfolk while the federal government was shut down, using the event to criticize Democrats over budget negotiations.
“Despite the current Democrat-induced shutdown, we will get our service members every last penny,” Trump said. “But we have to take care of this little gnat that sits on our shoulder called the Democrats.”
“Despite the current Democrat-induced shutdown, we will get our service members every last penny,” he added.
The President attended the ceremony alongside the first lady and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, honoring a 100-year-old World War II veteran and observing military exercises. His remarks, however, focused heavily on the budget impasse and immigration.
September 30, 2025 — Marine Corps Base Quantico, Virginia
Defense Secretary Hegseth convened a gathering of senior military leaders in September, which Trump joined at the last minute. Speaking before a room of generals and admirals, Trump delivered a speech that observers described as partisan.
“The ones that are run by the radical left Democrats... what they've done to San Francisco, Chicago, New York, Los Angeles, they're very unsafe places. And we're going to straighten them out one by one. This is going to be a major part for some of the people in this room,” he said in a speech to military leaders. “That's a war too. It's a war from within.”
He warned that the county was “under invasion from within” and criticized political opponents, blending his role as commander in chief with political messaging in a setting traditionally reserved for nonpartisan military discourse.
The event drew attention because it broke with the longstanding norm of keeping senior military forums free from campaign-style rhetoric, raising questions about civil-military boundaries.
June 10, 2025 — Fort Bragg, North Carolina
During a visit to Fort Bragg, earlier last year, marking the Army’s 250th anniversary, Trump announced he was restoring the names of seven military bases that had been changed after a Pentagon review of installations honoring Confederate officers.
“We won a lot of battles out of those forts. It’s no time to change,” Trump said. “I’m superstitious. I like to keep it going.”
The announcement reversed changes made under the Biden administration following recommendations from a congressional naming commission. Trump said he chose to reveal the decision at Fort Bragg rather than wait for a military parade in Washington days later.
“I can’t wait. I got to talk to my friends here today,” he said.
At the same Army anniversary celebration, Trump used his remarks to defend deploying National Guard troops and Marines to Los Angeles amid protests over immigration enforcement.
Calling protesters “animals” and “a foreign enemy,” Trump said. “We will not allow an American city to be invaded and conquered by a foreign enemy.”
He also warned that demonstrators opposing an upcoming military parade “will be met with very heavy force.”
The event, which included military demonstrations and equipment displays, blended ceremonial observances with political messaging about immigration, public safety, and Democratic leaders.
His visit also drew attention after campaign-style merchandise was sold on base, including “Make America Great Again” hats and Trump-themed T-shirts.
May 24, 2025 — West Point, New York
Trump delivered a commencement address at the U.S. Military Academy that at times resembled a campaign rally, appearing before graduates in a red “Make America Great Again” hat and tying the institution to his broader political agenda.
“In a few months, you’ll become graduates of the most elite and storied military academy in human history,” Trump told the cadets.”And I know, because I rebuilt that army.”
The President used the speech to tout his first-term record, criticize diversity initiatives, and repeat familiar campaign lines, including his claim that he faced more investigations than Al Capone.
“We’ve liberated our troops from divisive and demeaning political trainings,” he said. He also veered into cultural issues, refereing transgeder policies and gender in sports while addressing the graduating class.

- While the FDA did not confirm whether any illnesses had been reported, the agency did note that serious health consequences are unlikely.
- The FDA also issued a recall for a single lot of Initiative Foods’ Tippy Toes brand of Apple Pear Banana Fruit baby food puree due to elevated levels of patulin.
- Additionally, over 22,000 pounds of raw ground beef from CS Beef Packers, LLC were recalled after routine testing revealed the presence of E. coli O145.

Netanyahu says US deal with Iran must dismantle nuclear infrastructure
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday he told US President Donald Trump last week that any US deal with Iran must include the dismantling of Iran's nuclear infrastructure, not just stopping the enrichment process.
Speaking at the annual Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations, Netanyahu also said Israel still needs to "complete the job" of destroying all tunnels in Gaza.
Israel, he said, has already dismantled 150 km (93 miles) of an estimated 500 km.
A second round of talks between the US and Iran are slated for this week.
Iran is pursuing a nuclear agreement with the US that delivers economic benefits for both sides, an Iranian diplomat was reported as saying on Sunday.
Netanyahu said he is sceptical of a deal but it must include enriched material leaving Iran.
"There shall be no enrichment capability - not stopping the enrichment process, but dismantling the equipment and the infrastructure that allows you to enrich in the first place", he said.
Iran and the US renewed negotiations earlier this month to tackle their decades-long dispute over Tehran's nuclear programme and avert a new military confrontation.
The US has dispatched a second aircraft carrier to the region and is preparing for the possibility of a sustained military campaign if the talks do not succeed, US officials have told Reuters.
Netanyahu also said that he aimed to end US military aid to Israel within the next 10 years, after the current 10-year deal of receiving $3.8 billion a year - which is largely spent in the United States on equipment - ends in 2028.
Due to a thriving economy, "we can afford to phase out the financial component of the military aid that we're receiving, and I propose a 10-year draw down to zero. Now, in the three years that remain in the present memorandum of understanding and another seven years draw it down to zero", Netanyahu said.
"We want to move with the United States from aid to partnership", he said.

West not to be able to compete with global South — Russian businessman

MOSCOW, February 15. /TASS/. The real challenge for Europe is its inability to compete with the global South rather than a mythical existential threat coming from Russia, Russian businessman Oleg Deripaska said.
"The world has changed dramatically and will continue changing rapidly. The aging West will not be able to compete with the global South, either economically or militarily. This is the major threat to the comfortable live in the Old World. Definitely, not Russia," he wrote on his Telegram channel.
According to Deripaska, it would be useful for Russia to diversify its economic relations and opt for more pragmatic economic cooperation with China, Africa, India, and Latin America rather than continuing interaction with the dominating "wealthy" West.
Given well-balanced strategy, Russia will be able to regain economic growth of 7-8% and win a foothold among the world’s top four economies within ten years after the conflict in Ukraine is ended.

Rubio says US pleased with overall ‘trajectory’ in Syria after YPG deal

04:11:00 KST

The United States is satisfied with the “trajectory” in Syria, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Sunday, following an agreement between the government and the U.S.-backed YPG terror group last month.
"There's been some days that have been very concerning, but we like the trajectory," Rubio said on a brief visit to Bratislava. "We have to keep it on that trajectory. We've got good agreements in place."
Rubio added, however, that a deal between Syrian authorities and the YPG must now be implemented.
"That's not going to be easy and there other such agreements that they need to reach with the Druze, with the Bedouins, with the Alawites, with all the elements of a very diverse society in Syria," Rubio said.
The YPG is the Syrian wing of the PKK. The PKK's attacks under the pretext of a struggle to establish a self-styled Kurdish state, cost thousands of lives since the 1980s. The YPG pursues a similar agenda in Syria and declared parts of northeastern Syria as an autonomous region. The group aims "decentralization" of Syria to carve out a Kurdish entity.
Syrian leaders in Damascus and YPG officials announced in January, after months of deadlock and armed clashes, that they had reached an agreement to integrate YPG and YPG-held areas of Syria into the Syrian state.
The PKK/YPG created a self-styled so-called Kurdish state in northeast of the country during Syria's civil war (2011-2024).
The United States had supported the PKK/YPG under the pretext of fighting Daesh terrorists.
But after the overthrow of Bashar al-Assad at the end of 2024, the President Donald Trump's administration backed Syrian leader Ahmad al-Sharaa, whose anti-regime forces drove Assad from power, in his bid to impose authority over the entire country.
Rubio on Sunday defended the administration's embrace of al-Sharaa, even against the former YPG allies, by arguing that Washington faced a difficult decision in Syria.
The process, "as difficult as it's been, is far better than a Syria that would've been broken up into eight pieces with all kinds of fighting going on, all kinds of mass migration," Rubio said. "So we were very positive about that."

'Extremely lenient': Box Hill North players sanctioned over inappropriate photos

Box Hill North players' sanctions over inappropriate photos criticised as 'extremely lenient'
The Box Hill North Football Club players involved in inappropriate photos posted online after their "Silly Saturday" post-season celebrations have been sanctioned by the league's governing body.
The reprimands have been called "extremely lenient" by the former women's captain who first brought the behaviour to the club's attention in August last year.
In the photos posted to social media, the captain of the men's senior team was dressed as a schoolgirl having her breast touched by a St Kilda AFL player.
The outfit referred to the "St Kilda schoolgirl" scandal in 2010, when two St Kilda players were accused of having sex with a 17-year-old schoolgirl.
In another photo, the deputy vice-captain was dressed in full-body blackface with a large penis attached to the costume. This photo was left on Instagram for more than three months.
The four players involved were found by the Victorian Amateur Football Association (VAFA) to have breached the league's national community football policy general code of conduct and the VAFA's social media policy.
The two players who posted the photos to social media received a three-week suspension, while the other two players in the photos received a two-week ban.
They have all been stood down from any leadership roles until they complete appropriate education sessions, after which their positions will be reviewed.
The league said all players pleaded guilty and cooperated fully with the investigation.
Genna Krienke, the former captain of the women's team who brought the photos to the club's attention, said the club took no action for four months and only raised the issue to VAFA after the media got involved.
The 25-year-old, who has now left the club, took part in the league's investigation into the matter, yet said she had not been contacted by VAFA, AFL Victoria or the club following the handing down of the punishments.
"I'm disappointed but not surprised that it's [the sanctions] just a slap on the wrist," Krienke told the ABC.
"The players are not going to learn from this at all, other clubs are not going to learn from this either, because they've seen that the punishment is just one to three weeks of sitting out."
When the photos were first reported by ABC Sport, the club provided a statement in which it "sincerely apologises for any offence caused following the players' end-of-season gathering".
"Certain costumes and associated social media posts were inappropriate and do not reflect our values or the inclusive environment we strive to provide," the statement read.
"To be clear, the club strongly condemns this behaviour and is taking the matter extremely seriously."
The club did not respond to multiple requests for comment by the ABC following the sanctions, including asking what the education sessions involved and an expected timeframe.
VAFA also declined to comment on what the education sessions involved.
Krienke said she did not think the club could say in good faith that it had taken the matter seriously at any stage throughout the process.
"They were slow in approaching it. They were hesitant to investigate it. They've been extremely lenient with the coach and the players in the punishment," she said.
"They cannot look me in the eyes, or look any woman, person of colour or marginalised person in the community in the eyes, and say, 'We've taken this seriously.'"
She added it was "beyond disgusting" that in the eyes of VAFA and the club, careless conduct on a football field could have resulted in a harsher punishment than the players' planning and choosing to wear the offensive costumes.
One source told ABC Sport the players testified they had been subjected to social media abuse following the story becoming public, which was a factor in the decision-making around the suspensions.
VAFA said in a statement following the sanctions it "remains committed to upholding its values of respect, inclusion, community and integrity, and to educating all members in support of these principles".
The club will also conduct two respectful relationships workshops (as recommended by AFL Victoria) for the men's playing and coaching group and undertake a whole-of-club "Healthy Club" workshop facilitated by Relationships Australia.
VAFA, AFL Victoria and Box Hill North were contacted for further comment by ABC Sport.

When Palestinian peasants brought an empire to its knees

There was a time in Palestine when the greatest empire in the world lost control of entire areas, when highly educated lawyers followed the orders of simple illiterate peasants, and when wearing the Palestinian scarf, or koufiyyeh, became a political statement. Just like Palestine’s name, it has almost been forgotten from the world’s memory.
Palestinian director Annemarie Jacir’s recent film, “Palestine 36,” tells part of that story, shedding light on one of the most dramatic and crucial episodes of Palestinian history: the 1936-1939 revolution.
The film takes place between Jerusalem and the nearby fictionalized village of al-Basma, spanning the years in which Palestinians launched an uprising against the British Mandate and Zionist settler colonialism. The story follows the lives of several characters descended from the rural Palestinian peasant class, the urban middle class, and the traditional elites. A fair bit of the movie is devoted to unearthing the divisions between them, especially differences over how to respond to the increasingly aggressive Zionist settler movement, which operated under the discriminatory protection of the British. Some continued to opt for diplomacy with the British out of concern for their social and financial privileges. Others, directly impacted by British colonial policies and Zionist land grabs, joined the uprising in earnest, facing brutal repression.
“Palestine 36” is the first rendition of the 1936 revolution for the big screen. The international audience for which it was largely intended knows little of this history, and in that respect, the film aptly delivers, and with aesthetic finesse. But for Palestinians, recent years have seen a renewed interest in the 1936 revolution, especially for the younger generation of Palestinians who grew up under the Oslo Accords and the era of Palestinian defeat. That’s why the planned screenings of the movie in Ramallah had to be repeated several times to accommodate the intense local interest in seeing it.
The renewed interest in the 1936 revolution could be traced back to the period of revived political consciousness among young Palestinians during the past decade, becoming increasingly present in cultural circles and activist groups. Youth organized local visits to West Bank villages following in the footsteps of the revolution’s protagonists and their local stories. Folk artists featured stories about how the Palestinian peasant “fallahi” culture came to represent national liberation in those years. Young historians and researchers produced dozens of articles on specific aspects of that period, including the short-lived “state” proclaimed by revolutionaries in the hills of Hebron, the historical figure behind an iconic 1936 poem, and the real story of the Palestinians who collaborated with the British against the revolution.
“Palestine 36” can be seen as a continuation of this Palestinian effort to reclaim the narrative of a key period of Palestine’s modern history.
Palestinian writer and founder of Palestine’s “Popular University” project, Khaled Odetallah, has been an important figure in this recent revival. He says that the 1936 revolution was “a foundational event of Palestinian nationalism.”
“Because contrary to previous attempts by Palestinian urban elites to formulate a national movement after the end of WWI, the 1936 movement erupted from the popular base of Palestinian society,” Odetallah told Mondoweiss.
“‘Palestine 36’ captures this historical event successfully and in a highly aesthetic manner, and it does deliver the essentials about it to an international audience that might not be familiar with it,” Odetallah continued.
But as a well-made artistic work, Odetallah believes the movie still couldn’t capture all the dimensions of the poor peasant uprising that had posed a serious challenge to the British empire, “which controlled half of the world at the time,” he said.
Odetallah points out that the fictional film al-Basma is clearly inspired by the real-life village of al-Bassa in the Galilee, even though the film depicts the village as near Jerusalem.
Al-Bassa was a predominantly Christian village that would come to be ethnically cleansed in 1948. Before that, its residents were swept up in the revolution, as British soldiers, in an effort to put down the revolt, entered al-Bassa on September 6, 1938, and sprayed the villagers with machine gun fire for 20 minutes before burning it to the ground, according to the testimony of a British soldier.
“Many of the events portrayed in the film actually took place in al-Bassa, especially some of the cruelties committed by the British forces,” Odetallah explained.
Jacir’s historical epic also takes pains to shed light on some of the British figures behind the brutal repression of the revolt. This is perhaps best encapsulated in the character of Captain Wingate, clearly inspired by the real-life mastermind behind the British repression of Palestinian villages during the revolution, Orde Charles Wingate.
His cruelty and violence towards Palestinians, and his ideological Christian Zionism, are one of the film’s high points as far as historical portrayals go. But it “failed to show the more strategically important role of Wingate,” Odetallah said. “Wingate was the engineer of the Zionist military doctrine during the Nakba, and he was the person who trained the Zionist militias in how to repress and depopulate Palestinian villages, to the point that he introduced Zionist militia men into his troop during his counterinsurgency campaigns in the Palestinian countryside.”
One of those Zionist militia men was none other than Moshe Dayan, who would go on to become Israel’s Defense Minister and called Orde Wingate his “first teacher” in his diaries. Many of the methods used by the Israeli army today, like punitive home demolitions and mass arrest campaigns, were introduced by Wingate and other British officers in the 1930s. The film does show these British practices, but it doesn’t highlight the direct connection between the British military and Zionist paramilitary forces.
A class-based revolution
The film also sheds light on the social contradictions in Palestine during the 1930s, even highlighting aspects largely ignored by mainstream Palestinian narratives — namely, the collaboration of some Palestinian elites with the British against the revolution. The film shows, for example, a prominent Palestinian journalist and editor whose wife discovers that he had been on the payroll of the Zionist organization to publish articles unfavorable to the revolution, under the promise of helping him become mayor.
“The film does a courageous thing in breaking some taboos,” Odetallah noted. “This did happen, and it is difficult to write about these treasons in academia today, but what the film failed to capture, in my opinion, is the more structural, class-based type of collaboration with the colonizers,” he said.
“There is the petty collaboration of some individuals which needs to be hidden, but there were in the 1930s entire elite families and groups whose behavior was nothing more than the logical protection of their interests, and who openly acted against the revolution,” he explained. “Including that could have more deeply captured the class dynamics of the times.”
Understanding the class character of the revolution and the social and political forces that opposed it ultimately helps explain how it was crushed by 1939. The first Palestinian who took up the task of mapping these class dynamics was Palestine’s literary juggernaut, Ghassan Kanafani. The result was his pioneering in 1971 study of the revolt, which opened with the statement that the anti-colonial revolution in Palestine was defeated “by the alliance of British and Zionist colonial forces, the surrounding Arab regimes, and the local traditional elites.”
The importance of Kanafani’s study — the only historical piece he has written that isn’t literature or political journalism — lies in the fact that it isn’t really about the past.
Palestinian historian and educator Hazem Jamjoum, author of the latest English translation of Kanafani’s work, has pointed out that Kanafani wrote the study in the aftermath of Black September, the devastating war launched by the King of Jordan against the Palestine Liberation Organization, which ended with the Palestinian resistance leaving the country. Kanafani sensed that it was the beginning of a process that would pave the way for a politics of compromise and political capitulation instead of liberation. He identified this tendency as encapsulated in the Arab regimes and Palestinian elites’ class-based interests. According to Jamjoum, Kanafani’s study was essentially issuing a warning to his time.
As a self-proclaimed Marxist, Kanafani chose the 1936 revolution precisely for its obvious class character and its foundational nature in Palestine’s national struggle. He was laying the groundwork for a counter-narrative of the Palestinian struggle, told from below rather than from the top down.
“Palestine 36” doesn’t exactly adopt this particular reading of history, although it certainly isn’t hostile to it. It places the film’s characters at the center of the events, emphasizing their individual stories and trajectories, while avoiding foregrounding a single character as the hero. In this, the film hints at the spirit of collectivity in the revolt, keeping the story a collective one, just not of a specific class or group.
Some characters in the film remain somewhat flat in the background, but the main ones undergo an evolution in self-awareness. This happens to Yousef, the young man who wants to escape his rural village life and ends up fighting the British in its hills. But it also happens to Khuloud, the educated journalist in the city with close connections to British government employees, who starts out hoping that the uprising doesn’t spiral out of control and that the national leaders will unite. She ends up leaving her husband and joining protesters in the street.
Yet even though the film sets the revolution in the countryside, most of the political dialogue takes place in the city between Palestinian elites and the British. It is as if the events are centered in one world, and the reflection about them in another.
This is most starkly highlighted when the characters learn about the results of the British Peel Commission on Palestine, which recommended the partition of the country to give half of it to the Zionist movement. The dialogue concerning the commission and the ensuing argument over it all happens in a Jerusalem city house around a social dinner table, in the presence of a British government employee. This contrasts with the reaction in the village, where people pour out into the fields in anger and chase British patrols with stones.
This also applies to the movie’s portrayal of Palestinian social dynamics. We can clearly see how urban society is structured and how the relations among the political leaders, the journalists, the businessmen, and the British evolve. But we don’t learn much about the village — its family and clan structure, social hierarchies, or how the revolution sprang from Palestinian village society and impacted them. This tended to render the Palestinian village as something of an archetype, to the point that its culture was largely absent. Despite actors’ efforts to use the rural Palestinian pronunciation of certain letters, it didn’t capture the accent, mannerisms, or speech style of Palestinian villages. For an international audience, this isn’t an issue, but for a Palestinian audience, it sticks out like a sore thumb.
Yet in its most important task, “Palestine 36” does what few other films have done for an international audience: it places the 1936 revolution at the center of the Palestinian narrative. First-time viewers will come away from the movie knowing that they just learned of a key and foundational episode in the decades-long Palestinian struggle for freedom. More importantly, it makes up the core of what it means to adopt Palestinian identity: fighting for freedom demands a price, and even then, the results are never guaranteed.
This is most poignantly captured in one of the film’s final scenes. After the destruction of the village by the British, one of the characters tells a child, “It is not the first time, and it won’t be the last. There is still a long way to go.” With that, history comes full circle.

‘Right about everything’: Liz Truss tweets photo of meeting with Trump

After spending time and resources crisscrossing the Atlantic to cultivate the support of the Maga faithful, Liz Truss has finally got the prize she apparently craved: a photo with Donald Trump.
Britain’s shortest-serving prime minister tweeted a photo on Sunday showing her in the company of the US president at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida.
“Right about everything,” Truss posted, tagging the president on X.
Trump had yet to record the meeting on his own social media feeds, focusing instead on promoting the new documentary made by his wife, Melania. It is unclear how long the meeting between Truss and Trump lasted and how it was initiated.
Truss, who has increasingly adopted extreme positions to the right of the Conservative party she once led since she left office, and has attempted to relaunch herself as a podcaster, has made addresses in each of the last two years at the flagship annual conference of the US right.
She told the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in Maryland last year that her own country was “failing”, as she appeared alongside rightwing populists from around the world planning deeper ties and cooperation.
An increasingly marginal figure in British politics, who was prime minister for only 49 days and lost her seat in 2024’s general election, Truss has sought to secure a safe harbour at CPAC, a once mainstream conservative gathering that has embraced Trump’s brand of nativist-populism.
At home in the UK, meanwhile, Truss has been trying to get her own club off the ground and has been accused of wandering the premises of London’s exclusive club 5 Hertford Street in search of members to poach for her rival operation.
The latter, called The Leconfield, asks “founding members” for £500,000 and was conceived by Truss and the property tycoon Robert Tchenguiz, who is transforming his Curzon Street offices for the venture.

Bangladesh has invited top diplomats of South Asian nations for a new government ceremony in the capital Dhaka after new lawmakers were elected in last week's general elections, officials announced on Sunday.
The newly elected lawmakers and Cabinet members will be sworn in on Tuesday, ushering in the first new parliament following the 2024 uprising that ended Sheikh Hasina’s 15-year rule.
Chief Election Commissioner AMM Nasir Uddin will swear in new lawmakers, and the president will do the same for the new Cabinet.
In line with tradition, guests, among them the foreign ministers of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) members, including Afghanistan, Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and others, have been invited to the swearing-in to be held in front of the parliament building.
The Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), which secured a two-thirds majority in Thursday's election with 209 seats in the 300-seat parliament, will form the government with party leader Tarique Rahman to become prime minister.
In Thursday's election, the BNP got 49.97 percent of the vote while the Jamaat-e-Islami party-led alliance Jamaat got 31.76 percent, according to the country's election commission.
Jamaat ally the National Citizen Party (NCP), the youth group that led the 2024 uprising, got 3.5 percent of the vote.
Jamaat seeks recount for 32 seats, announces protests
After securing 77 seats, the Jamaat alliance accepted the results overall but claimed some irregularities in the process.
Jamaat said on Sunday that they are seeking a recount in 32 constituencies over alleged irregularities and counting manipulation.
Assistant Secretary General Hamidur Rahman Azad told reporters that they saw irregularities during the voting, adding: “There is a demand for revaluation in 32 seats. We will follow the legal process.”
He also announced protests for Monday, saying: “We will take the oaths of office, go to parliament, and play a constructive role. At the same time, the streets will also be open for us.”
More than 127.6 million people in Bangladesh were eligible to cast ballots, and the country saw a voter turnout of 59.44 percent, up from 41.8 percent in the January 2024 elections.
Results in three seats were held up or suspended, two due to court orders and one due to the death of a candidate.
The commission also published the results of the Thursday referendum on constitutional reforms, with votes in its favor exceeding 60 percent.
In a rare political gesture, Rahman visited Jamaat Ameer chief Shafiqur Rahman at his residence in Dhaka on Sunday. Some top leaders from the both parties were present and discussed issues, including post-election developments.
Rahman is scheduled to hold another such visit to NCP chief Nahid Islam, a key figure of the 2024 upspring, at his Dhaka residence.

African leaders wrapped up a two-day summit on Sunday with urgent calls to end conflicts across the continent and renewed demands for reform of the UN Security Council, as mounting security crises overshadowed the gathering’s stated agenda of water issues.
Burundi’s President Evariste Ndayishimiye, the newly elected African Union (AU) chair, said restoring stability remains the bloc’s foremost priority.
“We need to silence the guns. We need peace on this continent. We need stability on this continent, and we have a program for that,” he told a closing press briefing.
AU Commission Chair Mahmoud Ali Youssouf said the leaders also stressed the link between development and stability, warning that access to basic services remains critical for long-term peace.
“Without equitable access to water and sanitation, we cannot talk of public health or inclusive development or sustainable prosperity for our people,” he said.
Worst humanitarian crisis
In a separate press briefing, AU Peace and Security Commissioner Bankole Adeoye described the situation in Sudan as “the worst humanitarian crisis globally” and said the conflict, which began in April 2023, remains “virtually unreported” despite its scale and impact on regional stability.
Taking questions on Sudan, he told reporters: “Our number one goal is a permanent, unconditional, inclusive, immediate ceasefire.”
He also reiterated Africa’s long-standing position on global governance reform, saying the UN Security Council must better reflect contemporary realities.
“The UN Security Council must reflect the world of today,” Adeoye said.
Adeoye added that AU leaders reaffirmed their policy of “zero tolerance” for unconstitutional changes of government.
Although the summit was officially convened under a theme focused on water security and sanitation, the issue received less attention in its final hours as leaders concentrated on urgent peace and security challenges across the continent.

Lawmakers urge DOJ to ‘stop protecting predators’ over vague Epstein files disclosure
- The Department of Justice (DOJ) has sent a six-page letter to Congress, disclosing a list of high-profile individuals mentioned in the Jeffrey Epstein files.
- Lawmakers have expressed dissatisfaction with the disclosure, accusing the DOJ of being purposefully vague and protecting individuals with close ties to Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell.
- The list includes names of celebrities like Marilyn Monroe and Janis Joplin, who died decades ago, alongside figures such as Donald Trump, without clarifying their connection to Epstein.
- Members of Congress, including Rep. Ro Khanna and Rep. Nancy Mace, are demanding greater transparency and the release of fully unredacted files, despite the DOJ indicating this is the final release.
- The DOJ stated it has released “all” records as required by the Epstein Files Transparency Act, but lawmakers argue that many pages remain blacked out and that the list is incomplete.

Trump’s border tsar Homan says ‘small’ security force will remain in Minnesota
Deaths of Renee Good and Alex Pretti by federal agents raised questions over officers’ conduct, prompting changes to Operation Metro Surge
White House border tsar Tom Homan said on Sunday that more than 1,000 immigration agents have left Minnesota’s Twin Cities area and hundreds more will depart in the days ahead as part of the Trump administration’s drawdown of its immigration enforcement surge.
He also said agents will keep investigating fraud allegations as well as the anti-immigration enforcement protest that disrupted a service at a church service.
“We already removed well over 1,000 people, and as of Monday, Tuesday, we’ll remove several hundred more,” Homan said. “We’ll get back to the original footprint.”
Thousands of officers were sent to the Minneapolis and St Paul area for US Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s (ICE) “Operation Metro Surge”.
The Department of Homeland Security said it was its largest immigration enforcement operation ever and proved successful. But the crackdown came under increasing criticism as the situation grew more volatile and two US citizens were killed.

My suburb has a reputation for sleaze. But now Sydney and Melbourne want to emulate it

Opinion
My suburb has a reputation for sleaze. But now Sydney and Melbourne want to emulate it
People talk about living in the Valley like they might talk about doing time.
You sign up for a two-year stretch. At first, you immerse yourself in the vice and degeneracy, but then it wears you down, you get clean and, if you’re lucky, your rental agent grants you parole at the 18-month mark.
Then you’re out of there, minus a good portion of your bond, but with a good dose of PTSD.
I’ve lived in the Valley for much of the past eight years, and I get it.
The first four years were at FV by Peppers, on the corner of Brunswick Street and St Pauls Terrace, and I definitely saw things I wouldn’t tell my mother about (although dear old mum, bless her, once picked me up and was delighted to spot a former colleague walking along Brunswick Street … before he stepped into The Den sex shop). A good number of my neighbours were sex workers and cashed-up drug dealers.
There were parties and lock-ins at local restaurants, and noise complaints and visits from security.
On a typical Friday walk home along Brunswick Street, you’d step over passed-out punters and fist-bump the occasional security guard before escaping into the elevator to your apartment.
It was fun, and sometimes funny, but frequently exhausting, and when I moved out in 2021, like many others, I thought I was making good my escape.
I did, but not really. These days, I live on Wandoo Street, still in the Valley but a vastly different part. And it underlines how this is very much a suburb of two halves.
There’s the club-driven grunge and grit of Brunswick Street and its surrounds, and then there’s the perfectly manicured glamour of James Street, the area in which I live. And yet, the two, within easy walking distance, co-exist happily enough.
That’s in part because despite its careful curation, James Street is, in many ways, just as real as the suburb’s less-salubrious elements. The restaurants here – Essa, Hellenika, Bianca – are the real deal, and its collection of boutiques is one of the best in the country.
Someone once said to me: “Imagine being in London in the middle of winter and seeing a picture of The Calile? You’d be on the plane in no time.” James Street represents the city’s international future as we head towards the Olympics, and it’s one of the few places in Brisbane where drivers simply accept that pedestrians rule.
Planners and designers in Sydney and Melbourne study places like James Street – this planned precinct in a city that got good at executing them after it knocked down so much heritage.
But that’s the other thing I love about this end of the Valley – it does have heritage and history. You just need to know where to look. There are the converted war-era Nissen huts on Arthur Street that now house Italian diner Mosconi and, until recently, King Arthur Cafe, and the old air-raid shelters near the corner of Wickham and East streets.
The suburb played a significant role in World War II, particularly after General Douglas MacArthur – allied commander of the south-west Pacific theatre – moved his headquarters to Brisbane in 1942. It was the home of the US 5th Air Force service command, an ordnance and enlistment depot, and an air freight depot.
The history goes back further, of course – thousands of years in the case of the Indigenous Turrbal and Jagera people. The suburb was named by Scottish migrants who arrived in Moreton Bay on the 608-tonne SS Fortitude in 1849.
Initially farmland, Fortitude Valley’s growth was turbocharged by the arrival of the train line in 1890, and the subsequent retail rivalry between Thomas Beirne and his former manager, James McWhirter.
Its resistance to floods helped the Valley remain Brisbane’s primary retail district right up until the rise of suburban shopping centres in the 1970s. Then came a decline.
Related Article
If the blocks around James Street are known for their wartime history, the areas up the hill towards Brunswick Street and the guts of Wickham Terrace still have echoes of the “Moonlight State” of the Bjelke-Petersen years, when police corruption was rampant.
Les Bubbles, a steakhouse, was once Bubbles Bath-House, the illegal casino and massage parlour at the centre of the Fitzgerald Inquiry; the infamous Hot Lips strip club sat on the corner of Brunswick Street and St Pauls Terrace; and in 2017, then-Queensland attorney-general Yvette D’Ath announced the government would reopen the coronial inquest into the 1973 firebombing of the Whiskey Au Go Go nightclub, which killed 15 people.
There’s a sense the Valley has never quite reckoned with those dark days, even as gentrification of the streets surrounding Brunswick, Alfred and Constance threaten to flatten much of the past entirely.
As a journalist, you like to be somewhere that’s in a state of flux or transformation – that’s where the stories are, and that’s Brisbane right now.
Fortitude Valley continues to play a key part in that transformation. And as you sit and watch the apartment blocks rising around you – this city slowly being rewired to go up instead of out – you can’t see that changing any time soon.

USF, SOF, and DIU Attack Russian Tamanneftegaz Oil Terminal

Unmanned systems forces, in coordination with Special Operations Forces and Defense Intelligence, conducted an attack on the Russian Tamanneftegaz oil and petroleum products export terminal in Krasnodar Krai.
The 1st Separate Center of the USF reported this news.
According to the report, a series of explosions were recorded during the strike on the night of February 15. The extent of the damage is still being assessed. Local authorities confirmed the strike on the morning of the same day.
Official sources said one of the tanks containing oil products caught fire. Russian authorities claimed the fire was caused by falling debris rather than a direct hit.
Krasnodar Krai Governor Veniamin Kondratyev said that, in addition to the tanks, storage facilities, and elements of the terminal infrastructure were damaged.
Tamanneftegaz is one of Russia’s key export terminals, located near the port of Taman. The facility handles the transshipment of oil, petroleum products, and liquefied hydrocarbon gases from tank farms for onward shipment by sea.
The terminal is a critical component of Russia’s oil export infrastructure and also supports the logistical capabilities of the Russian Black Sea Fleet.
Its proximity to the Crimean Bridge and temporarily occupied Crimea further underscores its importance for the logistical support of Russian forces in the Black Sea.
Available data indicate the terminal’s design capacity is around 19.9 million tons of oil and petroleum products per year.
The facility’s tank farm, used to store oil products and liquefied gas, has a total capacity exceeding 1 million cubic meters.
This is not the first attack on the facility. On January 21, four oil storage tanks caught fire following a prior strike.
Two months earlier, on the night of December 21-22, 2025, the port of Taman was also hit by drones.

As high-speed rail plans gather pace, Britain's HS2 offers hard lessons

As high-speed rail plans gather pace, Britain's HS2 offers hard lessons
Take a flight out of London heading west, and you may just catch a glimpse of a massive construction site snaking its way through the otherwise green English countryside.
That is what one day will become the UK's first fully domestic high-speed rail line, known in Britain as HS2.
But with federal and state governments in Australia reviving long-talked about plans for fast rail networks of their own, the British project comes with some lessons.
Construction of HS2 officially began in 2019, but years later the project is mired in delays, cost overruns and planning failures on multiple fronts.
Experts say many of those challenges present important takeaways for Australian governments — issues they must address if they want to prevent their mega-projects going off the rails.
Where will HS2 go?
HS2's route has been one of the knottiest aspects.
The high-speed line was initially approved to run from London's Euston station, via the UK's second-largest city, Birmingham, before branching into the northern English cities of Manchester and Leeds.
The project was developed in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, with politicians hopeful that it would aid an economic recovery.
However, austerity measures implemented in subsequent years made HS2 increasingly difficult to justify, particularly after construction began in 2019, and the COVID-19 pandemic ushered in elevated inflation.
What was initially proposed as a cut-and-dried £37.5 billion ($72 billion) scheme in 2009 was, by some estimates in 2020, expected to cost £100 billion.
Opposition gathered a head of steam.
First, the Leeds leg was axed in 2021. Then the route to Manchester was binned last year.
Experts say that's already reduced, if not eliminated, the actual benefits of the line, when set against the standard rail lines already operating.
"[The economic benefits] won't nearly be as great as if the line had gone all the way," Chris Nash, a British transport expert, says.
"It never looked to stack up, being built just London to Birmingham."
Sally Gimson, who has written a book about the project's failings, is equally critical of the line's shortening, stating that the original plans were supposed to "free up capacity on the west coast line for freight" between Birmingham and Manchester, two of the UK's largest industrial centres outside of London.
"It's crazy to end it in the West Midlands."
Now, the UK government is talking about building a separate high-speed line between Birmingham and Manchester, which may only become a reality in 20 years' time.
Left at the station
Even more frustrating for planners is that scaling back the project means the new Birmingham station is something of a white elephant. It is overly complex, with too many platforms that will ultimately serve only trains to London.
It doesn't end there.
While Birmingham's station is too big, London's terminus does not yet exist.
"There hasn't been any work done in Euston since 2023," Ms Gimson says.
UK PM Sir Keir Starmer's government, which inherited the project when it came to office in 2024, still has not announced how the Euston station will be funded, what it will look like, and when it will open.
All the while, HS2's overall cost is rising, souring the public's appetite for large infrastructure projects.
Why the cost?
Ms Gimson says the project's hefty price tag is rooted in a lack of flexibility from the outset.
"So the trains had to go faster than any other train in the world, the signalling had to be more sophisticated than any other signalling in the world," she says.
"We put lots of bells and whistles on it, so that also then made it more expensive."
That's an argument rejected by one of the project's chief architects, Lord Andrew Adonis, who, in 2023 as the project was being cut back, argued that the cost difference between conventional and high-speed rail was only 10 per cent.
Among other issues, Lord Adonis blames "excessive planning requirements", a lack of expertise in the UK government, and NIMBYism, referring to "not in my back yard" locals along the route who demanded expensive changes to the project.
Costs were further exacerbated by supply chain problems after the country officially left the EU, and HS2 also cites the inflation surge since COVID as a factor.
In response to questions from the ABC, a spokesperson for HS2 says even the project's chief executive acknowledges "the overall delivery of HS2 has been unacceptable" and needed resetting.
"Target costs were optimistic and the design was immature when we started construction," the spokesperson says.
"HS2 Ltd was not properly set up for delivery success and has suffered from high turnover in leadership positions, lacked capability in key areas and has been passive in the face of challenges, failing to learn lessons."
What are Australia's plans?
High-speed rail in Australia has long been discussed but has been slow to proceed.
Among the ideas discussed are linking Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane to compete with one of the world's busiest aviation corridors.
In November last year, a business case for building a high-speed rail link between Sydney and Newcastle was supported by Infrastructure Australia, the federal body responsible for assessing the viability of major projects.
But ultimate approval sits with the federal government.
A spokesperson for the High Speed Rail Authority told the ABC the delivery of other projects was "taken on board and learned from" when designing the business case for the Sydney-Newcastle link.
"Recognising that high-speed rail will be new to Australia, as part of our business case process, we have taken a 'tried and tested approach' to mitigate risk," the spokesperson said.
"This includes getting feedback on the approach taken and lessons learnt from established high-speed rail networks internationally and those under delivery, including HS2."
What lessons does HS2 hold for Australia?
Lord Adonis believes that, despite the cost, High Speed 2 will "be greeted … as a transport miracle" and, at least he hopes, will eventually be upgraded again so that it may one day reach Leeds and Manchester.
For Sally Gimson, the UK's experience has a clear lesson: meddling and tinkering with rail projects once shovels are in the ground ends in disaster.
"It should be a national project," she says.
"It has to be agreed with government, with governments into the future."
"[With HS2] there was real disagreement about whether to do it or not … it was never national project."
Professor Nash agrees, saying Australian governments should decide on a plan, "stick to it and not keep changing it".
Further, he warns that rushing to complete an entire project in one go could end up disastrously, preferring a staged approach instead.
"Maintaining flexibility by building a part but building it in such a way that is useful, and then carrying on if everything looks favourable, does make sense," he says.
But he concedes that is more difficult when Australia's vast distances are factored in.
"Because [Australian] cities are so far apart with not all that much between them, it's difficult to find a way of phasing it so you're building something useful even if the line never gets right to the other end."

Why experts say this preventable child disease hit a 35-year record high

Whooping cough cases hit record high after 'potentially catastrophic' vaccine rate drop
In short:
The number of whooping cough cases rose in 2024–25 to the highest level recorded in Australia in 35 years, a Productivity Commission report has revealed.
More than 57,000 cases were identified in 2024, including 37,663 that affected infants and children aged up to 14.
What's next?
Infectious disease experts say a continuing decline in childhood immunisation rates could risk an increased circulation of preventable diseases.
A "potentially catastrophic" decline in Australia's childhood vaccination rates has contributed to the sharpest increase in cases of whooping cough in 35 years, infectious disease experts say.
Rates of whooping cough, a highly contagious respiratory disease also known as pertussis, rose to almost 800 cases per 100,000 Australian children in 2024–25, according to a recent Productivity Commission report.
The average rate was 183.5 per 100,000 children for the pre-pandemic years, from 2015–16 to 2018–19.
The Australian Centre for Disease Control's surveillance system showed 57,257 whooping cough cases were confirmed in 2024, with 37,663 of those cases involving infants and children aged up to 14.
That spike marked the highest yearly number of cases since 1991, when cases of whooping cough were first recorded.
Almost 26,000 of the cases were detected in NSW and more than 15,000 in Queensland.
Another 25,272 notifications of whooping cough were then confirmed by authorities in 2025.
Whooping cough is a potentially fatal infection caused by the bacterium bordetella pertussis and can lead to severe coughing fits that can linger for months, according to Australia's Centre for Disease Control.
Common symptoms often include a runny nose, sneezing and a mild dry cough within the first week of illness. After two weeks, the infection can worsen and lead to long episodes of heavy coughing.
Archana Koirala, a paediatrician and infectious diseases specialist from the National Centre for Immunisation Research and Surveillance, said COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns and social distancing rules were a factor in the 2024–25 spike.
"The bacteria is spread similarly to how viruses are spread, and so if you restrict people from coming into contact with each other, the bacteria is restricted in its spread as well," she said.
"Immunised children didn't get exposed to that usual kind of circulation … and so they didn't get that immune boost.
"We saw a decline in coverage across Australia, and so what happens is that [among] those who are vaccinated, their immunity waned … and a proportion didn't get their vaccines in time.
"That's like a perfect storm for an outbreak."
In Australia, routine childhood immunisations are administered from birth until the age of four to protect against diseases such as hepatitis B, diphtheria, pertussis, polio, rotavirus, measles, meningococcal and influenza.
Paul Griffin, the director of infectious diseases at Mater Health Services, agreed.
"The unfortunate reality is that when vaccination rates decline, population susceptibility and therefore risk goes up, and these things will increase," he said.
"If we don't do something about it, we're going to start seeing a whole host of these things that really should be much better controlled than they are at the moment, and that includes basically all vaccine-preventable diseases.
"It is potentially catastrophic."
In September last year, 91.54 per cent of children aged one, 89.57 per cent of two-year-olds and 93.17 per cent of five-year-olds were vaccinated for preventable diseases, according to quarterly data released by the federal health department.
All three age groups fell short of the national target of 95 per cent.
The data showed it was the lowest national coverage rate for one-year-olds since 2014, the lowest for two-year-olds since 2015 and the lowest for five-year-olds since 2016.
"Even a slight decline in vaccination can have a big impact on population immunity and case numbers and burden of disease," Dr Griffin said.
"We know [whooping cough] is a devastating infection, particularly in those most vulnerable, and we need to make sure we don't continue to see this trend into the future."
Dr Koirala said the childhood vaccination rate decline also coincided with an increase in the number of measles cases.
The Australian Centre for Disease Control reported 181 cases were confirmed in 2025 — up from 57 in the previous year.
About 30 cases have been detected this year.
If the vaccination rates did not rebound, Australia could face a potentially disastrous re-emergence "of diseases that we have almost eliminated", such as endemic measles, she said.
Australia was among the first four nations globally to eliminate the constant local transmission of measles in 2014, according to the World Health Organization.
"We're really worried because measles is a very infectious virus and we know that when the coverage gets below 95 per cent in the population, that's when large outbreaks have occurred," she said.
"We'll see a measles death, we'll see a whooping cough death … and if vaccine hesitancy increases, we'll have more circulation of the bacteria."
Vaccine advocate flags dangers of social media
Catherine Hughes, the co-founder of the Immunisation Foundation of Australia, lost her son Riley in 2015.
He died from whooping cough at just 32 days of age.
She said watching Australia's childhood vaccination rates continue to decline "makes your heart sink".
"You think back to that time when you watched your baby in hospital get worse and worse and sicker and sicker and ultimately not survive. It's such a simple, easy way to prevent it," she told the ABC's Radio National Breakfast.
"To know that these rates are the worst that they've been in 10 years for childhood immunisation, it's not great news.
"I worry that this trend will continue."
Loading...Ms Hughes became a vocal immunisation advocate after Riley's death, saying she was concerned about the rise in misinformation and "anti-vaccine propaganda" that continued to proliferate on social media.
"A couple of years ago, a lot of the social media companies would use fact checkers and it did help mitigate to a certain degree some of the anti-vaccine propaganda that we see, but that has been dropped in the last 12 to 18 months," she said.
"At the end of the day, all it really does is serve as a reminder to me of why it's important that we continue to speak out … about the importance of vaccination."
Dr Griffin believes it is now "far easier to be misinformed than to be informed" about vaccination safety in Australia.
"We need to be more proactive in getting good information out there," he said.
"Make sure people know where the good sources of information are; empower our frontline workers in this regard — our pharmacists and our GPs — with good information and the time and resources to be able to spend time with patients … to be able to make sure that everyone gets the right information."

The team of four that make up Expedition 74 set off on Friday morning at 5.15 am, from Cape Canaveral. They are Jessica Meir and Jack Hathaway from the US, Andrey Fedyaev, a Russian Cosmonaut, and Sophie Adenot, becoming the second female astronaut from France, after Claudie Haignerer 3 decades ago.
The ISS is considered the most expensive human made engineering project in history, a total cost over it's lifetime around 150 to 160 billion, and since the year for 25 years it has been continuously occupied by humans, living, working in a set of capsules in a football field sized space, pushing the boundaries of science in space.

Trump tells Hamas to proceed with 'Full and Immediate' disarmament
US President Donald Trump on Sunday urged Hamas to move forward with disarmament under his plan for postwar Gaza, and said members of his so-called "Board of Peace" had pledged $5 billion to the Palestinian territory's reconstruction.
"Very importantly, Hamas must uphold its commitment to Full and Immediate Demilitarization", Trump said in a post on his Truth Social platform, ahead of a 19 February meeting of the board in Washington.
Disarmament is a key part in the second phase of the US-brokered ceasefire plan sealed in October between Israel and the Palestinian group to end the war triggered by the Hamas-led attack in October 2023.
The United Nations endorsed the plan in November.
The second phase stipulates that Israeli forces gradually withdraw from Gaza and Hamas should disarm, with an international stabilization force deployed to ensure security.
Hamas has repeatedly said that disarmament is a red line, although it has indicated it could consider handing over its weapons to a future Palestinian governing authority.
Both sides accuse each other daily of ceasefire violations.
Although originally intended to oversee Gaza's rebuilding, the charter for the "Board of Peace" does not seem to limit its role to the Palestinian territory.
"The Board of Peace has unlimited potential", Trump said Sunday in his post.
After an initial meeting on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos last month, the board is due to meet Thursday in the US capital.
Countries have been asked to pay $1 billion for permanent membership of the board, and the invitation for Russian President Vladimir Putin, whose country invaded Ukraine in 2022, has drawn criticism.
Key US allies including France and Britain have expressed doubts.
Trump said the $5 billion in pledges by member states would be formally announced then, and that members also "have committed thousands of personnel to the International Stabilization Force and Local Police to maintain Security and Peace for Gazans".
Trump has said the organization will work "in conjunction" with the United Nations.
"The Board of Peace will prove to be the most consequential International Body in History", he said.
Under the ceasefire plan, a Palestinian technocratic committee has also been set up with a goal of taking over governance in the battered Gaza Strip.

Iran says pursuing nuclear deal with US for mutual economic benefits

Iran is seeking a nuclear agreement with the United States that would generate economic benefits for both countries, an Iranian diplomat said Sunday, ahead of a new round of negotiations between Tehran and Washington.
Iran and the U.S. renewed negotiations earlier this month to tackle their decades-long dispute over Tehran's nuclear programme and avert a new military confrontation.
The U.S. has dispatched a second aircraft carrier to the region and is preparing for the possibility of a sustained military campaign if the talks do not succeed, U.S. officials have told Reuters.
U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, speaking at a news conference in Bratislava, said President Donald Trump had made it clear that he would prefer diplomacy and a negotiated settlement, while making clear that may not happen.
"No one's ever been able to do a successful deal with Iran but we're going to try," Rubio said.
Iran has threatened to strike U.S. bases in the Middle East if it is attacked by U.S. forces but on Sunday took a conciliatory line.
"For the sake of an agreement's durability, it is essential that the U.S. also benefits in areas with high and quick economic returns," foreign ministry deputy director for economic diplomacy Hamid Ghanbari said, according to the semi-official Fars news agency.
"Common interests in the oil and gas fields, joint fields, mining investments, and even aircraft purchases are included in the negotiations," Ghanbari said, arguing that the 2015 nuclear pact with world powers had not secured U.S. economic interests.
In 2018, Trump withdrew the U.S. from the pact that had eased sanctions on Iran in exchange for curbs on its nuclear programme, and re-applied tough economic sanctions on Tehran.
On Friday, a source told Reuters that a U.S. delegation including envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner would meet Iranian officials in Geneva on Tuesday, a meeting later confirmed to Reuters by a senior Iranian official on Sunday.
"Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner will be traveling, I think they are traveling right now, to have important meetings and we'll see how that turns out," Rubio said, without providing further details.
While talks leading to the 2015 nuclear pact were multilateral, the current negotiations are confined to Iran and the United States, with Oman acting as mediator.
Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi left Tehran for Geneva to take part in the indirect nuclear talks with the U.S. and meet the head of the UçNç nuclear watchdog, the IAEA, and others, his ministry said.
Deputy Foreign Minister Majid Takht-Ravanchi signaled Iran's readiness to compromise on its nuclear program in return for sanctions relief, telling the BBC on Sunday that the ball was "in America's court to prove that they want to do a deal."
The senior official referred to the Iranian atomic chief's statement on Monday that the country could agree to dilute its most highly enriched uranium in exchange for the lifting of sanctions as an example of Iran's flexibility.
However, he reiterated that Tehran would not accept zero uranium enrichment, a key sticking point in past negotiations, with Washington viewing enrichment inside Iran as a potential pathway to nuclear weapons. Iran denies seeking such weapons.
In June, the U.S. joined Israel in a series of air strikes that targeted Iranian nuclear sites.
The U.S. is also stepping up economic pressure on Iran. At a White House meeting earlier this week, Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu agreed that the U.S. would work to reduce Iran's oil exports to China, Axios reported on Saturday.
China accounts for more than 80% of Iran's oil exports so any reduction in that trade would significantly lower Iran's oil revenue.

AI got personal last week, and it's more complicated than we think

analysis
Artificial intelligence got personal for me last week. It also became clear how quickly it's developing now and that it is more complicated than we thought.
A week ago, someone sent me a link to an online article describing a flaming confrontation between me and the CEO of the Commonwealth Bank, Matt Comyn, on the set of 7.30.
The story was 2,000 words long, very detailed, and had pictures of Comyn and me arguing in front of 7.30 host Sarah Ferguson, before Matt throws away his microphone and storms off.
Not a word nor a photo of it was true. It was an AI fake. I won't link to it because it would draw more attention to it. The article was convincing, and many people have since written to me asking whether it is true.
Then that night, a bloke named Matt Shumer, who co-founded an AI company in New York City, published a 4,800-word essay headed "Something Big is Happening", which has since gone viral.
In it, Shumer talks about two AI releases the previous week that came within minutes of each other.
He wrote: "… on February 5th, two major AI labs released new models on the same day: GPT-5.3 Codex from OpenAI, and Opus 4.6 from Anthropic (the makers of Claude, one of the main competitors to ChatGPT). And something clicked. Not like a light switch … more like the moment you realise the water has been rising around you and is now at your chest".
He went on to say, "I am no longer needed for the actual technical work of my job. I describe what I want built, in plain English, and it just … appears."
Mind you, cars have been doing this for a while. I got a call last week from someone at Tesla offering to show me his autonomous car. He says he tells it to drive to the airport and it does — he doesn't touch the steering wheel, the brake, or the accelerator for the entire trip. In Australia, it's against the law to sit in the back seat reading a book, but that is allowed in a few American cities, and driverless taxis are now doing 450,000 trips per week.
AI wake-up call
It's been a big week for wake-up calls.
On Tuesday, Mrinank Sharma, the head of safeguard research at Anthropic (the company that developed Claude AI), resigned, posting a letter on X: "The world is in peril. Not just from AI, or bioweapons, but from a whole series of interconnected crises unfolding in this very moment.
"We appear to be approaching a threshold where our wisdom must grow in equal measure to our ability to affect the world, lest we face the consequences. Moreover, throughout my time here, I've repeatedly seen how hard it is to let our values govern our actions."
He says he's going off to study poetry and devote himself to the practice of "courageous speech".
On Wednesday, I had coffee with a young man, 27, who decided a couple of years ago to start a business training people in how to use AI. It didn't work because he quickly realised there is no point teaching people to use something that is simply going to replace them. Instead, he's building an AI agent that will replace receptionists by answering the phone and dealing with customers' queries so they don't know it's not human. At this stage, he says, it will tell customers they're talking to an AI.
The AI will have all the company's data and be able to tell customers whatever they want to know.
On Wednesday night, our time, Jimmy Ba, one of the co-founders of Elon Musk's xAI that developed Grok AI, also resigned. He posted this: "We are heading to an age of 100x productivity with the right tools. Recursive self-improvement loops likely go live in the next 12mo. It's time to recalibrate my gradient on the big picture. 2026 is gonna be insane and likely the busiest (and most consequential) year for the future of our species."
On Thursday, the head of AI at Microsoft, and one of the founders of Google's DeepMind, Mustafa Suleyman, told the Financial Times: "White-collar work, where you're sitting down at a computer, either being a lawyer or an accountant or a project manager or a marketing person — most of those tasks will be fully automated by an AI within the next 12 to 18 months."
How will investors respond?
It's now dawning on the world, including investors for the first time, that artificial intelligence is moving well ahead of any plans to deal with its consequences.
The near-simultaneous release of GPT-5.3 Codex by OpenAI, and Opus 4.6 by Anthropic was one of two events in early February that brought "AI fear" (as analysts call it) to the share market.
The first, on February 3, was Anthropic's release of plug-ins for Claude Cowork that will allow it to automate professional work, starting but not ending with the back-office work done in law firms.
Software firms and data like Salesforce, Thompson Reuters and Adobe saw their shares drop sharply, and in Australia, software companies like Technology One, Xero and Wisetech did likewise.
Last weekend, a Chinese lab called OpenBMB released an AI agent called MiniCPM-o 4.5, which is open-source and has 9 billion parameters.
It runs on local devices, like laptops and smartphones, and doesn't need data centres, so suddenly there are question marks around the massive investment in them.
I asked Google's Gemini AI how that compares with its own parameters. It replied that it "likely" has more than a trillion parameters and remarked: "Comparing a model like MiniCPM-o 4.5 to a flagship like Gemini 3 Flash is a bit like comparing an agile, high-performance sports car to a massive, hyper-efficient logistics network. They both get the job done, but their "engines" are built very differently."
Oh right.
LoadingThe fourth industrial revolution is here
As I lay awake at the end of the week staring at the ceiling in the dark, I realised that my earlier frames of reference for AI and what's being called the fourth industrial revolution are suddenly inadequate.
I had been thinking about AI as both a return to labour that is owned — a part of capital — rather than employed, about two centuries after the abolition of human slavery, and simultaneously as a collapse in the price of intelligence.
The price of intelligence is falling towards zero in the same way that the price of communication fell with the invention of packet switching and TCP/IP. That is, the internet.
Those two aspects of AI explain why every company in the world is rushing to use it: costs will fall, and productivity will surge. As a result, so will profits and every corporate executive is required to increase profits.
Moreover, company owners and their boards are motivated to shift production from labour to capital wherever possible because capital is where wealth is created, while employed labour drains it.
But what's happening is far more profound, even than the issues of cost and ownership, as profound as they are.
We are building — or perhaps have already built — an alien intelligence that thinks at least one thousand times faster than any human, knows every bit of knowledge that every human has ever known, is evolving a million times faster than human evolution and will end up vastly outnumbering humans.
Calling it another industrial revolution seems insufficient.

Conflicts, UN reform dominate close of water-themed AU summit
Leaders call for ceasefires across the continent, particularly in Sudan, and renew demands for UN Security Council reform as mounting crises overshadow development priorities
ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia
African leaders wrapped up a two-day summit on Sunday with urgent calls to end conflicts across the continent and renewed demands for reform of the UN Security Council, as mounting security crises overshadowed the gathering’s stated agenda of water issues.
Burundi’s President Evariste Ndayishimiye, the newly elected African Union (AU) chair, said restoring stability remains the bloc’s foremost priority.
“We need to silence the guns. We need peace on this continent. We need stability on this continent, and we have a program for that,” he told a closing press briefing.
AU Commission Chair Mahmoud Ali Youssouf said the leaders also stressed the link between development and stability, warning that access to basic services remains critical for long-term peace.
“Without equitable access to water and sanitation, we cannot talk of public health or inclusive development or sustainable prosperity for our people,” he said.
In a separate press briefing, AU Peace and Security Commissioner Bankole Adeoye described the situation in Sudan as “the worst humanitarian crisis globally” and said the conflict, which began in April 2023, remains “virtually unreported” despite its scale and impact on regional stability.
Taking questions on Sudan, he told reporters: “Our number one goal is a permanent, unconditional, inclusive, immediate ceasefire.”
He also reiterated Africa’s long-standing position on global governance reform, saying the UN Security Council must better reflect contemporary realities.
“The UN Security Council must reflect the world of today,” Adeoye said.
Adeoye added that AU leaders reaffirmed their policy of “zero tolerance” for unconstitutional changes of government.
Although the summit was officially convened under a theme focused on water security and sanitation, the issue received less attention in its final hours as leaders concentrated on urgent peace and security challenges across the continent.

Why a packet of Arnott's Shapes could help determine the 'case of the century'

ACCC takes Coles to court over 'illusory' discounts in 'case of the century'
Thousands of customers throw a box of Arnott's Shapes into their shopping trollies each week — one of a dozen purchases that could help decide a bombshell case playing out in the federal court from today.
The ACCC has accused Coles of ripping off customers with fake discounts. And if the supermarket giant loses, it could face a huge fine and massive reputational damage.
Customers could also receive cash back from a class action lawsuit that might follow, and corporations could be forced to change how they price their products — especially discounts.
But if Coles successfully defends itself, the blowback for the ACCC will be significant, with implications for an upcoming, almost identical, lawsuit against Woolworths.
"The stakes are enormous," former consumer watchdog boss Allan Fels said.
"The ACCC will certainly be feeling nervous, as would Coles.
"It's the case of the century because it affects not only Coles and Woolies, but millions of businesses who discount [and their customers]."
Coles accused of 'illusory' Down Down discounts
The court will look at the prices Coles charged for 245 common household products, ranging from paper towels to dog food and yoghurt, under its prominent "Down Down" promotions.
The ACCC alleges Coles misled shoppers in stores and online because the products were sold at one regular price for at least six months before being jacked up for a short period and then slashed as part of a "Down Down" promotion.
ACCC chair Gina Cass-Gottlieb said the discounts — which ran between February 2022 and May 2023 — were fake or "illusory".
Shoppers thought they were getting a bargain, but they were paying either the same amount as or more than the product's regular price, the ACCC claims.
Twelve representative products have been chosen to save the court time and avoid examining hundreds of items.
For example, the regular price for a box of Strepsils was $5.50. This price remained on the product for more than 640 days before being increased to $7 for 28 days, then reduced during a "Down Down" promotion.
The sales ticket customers saw for Strepsils showed a "Down Down" price of $6.00 and a "was" price of $7; however, that was 9 per cent higher than the regular price of $5.50.
Professor Fels said the period of time Coles increased prices before discounting them would be crucial.
"If those price drops had been preceded by big price rises, then the court may well conclude it was misleading and deceptive," he said.
The ACCC said the case was partly prompted by social media users alerting it to the pricing practices.
One of those social accounts belonged to Paniora Nukunuku, who posts tongue-in-cheek videos on TikTok questioning supermarket prices.
One post showed Mr Nukunuku comparing the cost of tinned corned beef at Coles to Aldi.
"Corned beef is not a luxury food," he says.
"No-one should be having to feel like they have to choose between the basics."
Coles told the ABC Mr Nukunuku was "not comparing like-for-like items" and was "comparing a house brand product with a proprietary product".
Meanwhile, consumer group Choice said members had expressed growing concern about the way supermarkets advertised discounts.
"We've all experienced feeling bombarded by just the sheer number of colourful tags," director of campaigns, Andy Kelly, said.
"There's some important contextual information being left off."
In 2023, Choice called out Coles for increasing the price on a product it had promised to have "locked" for a fixed period.
In response, Coles refunded customers for price increases on 20 items.
How Coles plans to strike back
Coles is fighting back, rejecting the central allegation that the "Down Down" discounts were "illusory".
It claims the price rises were justified due to inflation hammering suppliers and a surge in global commodity prices, as well as in packaging, freight, utilities, and international shipping.
Australia experienced a 30-year high in inflation when the alleged misconduct occurred, peaking at 8.4 per cent in December 2022.
In 243 of 255 instances, Coles says suppliers requested a higher shelf price or changes to promotional funding.
Coles also defended raising prices for up to six weeks before cutting them to the "Down Down" price.
It was "a genuine discount from that shelf price", the company said.
The supermarket chain said the original price was no longer relevant to the discount because it had been "superseded" due to increasing costs.
Another former ACCC boss, Graeme Samuel, said the court may probe what Coles intended when it briefly raised prices before discounting them, and whether that was justified by suppliers requesting increases and later seeking the price dropped to entice customers back to their product.
The court has granted Coles the right to keep certain information confidential, including an expert report and key witness affidavits.
Coles said the material was mainly related to "commercially sensitive information" that it did not want competitors to see.
Senior executives and board members will not be giving evidence.
What's at stake?
If it loses, Coles faces a substantial fine.
By comparison, Volkswagen copped a $125 million fine for misleading consumers over diesel emissions while Qantas coughed up $100 million for selling tickets to flights it already cancelled.
Professor Fels said he would not be surprised if Coles was forced to pay even more if the allegations were proven.
"If Coles loses, the penalties will be in the hundreds of millions of dollars," he predicted.
Mr Samuel agreed that any loss would result in a substantial penalty.
"Frankly, they deserve to have the book thrown at them."
Mr Nukunuku said he would be watching closely.
"A lot of people would feel validated on the cost-of-living experience," he said.
The outcome of the case will also have immediate implications for what is known as "Was, Now" retail pricing.
"Such a shake-up would bring a benefit to consumers because they'll be better informed about what they are buying and will lead to sharper competition," Professor Fels said.
However, if the ACCC loses, there will be "serious consequences" for the watchdog, including difficult questions about whether it was overly influenced by the political firestorm around price gouging.
"There will be suggestions, accusations that they instituted these proceedings because of the political pressure that was around at the time to blame Coles and Woolworths," Mr Samuel said.
What about supermarket 'price gouging'?
No matter what the court decides, it will not offer a verdict on so-called price gouging.
Coles reported a net profit of $1.08 billion last financial year and is the second biggest supermarket chain with more than 840 stores.
Together with Woolworths, it has almost two-thirds of the market cornered.
An ACCC inquiry dodged the question about whether the supermarkets charged excessive prices or had unreasonable margins, only saying the big two players had little incentive to compete on price.
Coles rejected this, saying "competition is very much alive in the grocery sector".
But in a major change, the federal government has banned "excessive pricing of groceries" from July 1.
The ban prohibits large retailers from charging prices that exceed the cost of supply plus a reasonable margin.
The consumer watchdog has flagged that the ban would likely result in it taking further court action against the supermarkets.

Bangladesh invites top diplomats of S.Asian nations for government swearing-in ceremony
297 newly elected lawmakers, Cabinet members set to be sworn in Tuesday in front of parliament building
DHAKA, Bangladesh
Bangladesh has invited top diplomats of South Asian nations for a new government ceremony in the capital Dhaka after new lawmakers were elected in last week's general elections, officials announced Sunday.
The newly elected lawmakers and Cabinet members will be sworn in on Tuesday, ushering in the first new parliament following the 2024 uprising that ended Sheikh Hasina’s 15-year rule.
Chief Election Commissioner AMM Nasir Uddin will swear in new lawmakers, and the president will do the same for the new Cabinet.
In line with tradition, guests, among them the foreign ministers of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) members -- including Afghanistan, Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and others -- have been invited to the swearing-in to be held in front of the parliament building.
The Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), which secured a two-thirds majority in Thursday's election with 209 seats in the 300-seat parliament, will form the government with party leader Tarique Rahman to become prime minister.
In Thursday's election, the BNP got 49.97% of the vote while the Jamaat-e-Islami party-led alliance Jamaat got 31.76%, according to the country's election commission.
Jamaat ally the National Citizen Party (NCP), the youth group that led the 2024 uprising, got 3.5% of the vote.
Jamaat seeks recount for 32 seats, announces protests
After securing 77 seats, the Jamaat alliance accepted the results overall but claimed some irregularities in the process.
Jamaat said Sunday that they are seeking a recount in 32 constituencies over alleged irregularities and counting manipulation.
Assistant Secretary General Hamidur Rahman Azad told reporters that they saw irregularities during the voting, adding: “There is a demand for revaluation in 32 seats. We will follow the legal process.”
He also announced protests for Monday, saying: “We will take the oaths of office, go to parliament, and play a constructive role. At the same time, the streets will also be open for us.”
More than 127.6 million people in Bangladesh were eligible to cast ballots, and the country saw a voter turnout of 59.44%, up from 41.8% in the January 2024 elections.
Results in three seats were held up or suspended, two due to court orders and one due to the death of a candidate.
The commission also published the results of the Thursday referendum on constitutional reforms, with votes in its favor exceeding 60%.
In a rare political gesture, Rahman visited Jamaat Ameer chief Shafiqur Rahman at his residence in Dhaka on Sunday. Some top leaders from the both parties were present and discussed issues, including post-election developments.
Rahman is scheduled to hold another such visit to NCP chief Nahid Islam, a key figure of the 2024 upspring, at his Dhaka residence.

Kansas woman jailed for falsely accusing estranged astronaut spouse of committing a crime while on the ISS
Summer Heather Worden, the estranged spouse of NASA astronaut Anne McClain, was sentenced to three months in prison
- Bookmark
A Kansas woman has been sentenced to jail time after prosecutors said she falsely accused her estranged spouse, NASA astronaut Anne McClain, of committing a crime while on the International Space Station.
Summer Heather Worden, a former Air Force intelligence officer, was sentenced Thursday to three months in federal prison and two years of supervised release, according to the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Texas. The 51-year-old was also ordered to pay $210,000 in restitution.
This comes after Worden pleaded guilty to lying to law enforcement in November.
The case stems from allegations Worden made against McClain in July 2019. The court heard evidence that Worden “falsely accused her former spouse of illegally accessing her bank account from the International Space Station while the couple was going through a divorce,” according to the U.S. Attorney’s Office.
Investigators learned Worden “opened her bank account in April 2018, and both parties accessed it until January 2019, when Worden changed the account credentials,” the agency said. They also said Worden gave her wife access to her bank records and login credentials as early as 2015.
“Even after an internal investigation exonerated the former spouse, Worden continued promoting the false claim to news outlets and hired a media consultant to amplify the claim. The evidence further showed Worden publicly released her former spouse’s personal information,” the U.S. Attorney’s Office said.
Worden was allowed to remain out on bond until her sentencing hearing. She’s now expected to “voluntarily surrender to a Federal Bureau of Prisons facility to be determined in the near future,” prosecutors said.
McClain, 46, has maintained that she had permission to access Worden’s accounts, The New York Times reports.
In November, the NASA astronaut said Worden “presented a story to federal investigators and to the media with the intention of harm,” according to the Times.
“From the outset, there was no evidence supporting her claims, and overwhelming evidence disproving them. As I continue my public service, I remain committed to the values that have defined my career and which held up under the closest scrutiny,” she added.
McClain joined NASA in 2013. During her first spaceflight, she spent more than 200 days as a flight engineer and completed two spacewalks.
Most recently, she commanded NASA’s SpaceX Crew-10 mission, which launched in March 2025. McClain served as a flight engineer for 146 days and completed a nearly six-hour spacewalk during that mission.
The Independent has contacted Worden’s attorney and McClain for comment.

Malian forces 'neutralize' about dozen terrorists in central region, army says
Operation carried out between Bambara-Maoude and Inadjatafane in Douentza
ISTANBUL
Malian forces "neutralized" around a dozen terrorists Sunday during an operation between Bambara-Maoude and Inadjatafane in the Douentza region, the army said in a statement.
The statement did not identify the groups targeted.
“No effort will be spared by the FAMa to ensure the protection and free movement of people and their property,” the army said, referring to the Malian Armed Forces by its French acronym.
Mali has faced persistent insecurity for more than a decade, particularly in its central and northern regions, where armed groups linked to militant organizations and local conflicts have carried out attacks against security forces and civilians.
The army regularly announces counterterrorism operations as it seeks to reassert control over territory and curb the activities of armed groups, especially in areas near key population centers and along the Niger River corridor.

The Liberal Party's right wing is divided and One Nation isn't the only reason

Liberal Party divided over future direction as Angus Taylor plots right-wing political shift
In short:
Senior sources have told Four Corners that the Liberal Party is discussing an immigration approach inspired by a controversial UK Labour policy.
It is part of a broader realignment taking place in right-wing politics in Australia amid the rise of populism overseas.
Liberal MPs are divided over whether to overhaul the party's direction or maintain tradition to win back voters who have abandoned them.
Internal machinations in the right wing of the Liberal Party are threatening to divide the party further after a tumultuous start to the political year that culminated in a change of leadership.
New leader Angus Taylor is seeking to unify the party that has already divorced its Coalition partner this year, and his elevation to the top job all but confirms the Liberals will shift further to the right in a bid to counter One Nation's surging popularity.
A tougher immigration policy is central to his vision as opposition leader, with him declaring on Friday "the door must be shut" to people who don't align with "Australian values".
The party is yet to announce any policies, but senior sources have told Four Corners that the Liberal Party is actively discussing a controversial approach to immigration inspired by a recent UK Labour policy.
Late last year, following a new hardline immigration approach, UK Labour announced it would deny visas to three African nations unless their governments cooperated with the UK's efforts to return their citizens whose visas had been cancelled.
By February, all three had capitulated and assisted the UK in returning their citizens.
Under the policy being considered by the Liberals, if a country refused to take back its citizens who had been rejected by Australia, then Australia would blacklist that country — or potentially a zone within it — and ban its citizens from getting a visa.
This could include areas like parts of the Philippines, which have in the past been hotbeds of terrorism.
The proposed policy, which Mr Taylor is understood to be considering, is part of a broader radical realignment taking place in right-wing politics in Australia.
But the shift is controversial within the already divided Liberal Party and goes beyond a battle between moderates and conservatives, who are at odds about how to win back voters who have abandoned the party.
There is a deeper rift in the conservative wing between those who believe the party should emulate the populist strategy of Donald Trump and the UK's Nigel Farage, or stick to the economic tradition of John Howard and Peter Costello.
With its right wing now in control, behind the scenes, the Liberal Party is embroiled in a contest between those who want to overhaul their party's direction and those who believe doing so would mean political death.
United right?
After claiming victory in Friday's leadership spill, Mr Taylor declared the party "must look ahead and put the disagreements of the recent past behind us".
But his elevation to leader suggests the party will shift further to the right on cultural issues and immigration, which threatens to further divide the party.
Mr Taylor represents a group of Liberal MPs who believe that the traditional approach to economics is the way to win back voters in the centre.
On the other side is an Andrew Hastie-led group, which is pushing for a more populist, "Australia First" approach that focuses on reducing immigration and investing in local manufacturing.
Last year, Mr Hastie's group succeeded in dumping net zero climate emissions from the party's policy platforms. His next campaign was immigration, which he linked to higher house prices, and it quickly became one of the party's top priorities.
Despite Mr Hastie's withdrawal from the leadership race in January, the broader rupture over the party's future direction has not been silenced. He and his fellow populists were instrumental in installing Mr Taylor as leader and are likely to be rewarded with frontbench roles.
Victorian Liberal senator James Paterson, a key powerbroker in the conservative wing who swung his support behind Mr Taylor, said the change in leadership was about securing the party's traditional supporters.
"The nine months since the election have taken us to new lows, and that's due to a variety of factors, but it's very clear that a big chunk of people who used to have faith and trust in the Liberal Party have walked away from us," he told Four Corners.
"The first and most important task in politics is to lock down your base … our first task is to earn back the trust and support of the people who used to vote for us, who are now exploring other options."
Senator Paterson, however, conceded that tensions exist within the party's conservative wing over the way forward.
"Of course. There should be, right? We've just suffered our worst ever election defeat and then plunged even further in our public support since," he said.
"Our traditional supporters are telling us they don't recognise what we stand for and they think we're divided, so of course, you would expect that there would be a debate. There has to be a debate."
But the conservative forces pulling the party are not just internal.
Searching for the 'centre right'
The rise of One Nation has rattled the Coalition and motivated members of the Liberal and National parties to take a harder line on immigration and the economy, in an effort to avoid losing votes to the right-wing party.
That tougher stance was on display in Mr Taylor's first public appearance as opposition leader on Friday, with his vision for immigration and economic issues shared by his populist Liberal colleagues.
Senator Paterson denied that the party was shifting to the right to appeal to voters moving to One Nation.
"It's not really about left or right per se, but it is about demonstrating to our more conservative supporters that on issues like Australia's culture and national identity on our symbols, on questions of values, that we are the traditional centre right political party that they recognise," he said.
"They want to see us stand up for things like the flag and the anthem and the constitution and Australia Day and our Anzac tradition because they see in us, or they hope to see in us, a patriotic Australian party."
That approach, however, is not without issue amongst more moderate members of the Liberal Party.
South Australian Liberal senator Andrew McLachlan is concerned about the dangers of a hardline approach to immigration, particularly in the wake of the Bondi terror attack, when language used by some politicians to describe Muslims has sharpened.
"I think it's extremely unhelpful. For those of us that have longstanding relationships with the Muslim community, we need to give them reassurance they're not being singled out," he told Four Corners.
"I'm a veteran of Afghanistan. I have very strong ties to the Afghan community. They're devastated post-Bondi. They're Australians. They've come here to escape radicalisation."
Charlotte Mortlock has long been dedicated to the Liberal Party. In addition to being a member, she founded Hilma's Network, a group dedicated to getting more Liberal women elected.
On Sunday, Ms Mortlock announced she had quit the Liberal Party and would step down from her role as executive director at Hilma's "due to recent events".
She believes the populists are trying to appeal to the fringe to attract votes and it won't work.
"One of the biggest things that I think is a problem is that we have politicians who have been completely algorithmed," she told Four Corners.
"We've always had the pub test, but people are replacing that with their social media feed, and they are thinking that the world is a place that it is not, and they are living in an alternative reality.
"The huge concern there is that they're creating public policy for that virtual reality.
There are people in Australian politics on both the far left and the far right. They speak with such a conviction that they are so certain that they have the finger on the pulse. They have their finger on their social media algorithm."
Campaign problems
Supercharging the algorithm is conservative lobby group Advance, which is flooding social media with a fierce anti-immigration campaign and promoting a nostalgic vision of a whiter Australia.
Advance launched in 2018, but it's only in the last few years that its donations have skyrocketed — from $5 million in 2022-23 to more than $13 million last year.
That's more than double the donations to left-wing activist group GetUp! and on par with the Business Council of Australia.
The latest donations to political parties also showed that $895,000 was donated to Advance last year by Hancock Prospecting, the company of billionaire mining figure Gina Rinehart, who is a supporter of Pauline Hanson and One Nation.
Advance has made clear that Mr Hastie is one of their preferred Liberals by promoting him in its social media videos, and Liberal MPs have told Four Corners about the impact the group is having on the Liberal party room by pushing right-wing agendas and campaigning against moderate Liberals.
Four Corners has confirmed that senior Liberal strategists are concerned that Advance is cannibalising the donations that would come their way, while it's being promoted by Liberals like Jacinta Nampijinpa Price, who has been advertised as a prominent speaker at Advance's blockbuster conference later this month.
There's also internal anger that Advance has attacked Liberals it sees as having moderate views, including Sussan Ley, Andrew Bragg and Tim Wilson, particularly given it has received a $500,000 donation from a Liberal Party-linked fund, the Cormack Foundation.
Moderate Liberal frontbencher Mr Wilson said the donation was wrong.
"I don't think any people should give any money to any organisation that campaigns against Liberal MPs unless their objective is to see Labor, teal or Greens MPs elected,"he said.
"So I would dissuade anybody from doing that. I don't see that it serves any purpose."
Advance declined to be interviewed by Four Corners, but in a statement said: "In our experience, people who run down Advance in the media always have an agenda of their own.
"Advance does not support any political party, but will always encourage politicians whose values and ideas align with our supporters and criticise those who don't."
Divided direction
Former Liberal Party strategist Tony Barry helped shape the party's direction, and is now watching from the sidelines as a pollster.
"At the moment, the Liberal Party is a man drowning, and so their future is entirely dependent on shaping an economic narrative that appeals to those Liberal-coded voters out there to grow their primary vote," he told Four Corners.
"The danger for the Liberal Party is if it moves to the fringes, it'll start getting fringe political results.
"There's simply no pathway back to government without winning some of those teal seats."
Trying to reclaim inner-city seats at future elections will be more difficult if the Coalition considers working with One Nation to form government — a suggestion firmly rejected by James Paterson.
"We're not looking for any more dance partners," he said.
"As you might have seen over the last nine months, we've had enough challenges managing our existing dance partner. I don't think we need a third one."
Results from recent polls suggest One Nation's messaging is working, but how many votes it will attract on issues such as a harsh line on immigration is the existential question now facing the Liberal Party.
"I think the real debate is between those who think that we're just a little bit off, and those who think we're a long way off," Queensland Liberal MP Garth Hamilton said.
"I think we've been a long way off for a little while now, and I think that's the real source of tension here.
"Do we just keep on kind of refining where we've been and making small changes, or are there some significant departures to how we've been working that we need to do?"
While One Nation's rise in polling is still untested at an election, Tony Barry is confident the Liberal Party can turn its fortunes around.
"The Liberal Party needs an enema, but I think its future can be secured, but only if it pivots that economic narrative and differentiates from Labor with some bold policies," he said.
"The pathway back for the Liberal Party is not to keep shadowing One Nation with those policy agenda settings, but to offer some economic hope.
"That might be in the form of income tax cuts, addressing some of the structural problems in the economy to show that there is hope for the future.
"At the moment, they're just creating and chasing noise."

Australia wants to make international hunting harder for shooters like Darren. He says it won't work

Watch The Feed's Short Documentary on Australia's Trophy Hunters
This article contains images of animals that may upset readers.
In a trophy room just outside Goulburn in regional NSW, glassy eyes watch from every direction. Antlers stretch toward the ceiling and the air smells of chemicals used to preserve dead things and the dust that inevitably settles over years of collecting.
Floor to ceiling, the walls are covered in taxidermy: some heads, some full bodies. Couches have skins thrown over them and coffee tables are decked with tusks.
Darren Plumb gestures toward mounted animals and says that almost everything in the room, he’s hunted.
Mountain zebras from South Africa, black bear from Canada, brown hyena from Namibia, Himalayan tahr, jackal, steenbok, oryx, kudu,and caracal.
"In excess of ninety," he says. Plumb, who is now a board member in NSW for the Shooters, Fishers and Farmers Party, has been hunting since he was five. Soon he’ll be 60.
"Some people run a marathon to get a medal," he says.
These are what he refers to as his medals — markers of achievement for someone who grew up in a small town of about 2,700 people, and went on to see rural corners of the world many travellers never reach.
"It can be said that it's hours of nothing and then 30 seconds of a total adrenaline rush," Plumb says.
"It's the camaraderie. It's not actually the killing of an animal, it's the getting out there, just trying to see if you could outwit an animal on their terms."
When asked how much he’s spent, he laughs. "I tried to add that up one night and stopped. It was just phenomenal."
At least $100,000, he offers.
He points out some of the more recognisable animals in the room.
"Warthog," he says, gesturing. "They’re cute because they’re ugly."
He says Disney has stacked the deck of public sympathy, turning some animals into familiar, likeable characters and leaving others without that glow.
For hunters, he says, that means the public respond with emotion, not context.
The fight over Australia’s hunting trophies
For years, Australians have boarded flights bound for Africa, North America and beyond to hunt giraffes, zebras, black bears, polar bears and more, and bring their remains home.
They call them trophies, but even among hunters, that word can feel uncomfortable.
At the federal election last May, the animal welfare organisation Humane World for Animals (HWFA), helped secure political support for a wider ban on trophy-hunting imports. Several independents, including David Pocock, as well as the Greens and the Labor Party, signalled they were in favour.
In a statement to The Feed, the federal government said: "The Albanese Government supports this initiative, with work being undertaken by the Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water to progress it."
The proposed ban, if accepted as is, would be Australia’s toughest crackdown yet, blocking the 20 most popular hunting trophies from entering the country in a bid to deter people from travelling to hunt them.
Over the past decade, Australians have imported — or applied to import — more than 1,000 hunting trophies from 46 different mammal species protected under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), including 299 American black bears, 147 Hartmann’s mountain zebras, 47 hippos, 17 polar bears and 16 giraffes.
On the list are many of the animals that line Darren Plumb’s walls.
Some, like the red lechwe, a species of antelope, are recognised as near threatened by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Others, like the American black bear — Australia’s number one imported hunting trophy — are classified as least concern, with growing populations.
Nicola Beynon, head of campaigns for HWFA, has been one of the leading voices behind the push for change.
"Trophy hunting has no social licence in this century. It's a practice that I think most people wish was left behind in the last century," she says.
While US hunters import the majority of global trophies, Australia is among the top 10 trophy-importing nations in the world, according to HWFA estimates.
In 2024, Botswana’s then President Mokgweetsi Masisi hit back at Germany after officials proposed tighter restrictions on elephant trophy imports, offering to send 20,000 elephants to Germany and asking how Germany could have an opinion when Botswana had rebounded elephant numbers to the largest population in the world.
Namibia’s former environment and tourism minister, Pohamba Shifeta, has similarly warned that blanket import bans could harm conservation and rural livelihoods, arguing that without alternatives to replace hunting revenue, "both our people and wildlife will suffer".
But despite pushback, Beynon says Australia has a right to back a prohibition.
"We've already prohibited the trophies of elephants, lions and rhinos, and there's all sorts of contrabands that we say we don't want in this country."
Putting a price on a head
Hunters such as Plumb see it differently. They argue that if people understood how the system actually works, the reaction might be less visceral.
"The keyboard warriors," he says, "have most likely never set foot in the countries where those animals are taken".
"If you take Africa, for example, the local communities look after their animals because they know there’s going to be someone like me that’s going to come over and shoot a zebra," he said. "I’m going to pay $1,000 to shoot that zebra."
To Plumb, the logic is simple: giving wildlife an economic value creates an incentive to protect it. He describes it as a cycle that feeds both community and funds conservation — and it's the common argument made by hunters.
He says trophy hunters only target old, solitary animals.
"So you're really looking for an older animal," Plumb says. "They either die of old age or, in my case, hopefully I shoot them, I do the taxidermy and put them on the wall and then I can look at them for the rest of my life."
He says meat rarely goes to waste, and hunts are regulated with government-issued permits.
"Meat and protein goes back to the communities," he says. "In Africa it’s all used. In North America and Canada, the meat by law has to be taken and used, it can’t be left on the mountain."
'Interfering with natural selection'
Nicola Beynon says that in practice, the idea that only specific animals are targeted is a fallacy.
"Hunters are going for the animals that have some of the most impressive physical traits," she says.
"You’re removing the strongest, healthiest animals, weakening the gene pool and the resilience of their populations … you’re interfering with survival of the fittest."
She also questions how hunts are carried out.
"These are tourists, they're not always skilled hunters," Beynon says.
"They can use hunting weapons that are cruel, like bows and arrows, which aren’t very good at getting a quick kill."
The exception, not the rule
In a reserve near Cape Town, South African freelance journalist Adam Cruise watches giraffes wander past, unbothered by the sound of a nearby vehicle.
Cruise broke the story of Cecil the lion — the research-tagged animal killed in 2015 after being lured out of Hwange National Park in Zimbabwe.
The well-known male lion was killed by an American trophy hunter. Zimbabwean authorities said the lion had been shot with a bow and arrow and then tracked for hours before being killed with a rifle.
The global backlash helped trigger Australia’s move to restrict lion trophy imports.
"It was really nice to see those giraffe just ambling slowly past and not being skittish. On a trophy hunting ranch you would see they would run away straight away at the sound of a vehicle," he says.
Cruise has spent years examining the claims made by hunters and industry bodies and says the argument that trophy hunting benefits local communities frustrates him.
He calls it patronising and a convenient excuse to hunt.
He points to the practice of distributing meat, particularly elephant meat, to communities already dealing with human–wildlife conflict and describes it as an insult.
"I mean, it's like it's, you're in a zoo and the zookeeper comes along and tosses a piece of meat into your cage. That doesn't help people at all. It doesn't stave off hunger because it's once in a while."
"In 50 years of trophy hunting, these communities remain as poor as ever."

Follow the money
Independent research, including peer-reviewed studies in major conservation journals, shows that in many African countries, only a small share of trophy-hunting revenue reaches the communities living alongside wildlife.
Studies by Economists at Large and research published in journals including Biological Conservation tell a similar story: in many places, much of the money leaks out to foreign-owned operators, quotas are weakly managed, and the benefits end up concentrated among a small local elite — meaning many communities see little direct gain.
"Most of that money is going back to the trophy hunting company, which is also often foreign-owned. When they are employing locals, they're employing very few of them and on very low wages," Beynon says.
But there are exceptions hunters often point to — and researchers agree they’re real, just not the norm.
Namibia: A rare success story
Namibia’s community conservancy model is widely cited as the most successful version of trophy hunting in Africa.
There, communities co-manage land and receive guaranteed revenue-sharing from hunts. A study published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America shows this model has supported anti-poaching patrols, habitat protection, and local salaries.
Researchers emphasise, however, that the model succeeds because locals have real decision-making power and strict governance structures, not because trophy hunting inherently produces conservation outcomes.
In Pakistan, animal numbers surged
In Pakistan’s northern regions, trophy hunting of markhor, or screw-horned goat, and Himalayan ibex operates under a CITES — approved community management program.
In these regions, 80 per cent of trophy fees go directly to local communities, with the remaining 20 per cent returning to government conservation programs, according to Pakistan’s Wildlife Department and United Nations Development Programme reporting.
Multiple studies published in conservation journals and CITES case reviews show that markhor populations rebounded significantly in areas where communities controlled revenue and protected habitat.
In 2024, it was widely reported that a permit to hunt a flare-horned markhor sold for roughly US$180,000 ($270,000), the highest amount ever paid for the species.
‘It’s neocolonial’
Robbie Kroger, a South African Australian American hunter and content creator, runs an organisation with a mission to rebrand hunting’s image. He’s furious about Australia’s proposed ban.
"Australia through this ban is acting like a colonialist, actually a neocolonist".
"I cannot defend a rich, fat white person sitting behind an animal," he says. "I can defend this picture of us with all the schoolchildren that we just fed", showing a picture on his phone of himself and three other men standing with a group of schoolchildren.
Kroger doesn’t pretend the model is perfect. But he says hunting keeps land from being cleared for agriculture and in his view, that makes it a trade-off worth taking.
"Forget everything else. If we’re protecting habitat in Africa alone, for example, hunting protects 1.5 million square kilometres of habitat," he told The Feed from Memphis.
"Wouldn’t you want to use every tool we have?"
And he says in some remote areas, it’s the best viable option for generating income.
Kroger pulls out a photo of a local man he calls Peter, who lives in rural Zimbabwe. He says there isn’t a tourism lodge within 100km of Peter. Where tourists won’t go, hunters will.
"He will tell you that hunting elephants has changed his life from a protein perspective," Kroger says.
For Kroger, cruelty happens in nature anyway, so why not get paid for it?
"Mother nature, she’s a cruel, violent bitch. She’ll bring disease, she’ll bring starvation … Are you either going to get someone to pay you to do it or are you going to pay to do it?"
"It simply comes down that they hate the idea of hunting."
'Agriculture in disguise'
Cruise argues that while some species numbers have increased, the context matters.
"A lot of hunting people say our numbers of species are actually going up," he says.
"And that is true, but you’ve just got to look at the nature of what these species are. They’re not wild, they’re ranched."
He describes many hunting ranches as "agriculture in disguise".
"It falls under the agricultural ministry. It is not under the environmental ministry and the profits are agricultural. So admit it as such."
On many trophy properties, Cruise says target species are effectively farmed — artificially fed and selectively bred for larger horns or whiter pelts.
"It’s kind of like cattle ranching where the target species that hunters like to shoot are overstocked on small patches of fenced land," he says. "It’s not really the protection of nature or biodiversity."
A line in the sand
Plumb says that from his own trips, he’s seen the benefits firsthand — and that even if the system has flaws, he believes he’s contributed to something positive.
But he also acknowledges past mistakes, including "taking an immature animal" or "a long time ago, probably climbed over a fence I shouldn’t have".
On one point, Plumb and Beynon agree: a ban like this won’t stop people from travelling overseas to hunt if they really want to. Some within the hunting community told The Feed that Australians had hunted a lion just months ago and plan to bring back a sculpture instead.
"There won’t be any real-world effect," he says. "If a person wants to go to Africa and has the money to shoot a lion, they’ll shoot a lion."
But for Beynon, Cruise, and others pushing for change, that’s beside the point. For them, the ban is about where Australia chooses to draw the line.

Former Georgian Ejder 6×6 APCs Found in Syria

Former Georgian Ejder 6×6 armored personnel carriers (APCs), purchased from Turkey in 2009, have been spotted in service with Syria’s new army.
B-AREV published the photo on his page on the social media platform X.
The vehicles have been repainted in a sand-colored camouflage, replacing the distinctive Georgian tricolor scheme.
In the summer of 2025, APCs were recorded being transported in their original Georgian colors, though at the time, there was no clear confirmation that they were destined for Syria.
Confirmation came in December 2025, when the vehicles were publicly displayed during a parade in Damascus. The number of APCs transferred to Syria has not been disclosed.
Unlike other members of the Ejder family, the Ejder 6×6 did not achieve broad export success. Georgia was the only foreign customer, purchasing a total of 72 vehicles.
It is possible that Turkey repurchased some of the APCs as a relatively quick and low-cost way to equip Syria’s new army. It is also possible that Tbilisi received preferential terms or priority access to modern Turkish weapons in return.
During service in Georgia, the APCs were reported to suffer from limited engine power.
For the Georgian military, this was a significant drawback, as the vehicles’ performance declined in mountainous terrain and their cross-country mobility was limited under difficult conditions.
The relatively high ground clearance also resulted in a higher center of gravity, which affected stability. In some cases, vehicles overturned while cornering at speed or operating on rough terrain.
The Ejder 6×6 TTZA (Taktik Tekerlekli Zırhlı Araç — tactical wheeled armored vehicle) has a combat weight of about 18 tonnes, a maximum road speed of up to 110 km/h, and a range of approximately 800 km. Only the first and second axles are steerable.
The hull is made of hardened steel, providing all-round protection against small-arms fire and artillery fragments. Additional armor can be fitted to increase ballistic protection, although this option was not implemented on the Georgian vehicles.
A V-shaped hull bottom is designed to improve crew survivability, accommodating a crew of two and up to 10 troops, with protection against mines and improvised explosive devices.
The vehicle is also equipped with two rear-mounted water jets, allowing it to cross water obstacles at speeds of up to 9 km/h.
The Ejder 6×6 can be fitted with a remotely operated weapon station armed with either a 7.62 mm or 12.7 mm machine gun, as well as a 40 mm automatic grenade launcher. The Georgian Armed Forces operated the version equipped with the grenade launcher.
The platform can also accommodate other remotely operated turret systems with weapons of up to 90 mm caliber, expanding its potential combat roles.

Trump sanctions chief John Hurley poised to leave after friction with Bessent
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
WASHINGTON – Mr John Hurley, the Trump administration’s top sanctions official, is set to leave his post after friction with US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, according to people familiar with the matter.
Mr Hurley’s expected departure as Treasury’s undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence follows months of internal tension over the tactics and targets of US sanctions policy, said the people, who requested anonymity to discuss private deliberations.
His future remains unclear, with officials floating Mr Hurley for several ambassadorial roles, in an effort to keep a loyal and valued ally within the fold, the people said.
A senior administration official said that Mr Hurley is in talks with the White House for an ambassadorship and that Mr Hurley and Mr Bessent continue to have a great working relationship at Treasury.
His exit would mark the latest shakeup in senior ranks at the Treasury Department.
Mr Bessent’s first chief of staff, Dan Katz, left in the fall and his successor, Michael Friedman, left as well, according to some of the people. Mr Bessent’s top deputy stepped down in August, while the key post of undersecretary of international affairs remains unfilled.
Overall, the level of turnover has raised questions among current and former officials about stability inside one of the government’s most market-sensitive agencies.
The changes come as US sanctions toward resource-rich nations including Venezuela, Iran and Russia play an increasingly pivotal role for international investors, global energy flows and geopolitical risk.
In recent weeks, Treasury has been at the centre of the Trump administration’s push to roll back many restrictions on the Venezuelan oil industry
Mr Hurley has overseen Treasury’s TFI unit, a sprawling apparatus of roughly 1,000 employees that has become one of Washington’s key foreign policy tools. Over the past decade, the job has evolved into a front-line position shaping everything from oil exports to access to the dollar-based financial system.
A former hedge fund executive with ties to the late investing legend Julian Robertson, Mr Hurley was confirmed by the US Senate in July 2025 and emerged as a forceful advocate of assertive economic pressure.
Colleagues have described him as disciplined and analytical, with a strong belief in the role that sanctions can play in projecting American power abroad.
But tensions within Treasury have grown in recent months over how sanctions authorities get deployed, particularly as some of President Donald Trump’s top advisers pursued designations against political opponents, including foreign judicial officials and international institutions, several of the people said.
Some career staff raised concerns privately about reputational and diplomatic fallout, while others argued the measures were consistent with the administration’s broader strategic posture.
Unease within the agency has also grown as the US braces for its mutual evaluation report from the Paris-based Financial Action Task Force, where international assessors are expected to flag concerns over the recent scaling back of key anti-money laundering and countering terrorist financing measures, some of the people said.

Tunisian police detain opposition figure Olfa Hamdi at airport
Tunisian police detained opposition figure Olfa Hamdi as she arrived at the country’s main airport on Sunday, local media reported, in the latest move against a critic of President Kais Saied.
Hamdi, leader of the Third Republic party, was detained shortly after disembarking from a flight, the reports said. She resides abroad and previously served as CEO of Tunisia's national carrier Tunisair.
Hamdi has repeatedly criticized Saied’s rule and called for the formation of a transitional government and early presidential elections.
Opposition figures described the arrest as part of a wider crackdown on dissent, as Tunisia grapples with deepening polarization since Saied assumed sweeping powers in 2021, a move critics have denounced as a coup.
Authorities made no immediate comment on the arrest. Reuters has been unable to contact Hamdi's lawyer or any of her relatives.
In early February, police arrested a member of parliament known for mocking the president, in what opposition called an effort to stifle critic voices.
Many opposition leaders, along with activists and journalists, are behind bars, with critics accusing Saied of having turned Tunisia into a prison since 2021.
Saied rejects the accusations, insisting that he is not a dictator and that the law applies to everyone, regardless of their position.

The billion-dollar move crime boss made for Australia’s top illicit cigarette brand

The billion-dollar move crime boss made for Australia’s top illicit cigarette brand
Just before his 40th birthday, Kaz Hamad traded the shadows for a global corporation. Now, he exerts a white-knuckle grip over the illicit tobacco market from the production floor to shops that dare not sell anything else. This is the story of how he did it.
Kazem Hamad’s crime empire has taken a major stake in the Manchester tobacco company in Dubai, cementing his grip on the illicit cigarette market from production to sale in hundreds of suburban shops across Australia.
Manchester United Kingdom, despite being illegal to import or sell in Australia, has become the most popular tobacco brand in the country as organised crime syndicates flood the market with cut-price, untaxed cigarettes, fuelling Melbourne’s so-called ‘tobacco war’.
Hamad, who was deported to Iraq in mid-2023, has emerged as the most powerful gangland boss in Melbourne’s underworld after creating a ‘cartel’ that controls the illicit tobacco market after a two-year campaign of firebombings and shootings.
The Australian Federal Police believes Hamad’s reach extends well beyond Victoria, with the cartel operating across five states and one territory in Australia.
The 41-year-old was arrested by Iraqi authorities in mid-January following intelligence provided by the Australian government. His current status in Iraq is unknown beyond a mugshot provided to Australian authorities by their counterparts overseas.
Four sources in law enforcement, intelligence and the tobacco industry, speaking on the condition of anonymity to disclose confidential information, say Hamad has taken a significant financial stake in the foreign tobacco company, which is headquartered in London but operates out of a free port zone in the United Arab Emirates.
Hamad’s involvement in Manchester has allowed his transnational criminal syndicate to reap massive profits by exerting control over every part of the illicit market, from production to import smuggling to wholesale distribution to street-level retail.
Hamad’s dominance over the market in Australia is rigidly enforced through violence, including running an extortion racket over hundreds, if not thousands, of shops around the country that are forced to sell the Manchester brand.
The profits are estimated to be in the billions of dollars.
Hamad’s involvement in Manchester came after he forced the surrender of major rivals, the Haddara crime family, in early 2024, taking control of their distribution networks, retail shops and profit share in the brand.
Manchester’s business model sees the company produce billions of cigarettes in the emirate of Dubai, which are legally sold to exporters who ship them around the world. That is despite the brand failing to meet most countries’ packaging standards and its widespread use to evade tax.
The cigarettes are smuggled into Australia by criminal syndicates and then distributed to wholesalers and retail shops.
Commonly in drug trafficking networks — such as those handling cocaine — each link in the chain is controlled by a different criminal gang, often in different countries. This is because no single syndicate is strong enough to control the entire network.
Dr John Coyne, head of strategic policing and law enforcement at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, described Hamad’s arrangement as a “fully vertically integrated criminal enterprise”.
“Organised crime groups are looking for vertical integration because it gives you a surety of supply. It allows you to make maximum profits,” he said.
“It means being able to control parts of the supply chain that aren’t illegal. It’s illegal to bring the tobacco into Australia, but they can maximise their profits and coordination by taking control of the part of the supply chain where it’s legal to manufacture and export it.”
Federal and state law enforcement authorities have declined to comment on the record about Hamad’s involvement in the Manchester brand.
But sources say the connection between Manchester and organised crime syndicates in Australia is long-standing and has fuelled the explosion in the illicit tobacco market, years before Hamad seized control of the black market from the Middle East.
Quintessentially British?
Manchester United Kingdom is a British tobacco brand – on paper at least.
Its logo is a heraldic shield standing between two unicorns, the national animal of Scotland also featured in the UK’s royal coat of arms.
“Inspired by Manchester city, Britain’s metropolis and the ever-beating urban spot in London, Manchester cigarette brand took on, since its naissance, the city’s vibe, glam and charm,” the company’s promotional materials say.
The headquarters of “Manchester United Kingdom” is in the very heart of London’s West End, occupying a prime spot on historic Regent Street.
Manchester regularly shows up at tobacco trade fairs in the Middle East and the US, where its marquees look more like display cases for high-end jewellery than cigarettes.
But there are easily identifiable cracks in its cultivated image.
The flash address near The Langham hotel and high-end clothing shops are all for show.
Manchester United Kingdom, owned by J.S.S. Tobacco Ltd, is just one of hundreds of companies that “occupy” a suite in the building, a virtual office that has been described as a “scammers’ paradise” by the British media.
The suite has appeared as a registered “place of business” in multiple legal proceedings and document leaks related to tax-avoidance schemes.
Incorporation records show J.S.S. Tobacco Ltd has just one employee in Britain and its operation is so small it is not required to file financial paperwork, except a declaration that “the company confirms that its intended future activities are lawful”.
Manchester’s real home is the Jebel Ali Free Zone, on the outskirts of the city of Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates.
Jebel Ali is one of the busiest shipping ports in the world, serviced by a vast plain of factories and warehouses that enjoy special tax advantages, employment conditions and secrecy provisions governing their operations.
The UAE exports upwards of 100 billion cigarettes a year, making tobacco one of the country’s biggest non-oil exports.
The Jebel Ali Free Zone alone is home to more than 20 tobacco factories and has become a major transit point for illicit cigarettes smuggled into Australia, Europe and beyond, according to intelligence assessments and court records. The area accounts for 36 per cent of Dubai’s GDP.
The Terrorism, Transnational Crime and Corruption Centre at George Mason University in the US estimates the UAE is responsible for a quarter of the illicit cigarettes sold globally, making the country one of the biggest contributors to the black market.
This masthead does not suggest the Manchester brand or its agents are committing any crime. The cigarettes are manufactured legally and are a legal product when they are exported from Dubai.
Manchester brand cigarettes are made by at least three factories in Jebel Ali under licence from the ultimate corporate owner, Adam International FZCO.
Almost nothing is known about the operation of the company or its value, as the UAE does not mandate disclosure of anything but basic information about the more than 11,000 businesses operating inside the Jebel Ali Free Zone.
A corporate investigation report commissioned by this masthead only stated its primary business is the “trade of tobacco” and “financial information was not available”.
“The shareholder structure of Jebel Ali free zone companies in the United Arab Emirates is generally not recorded at the commercial register and is not publicly available,” the report said.
“The subject’s financial statements were not available in the course of our investigation and respondents contacted at the company were not prepared to release such documents.”
Behind this cloak of institutional secrecy, Manchester became a dominant brand in the illicit tobacco trade and forged deep connections to Australian organised crime.
Representatives for Manchester’s parent company in Dubai, Adam International FZCO, did not respond to requests for comment.
Long-time player
There have long been suspicions in law enforcement that Manchester had links to organised crime, going back almost to the brand’s founding.
United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime researcher Ted Leggett said that for a long time, the position of tobacco companies had been to export their product to wholesalers and wash their hands of whatever happened next.
“If the wholesaler diverts that traffic into illicit channels, that’s not their problem,” he said.
But in Manchester’s case, there is little recourse for the brand to separate itself from the illegal markets their products get funnelled into.
Despite being manufactured legally in Dubai, Manchester cigarettes without health warnings can’t be legally sold in any major market in the world because they do not comply with packaging and graphic warning requirements in almost every jurisdiction.
That includes the countries with transit ports for shipments bound for Australia, such as South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and Thailand, which debunks any possible claim that the cigarettes are being manufactured to be sold in those areas.
“When a producer produces cigarettes, the packaging that they’re in is unique to the country of destination,” Leggett said.
“Those packages without health warnings can’t be sold in any country which covers, I think I calculated, 97 per cent of the adult population of the world.”
But there has also been more direct intelligence.
As part of a sting operation in 2018, a well-known smuggler was caught boasting to undercover police operatives that he personally knew the owner of Manchester because he was the first person to ever import the brand illegally into Australia in 2009.
The smuggler, Ahmed Masri, and a covert police officer travelled to Jebel Ali to arrange for a container to be packed with 9.5 million Manchester cigarettes.
“[Masri] told [the officer] that his tobacco supplier in Dubai was ready and waiting for his order and could be trusted and relied upon 100 per cent,” according to court records.
This is just one of hundreds of containers packed with Manchester cigarettes that have flooded the Australian market over the past 15 years.
It is not known what market share Manchester now commands because Australia’s law enforcement and intelligence community was caught unprepared by the explosion in the market.
A freedom of information request has revealed the Australian Border Force has been unable to track the rise of Manchester.
“[ABF operations] have advised that brand names of illicit tobacco seizures are not recorded. Therefore, the department is unable to provide data on brand names of illicit tobacco seizures,” the agency reported.
What the Department of Home Affairs does track is the total number of cigarettes it has seized across all brands, including Manchester, Double Happiness, Mac, Esse and others.
In 2025, more than 2.5 billion cigarettes were intercepted at the border, up almost 500 per cent from 423 million ‘sticks’ five years ago.
Industry market intelligence says Manchester is now the top-selling cigarette – legal or illegal – in Australia.
Tobacco is now also the second most valuable illegal commodity after drugs, according to the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission.
“The billions of dollars of profit available continues to drive serious and organised crime involvement in illicit tobacco – now estimated to represent the majority share of Australia’s tobacco market,” a commission spokesperson said.
Before the rise of Hamad in mid-2023, the illicit market had been dominated in Victoria by the Haddara crime family, which built an empire of legitimate businesses in the hospitality, auto repair and entertainment industries off the back of illicit tobacco imports.
They also have extensive land and business holdings in Lebanon, sources say.
The Haddaras held a tight grip over the trade for more than a decade, arranging some of the largest importations of illegal cigarettes in Victoria at the time. For law enforcement trying to crack down on the market, the syndicate was the number one player.
Manchester shipping records, obtained by this masthead, show an influential member of the Haddara crime family organising shipments of nearly a quarter of a billion Manchester cigarettes from suppliers in the UAE in the first half of 2023.
In the hands of illicit retailers on the streets of Australia, that six-month supply alone would be worth more than $100 million.
Law enforcement sources say the Haddaras, who also have deep connections to organised crime in Lebanon and Dubai, parlayed this influence into a stake in the Manchester brand itself.
The Haddaras’ ability to influence the supply chain made it a major power in the attempted formation of an organised crime “commission” in early 2023 that would attempt to regulate control of the illicit market among a number of organised crime gangs and outlaw bikie clubs.
That ended in February 2024, following a relentless firebombing and shooting campaign allegedly waged by Hamad from his base in Iraq, where he ordered dozens of targeted attacks on Haddara-owned or linked tobacco shops and family businesses.
The speed of Hamad’s rise caught the Haddaras off guard. The crime family was soon backed into a corner and their network of close allies began to splinter.
The turning point was when patriarch Fadi Haddara, the subject of a $1 million murder contract, found GPS trackers attached to the undercarriage of his car.
Underworld sources at the time said the Haddaras paid $1 million to Hamad to be left in peace, and handed control of a vast network of business interests to their rivals.
That marked an end to the dominance of the Haddaras. However, some segments of the syndicates were co-opted into the new cartel created by Hamad, who continues to use their deep connections in international smuggling networks.
In July 2025, the member of the Haddara family who was orchestrating those mass exports in 2023 came together with members of the Hamad cartel in “meetings” in Lebanon that were also attended by the operator of a major Dubai-based cargo clearing company.
Images of the encounter show members of the Haddara family posing with Hamad’s associates outside a hillside property overlooking a valley. In other photographs, the group can then be seen sitting on a large wrap-around couch inside a room decorated with golden jugs and cups and old rifles, sharing plates of fruit and a hookah.
The same member of the Haddara clan had four months earlier met with the cargo clearing company operator in Dubai for dinner at a fancy restaurant overlooking the city’s skyline.
The blow to the original Melbourne-based Haddara syndicate is perhaps best encapsulated in a social media post by Fadi Haddara the month after the Dubai meeting, showing an image of actor Leonardo DiCaprio along with a quote.
“A year ago I would have died for certain people. A year later half of them are dead to me.”
Fadi Haddara did not respond to requests for comment when approached via his lawyer.

Push for Melbourne’s top science school to introduce gender quotas

Push for Melbourne’s top science school to introduce gender quotas
Two of Melbourne’s most sought-after state high schools will reach gender parity next year, marking the end of more than a decade of male-dominated enrolments.
The milestone has prompted calls for the state’s top specialist science school, where female representation has yet to return to its pre-pandemic high, to work harder to get more girls into its classrooms.
Selective entry Suzanne Cory High School and Nossal High School have been dominated by boys each year since 2014, a stubborn trend which saw the state government introduce a special measure in 2024 requiring both schools to enrol an equal number of girls and boys in year 9.
However, John Monash Science School which has recorded a decade-old gender imbalance is exempt from the measure.
Around 600 aspiring John Monash Science School students complete an assessment and interview each year in the hope of securing one of 200 prized year 10 places.
But the odds of securing a place is greater for boys with the proportion of girls enrolled at the Clayton school falling from 49 per cent in 2020 to 47 per cent last year, analysis by The Age shows.
Gender Equity Victoria chief executive Micaela Drieberg said for gender parity to be achieved and then maintained across academically selective schools, quotas should be part of the selection process.
“All students should have equal opportunities,” Drieberg said.
“A consistent policy that focuses on gender representation across all select entry schools would ensure the students of today have equal opportunities, as well as the students of tomorrow.”
Places at Suzanne Cory High School and Nossal High School, Melbourne’s only two co-educational selective entry schools, have persistently favoured boys but will achieve full gender balance next year when 2024’s year 9 intake reaches year 12.
John Monash Science School principal Andrew Chisholm said the 17-year-old school aimed for parity however the gender balance depended on applications.
He said John Monash Science School differed from Suzanne Cory High and Nossal High as it was a specialist selective entry school rather than a cross-discipline selective entry school.
“We’re really inclusive, and we want gender balance,” he said.
“But sometimes having more guidelines actually makes it worse because you’re taking away the freedom of the school and to choose the people who are most appropriate to be at a science school.”
Chisholm pointed out that of the 34 year 11 students joining the school this year, 21 were girls.
Drieberg acknowledged the specialist science school was close to parity but said a consistent policy was required to lift and then maintain an equal proportion of girls and boys in the classrooms.
“If we don’t have these things in place, and if we take our foot off the pedal, we can easily go backwards,” she said.
Co-chair of research and gender advocacy group The 100% Project Mark Morris said having gender equality policies in place signalled parity was taken seriously.
“Failure to work toward gender equality is an intentional act against gender equality,” he said.
“When it comes to gender equity, there shouldn’t be different acceptable standards for different schools.”
Suzanne Cory High School and Nossal High School have both recorded an increase in the proportion of girls enrolled since the policy took effect.
Of the 922 students at Suzanne Cory High School last year, 47 per cent were girls.
In 2023, the year the special measure was announced, 42 per cent of the student population were girls. That figure rose to 46 per cent when the policy took effect in 2024.
It’s a similar story at Nossal High School, where 46 per cent of the 825 students last year were girls, up from 43 per cent between 2022 and 2024.
“We know historically that quotas work,” Drieberg said.
However, Melbourne University professor of history and philosophy of science Cordelia Fine said benefits of gender parity policies didn’t automatically justify them.
“In the case of selective schools, there is a cost both to boys who would otherwise have been offered a place, and to girls who may be stigmatised as needing a lower bar to gain entry,” Fine said.
Melbourne molecular biologist Suzanne Cory, whose name adorns the Werribee school, is an advocate of having an equal number of boys and girls in the classrooms.
Cory, the first female president of the Australian Academy of Science, told The Age in November that all students would benefit from an academically selective system made up of an equal proportion of girls and boys.
Victorian Education Minister Ben Carroll said the state’s selective entry schools provided high-achieving students with an academically challenging and enriching secondary school experience.
“Balancing gender enrolment numbers in our select entry high schools provides every Victorian student an equal opportunity to study at one of these education providers,” he said.
More than 5700 students sat the selective entry school entrance exam last year.
Just 1000 places for this year’s year 9 intake across Nossal High School, Suzanne Cory High School, MacRobertson Girls’ High School and Melbourne High were up for grabs.

Israel will begin contentious West Bank land registration in new step to deepen control
The Israeli anti-settlement group Peace Now said the ‘dramatic’ move probably amounts to a ‘mega land grab’ from Palestinians
Israel will begin a contentious land regulation process in a large part of the occupied West Bank, which could result in Israel gaining control over wide swathes of the area for future development, according to a government decision on Sunday.
It paves the way for the resumption of “settlement of land title” processes, which had been frozen in the West Bank since the Middle East war in 1967. It means that when Israel begins the land registration process for a certain area, anyone with a claim to the land must submit documents proving ownership.
The Israeli anti-settlement group Peace Now said the process probably amounts to a “mega land grab” from Palestinians.
“This move is very dramatic and allows the state to gain control of almost all of Area C,” said Hagit Ofran, the director of Peace Now’s Settlement Watch programme. Area C refers to the 60 per cent of the West Bank that is under full Israeli military control, according to agreements reached in the 1990s with the Palestinians.
Israel’s Foreign Ministry in a statement claimed, without offering evidence, that the Palestinian Authority was “advancing illegal land registration procedures in Area C” and said Sunday’s decision was taken for greater transparency.

Ukraine preparing to sanction Russians who "put sport at service of war" – Zelenskyy
Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has reported that Kyiv is preparing a new sanctions package targeting Russians who "work for the war and put sport at the service of war".
Source: Zelenskyy in his evening address
Quote: "We are preparing a new sanctions package targeting Russian individuals who work for the war and put sport at the service of war.
The documents are already prepared; this Ukrainian sanctions package should be a signal to others around the world – a signal that one cannot simply turn a blind eye to support for aggression. When Ukrainians at the Olympics are forbidden to even mention the victims of Russian aggression, that is clearly a global rollback of justice.
We will restore justice. The sanctions decree will be issued soon."
Background:
- Ukrainian skeleton athlete Vladyslav Heraskevych was disqualified from the 2026 Winter Olympic Games over his "helmet of remembrance" featuring 20 Ukrainian athletes who were killed due to Russia's aggression.
- Zelenskyy awarded the Order of Freedom to Heraskevych.

A Chicago teenager, whose father was detained by immigration authorities while she navigated cancer, died on Friday, a family spokesperson said.
Ofelia Torres, a 16-year-old in Chicago, had been undergoing treatment for an aggressive and rare form of cancer since late 2024. As she and her family struggled with the medical procedures, her father, Ruben Torres Maldonado, was detained by immigration authorities while at a Home Depot in October, leading to a contentious and public case that highlighted the human effects of the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration crackdown.
The family challenged Torres Maldonado’s detention, saying he was instrumental to helping their family and caring for Ofelia’s four-year-old brother, Nathan. A judge later ruled in late October that Torres Maldonado’s arrest and detention was illegal. He was released from custody on 30 October.
Last year, the Trump administration launched Operation Midway Blitz, a surge in immigration enforcement arrests in Chicago, with officials from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), border patrol and other federal agencies descending on the city to drive up arrests.
Torres Maldonado was arrested by authorities and detained in an immigration jail amid the operation. Ofelia had been enjoying a temporary break from treatment for stage 4 alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma, a rare and aggressive form of cancer that develops in skeletal muscles, when her father was detained.
Delia Ramirez, a US representative opposing the Trump administration’s mass deportation agenda, said on social media that Ofelia, one of her constituents, was an inspiration.
“Even as Ofelia fought cancer, she also fought to bring her father home and ensured that he would no longer have to live in fear in the shadows,” Ramirez said. “She taught us what love, hope, and resolve look like. My condolences to her family and loved ones.”
Chicago’s mayor, Brandon Johnson, also expressed his condolences on social media, while criticizing the Trump administration’s operations in Chicago.
“Ofelia led a steadfast, dedicated and truly inspiring life,” Johnson said, adding that the Trump administration’s “indiscriminate, bigoted” mass deportation campaign, “which has upended the lives of hard-working families who came to Chicago, and other cities across the country, in search for a better life, must come to end”.
A public GoFundMe page highlighting the Torres family’s story in October included a video by Ofelia talking about her dad and the effect of his arrest.
“I find it so unfair that hardworking immigrant families are being targeted
because they were not born here,” Ofelia said in the video. The Torres family were able to secure resources to help with their situation. “Sadly, that’s not the case for all families.”
“That’s why I’m making this video: to spread awareness and remind the public that immigrants are humans with families and deserve to be treated with love and respect, just like anyone else,” Ofelia added.
The Torres family’s story led to widespread condemnation and backlash against the Trump administration for their crackdown targeting families. Ofelia’s family received legal assistance, filing and pushing for his release.
In response to the Chicago Tribune when the family’s story came to light, homeland security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin accused Ofelia’s father of “habitual driving offenses”. She called his legal case “nothing more than a desperate hail Mary attempt” to keep him in the US with his family.
Days before Ofelia died, a judge ruled that Torres Maldonado’s deportation would be blocked, due to the hardship it would bring his family, opening the door to a potential pathway to permanent residence and eventual citizenship.
“Ofelia was heroic and brave in the face of ICE’s detention and threatened
deportation of her father,” the family’s attorney said in a statement. “We mourn Ofelia’s passing, and we hope that she will serve as a model for us all for how to be courageous and to fight for what’s right to our last breaths.”
According to the Chicago Tribune, Ofelia completed a school project on the high cost of healthcare in the US. As a result, her teacher introduced her to an Illinois state representative.
“She is smart, funny, inquisitive, engaging. We just talked about state healthcare policy,” Illinois state representative Laura Faver Dias said at the time. “We talked about her fears, our shared fears about what happens to Medicaid for her and her family as she is navigating cancer.”

Winter Olympics recap: Brignone’s double gold after broken leg, Klaebo sets a medal record
Winter Olympics recap: Brignone’s double gold after broken leg, Klaebo sets a medal record
MILAN (AP) — Federica Brignone and Johannes Hoesflot Klaebo glided into history at the Winter Olympics on Sunday in very different ways.
Host nation Italy was delighted as Brignone’s sensational comeback continued with a second gold medal of the Olympics, still in pain after a badly broken leg last year.
Klaebo has the most gold medals of any Winter Olympian in history with nine after taking gold with Norway’s cross-country men’s relay team.
Brignone does it again
Winning one gold medal in super-G made Brignone feel like she was living in a movie.
What do great movies get? A sequel.
The Italian skier known as the Tiger was unbeatable in the giant slalom for her second gold of the Olympics and fifth career medal, breaking her own record as the oldest women’s Alpine skiing Olympic champion for good measure.
There were two silver medalists as Sara Hector and Thea Louise Stjernesund finished in exactly the same time and bowed to Brignone to mark her victory.
After breaking multiple bones in March, Brignone needed two surgeries and 42 stitches to put her leg back together. She only returned to skiing in January.
Mikaela Shiffrin of the United States was 11th and has now failed to win a medal in eight straight Olympic races since the Winter Games in 2018.
Record ninth gold medal for Norwegian skier
Klaebo stands alone as the most successful Winter Olympian of all time after winning his ninth career gold medal in cross-country skiing.
Norway’s prime minister was watching as Klaebo anchored his team’s relay gold Sunday. That broke a tie on eight gold medals with three other Norwegians: cross-country skiers Marit Bjoergen and Bjoern Daehlie and biathlete Ole Einar Bjoerndalen.
Klaebo could get into double figures by the end of the Milan Cortina Games. His next chances for a 10th gold are in the team sprint on Wednesday or the 50-kilometer race on Saturday. Also, he’s only 29.
More controversy rocks curling
The typically calm world of curling is being rocked by a controversy over double-touching, and it broadened Sunday as the British men’s team had a stone removed for the violation.
Until now the Canadian men’s and women’s teams had been in the focus of scrutiny. An expletive-laden outburst by Canada’s Marc Kennedy after an accusation of a double touch against Sweden on Friday highlighted the problem. A double touch is when a player touches a stone again after releasing it.
Another win for the moguls king
Mikael Kingsbury of Canada has won almost everything there is to win in moguls skiing. When they added a new Olympic event, he won that too.
Kingsbury took gold, his fifth career Olympic medal, in the inaugural dual moguls event Sunday, three days after settling for silver in the traditional moguls event in a surprise win for Australian Cooper Woods.
Dutch speedskater Jutta Leerdam won another medal but it was silver, not gold, as her teammate Femke Kok won the women’s 1,000 meters. Miho Takagi of Japan was third and defending champion Erin Jackson of the U.S. fifth.
Britain won its first snow-sport Olympic gold in history with a victory for Charlotte Bankes and Huw Nightingale in team snowboardcross. There was another British gold in team skeleton hours later.
Biathlon saw a first Olympic gold for Italy as Lisa Vittozzi won the women’s pursuit, hours after Sweden’s Martin Ponsiluoma’s surprise gold in the men’s event.
In men’s hockey, Canada routed France 10-2 and the United States plays Germany later, seeking a quarterfinal spot.

When Israel fought the Soviets: the secret air war of 1970
Unknown

03:21:20 KST

The most direct military clash between the IDF and the Soviet Union unfolded gradually and largely out of public view, emerging during the final year of the War of Attrition as a dangerous escalation that brought a Cold War superpower into open combat with Israeli forces. What began as an Egyptian effort to recover from defeat in the 1967 Six-Day War evolved into a covert superpower deployment, direct aerial combat between IDF and Soviet pilots, and deadly missile engagements that reshaped the regional balance and hastened the war’s end.
After the 1967 Six-Day War, Egypt sought to challenge control of Sinai not through a decisive ground offensive but through prolonged pressure. Artillery duels along the Suez Canal intensified. Commando raids became routine. Air power assumed a central role. IDF aircraft struck Egyptian positions along the canal and increasingly deep inside Egypt, targeting air bases, radar installations, bridges, power stations and logistical hubs.
By 1969, the imbalance in the air was stark. Mirage III fighters and newly introduced F-4 Phantom jets gave the IDF the ability to operate hundreds of kilometers west of the canal. A series of deep-penetration raids, later known collectively as Operation Priha, exposed Egypt’s inability to defend its own heartland. Bombs fell near Cairo, Alexandria and the Aswan Dam. Egyptian fighter losses mounted, while air defenses struggled to intercept or survive.
President Gamal Abdel Nasser concluded that Egypt could not sustain the war alone. In the autumn of 1969 and again during a visit to Moscow on Jan. 24–25, 1970, he pressed Soviet leaders for expanded assistance. This time, the request went beyond weapons. Nasser asked the Soviet Union to defend Egyptian airspace directly.
The Soviet response was unprecedented. Moscow approved a covert deployment code-named Operation Caucasus, involving a full expeditionary force, divisional in size. At its core was the 18th Special Anti-Aircraft Rocket Division of the Soviet Air Defence Forces, reinforced by fighter aviation regiments equipped with MiG-21MF aircraft, radar units, electronic warfare teams and thousands of personnel.
Beginning in March 1970, Soviet ships unloaded men and equipment at Egyptian ports. SA-2 and SA-3 surface-to-air missile batteries were deployed around Cairo, Alexandria and Aswan. Soviet pilots flew combat air patrols. Radar operators, missile crews, technicians and controllers took over entire sectors of the air defense network. Vehicles were painted in Egyptian colors. Soviet personnel wore desert uniforms resembling Egyptian dress. Officially, both Cairo and Moscow denied the deployment.
IDF intelligence detected the presence almost immediately. Unit 848 intercepted Russian-language communications. Radar signatures and operational behavior matched Soviet doctrine. The conclusion was unavoidable: Soviet forces were now actively engaged.
Despite this, political leaders sought to avoid escalation. The IDF was directed to avoid contact with Soviet-manned systems. Deep-penetration missions were curtailed and by April 1970 halted entirely, ending a year of successful strikes deep inside Egypt.
The restraint backfired. Soviet commanders used the pause to reshape the battlefield. Missile batteries advanced eastward toward the canal in carefully protected stages. Egyptian air defense units were freed to reinforce the front. The operating space for IDF aircraft narrowed steadily.
By early summer, the consequences were severe. Several Phantoms were shot down by surface-to-air missiles. Aircrew were killed, wounded or captured. Soviet confidence increased. MiG-21 patrols expanded their range, probing closer to the canal and beyond.
On July 25, Soviet-flown MiGs intercepted IDF A-4 Skyhawks during a ground-attack mission and pursued them into Sinai. An AA-2 Atoll missile struck one aircraft, forcing an emergency landing at Rephidim. For the first time, Soviet pilots had fired air-to-air missiles east of the canal.
Maj. Gen. Mordechai Hod, commander of the IDF Air Arm, and Lt. Gen. Haim Bar-Lev, chief of staff, concluded that restraint had failed. Air superiority, regarded as a strategic pillar since 1967, was under direct threat. Hod proposed a controlled confrontation in air-to-air combat, where IDF experience and training were believed to offer an advantage over Soviet pilots, rather than continued exposure to missile ambushes.
The plan was presented to the cabinet on July 25 and approved by Prime Minister Golda Meir. The objective was deterrence, not escalation. The operation was code-named Rimon 20.
Planning relied on deception, timing and intelligence dominance. Unit 848 and other intelligence elements provided continuous monitoring of Egyptian and Soviet communications. IDF electronic warfare units prepared to disrupt radar coverage at key moments.
On the morning of July 30, routine-looking strike missions were flown along the canal to preserve normal patterns. Shortly after 14:00, four F-4 Phantoms from Squadron 69, led by Avihu Bin-Nun with navigator Shaul Levi, attacked an Egyptian radar station near Sokhna, flying profiles typical of Skyhawks to avoid drawing special attention.
At the same time, four Mirage IIIC fighters from Squadron 119 — flown by Amos Amir, Asher Snir, Avraham Salmon and Avi Gilad — crossed into Egyptian airspace near Hurghada. Flying in tight formation, they appeared on radar as a single reconnaissance aircraft and climbed to altitude on a steady northward track.
Soviet controllers responded as expected. The first quartet of MiG-21s lifted off from Kawm Ushim under Capt. Yevgeny Kamenev. Two additional formations followed from Beni Suef, led by Capt. Nikolai Yurchenko and Capt. Vitaliy Saranin. Further MiGs joined from al-Qatamiyah. In total, 24 Soviet fighters were committed.
Unseen, additional Mirages from Squadrons 117 and 101 loitered at low altitude over Sinai, beyond radar coverage, while another quartet waited on alert at Rephidim.
As the MiGs closed to within 20 kilometers, Hod gave the order to attack. Fuel tanks were jettisoned. Formations broke apart. The engagement collapsed into a chaotic, close-range dogfight as Phantoms and Mirages converged from multiple directions.
Salmon scored the first kill, firing an AIM-9D Sidewinder at a MiG threatening a pair of Phantoms. The missile struck, killing Yurchenko. Moments later, Snir downed another MiG flown by Capt. Yevgeny Yakovlev, who ejected but later died. Snir was then hit by a missile fired by Capt. Vladimir Ivlev. His Mirage was badly damaged, its tail shredded, but he disengaged and landed safely at Rephidim.
Phantom pilot Aviem Sella, flying with navigator Reuven Reshef, engaged a MiG flown by Capt. Georgy Syrkin. After an initial missile appeared ineffective, a second hit destroyed the aircraft. Syrkin ejected and survived.
Another MiG, flown by Kamenev, attempted to escape at low altitude. Bin-Nun and Levi launched an AIM-7 Sparrow at extremely low height, destroying the aircraft.
The final loss was confirmed only years later. A MiG flown by Capt. Vladimir Zhuravlev, pursued by Salmon and Iftach Spector, managed to flee the immediate fight but later crashed. Salmon and Spector were credited with a shared kill.
The entire engagement lasted less than three minutes. Five Soviet MiGs were destroyed. Three pilots were killed. Two ejected. No IDF aircraft were lost.
Publicly, details were muted. Initial statements spoke only of enemy aircraft downed. Egypt denied losses. Moscow remained silent. Within days, foreign reports identified the pilots as Soviet. In October, Meir confirmed it openly.
Moscow responded quickly. Marshal Pavel Kutakhov, commander of the Soviet Air Force, flew to Egypt. Reinforcements followed. Additional MiG units arrived, along with Su-15 interceptors. Plans were drawn up for retaliation through surface-to-air missile ambushes rather than air combat.
That response came on Aug. 3.
IDF strike aircraft were dispatched to attack missile batteries deployed between Abu Suweir and Ismailia in an operation later known as Shayar 265. The mission aimed to blunt the expanding Soviet-built air defense network. Instead, the aircraft flew into a carefully prepared trap. Decoy missile sites had been erected. Operational SA-3 batteries were concealed and linked to coordinated fire plans.
A dense barrage of missiles followed. One Phantom was hit and went down. Pilot Yigal Shohat was severely wounded and later lost a leg. Navigator Moshe Goldwasser was captured by Egyptian forces, tortured and later died in captivity.
Another Phantom was badly damaged. Pilot Raanan Naaman was wounded by missile fragments that tore through the cockpit. Navigator Yoram Romem took control of the aircraft and flew it back to Rephidim despite extensive damage. Both men were later decorated by the IDF.
Shayar 265 underscored a grim conclusion for IDF planners: there was no tactical solution to the Soviet missile network then deployed in Egypt. Losses mounted. Strategic calculations shifted.
Within days, U.S.-brokered diplomacy produced a ceasefire. It took effect on Aug. 7, 1970, ending the War of Attrition. Although Egypt later violated the agreement by advancing missile batteries eastward, large-scale fighting ceased.
Soviet forces remained in Egypt after the ceasefire, continuing to operate air defenses. Only in 1972 did President Anwar Sadat expel most Soviet troops, retaining advisers.
Years later, memoirs, declassified documents and archival discoveries revealed the full scope of Operation Caucasus, Rimon 20 and Shayar 265. Together, they exposed a rare Cold War confrontation in which the IDF and Soviet forces met directly, tested one another’s limits and then stepped back from a conflict that threatened to draw in the world’s superpowers.

ASX set to rise as Wall Street steadies

ASX set to rise as Wall Street steadies
US stocks steadied on Friday after an encouraging update on inflation helped calm a Wall Street that’s been wracked by worries about how artificial-intelligence technology may upend the business world.
The S&P 500 barely budged, a day after it had tumbled to one of its worst losses since Thanksgiving. The Dow Jones rose 48 points, or 0.1 per cent, and the Nasdaq composite slipped 0.2 per cent.
The Australian sharemarket is set to climb, with futures pointing to a rise of 51 points, or 0.6 per cent, at the open. Reporting season continues with Treasury Wine, Bendigo and Adelaide Bank and JB Hi-Fi among companies due up. The Australian dollar was trading at US70.72¢ at 5.14am AEDT.
Stocks got some help from easing Treasury yields, which fell after a report showed inflation slowed last month by more than economists expected. US consumers paid prices for groceries, clothes and other costs of living that were 2.4 per cent higher overall than a year earlier.
While that’s higher than anyone would like and above the 2 per cent target set by the Federal Reserve, it wasn’t as bad as December’s 2.7 per cent rate. And an underlying measure of inflation that economists see as a better predictor of where it may be heading slowed to the least-painful level in nearly five years.
“It’s still too high, but only for now, not forever,” said Brian Jacobsen, chief economic strategist at Annex Wealth Management.
Besides helping US households struggling to keep up with the cost of living, slower inflation could also give the Federal Reserve more leeway to cut interest rates, if needed. The Fed has put its cuts to interest rates on hold, but the widespread expectation is that it will resume later this year.
Reducing rates would give the economy a boost and juice prices for stocks. What holds the Fed back from cuts is that they can give inflation more fuel.
In the meantime, the economy seems to be in a better place than at the end of 2025. Besides the slowdown in inflation, it also saw the job market improve last month by more than economists expected.
On Wall Street, stock prices steadied for several companies that investors had earlier targeted as potential losers from AI disruption.
AppLovin, for example, lost nearly a fifth of its value on Thursday even though it reported a stronger profit than analysts expected. Investors have been worried that it and other software companies could see AI-powered competitors take away customers and fundamentally change their industries.
On Friday, AppLovin climbed 6.4 per cent.
Trucking and freight companies also tumbled on Thursday after a small company, Algorhythm Holdings, said its AI platform helps customers scale freight volumes by up to 400 per cent “without a corresponding increase in operational headcount.” After sinking 14.5 per cent Thursday, C.H. Robinson Worldwide rose 4.9 per cent on Friday.
Such drops have been rolling through the market recently, targeting industries that investors decide are under threat for disruption by AI. The reactions have been so aggressive and so quick that analysts have likened it to a “shoot first, ask questions later” mindset.
Applied Materials was the strongest single force pushing upward on the S&P 500 after rising 8.1 per cent. The company, whose products help make chips and displays, reported a stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. CEO Gary Dickerson credited “acceleration of industry investments in AI computing.”
On the losing end of Wall Street was DraftKings, which dropped 13.5 per cent even though its profit for the latest quarter topped analysts’ expectations. It gave a forecast for revenue this year that fell short of expectations.
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings fell 7.6 per cent after replacing its CEO, just a few weeks before it will report its latest quarterly results. The cruise ship operator said John Chidsey, a director at the company who used to be CEO of Subway Restaurants, is replacing Harry Sommer, effective immediately.
The heaviest weight on the market was Nvidia, which fell 2.2 per cent. Because it’s the largest stock on Wall Street, its moves carry more weight on the S&P 500 than any other company’s.
All told, the S&P 500 added 3.41 points to 6,836.17 to close out its worst week since November. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 48.95 to 49,500.93, and the Nasdaq composite fell 50.48 to 22,546.67.
In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.05 per cent from 4.09 per cent late Thursday. The yield on the two-year Treasury, which more closely tracks expectations for Fed action, sank more. It dropped to 3.40 per cent from 3.47 per cent.
In stock markets abroad, indexes fell in Asia and were more mixed in Europe. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng dropped 1.7 per cent, and Japan’s Nikkei 225 fell 1.2 per cent for two of the bigger moves.

British Museum removes the term Palestine from certain Middle East exhibits

The British Museum has removed the term “Palestine” from some of its Middle East gallery panels and labels following complaints that the use of the term was historically inaccurate and anachronistic.
“For the Middle East galleries for maps showing ancient cultural regions, the term ‘Canaan’ is relevant for the southern Levant in the later second millennium [BCE],” the British Museum told The Jerusalem Post on Sunday, adding that “some of the graphic panels date from the earlier period of the understanding of the term are being reviewed as part of plans for refurbishing these spaces.”
This comes after UK Lawyers for Israel (UKLFI) expressed concerns about historically inaccurate references to “Palestine” in displays covering the ancient Levant and Egypt. In a letter to the British Museum, UKLFI explained that several maps and descriptions retroactively apply the term “Palestine” to periods in which “no such entity existed” and that this “risks obscuring the history of Israel and the Jewish people.”
UKLFI argued that applying a single name across thousands of years “erases historical changes and creates a false impression of continuity.”
As such, UKLFI asked the museum to review its collections and revise terminology so regions are referred to by historically accurate names such as Canaan, the kingdoms of Israel and Judah, or Judea, depending on the period being described.
Museum decided Palestine no longer 'neutral' terminology
The museum told the Post that while the term “Palestine” was well established in Western and Middle Eastern scholarship as a geographical and “neutral” designation for the southern area of the Levant since the late 19th century, it recognized that “the term no longer holds a neutral designation and may be understood in reference to political territory.”
For this reason, the museum has, until now, opted to use UN terminology on maps that show modern boundaries, “for example, Gaza, West Bank, Israel, Jordan, and refer to ‘Palestinian’ as a cultural or ethnographic identifier where appropriate.”
According to UKLFI, the information panels in the Levant gallery, covering the period 2000-300 BCE, have all already been updated to describe in some detail the history of Canaan and the Canaanites and the rise of the kingdoms of Judah and Israel using those names. A panel in the Egypt galleries was recently amended to replace “Palestinian descent” with “Canaanite descent.”
A UKLFI spokesperson said the organization “welcomes the British Museum’s willingness to review and amend terminology which is inaccurate or liable to convey an incorrect meaning today.
“Museums play a vital role in public education, and it is essential that descriptions reflect the historical record with precision and neutrality. These changes are an important step toward ensuring visitors receive an accurate understanding of the ancient Near East.”

NCAG Chief Commissioner admits he threw stones at Israeli soldiers when he was 'still young'

Ali Shaath, the chief commissioner of the National Committee for the Administration of Gaza, threw stones at Israeli soldiers alongside Palestinian youth he worked with, he admitted during an interview with Ahmad Biqawi in April 2025.
Around seven minutes into the nearly two-hour interview, Shaath said, “I worked with the youth at school in demonstrations against the Israeli occupation. We would stand in areas where there were occupation checkpoints and their posts, and we would throw stones at them so they would leave our town.”
“I actually was the organizer of this activity or this national act in the city of Khan Yunis [in the Gaza Strip]. I succeeded in awakening all the opinions and feelings of the people, and they set out to the occupation’s positions,” he said.
Without confirming his age at the time of the incident, only saying he was “still young,” Shaath told his interviewer he was sentenced for the stone-throwing attacks. He said he was later imprisoned again, resulting in him needing to resit his degree, but he did not give a reason for the detainment.
The IDF recognizes stone throwing as a form of “popular terror.”
Video threatens NCAG's future
Israeli expert and director of the Palestinian Media Watch, Itamar Marcus, told The Jerusalem Post that the newly discovered video could undermine NCAG’s legitimacy if Shaath is allowed to remain its head.
“If the United States wants this experiment for Gaza’s future to have any chance of success, it must immediately remove Shaath from his position and appoint a replacement who is honest enough to condemn violence and recognize Israel’s history and its right to exist,” he said.
And this would need to be someone “brave enough to say it publicly,” the researcher told the Post.
Marcus noted that Shaath’s ideology, as exhibited during the interview, made his appointment to the NCAG inappropriate.
“First and most important, Shaath declared the existence of Israel to be an American and European colonial implant. Shaath, the so-called apolitical leader to build Gaza, sees Israelis as foreigners and denies Israel’s right to exist,” he said.
“During the interview, he uses the PA term for Israel – ‘the occupation’ – instead of calling Israel by name. In the PA lexicon, all of Israel is an ‘occupation,’ and all Israeli cities are ‘settlements,’” Marcus continued.
MK Ohad Tal, the chair of the Religious Zionist faction in the Knesset, told the Post, “For those who seek stability and genuine peace, there is no alternative to Israeli control over Gaza.”
“Our soldiers did not fight courageously for many months only to transfer Gaza from one Palestinian terror regime to another, merely replacing one failed and dangerous government with another,” he said.
“I call on Prime Minister [Benjamin] Netanyahu to commit to the notion that in the long term in Gaza, there will be no Hamas and no Abbas. It should be a place free of anyone who seeks to follow in their path.”
Shaath enjoys his reputation as a moderate. Despite his family connections to senior members of Fatah, Shaath had previously spoken in support of a two-state solution.
In 2011, while blaming West Bank violence exclusively on Israeli settlers, Shaath told Army Radio, “I think our people are quite satisfied not to go back to violence and are going, in this fight, to continue their peaceful struggle for independence and for real peace and a two-state solution.”

The Milano Cortina Games organizers on Sunday said they had taken measures to preserve "a neutral, respectful and welcoming environment" at the Olympics after an altercation between a pro-Palestinian employee at an Olympic venue shop and an Israeli supporter.
"We are aware of an incident that took place at the Cortina Sliding Centre involving a retail employee and a visitor," the Games organizers said.
"It is not appropriate for Games staff or contractors to express personal political views while carrying out their duties or to direct such remarks at visitors," they added.
The employee repeatedly called out "Free Palestine" when a group of Israeli sports fans entered the shop, videos of the incident circulating on social media and on Italian newspaper websites showed.
The footage showed a person with an Israeli flag on their bag exiting the store after the exchange, while another person from the group engaged with the employee, daring him to repeat "Free Palestine," which he did.
"This is the Olympics," the person from the Israeli group replied. "Israel is allowed to compete like just any other country, it's not controversial ... OK, good for you, you did it, you freed Palestine, good job."
Employee removed from shift, not fired
The Games organizers said the matter had been dealt with immediately at the venue level, without clarifying if there would be further consequences for the employee.
In the video, someone in the background can be heard saying the person should be fired.
"Those involved were reassured, and the individual concerned was removed from the shift," the organizers said in a statement.

Elite South African school apologizes over refusal to play Jewish day school at fixture

An elite Anglican school in South Africa has formally apologized after its students refused to play a sports fixture against a Jewish day school earlier this month.
On February 3, a Jewish school in South Africa claimed that students at Roedean School, a prestigious Johannesburg-based girls’ school, refused to play against them in a tennis match. The Jewish students of King David Linksfield had traveled to Roedean for the fixture, but the Roedean girls had refused to walk out onto the court, and the fixture was ultimately canceled.
The South African Jewish Board of Deputies (SAJBD) condemned what it said was a “disturbing refusal to play Jewish tennis players.”
Discrimination has become acceptable
“It also conveys the message that hate and discrimination have become acceptable values at Roedean.”
The school originally denied the allegations, writing in a letter to parents that it had notified King David that it could not field a team because of prior commitments, including compulsory academic workshops, and it had requested either a postponement or, failing that, cancellation of the fixture.
However, South African outlet The Common Sense obtained an audio recording of a telephone conversation between senior staffers at Roedean and King David Linksfield schools, which contradicted the school’s claim that the cancellation was due to scheduling constraints.
In the audio, the Roedean staff member asks King David if it has had pressure from any other school to not attend fixtures, or if parents at other schools had complained about their children playing against a Jewish school.
The King David staff member said this had never happened before, and all fixtures since 2023 had gone ahead as normal.
The Roedean staff member then admitted that the parents at her school were putting pressure on the school not to play against King David, and that they felt they needed to “take a stance” in line with the government.
Despite this seemingly reference to the government’s stance on Israel-Palestine, and not on Jews, the Roedean staff member said “at the moment it’s presenting itself as a Jewish day school issue,” and that she would be attending the fixture “to make sure my parents behave.”
The King David staff member replied that this was “very worrying.”
Roedean then released a statement saying it “recognized the seriousness of the concerns that have been raised and the distress this matter has caused to students, families, and the wider school community,” and was communicating directly with King David.
It added that Roedean has a “long-standing commitment to inclusion and respect for all communities,” and “antisemitism has no place in our school.”
However, the SA Jewish Report discovered that Roedean School’s Senior School head, Phuti Mogale, left her post with immediate effect on February 9.
“What occurred between Roedean School and King David High School constitutes antisemitism,” said the South African Jewish Board of Deputies’ national director, Wendy Kahn.
“The tennis fixture didn’t fall away because of prior school commitments or academic workshops,” she said. “It fell away because in the words of Roedean’s school principal, ‘It’s presenting itself as a Jewish day school issue’.”
Roedean School finally sent a formal apology to King David on February 12, following mediation by the Independent Schools Association of Southern Africa (ISASA). It admitted that its actions were “deeply hurtful to the Jewish community”, and admitted that “while there were communication challenges which compounded this incident, these were not the cause of the cancellation of the match as Roedean originally understood and communicated, as has become clear from our ongoing independent investigations”.
The general manager of the South African Board of Jewish Education (SABJE), Rabbi Ricky Seeff, said, “We feel relieved. We had no interest in having long, protracted public spats with other independent schools. We want to resume normal relations. It was important to stand up to antisemitism. Now we just want to get our community and kids back to where they are meant to be – playing sports. “

Israel's female soldiers sacrifice for our country, we must not let them be harassed - editorial

Police officers rescued two female IDF soldiers on Sunday in Bnei Brak after a mob surrounded them when they came to carry out a welfare visit as part of their service, a police statement said. Officers protected the soldiers as rioters confronted a police car and hurled objects at it. Authorities reported 23 arrests.
Footage from the scene spread quickly, as did condemnation by politicians. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the incident serious and unacceptable while stressing that it came from an extremist minority that does not represent the broader ultra-Orthodox public.
Shas leader Aryeh Deri and United Torah Judaism (UTJ) leader Yitzhak Goldknopf also issued condemnations, and IDF Chief of Staff Lt.-Gen. Eyal Zamir described harm to soldiers by Israeli civilians as crossing a red line.
Israel cannot accept harassment of soldiers by a mob as just another ugly clip on a feed. Soldiers in uniform are not props for internal political posturing; they are public servants and they serve those who agree with them, the people who vote against them, and those who resent the system they represent.
Assault on female soldiers part of a wider narrative
The incident is part of a wider Israeli narrative that has unfolded since October 7, 2023, about the expanding role, responsibility, and burden shouldered by women in uniform, and the price they pay in doing so.
For over two years now, this newspaper has shown women fighting, commanding, rescuing, gathering intelligence, and holding the line under pressure. Caracal Battalion commander Lt.-Col. Or Ben-Yehuda has described female fighters engaging terrorists on October 7 and staying in the fight under extreme conditions.
Women have also been sent into arenas that were once discussed theoretically, then argued about, then postponed. The Post has reported on a co-ed battalion whose female troops went into Gaza, a first for the unit.
In late 2024, The Jerusalem Post reported on operational missions that took female combat soldiers into Lebanon, with their work framed as part of intelligence-gathering and operational support.
Their courage also includes roles that are less discussed around Israel’s Shabbat tables. IDF field observers, many of them young women, have borne a responsibility that the country did not fully appreciate until it had no choice.
Zamir has said female observers are “the eyes of the state.” He said, plainly, that the IDF failed on October 7 while the observers on duty did not fail, describing their actions as courageous and heroic under fire.
Meanwhile, the numbers have increased. In 2025, the Post reported that the IDF had recruited over 5,000 women for combat roles, marking a new record. The “why” is not mysterious. Many Israeli women watched October 7 and the months that followed and decided that, in this era, military service was part of adulthood.
These women are doing God’s work. They are saving lives. They are helping Israel stand back up.
Clearly, there are those in Israel who must still learn a basic national rule: Keep your hands off them. Do not surround them. Do not chase them. Do not spit at them. Do not scream at them as if you own the street and they are trespassers. The IDF uniform represents the entire country, including those who do not wear it.
A community can oppose a draft policy. A community can demand a different legal arrangement. A community can protest. None of that grants it the right to humiliate soldiers, especially those carrying out a welfare visit.
Anyone claiming religious justification for harassing women in uniform should hear the words used by haredi leaders in their condemnations, including language about desecration and disgrace. This is hilul Hashem (desecration of God’s name).
Israel also needs a practical response: Prosecutions should move quickly, and there should be severe consequences. A society teaches norms through enforcement as much as through rhetoric.
Political leaders who rely on haredi voters should stop treating the issue as “someone else’s problem.” The state should also ensure that soldiers are kept safe in public spaces, as it does other vulnerable public servants.
Israel has lived through two and a half years of wartime reality since October 7, 2023 and far too many soldiers and civilians have paid the ultimate price. It has carried too much. It has asked too much of the people who serve.
The very least Israel can do is protect the women who wear their uniform with pride and do the hard work.

Trump’s intervention turns Herzog’s pardon dilemma into a diplomatic trap - analysis
Unknown

Even before US President Donald Trump publicly lashed out at President Isaac Herzog on Thursday for not yet pardoning Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Herzog was in an impossible position.
Grant the pardon, and he alienates roughly half the country that wants to see Netanyahu’s trial continue, and, if the prime minister is convicted, pay the legal price. Refuse the pardon, and Herzog enrages the other half, which views the decade-long legal saga as unnecessary, excessive, corrosive, and long overdue for closure.
It was already a no-win situation. Trump’s most recent intervention – he first intervened in October when he publicly called for a pardon for Netanyahu from the Knesset podium – made it worse.
Responding to a question in the White House on Thursday, a day after meeting Netanyahu, Trump said Herzog should be “ashamed of himself” for not having pardoned the prime minister. He went further: “I think the people of Israel should really shame him. He’s disgraceful for not giving it.”
Those words reached Herzog during a 13-hour flight from Australia – where he had just completed a four-day visit marked by loud anti-Israel demonstrations calling for his arrest – to Abu Dhabi, before the final commercial leg home.
After being assailed in the streets and fiercely criticized in parts of the Australian press, the last place Herzog likely expected further invective was from the Oval Office in the White House. Yet there it was.
Trump’s comments did more than create diplomatic discomfort; they complicated Herzog’s overall calculus regarding the pardon.
On the one hand, Herzog could not ignore a public rebuke from the American president – particularly one who has positioned himself as Israel’s staunchest ally. On the other hand, any response had to be measured and respectful, mindful of Trump’s temperament and of the enormous importance of US-Israel ties.
The statement crafted by Herzog and his aides was careful and procedural. Netanyahu’s pardon request is currently with the Justice Ministry for a legal opinion, they said. Once that process is complete, the president will deal with the matter. That was consistent with what Herzog told reporters throughout his Australian trip, even before Trump’s intervention.
“Only after the process is concluded will the president examine the request in accordance with the law, the good of the state, and his conscience – and without any influence from external or internal pressures of any kind,” the statement read.
Herzog 'appreciates' Trump
Herzog stressed that he appreciates Trump for his significant contribution to the State of Israel and its security, while stressing that Israel is “governed by the rule of law” and that – contrary to the impression left by Trump’s comments – no decision has yet been made.
The message was two-fold: appreciation for Trump’s invaluable support, coupled with a polite reminder that Israel is “a sovereign state.”
But Trump’s intervention changes the political equation.
If Herzog ultimately grants the pardon, critics will argue he did so under American pressure. If he refuses, Netanyahu’s supporters will frame the decision as a slight to Trump – a rebuff to Israel’s most important ally and champion.
And that framing is not incidental. After calling Herzog “disgraceful,” Trump praised Netanyahu as a great wartime leader and declared, “I’ve been the best friend to Israel that they’ve ever had.”
The implied subtext is unmistakable: I am Israel’s best friend. I am asking for this. You owe me.
That is precisely what makes Herzog’s already fraught decision even more precarious. What was once a domestic dilemma has now acquired a new dimension – one that may have ramifications for the US-Israel relationship.
After the initial shock and the release of Herzog’s statement on Saturday, sources close to Herzog questioned whether Netanyahu put Trump up to this particular task. The timing, after all, was suspicious, with Trump’s diatribe coming just a day after he met Netanyahu in Washington.
They said that if Netanyahu did indeed have something to do with Trump’s remarks, this “constitutes crossing a red line.”
Sources close to the prime minister denied any involvement and said the remarks were entirely at Trump’s own initiative. They said Netanyahu heard about the remarks in the media and had no prior knowledge of them – just as he had no advance knowledge of the president’s call in the Knesset in October for a pardon.
In politics, perception matters
But in politics, perception often matters more than anything else.
The damage is not necessarily in coordination between Netanyahu and Trump – proven or unproven – but in optics. Trump’s very public intervention soon after meeting Netanyahu, in conjunction with his framing of the issue in personal and transactional terms, has reshaped the context in which the public will now judge any decision by Herzog.
Before Trump’s remarks, the president’s dilemma was domestic and legal. However controversial, a decision to pardon or not could have been debated on legal grounds, moral reasoning, precedent, or the need for national healing and for the country to move on. Now that space has narrowed.
If Herzog grants clemency, critics will not examine the logic in the Justice Ministry’s legal opinion or weigh the broader national interest. They will point to Trump’s demand and conclude that Israel’s president bowed to pressure from Washington. The decision will be interpreted not as a sovereign act of conscience, but as acquiescence.
If he refuses, Netanyahu’s supporters will argue that Herzog chose defiance over alliance – that he rebuffed Israel’s most forceful international backer in the midst of war and diplomatic strain to prove a point and to prevent coming under a barrage of criticism from the anti-Netanyahu camp.
In other words, Herzog is now effectively hemmed in. Trump, with or without prodding from Netanyahu, has shifted the debate from the merits of the pardon to the motivations behind it. And once motivation becomes the story, the actual substance of the matter becomes secondary.
To many Israelis, the whole saga is unseemly. Herzog may indeed want to decide this based on the dictates of his conscience and his reading of what is best for the country.
But Trump’s intervention has made that far more difficult. Any way Herzog turns, the decision will now be judged through a political lens – not because of what he decides, but because of the context in which he has been forced to decide.

Modern politics a 'clown show': Obama says Democrats have harder job than Republicans

Former US president Barack Obama said the current state of US political discourse feels like a “clown show,” in an interview with podcaster Brian Tyler Cohen on Saturday.
“Most Americans find this behavior deeply troubling,” Obama said. “Some public figures no longer seem to feel shame. But the majority don’t approve, and ultimately the answer will come from them.”
While he didnt mention current US President Donald Trump by name, Obama’s comment appeared to reference a video shared by Trump containing an AI-generated clip of Barack and Michelle Obama as apes.
The former president also claimed that while extraterrestrial life exists, he has never seen any aliens himself.
“They’re not being kept in Area 51 - unless there’s an enormous conspiracy that hid it from the president,” he said.
Obama said Democrats have harder job than Republicans
Obama also stated that in his eyes, Democrats have a harder job than Republicans, as, according to him, one group focuses on protecting norms while the other pursues its goals aggressively.
“We believe in government as a force for good, which means building majorities, persuading people, passing laws,” he said. “Tearing things down is easier.“
The former president said that he was able to get younger people to vote by building joy and community into his presidential campaign.
“The other side thrives on anger and division. Our strength is community. That spirit of shared purpose - that’s our home court,” he said.
When asked about how Democrats can avoid infighting as the 2028 election approaches, Obama insisted that divisions within the party have been exaggerated.
“A candidate in Virginia may run as a centrist; one in New York may run as an explicit socialist. That’s healthy. We don’t need to nationalize every issue. And we shouldn’t treat policy debates as moral betrayals,” he said.
“Take immigration. Morally, that child in Minneapolis deserves dignity. But voters also want orderly borders. We have to balance values with political reality.”

Some 539,000 Israelis aged 20 and over (8.6%) reported being victims of online crimes in 2024, according to data released by the Central Bureau of Statistics on Monday for National Safe Internet Surfing Week.
This accounts for over half of the people aged 20 and over who reported being victims of any crime (15%).
More men than women in the over-20 demographic were victims of cyberbullying and shaming, with 52.6% being men and 47.4% women.
Of the thousands of online crimes reported in 2024, over half of them involved theft and/or distribution of information (52.4%), with a higher likelihood of women being the victims.
Women were also more likely to be the victims of crimes involving impersonation and/or identity theft, which accounted for 30.8% of reported cybercrimes.
The age groups most likely to fall victim to online crimes, regardless of gender, were 45–54 (11.1%, or about 113,000 people) and 35–44 (10.2%, or about 122,000 people), while the lowest rate was among those over 65 (4.7%).
Generally, men were reported to be more likely to be victims of online crime, with the exception of the age group 35–44, where 8.7% of men reported victimization compared to 11.8% of women.
When divided by religious demographic, Jewish and other religions reported victimization at a rate six times higher than Arabs.
In Jewish communities, the highest rate of victimization was in the modern orthodox community (12.1%), while the lowest rate was among the ultra-Orthodox (5.1%).
Those with higher levels of education fell victim to cybercrimes more often
A majority of those victimized by online crime were individuals with master’s and doctoral degrees, with crime rates lowering with less formal education.
While those with high school degrees were most likely to fall victim to crimes involving theft and/or the distribution of information, those with advanced degrees were most likely to be targeted by crimes involving impersonation or identity theft.
According to the CBS, over 90% of victims did not actually report the crimes to the Israel Police, though about 40% of those who didn't said they had reported the crime to a separate authority instead.
About 13% of victims who chose not to report the crime cited the police’s inability to handle such cases, and nearly 10% said they did not feel the need to report what they considered a minor incident to police.
Some 42% of households in Israel have children aged 2-18, and 6.8% of those households have been the victim of at least one online crime. Theft, violence or threats of violence, sexual harassment, sexual offenses, online crime, and/or cyberbullying and shaming were prominent among those crimes.
In a majority of households where children aged 6–17 experienced victimization, it had occurred over the previous 12 months.
The rate of children victimized by online crime in Jewish households was 1.1%, while the estimate for Arab households could not be retrieved by the CBS due to the small number of cases.
Separately from the thousands who have already been victimized by online crimes, some 25.3% of adults aged 20 and over said they feared “to a very great extent” or “to a great extent” that they would become victims in the future.
Members of Arab society were the least afraid of falling victim to online crimes, at 15.7% compared to 27.5% for Jews and others.

United States Announces Need to Develop Mini-Interceptor for Tanker Aircraft
Unknown

03:07:18 KST

The U.S. Air Force has identified a requirement for a miniature interceptor missile to defend tanker aircraft against incoming enemy missiles.
Aviation Week reported the development, citing Kevin Stamey, Program Executive Officer and Director for the Mobility and Training Aircraft Directorate at the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center.
According to Stamey, aircraft in the U.S. Air Force tanker fleet require a new type of air-to-air interceptor capable of destroying incoming missiles.
By integrating such an interceptor into transport aircraft, the Air Force aims to reduce reliance on electronic countermeasures, which must be continually upgraded to keep pace with evolving adversary capabilities.
“Whether it’s an infrared seeker or a radar seeker, if we have a way to destroy it kinetically, we don’t have to rely on electronic attack or decoys that may be effective against some threats but not others,” Stamey said.
Kinetic interceptors would serve as a last line of defense, particularly against missiles equipped with dual-mode seekers.
“If all else fails and a threat penetrates other layers of defense, we would still have a means to protect the tanker aircraft,” he added.
Efforts to develop a mini-missile for aircraft self-defense are not new, but previous programs have not resulted in an operational system.
For example, in 2015, the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) disclosed work on the Miniature Self-Defense Munition (MSDM). At the time, AFRL said it was seeking a “highly maneuverable, highly responsive” miniature missile with a low-cost passive seeker and an overall length of about one meter.
AFRL initially contracted Raytheon and Lockheed Martin for the MSDM program. In 2020, Raytheon received an additional contract for what was described as a “miniature self-defense missile,” covering research and development of a flight-ready design. The effort appeared to continue the earlier MSDM work under a slightly revised name. However, Raytheon has not publicly presented a working prototype of such an interceptor.
In 2018, the United States Navy also issued a request for information on missile options to protect transport aircraft, tankers, and other support aircraft. The concept was also considered for use on advanced unmanned aerial systems.
In late January 2026, China released detailed imagery of the PL-17 ultra-long-range air-to-air missile, designed to target high-value aircraft. Its maximum range is estimated at about 400 kilometers.
Such weapons are primarily intended to engage large, high-value airborne assets, including tanker aircraft and airborne early warning and control platforms.

Russia revives election-day truce offer, proposes UN rule for Ukraine

Russia is ready to halt strikes on Ukraine for a single day of voting, Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Galuzin said in a Feb. 15 interview with the state-controlled news agency TASS, saying President Vladimir Putin's earlier proposal to pause strikes on election day "remains valid."
The remarks followed President Volodymyr Zelensky's comments at the Munich Security Conference on Feb. 14 that Ukraine would be ready to hold elections after at least two months of a ceasefire. Zelensky also said Ukraine could "announce a ceasefire for Russians" if Russia were to hold elections itself.
Galuzin accused Kyiv of failing to hold elections, though Ukrainian law prohibits national voting under martial law imposed after Russia launched its full-scale invasion. He also called Zelensky "illegitimate" and suggested Kyiv could manipulate voting procedures.
He went further, proposing "temporary external governance" for Ukraine under the UN, which he said would allow elections and bring to power a government with which Russia could sign a peace treaty.
"We are ready to discuss temporary external governance of Ukraine under the UN," he said.
"Such a step would allow for democratic elections to be held in Ukraine and bring to power a capable government with which it would be possible to sign a full-fledged peace treaty and legitimate documents on the future cooperation between our two countries."
Zelensky has in recent weeks promoted the idea of holding a referendum and potentially presidential elections immediately after a ceasefire is reached to show international partners that Ukraine is serious about a potential peace deal.
The remarks came as Russia continues regular missile and drone attacks across Ukrainian . The strikes have targeted cities, civilian infrastructure, and energy facilities, contributing to a nationwide energy crisis and making 2025 the deadliest year for Ukrainian civilians since the start of the full-scale war.

Angus Taylor needs a convincing economic plan, and fast
New Liberal leader Angus Taylor has made improved living standards central to his pitch to become prime minister.
In his maiden press conference after being elected opposition leader on Friday, Taylor said: “I say to Australians, the first priority of the Liberal Party now under my leadership will be to restore our standard of living and protect our way of life.”
Most voters will welcome the sentiment; Taylor must not delay in presenting voters with detailed economic policies to match the rhetoric.
He takes on the Liberal leadership as the Albanese government confronts a list of tricky economic challenges. Damaging price pressures have re-emerged during the past six months; inflation is now running at 3.8 per cent, well above the Reserve Bank’s target band of 2 to 3 per cent.
The RBA has lifted rates once this year in a bid to end the inflationary surge and further increases are a strong possibility. This unwelcome news for millions of indebted households follows years of elevated public concern about the cost of living.
The May federal budget looms as a stern test for Treasurer Jim Chalmers.
There is a case to suggest government spending has played at least some role in the recent inflationary spike. Chalmers must ensure that the 2026 budget does not make the problem worse.
The government is also being pressured to boost productivity growth and to do more to address housing affordability. The budget, Chalmers’ fifth, is an obvious platform to unveil effective new solutions.
The Liberal Party is languishing in the polls, but the government’s economic problems present Taylor with a political opportunity. To make the most of it, he must move beyond hollow rhetoric.
At Friday’s press conference, Taylor repeatedly described the Albanese government as “rotten” and even said it was the “worst Labor government in Australian history”.
But vague attacks will not be sufficient to rebuild the opposition’s economic credibility.
The latest Resolve Political Monitor, published on Monday by this masthead, shows only 26 per cent of respondents believe the Liberal-National Coalition would be the best economic manager. That’s the same share as Labor, despite the government’s economic troubles.
The Coalition was also on par with Labor (on 26 per cent) for which party would perform best in managing government finances.
This underscores how nebulous criticism of Labor will be insufficient to rebuild the Liberal Party’s economic bona fides.
Taylor is often portrayed as a Liberal in the Howard-Costello tradition, but he should not dwell on the past. Economic conditions have shifted dramatically in the 30 years since the Howard government won office.
Unless Taylor can skilfully address contemporary economic challenges, he runs the risk of being branded yesterday’s man.
The thumping 34-17 victory over outgoing Liberal leader Sussan Ley in Friday’s party room ballot gives Taylor scope for bold action. He must now outline specific policies to achieve his promise to restore living standards.
The opposition leader needs a fresh and convincing economic plan, and fast.

Zelenskyy: Ukraine to receive new support packages
President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has announced that Ukraine is to receive new support packages from its international partners.
Source: Zelenskyy in his evening address
Quote: "I'm already back in Kyiv after two very intense days at the Munich Security Conference. There were many meetings, and most importantly – there will be new support packages for Ukraine.
The key priority is missiles for air defence, for protection against ballistic missiles. This has been issue number one throughout this entire winter, as you know. That is why we discussed it in Munich with virtually every leader who can truly help us. Also with Marco Rubio, US Secretary of State. We hope the agreements will work as needed. Air defence is a daily necessity."
Details: Zelenskyy said meetings are expected to be held next week and work will be done on the new energy packages, focusing on both recovery after Russian strikes and the equipment that is needed.
Zelenskyy also mentioned the trilateral meetings with US and Russian representatives that are scheduled for next week.
Quote: "The Ukrainian delegation has the necessary framework for the discussion. Yesterday we coordinated with Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner. Ukraine will always be constructive. The American side knows this. But Ukrainians need to see real progress on security so there's real trust – trust both in diplomacy and in possible results. Overall, it is precisely the security issue that holds the key to ending the war. Security guarantees for Ukraine are necessary; this is the key priority."

Jordan, Qatar condemn Israeli decision to register West Bank land as ‘state property’
Amman says decision violates international law and amounts to annexation of occupied Palestinian territory
- Doha urges international pressure to halt illegal measure undermining Palestinian rights and the 2-state solution
ISTANBUL
Jordan and Qatar on Sunday condemned Israel’s decision to register land in the occupied West Bank as “state property,” calling the move a “flagrant violation” of international law, an attempt to annex Palestinian territory and unlawful plans to strip the Palestinian people of their rights.
The Israeli decision “undermines the Palestinian people’s inalienable right to self-determination, ending the occupation and establishing an independent, sovereign state on the June 4, 1967 lines with East Jerusalem as its capital,” the Jordanian Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
The ministry stressed that “Israel has no sovereignty” over the occupied West Bank.
It rejected any Israeli decisions or attempts “to impose sovereignty and laws” on the occupied West Bank, describing such actions as a “clear breach of international law and the existing legal status of the occupied territory.”
The ministry called on the international community to assume its legal and moral responsibilities and compel Israel, as the occupying power, “to halt dangerous escalation and unilateral measures” in the occupied West Bank.
“Fulfilling the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people, foremost among them the establishment of an independent state on their national soil, remains the only path toward achieving a just and comprehensive peace that ensures regional security and stability,” it stressed.
The UN and the international community consider the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, occupied territory, and regard Israeli settlements there as illegal under international law.
Qatar’s Foreign Ministry also denounced the Israeli move, describing it as an extension of an unlawful plan to strip the Palestinian people of their rights. It stressed the need for international solidarity and urged the global community to pressure Israel to halt implementation of the decision to avoid “serious consequences.”
The ministry reiterated Qatar’s “firm and longstanding” support for the Palestinian cause and reaffirmed its backing for the establishment of an independent Palestinian state on the 1967 borders with East Jerusalem as its capital, based on international legitimacy and the two-state solution.
Earlier Sunday, the Israeli government approved a proposal to register vast areas of the occupied West Bank as “state property,” the first such measure since Israel occupied the territory in 1967.
Under the Oslo II Accord signed in 1995, Area A is under full Palestinian control, Area B is under Palestinian civil control and Israeli security control, while Area C, accounting for about 61% of the West Bank, remains under full Israeli control.
The Accord limits land registration by the Palestinian Authority to Areas A and B, while prohibiting it in Area C.
The move was part of a series of measures approved by Israel’s Security Cabinet last week aimed at expanding illegal settlement building and increasing Tel Aviv’s control of the occupied West Bank.
According to Israeli media, the measures include repealing a law that barred the sale of land in the West Bank to illegal Israeli settlers, unsealing land ownership records, and shifting authority for building permits in a settlement bloc near Hebron from a Palestinian municipality to Israel’s civil administration.
Israel has intensified operations in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, since launching its military campaign in Gaza on Oct. 8, 2023. Palestinians view the escalation -- including killings, arrests, displacement and settlement expansion -- as a step toward formal annexation of the territory.
In a landmark opinion in July 2024, the International Court of Justice declared Israel’s occupation of Palestinian territory illegal and called for the evacuation of all settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem.

Top British and German military chiefs press ‘moral’ case for rearmament

Britain and Germany’s highest ranking military leaders have made an unprecedented joint appeal to the public to accept the “moral” case for rearmament and prepare for the threat of war with Russia.
The pair said they were making the plea not just as the military leaders of two of Europe’s largest military spenders, but “as voices for a Europe that must now confront uncomfortable truths about its security”.
Air Chief Marshal Richard Knighton, the UK’s chief of the defence staff, and Gen Carsten Breuer, Germany’s chief of defence, said Russia’s military stance had “shifted decisively westward” and a “step change” was needed in Europe’s defence and security.
In a joint article published in the Guardian and the German newspaper Die Welt, in the wake of the Munich Security Conference, the soldiers said they had a duty “to explain what is at stake so that the public could understand why the UK and Germany have committed to the biggest sustained increases in defence spending since the end of the cold war”.
“There is a moral dimension to this endeavour. Rearmament is not warmongering; it is the responsible action of nations determined to protect their people and preserve peace,” they write.
There is significant reluctance among voters in Britain and Germany to accept economic pain in return for rearmament, even while majorities in both countries believe the outbreak of a third world war is more likely than not in the next five years.
In Britain, polling this month by YouGov found that a minority favour tax rises (25%) or spending cuts (24%) to fund greater spending on the armed forces – including those who say it is very important to increase UK hard power.
German and French voters are also now less likely than they were last year to support increased defence budgets if it meant a trade-off with other investment, according to a poll for Politico this month.
The UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, said at the weekend that there was an urgent need for Britain to have a closer defence relationship with Europe, covering procurement and manufacturing, so that the UK would be at the centre of a stronger European defence setup.
In a visit to the Munich Security Conference, he told the audience: “We are not the Britain of the Brexit years” as he argued that the long-term threat posed by Russia and the need for Europe to take greater responsibility for its own defence required the UK to integrate more closely on defence procurement with European allies.
Europe was, he said, “a sleeping giant” but there had been fragmented industrial planning and procurement
Knighton and Breuer write: “If Russia perceives Europe as weak or divided, it may be emboldened to extend its aggression beyond Ukraine. History teaches us that deterrence fails when adversaries sense disunity and weakness. We know that Russian aggression and intentions extend beyond Ukraine.”
Echoing language used by government figures in Britain, Germany and other European states, Knighton and Breuer said the complexity of threats demanded a “an honest continent-wide conversation with our publics that defence cannot be the preserve of uniformed personnel alone”.
They called for a “whole-of-society defence” with resilient infrastructure, research and development in technology from the private sector, and national institutions prepared to function under increasing threats.
The UK and Germany have committed to deepening security and defence cooperation and signed what became known as the Trinity House agreement in 2024.
The German government is under pressure to meet its promise to revive economic growth after a prolonged downturn and to ramp up defence spending amid concerns over Russian aggression.
Germany is permanently stationing a combat brigade of 4,000-5,000 troops to Nato’s eastern flank and has amended its constitution to make essentially unrestricted funding available for defence.
Procurement of several thousand armoured vehicles has also started, alongside an expansion of industrial capacity.
Britain is building as many as six munitions factories, which are aimed at generating what the Ministry of Defence describes as an “always on” capability to sustain munitions stockpiles.
The debate about European security – almost four years after Vladimir Putin’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, and amid increasing ambiguity around the extent of US support for Nato after Donald Trump’s return to the White House – comes as the governments in Germany and the UK seek to rebalance spending after an era of investing a supposed “peace dividend” in public services.
Nato leaders at last year’s summit in The Hague committed to spending 5% of GDP on defence and security by 2035.
Such a move would expand the British economy in the short term, according to research, but there is still opposition on the left of the Labour party to defence hikes at the cost of spending on health and alleviating poverty. That debate is even more polarised in Germany, with opposition to increased defence spending on the left and, to a degree, from the far-right Alternative für Deutschland party.
Speaking on the opening day of the Munich conference, Germany’s chancellor, Friedrich Merz, singled out the threat Russia posed to Europe, warning “freedom can no longer be taken for granted”.
“We have to understand that in the era of big powers, our freedom is no longer a given. It is at stake. We will need to show firmness and determination to assert this freedom,” he said.
Merz also disclosed he had held initial talks with the French president, Emmanuel Macron, over the possibility of joining France’s nuclear umbrella, underlining his call for Europe to develop a stronger self-standing security strategy.

Brazil Carnival street party do's and don'ts: A survival kit from veterans to beginners

Brazil Carnival street party do's and don'ts: A survival kit from veterans to beginners
Veteran Carnival fans in Rio say the party is fun, but it also takes planning and endurance
- Bookmark
Carnival in Rio de Janeiro is for the uninitiated an energetic spectacle of joy, beauty and just-let-it-go. But for revelers with years of experience it is also a test of endurance, street-wise culture and pacing that allows them to still be standing after four days of festivities.
A balance between dos and don’ts is also needed, veteran Brazilian Carnival partygoers assure. Drinking water under Rio’s scorching summer heat is a must. But drinking too much of it requires revelers to find a bathroom, and that can be a scathing experience.
Eating a sound breakfast is key for energy, but a bit too much could mean a very slow walk along the cobblestone streets as other revelers speed up their pace.
Sunday marks the second official day of the bash, which ends on Ash Wednesday.
Geography and history professor Helena Lemos, 67, who also goes by her Hare Krishna name Kunti Devi Dasi, has been a Rio Carnival reveler since her teenage years. She is playing different drumming instruments in five street parties this year, and her survival kit is always with her.
“I am vegetarian, so my food kit is very light, just dried fruit, almonds, raisins. These will give you energy, won’t add to your weight and will keep you cool,” Lemos, who wore a light white shirt and sunglasses, told The Associated Press before her first street party on Friday in the bohemian region of Santa Teresa, in downtown Rio.
“Earlier, I had lemon tea for breakfast to have an easier digestion, had some tapioca pancakes and some coffee for stamina," she said. "I had a fruit smoothie to get some more energy and then some creatine. When I get back, I will have isotonic drinks because we can’t have them before the street parties.”
Pharmacist Ana Rodrigues Andrade, 44, is playing in nine street parties during this Carnival edition. Years ago she did 15 and still showed up at the city’s glitzy sambadrome to parade for three samba schools. Her main tips regard resting in between parties and bringing hygiene items.
“Under this sun you obviously need sunscreen, you leave home wearing it. You got to prepare it at home and also bring some. Women do need to bring toilet paper and hand sanitizers because the situation of bathrooms during a street party is not good at all. Bring it in a little purse,” Andrade said, as she carried a large drum kit by her belly. “It is also worth bringing a lot of adhesive tape if you’re playing an instrument, so you don’t hurt your hands.”
Physical education teacher Diego Tiriba, 49, has been a Rio Carnival reveler since his childhood. His strategy is being more frugal when he is on the streets and doing most of the preparation at home. He is also concerned about security in a city where criminal activity is considerable.
“I bring a money belt with some cash, a credit card, a bus card, my medical insurance card and the keys to my home, my cellphone and nothing else,” a shirtless Tiriba said, as he removed the money belt from under his shorts. Many women hide their cellphones and money under their shirts.
Most veteran revelers in Rio do not recommend buying food during street parties. Any indigestion might become a major problem at a time when millions are out and public bathrooms might be far. They also say that beer and fast-paced street parties do not go well together on very hot days, for that combination could end in dizziness.
But even longtime revelers make their mistakes.
“Once I spread sunscreen only on my face, the rest of my body was all red,” pharmacist Andrade said. “Today I will have trouble again, I forgot my knee braces to protect from the drum.”

As defence chiefs, we warn you today about Russia, and say this rearmament is not warmongering | Richard Knighton and Carsten Breuer

We write today not merely as the military leaders of two of Europe’s largest military spenders, but as voices for a Europe that must now confront uncomfortable truths about its security. Through the early years of our careers, Europe was emerging from the shadow of the cold war. Governments of all political colours chose to take what was known as the “peace dividend” – investing in public services and reducing spending on defence. That was an understandable choice at the time. Now it’s clear that the threats we face demand a step change in our defence and security. European leaders, along with military and civilian officials, have just discussed necessary consequences at the annual Munich security conference.
As military leaders, we see every day from intelligence and open sources how Russia’s military posture has shifted decisively westward. Its forces are rearming and learning from the war in Ukraine, reorganising in ways that could heighten the risk of conflict with Nato countries. This is a reality we must prepare for; we cannot be complacent. Moscow’s military buildup, combined with its willingness to wage war on our continent, as painfully evidenced in Ukraine, represents an increased risk that demands our collective attention.
At the Hague summit last year, Nato leaders committed to spend 5% of GDP on defence and security by 2035. This reflects our new security reality and requires hard choices and prioritisation on public spending for all members.
As the chiefs of defence of two of Europe’s biggest security providers, we have a duty to explain what is at stake, so that people can understand why our governments have committed to the biggest sustained increases in defence spending since the end of the cold war. That’s why it’s important that we communicate the threat. People must understand the difficult choices governments have to take in order to strengthen deterrence.
History teaches us that deterrence fails when adversaries sense disunity and weakness. If Russia perceives Europe in this way, it may be emboldened to extend its aggression beyond Ukraine. Indeed, we know that Moscow’s intentions range wider than the current conflict. But the good news is that Europe is powerful. Nato is the most successful military alliance in history and today, together, its military might is unsurpassed. We have sophisticated capabilities across land, sea, air and cyber domains, and nuclear deterrence. And we have long been adapting to the new security reality: through building a new model for European security, underpinned by engagement, readiness and collaboration.
This starts with Britain and Germany deepening cooperation. Our landmark Trinity House agreement in 2024 is paving the way for unprecedented cooperation that benefits both our security and economies.
Military readiness must mean a strong European defence industry. Ukraine shows us that industrial bases are key to sustaining and ultimately winning any major war. The increased defence spending under way across our countries proves that we are taking this seriously, as we cannot deter if we cannot produce. Our industries must be capable of sustained output – manufacturing the ammunition, systems and platforms our forces require at the pace modern conflict demands.
Britain is building at least six munitions factories, which will generate an “always on” capability to sustain munitions stockpiles. Germany is permanently stationing an entire combat brigade to the eastern flank and has amended its constitution to make essentially unrestricted funding available for defence. Procurement of several thousand armoured vehicles has started, accompanied by an expansion of industrial capacity.
In addition, the European Union’s Security Action for Europe (Safe) initiative will inject €150bn (£130bn) to strengthen Europe’s defence industrial base.
There is a moral dimension to this endeavour. Rearmament is not warmongering; it is the responsible action of nations determined to protect their people and preserve peace. Strength deters aggression. Weakness invites it.
Finally, the complexity of threats demands a whole-of-society approach and an honest, continent-wide conversation with the public that defence cannot be the preserve of uniformed personnel alone. It is a task for each and every one of us.
Whole-of-society defence requires resilient infrastructure, research and development in hi-tech from the private sector, and national institutions prepared to function under increasing threats. The path ahead calls for courage and an honest conversation with our citizens. Europe’s security is our shared responsibility, and we intend to meet it together.
When Europe acts together, we are a formidable force. And we act together, we are not Great Britain and Germany alone.

Transcript: Rep. Robert Garcia on "Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan," Feb. 15, 2026
The following is the transcript of the interview with Rep. Robert Garcia, Democrat of California, that aired on "Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan" on Feb. 15, 2026.
ED O'KEEFE: Welcome back to Face the Nation. We turn now to the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, California Congressman Robert Garcia, who joins us this morning from Long Beach, where he used to be the mayor. Congressman, good to see you. Thank you for being with us.
REP. ROBERT GARCIA: Sure thing, thank you.
ED O'KEEFE: I want to start real quick because you are on the committee that essentially has oversight of the entire government. You're Democrats. You don't have control of the panel. You've held some unofficial hearings on ICE operations nationwide. I'm curious if you're talking to the Republicans at all about doing anything to investigate allegations of wrongdoing of ICE and the Border Patrol as they continue to carry on immigration enforcement operations.
REP. GARCIA: Look, I think it's just been very recently we actually see more and more Republicans actually speak out and begin to show some level of courage. ICE, CBP, DHS is completely out of control. We have heard, not just in hearings, but certainly in looking at what's happening across this country and folks talking and telling their stories. We're talking about U.S, citizens that are being shot. We're talking about U.S. veterans that are being detained for no reason. Children that are being deported as young as four or five years old, sending to detention in other cases, as we've seen. And so I think you're beginning to see some Republicans actually show concern. But, right now, DHS is causing terror across this country, and Donald Trump has turned not just DHS, but ICE specifically, which we now know is larger than it's ever been, into his own personal police force.
ED O'KEEFE: But you know of no Republican committee chairman currently planning to investigate all these allegations, right? Is that what you're saying?
REP. GARCIA: Oh, there's no chairmen out there that have come out publicly. Now, you begin to hear some Republicans show some concern, but they need to show more courage. I mean, Mike Johnson, at the end of the day, does whatever Donald Trump wants him to do--
ED O'KEEFE: --Yeah--
REP. GARCIA: --and Republicans need to go out there and start speaking the truth of what's happening on the street.
ED O'KEEFE: So the big reason I wanted to speak with you this morning is, of course, you're now trying to conduct a pretty aggressive review of the Epstein documents, as they've now been released by the Justice Department. There have been about three and a half million documents released, and based on a CBS News review, so far there doesn't appear to be enough evidence to criminally charge anyone else. Saturday night, the Department of Justice released this legally required list of all government officials and politically exposed persons in the Epstein files. More than 300 names on the list which they acknowledge are people who are here listed in a wide variety of contexts. DOJ says they're doing this ask because it was part of the law. It lists everyone from Beyonce to Joe Biden, George W. Bush, Princess Diana, Michael Jackson, Barack Obama, Mike Pence, the Trumps, Mark Zuckerberg, among others, because they came up in one way or another in the documents. A few questions, why was this asked for? And are you aware yet of any names being not on this list that should be on the list?
REP. GARCIA: We're reviewing that list, of course, but let's, let's be really clear, this is a massive cover up being led by the White House and the DOJ. The fact that 50%, half of the Epstein files have not been released to the public and to the Congress, and of those that have been released, the actual files that have been out in the public or that we've seen, they're overly redacted. Many of the survivors and victims, their names are actually appearing with where there's no protection for the survivors. Yet, the names of billionaires, the names of folks that could be co-conspirators that helped fund Jeffrey Epstein, that could have actually been involved in the terror and rape, as we know, abuse of women and children, some of those names continue to be redacted and protected. Why won't the DOJ actually follow the law? Not just of what was passed by Congress but the subpoena that was put in place by the Oversight Committee during the summer. And so this continues to be a cover up, and the American public understands that they continue to hide and protect and deflect. Why does Donald Trump, the president continue to, in our opinion, to protect these powerful men? We're not going to stop until we get justice for the survivors.
ED O'KEEFE: The Justice Department says they released everything they can, and the rest are protected by attorney privilege, contain victim information or contain child sexual assault material. I know there's been a back and forth in recent days about a handful of names that were redacted, should have been unredacted. Turns out, they didn't have anything to do with it. They just happened to be in an event or in a photo with Jeffrey Epstein, basically. But I want to ask you about your investigation, a congressional investigation. You told the attorney general on Friday, it would take more than seven years for members to check the redactions on those three million pages, which sounds unrealistic, but is it your intent to review all of those documents to see what other information is there? What other names are either mentioned or missing?
REP. GARCIA: Absolutely. Look, we have a great team on the committee that's reviewing, right now, every single document, going through all the files that are available to the public, looking at redactions, trying to understand and piecing together an investigation. And it's not just the documents. We're interviewing survivors. We're talking to key witnesses.
ED O'KEEFE: Right.
REP. GARCIA: We're going to be holding hearings in the future as well. So all of that is part of this, but at the end of the day, they have not given us all the documents. So until we actually get the full set of files, this is not going to be a complete investigation, and the cover up that's being led by the White House and Pam Bondi is continuing, and the American public sees this, and so they need to release all of the files.
ED O'KEEFE: All right. Well, working with what you've got so far, what are you looking for specifically? Are there names? Are there events? Are there situations to clarify that they've been released or that they're out there? What is it you're looking for?
REP. GARCIA: Look, there's a variety of things. Number one is we want to ensure that all the names of the men that either were co-conspirators, those that themselves terrorized and brutalized women and children, those people need to be exposed. That work has begun. An additional piece of this is who is financing Jeffrey Epstein? So, for example, this upcoming week, we'll be interviewing Les Wexner, who is likely have been the single largest benefactor in providing financial support to Jeffrey Epstein. Where did he get all of his money and for what? And where was that money going? That is another critical part of this investigation. We've subpoenaed also the bank records, so we're going through all those and that information is critical to our investigation. And then, of course, is who was involved in the trafficking of girls and women? It wasn't just Ghislaine Maxwell. Why were there so many women being attacked in places across the country, whether it was New York, but also Palm Beach. You look at Mar-a-Lago, why was Mar-a-Lago a location where women continue to be trafficked from? So these are questions that we need to ask. We have questions for, for President Trump. And the broader- I think the broader issue here is why wasn't this investigated when these, when these, when these accusations and these stories actually were heard by the FBI years ago? Where was the investigation? Where was the DOJ? And this, by the way, is an issue not just in Republican administrations but also ones led by Democrats. We have to get answers.
ED O'KEEFE: Yeah. You mentioned Wexner, who you're interviewing this coming week. Have you heard back yet from the man formerly known as Prince Andrew?
REP. GARCIA: We have not, but we absolutely have sent letters. We want to actually talk to Prince Andrew And it's not just Prince And- former Prince Andrew.
ED O'KEEFE: Right.
REP. GARCIA: I mean, what's happening right now across- over in the UK is pretty stunning, and it's actually a show of what is- what happens when the government listens to the public.
ED O'KEEFE: Sure.
REP. GARCIA: There are actually things happening to those have been involved. That example, that's happening over there and in other parts of the world, needs to happen in our country, and the fact that the White House continues to cover up for these files and for these men, I think, is shameful. Release all the files today, and last thing, they keep claiming that, oh, well, there is a, you know, there's attorney-client privilege or there's interagency communication we can't put out to the public. That might be true in the Epstein Transparency Act, but it's not true in the subpoena that asked for the exact same documents that was passed last July and August. And so there is no reason why Congress shouldn't have all of the documents in front of us right now.
ED O'KEEFE: Let me ask you about a few more specific names. I've heard about the cover up that you're alleging by the White House. Let's work through some of these names. Peter Mandelson, the former British ambassador to the U.S. You heard back from him yet?
REP. GARCIA: We have not, but we absolutely want to talk to him.
(CROSSTALK)
ED O'KEEFE: Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick. He had said in an interview last year he hadn't seen Howard Lutnick in years. Turns out, he went to see his island off the U.S. Virgin Islands with his family back in 2012, and he had business interests with him in 2014. Are you working with Republican Chairman Jim Comer to bring Howard Lutnick in for questioning?
REP. GARCIA: We have asked Jamie Comer to bring in Howard Lutnick, and we have yet no, had no response. Not only did he visit the island, he had tons of communication with Jeffrey Epstein after it was already known that Jeffrey Epstein was essentially convicted for preying on children. So it is, it is shameful that he's actually in our government. He should not be the Commerce Secretary. He should come talk to the Oversight Committee.
ED O'KEEFE: The Oversight Committee also voted last month to hold Bill and Hillary Clinton in contempt of Congress for failing to show up for similar testimony. They're now scheduled to appear later this month for closed door testimony. What's the point of having them come in?
REP. GARCIA: Look, we've said from day one that we're willing to talk to anybody, whether they're Republicans or Democrats, whoever they are, whatever, how powerful they are. If you have information about Jeffrey Epstein, we want to talk to you. We've been saying that about, about President Clinton for a while. I'm glad that he's coming in. Look, the one thing I'll say, I think both President Clinton and Secretary Clinton have also added that they would like those hearings to be public.
ED O'KEEFE: Right.
REP. GARCIA: That's something that we absolutely support. We have questions for, for President Clinton. We'll be asking those in New York in the weeks ahead, as you know, but there's a lot of people that we need to speak with, and the more that we can have these conversations in public, I think it's better for the American people. It's what they want to see, and they want to understand what was the truth about Epstein, who he knew, where he got his money from and why has there been a constant focus on covering up his crimes by so many in government?
ED O'KEEFE: Congressman Robert Garcia, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, thank you for spending part of Sunday with us. We appreciate it, and we'll be right back.

How Jeffrey Epstein built the global network that protected him

"The minister glanced several times at his watch, so I took him aside and asked him to wait for half an hour. But it wasn't any use. Nobody came." This is how Francis Scott Fitzgerald, in 1925, described the pathetic funeral of Gatsby the Magnificent (The Great Gatsby), a mysterious man known for his extravagant parties and illegal fortune in the America of the Roaring Twenties. A century later, there was something of Gatsby in Jeffrey Epstein, the sexual predator who died alone in prison in the summer of 2019, after hosting some of the world's financial, political and cultural elite in a debauchery of sex and money. The recent release of thousands of new documents from the Epstein case revealed a worldwide grip, with unimaginable ramifications: threatening the British government and royalty, shaking Norway, implicating the International Olympic Committee and bringing down former French culture minister Jack Lang, with further ramifications in Russia and the Gulf states.
The comparison with Gatsby is not meant to excuse the financier's sexual crimes and child abuse, but rather to try to understand how one man – born in 1953 to a modest Jewish family in Brooklyn, the son of a municipal gardener and a childcare worker – managed to weave such a web of influence, from New York's wealthy elite to the scientific community of New England, passing through the global jet set, all with a sense of impunity. Without these connections, the predator probably could not have operated for so long.
Epstein was a predator, first convicted in 2008 for soliciting prostitution from a minor, but also a gangster who built his fortune on the back of Leslie Wexner, 88 years old, the driving force behind the global success of the Abercrombie & Fitch and Victoria's Secret brands. He was also a seducer, offering his guests access to his business networks, political discussions and lavish parties, and also girls – "very young," according to numerous witnesses – to those who wanted them.

If the Liberals stand any chance, Taylor must learn which fights not to pick

Opinion
If the Liberals stand any chance, Taylor must learn which fights not to pick
There are three elements that help determine whether an opposition leader will succeed. Angus Taylor, the newly elected leader of the Liberals, probably won’t need all three. Sometimes, just one is enough. Still, at this early stage, there are signs that Taylor may not have any.
The first is luck, also known as timing. Are you taking over at a time when the government is advantaged or disadvantaged by external events? Here, first impressions can be misleading. In Anthony Albanese’s first term, inflation seemed to dominate, a clear obstacle for the government. But in the end, other events – Donald Trump’s tariff war and his meeting with Volodymyr Zelensky – gave Labor a huge boost.
The second element is about your personal ability to command attention. It’s hard to comprehend just how hard this can be from opposition. Little of what you do has any impact – it’s all hypothetical. So how do you get the public to give you their time?
There are two main aspects here. One is political charisma. Bob Hawke is the exemplar, but it’s a stranger quality than his success suggests: it is a little like “star quality”, which can turn shy people into movie stars. Kevin Rudd was, on the face of it, a completely different proposition from Hawke. And yet Rudd, like Hawke, had some ineffable ability to reach voters through the camera.
This is a type of genius; and like all genius, it’s impossible to copy. This is unfortunate for Taylor, who does not possess it. In his first press conference as leader, Taylor improved when it was time for questions. In his prepared remarks, he appeared oddly low-energy, which is closer to his usual mode.
This is shallow stuff, so it is fortunate for all of us that personality and performance are not the only way to reach voters. Opposition is about making something out of nothing: turning particular policies into national issues. In his first term as opposition leader, Bill Shorten was skilled at this, destroying Joe Hockey’s “lifters and leaners” budget in 2014 and dictating much of the political agenda, much as Kevin Rudd had in 2007.
There are often pointers to the existence of this skill before a politician becomes leader. Rudd was a dynamo as shadow foreign affairs minister, particularly on the wheat-for-weapons scandal. As a minister, Shorten made the NDIS into a national cause. Taylor has not had any policy wins that anyone can remember.
That said, neither Anthony Albanese nor John Howard, as opposition leaders, were attention magnets. Both, however, understood the third element perfectly.
In 2024, this final element was explained by my former colleague, Lachlan Harris, who worked closely with Rudd on his successful campaign: “It usually takes several election losses for oppositions to learn that it’s often the things you don’t do that matter the most. The policies you don’t launch. The fights you don’t pick. The party shibboleths you don’t pursue. Opposition leaders must show restraint and restrain their party to prove they are ready to govern.
There are conflicting signals here from Taylor. On Friday, he emphasised two issues: “standard of living” and “protecting our way of life”. At the level of discipline, this is textbook – in Harris’ formula, “seeking to channel the voting public’s attention into a small number of carefully curated political fault lines”.
And yet on both topics, there are already doubts around whether Taylor can narrow them to issues on which most voters will be onside. “Senior sources” told The Australian before the leadership vote that Taylor “had been talking to colleagues about the party being full-throated on cultural issues like the primacy of the Australian national flag and caution on the overuse of Welcome to Country”. And indeed yesterday, speaking about immigration, Taylor said he wanted people “who are happy and proud to stand in front of the Australian flag”.
These are exactly the types of issues that helped paint Peter Dutton as a cultural warrior rather than an economic manager. Taylor’s repeated assertion that in immigration “standards have been too low” treads on similarly dangerous ground – especially when you add it to Jane Hume’s election reference to “Chinese spies” and Jacinta Nampijinpa Price’s comments about Indian migrants.
And here we come back to the question of timing.
Does Taylor understand contemporary Australia – a country in which almost one in three residents were born overseas? The same question arises with indications the Liberals will oppose any changes to the capital gains tax on property. This might work: opposing tax rises often does. But at this particular time in Australia, is standing against any measure with a chance of bringing down house prices a good idea? Or is this one of those fights you have to learn not to pick?
The final issue of timing is the most crucial.
It is likely the Coalition will get some poll boost from its new leadership. Some caution should be exercised here. As commentator Bernard Keane has pointed out, some of this will be the return of men who were unable to stomach a woman as leader. This leads into a crucial issue. There is a distinction between a section of the Coalition’s base returning and poll numbers that reflect a genuinely viable party of government.
This clash was illustrated by Sunday’s news that Charlotte Mortlock, founder and director of an organisation to promote women in the Liberal Party, had left both the organisation and the party. Is it still possible both to appeal to the party’s base and reach a wider group of voters? To win back both the voters who have left it for One Nation and voters who have left it for the teals? This is the problem Taylor’s ascent does not solve, at least not automatically. What if John Howard’s “broad church” simply makes no sense any more?
It is a big ask for Angus Taylor: to surprise us all, showing qualities as leader we have not yet glimpsed. But can the Liberal Party surprise us too, at this precarious moment in its history? That is an even bigger question.

Karen thought she had $3 million in her super. She can’t get hold of a cent

Karen thought she had $3 million in her super. She can’t get hold of a cent
“Dear Chris, still no funds in the bank. I now have significant debt on several credit cards and am running low on what is available to live on. Could someone please explain what is happening and when funds will be available?”
Karen Hedberg was getting desperate. Her email, sent last November, was one of many over several months seeking repayment of her $3 million in superannuation and answers from Christopher Edwards, her accountant. Most went unanswered.
After 50 years as a veterinarian, the 74-year-old believed she was retiring with a multimillion-dollar self-managed super fund.
Over the second half of last year, Hedberg had trouble extracting her funds and clarity about her investments from Edwards, who is also a solicitor. Hedberg now believes she might need to sell her home to survive. She is not alone.
More than 20 clients and staff of Edwards spoke to the Herald as part of this investigation. All except Hedberg and one other did so on the proviso of anonymity. Some feared it could jeopardise their chances of recovering their funds. Others were yet to tell their families about the potential financial loss.
Nearly all told similar stories. They claimed Edwards had talked them into rolling their superannuation into self-managed super funds (SMSFs), and/or loaning him considerable sums, which were invested into his developments.
Collectively, they allege Edwards owes them nearly $25 million.
An employee, who requested anonymity to discuss confidential workplace matters, estimated the 65-year-old held at least $100 million across more than 100 clients.
More than a dozen clients have alleged he has engaged in impropriety and unethical conduct. Almost all have attempted to withdraw some or all of the funds they claim they are owed. Fourteen alleged those efforts have so far been unsuccessful.
Clients have lodged complaints about Edwards with NSW Police, the corporate regulator, Tax Practitioners Board and Australian Taxation Office. Police did not confirm whether they were investigating.
Last September, Edwards was banned by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) from providing financial advice without a licence. Edwards has told clients the ban does not affect his business. The regulator has an ongoing investigation into Edwards.
Clients fear any intervention will come too late.
Approached outside his Richmond office this month, Edwards denied any wrongdoing.
Asked why he hadn’t repaid his clients, Edwards said the civil courts would “determine whether I have contractual obligations or not”. Asked whether he had done anything wrong, Edwards replied: “Correct. I haven’t.”
The problems underscore the risks in the loosely regulated SMSF sector, which has grown to about $1 trillion today and represents nearly one-quarter of the superannuation system.
Accountants have not been permitted to advise on SMSFs without a financial licence for a decade.
The clients
The themes of each client’s story were nearly identical. Many spoke of financial hardship and mental distress.
Six said they had known Edwards for decades – some while he was teaching in the late 1980s, others while he studied law at University of Technology Sydney. Many described the relationship as friendship; one described him as family.
Hedberg says she was convinced to transfer her financial affairs to Edwards given he was a solicitor. She claims she has not been provided with any copies of contracts or agreements with the companies where her savings have been invested.
Edwards’ promise of high returns enticed several clients: rates of up to 10 per cent paid quarterly was a common arrangement. A source said Edwards convinced him that the returns of his retail super fund were inferior. So he transferred nearly $1 million into one of Edwards’ company’s bank accounts.
Funds were invested in corporate entities – primarily property developments across NSW and Queensland – in which Edwards held a financial interest and served as director.
Sources who have dealt with Edwards and his business partners for decades say the arrangements appeared to be beneficial to both him and his clients.
Since 2023, clients allege interest payments have become increasingly delayed – some have not been paid at all. Correspondence shows various explanations: medical episodes, frozen bank accounts and promises of “something more concrete” in coming weeks.
A signed contract, provided to this masthead by one source, shows Edwards repeatedly missed quarterly payments, and failed to repay the principal within the 48-month term. Repayment was now more than a year overdue, according to the deed of agreement.
At least 10 clients were chasing Edwards by the end of 2025 for missing quarterly payments.
Susan Templeman, MP for Macquarie whose federal electorate encompasses Richmond, said: “Their distress is profound – the stress, the hours of work involved in trying to sort their affairs, as well as the financial implications that they have described.”
Those anxieties were exacerbated when an email from Edwards’ office landed in their inboxes. Payments would be delayed because Edwards had been admitted to hospital just before Christmas for a “routine floppy bladder operation”, it was explained, asking them to allow 10 additional business days for the “large settlement of funds”.
Another email arrived in mid-January: a promise that Edwards would soon provide a more concrete date as to when the cash would arrive.
‘The banning of me as a financial planner is interesting because I am not one. Speaking candidly, I do not want to be one.’Accountant Christopher Edwards
On January 13, dozens of clients were told the delay was caused by an industry super fund freezing investor funds because of internal issues. Edwards’ email added that, “more fundamentally”, the ASIC investigation had resulted in his bank accounts being frozen.
“This did lead to a run-on-the-banks situation where many people who had been contacted by ASIC or read the ASIC press release decided to withdraw capital or not proceed with their obligations to the company,” he wrote.
“As a director, it is for this reason I had to freeze all capital withdrawals and also point out that there were contractual obligations to the company and these had to remain in place.”
The ban
“The news flash is misleading,” Edwards emailed Hedberg in September.
“The banning of me as a financial planner is interesting because I am not one. Speaking candidly, I do not want to be one.”
The correspondence arrived on September 19, two days after ASIC announced Edwards would be barred from providing financial advice until 2035.
It was just one of many investigations ASIC was undertaking, Edwards emailed Hedberg, urging her not to “lose sleep over this”.
“Fundamentally and from your perspective, please be assured all is fine with your invested funds,” he wrote.
In a statement, ASIC alleged that Edwards provided financial advice with “sufficient system, repetition and continuity” over a four-year period, despite not holding a licence. The regulator held “serious concerns” about other aspects of his conduct, particularly, the “significant conflict of interest” between his personal interest in securing funding for his property development companies and his obligations as a lawyer and an accountant.
“ASIC found Mr Edwards’ conduct in approaching his accounting and legal clients and making recommendations that they invest in companies which he controls was particularly serious,” ASIC wrote.
Despite saying the ban has no bearing on his business, Edwards has applied for a review of ASIC’s decision in the Administrative Review Tribunal. He told this masthead via email that responding to further questions would be “inappropriate” in light of those proceedings.
The investments
Three of Edwards’ investments are a long way from completion.
For years, Edwards has been trying to convert a derelict, asbestos-ridden abattoir in Gunnedah, a small town west of Tamworth, into a solar energy farm. Several million dollars had been kicked into remediating the site, but Edwards has faced cashflow problems recently, an employee with insights into the project said.
A Gunnedah Shire Council spokeswoman said there was no evidence of physical commencement of two development applications for proposed solar projects on the site. Work had commenced on a third subdivision.
Through two of his companies – Great Northern Morayfield and Great Northern Developments – Edwards has two property developments planned in Queensland.
Edwards’ plans to build 39 homes in Morayfield, north of Brisbane, shows no movement. The project’s town planner requested City of Moreton Bay council provide a two-year extension last April, saying the developer had engaged a new builder while the “plans and proposal requires further investigations before they can move forward”.
A development in a suburb of Bundaberg – a 47-home community proposed by Great Northern Development – remained covered by grass.
Great Northern Development has run into trouble in the past. In figures provided to a receiver appointed in 2019, Edwards estimated the company’s assets were valued at $36.6 million against total liabilities of $34.4 million – a net position of $1.15 million.
The receiver did not respond to requests for comment.
Those figures were similar to financial statements Edwards provided a decade earlier during litigation ASIC brought against Great Northern Development.
The staff
ASIC has subpoenaed staff and clients as part of the latest investigation into Edwards.
After efforts to talk Edwards into returning their funds, clients have engaged lawyers. Two civil matters are listed in the NSW Supreme Court for the end of February.
To avoid winding up Great Northern Development during the ASIC case in 2010, Justice Richard White gave the company an undertaking to appoint a trustee to act as a “safe harbour” for clients’ funds. ASIC brokered a deal with La Trobe Financial. The asset manager took out formal mortgages over Edwards’ company’s development sites, meaning the land could be seized and investors paid back if the investment failed.
Last month, La Trobe issued Great Northern Development with default notices, requiring the company to make payment on debts by late February. If Edwards doesn’t comply, La Trobe can use its powers as a secured creditor to appoint a receiver, sell off assets and wind up the Edwards’ company.
A spokesman for La Trobe declined to comment.
The Herald has uncovered allegations that Edwards has breached signed contracts, and lodged tax returns falsely declaring third-party audits of the SMSF accounts had not been qualified.
The daughter of one elderly client claimed Edwards’ staff member walked her mother to the local Commonwealth Bank branch to withdraw hundreds of thousands of dollars to invest in his company. It was the last she saw of the money.
‘The ATO and ASIC. Why can’t they talk to each other? That’s the billion-dollar question.’Rakesh Sahgal
“It’s atrocious. He’s preying on vulnerable people,” she alleged, claiming Edwards was now failing to return calls or emails.
Two staff members claimed Edwards’ employees took clients to withdraw funds they believe ultimately went to his investments.
Rakesh Sahgal, one of the tax agents engaged by Edwards to audit his clients’ SMSF accounts, said he began refusing work from him after he issued a number of qualified reports because he could not independently corroborate the value of Edwards’ investments.
Sahgal said he reported Edwards to the Australian Taxation Office “so many times”.
“The ATO and ASIC. Why can’t they talk to each other? That’s the billion-dollar question,” he said.
A spokesperson for the ATO said: “The ATO is unable to comment due to our obligations under taxpayer confidentiality laws.”
“The ATO works alongside ASIC to regulate all self-managed super funds (SMSFs) and, where permitted under the confidentiality laws, will share information and other intelligence with ASIC that enables us to meet our joint objectives.”
A spokesman for the regulator said: “ASIC’s investigation into Mr Edwards remains ongoing. We cannot comment any further on an ongoing investigation.”

Isolated in a new country with her dying husband, Lidia didn’t want anyone to know
The Polish-born professor, physicist and air-quality expert, 73, was named one of the 100 Most Influential People of 2021 by Time magazine.
Each week, Benjamin Law asks public figures to discuss the subjects we’re told to keep private by getting them to roll a die. The numbers they land on are the topics they’re given. This week, he talks to Polish-born professor, physicist and air-quality expert Lidia Morawska. The 73-year-old was named one of the 100 Most Influential People of 2021 by Time magazine.
DEATH
Two weeks before you left Poland for Canada in the 1980s, you received news that your husband, Jan, had cancer. He eventually went into remission but, later, as you were leaving Canada for Australia in the 1990s, the cancer returned – and Jan passed away just over a year after arriving in Brisbane. Your children were 15 and 10. How did you navigate such a devastating loss? It definitely was very difficult. When we arrived in Brisbane [to take up a position at Queensland University of Technology], it was also a new country: new schools, new system, new position. But when you have a challenge, you deal with the challenge.
How old was Jan when he died? He was 39. He would have been 40 in November, the month after he died.
So young. And how old were you? He was a month younger than me.
Did anything help? All of our family was in Poland, so I was, in a way, completely alone. To be honest, I didn’t want anyone to know. If people know that you have a very big personal problem, you are treated a bit differently. Did I want to be treated differently? I didn’t. So it was only really in the last week, when it was very clear that it was the end and I couldn’t come to work, that I talked to the people at QUT. It was a very welcoming group of colleagues, so I felt immediately like I was among friends.
You’ve achieved so much: winning the David Sinclair Award [for excellence in aerosol science]; being listed as one of the Most Influential People in the world by Time magazine; winning a Prime Minister’s Prize for Science last year. Can you die happy? I don’t know. I certainly don’t have the feeling that I achieved everything that can be achieved in my area. We’re still in a not much different situation now than we were at the beginning of the pandemic in relation to indoor air quality. So this is the purpose now: to influence change.
SEX
Many scientific disciplines have been, historically, male-dominated. What was it like for you, as a woman, rising through the ranks in physics? I must say that for quite some time – maybe even until we were in Canada – I never thought about any issues around being a woman. I think the reason for this was that both my parents were educated. My mum had a degree in chemistry; my father had a degree in electrical engineering. There was that feeling that I could achieve whatever I wanted. But, in Canada, a mother of one of my daughter’s friends asked me, “Oh, how come you chose such a non-feminine topic?” I remember so vividly thinking, “What a silly question!”
What were the big social differences you noticed between Poland, Canada and Australia when it came to sex, relationships and romance? I don’t know whether these were topics of my conversations – maybe because when I left Poland, I already had family. At the same time, Poland is a very Catholic country, which is, of course, different to Canada and Australia. But still, there was a very liberal approach. I didn’t notice any major differences.
What do you find interesting and sexy about science? How do we make STEM disciplines appealing to young people? Well, everyone’s different and certain people are better at certain things. For example, as much as I love music or I love art, I cannot play instruments. It was very clear, at a young age, that I can listen, but I can’t make music. If we were all good at the same things, I guess the world would be very boring! But the other aspect is about making all these choices available to kids at a young age. And I had all those choices. It’s not about making things sexy: it’s about making them available.
POLITICS
You want to mandate good indoor air quality in Australia. To do that, though, you need to work with policy-makers. How are you finding the task? The biggest problem is that there is not just one government body responsible for this. If we are talking about outdoor air, it’s very clear: there’s one body in every state. But in relation to indoor air quality, there are residential buildings and public buildings. Mandating quality in residential buildings is pretty much impossible. And each type of public building belongs to a different government portfolio. So starting this conversation is very difficult.
What’s been your experience of engaging with politicians? It’s extremely frustrating. It’s obvious that this is a very basic thing we need and it isn’t being done. But it’s not simply the fault of politicians who don’t listen: it’s a much more complex problem. If people don’t realise there are problems with air quality or pollution, they don’t put pressure on politicians to effect change.
‘It’s extremely frustrating. It’s obvious that this is a very basic thing we need and it isn’t being done.’Professor Lidia Morawska
Does winning a Prime Minister’s Prize for Science help? I hope so!
What do you think constitutes good leadership? You have to have a vision. On the other hand, a good leader must also listen and not assume that what they think is the right direction is how something must be done. In particular, listen to those who have opposing views. Sometimes – as much as it might sound like complete nonsense – when you get to the bottom of what they’re saying, you start to see their point. And that point may require you to modify how you address things.
Many people look up to you, Lidia. Have you ever considered running for political office? Definitely not. Again, it’s about knowing what you are good at!

Gwenneth went to her local pub for a drink. Police found her body nine days later

Gwenneth went to her local pub for a drink. Police found her body nine days later
Malthouse Tavern was heaving when a bartender picked up the phone to call a taxi for a drunk woman at the bar.
The woman had been sitting at the Balga pub for most of the afternoon drinking and chatting to other patrons, but as midnight approached it was clear she’d had a bit too much.
It was the night before the WA Football League’s grand final, the crowd was restless and scattered, and a fight had broken out in the nearby car park as a barman ushered the woman out the front door.
She tottered into the car park with two beer bottles in a brown paper bag clutched in her hands to wait for her lift.
Police have never been able to say for certain if she got into a taxi that night. But they can say Gwenneth Graham’s body turned up nine days later.
50 years with no answers
The murder of Gwen Graham has remained unsolved for more than 50 years, and currently sits with WA Police’s cold case unit.
The case involved canvassing 4000 people, checking hundreds of cars and interviewing dozens of people of interest, but no one has ever been charged over the 46-year-old’s murder.
There are hopes a new $1 million reward could be the missing piece that finally helps detectives solve her death.
“Police continue to believe that someone in the community knows what happened, and it is time for that information to be shared,” a WA police spokesperson said.
“Her death was a devastating act of violence, and those responsible have never been held to account.”
A funny, quick and modern woman
Graham had two children before she was murdered.
She had been married a total of three times, and her eldest son, Steven, was from a relationship with motorcycle mechanic Bill.
“She was loving,” said Steven Wrightson, now 77 years old.
“She made me feel really loved.”
Wrightson has memories of sitting around with his mother while his father was at work, listening to their radio to pass the time.
He remembers her as warm, funny and charming – but also much more than a mother.
Records indicate when Graham – then named Gwen Murray — lied about her age to join the Australian Army in an administrative role.
She was also always on the move. She lived in Perth’s inner and outer suburbs, and even resided in the regional town of Geraldton for some time.
Wrightson, who strongly resembles his mother, said he was just six years old when his parents broke up, and he was forced to mainly stay in touch with her through letters and the occasional run-in on the streets of Perth.
He recalls visiting her in her new home in Balga for lunch at her state housing home.
“She had a nice little place,” Steven said.
“She kept a nice, very, very clean house, and she was a good cook.
“That was the last time I saw her until I found out about what happened.”
Bush in the city
Back in 1974, Balga was a patchwork of state housing, campsites, swamp, dirt tracks and bushland.
Children roamed freely, and wild horses and dogs would come and go as they pleased. The local pub was a central meeting point, as was the Balga Bazaar. One local remembered Balga as a typical pit stop for people moving in from the outback to the city.
“The street we lived in – we knew the neighbours on both sides, and we knew the people up the street. I was always outside running around looking for something to shoot with my brother,” he told this masthead.
“We played cricket, had running races, and all sorts out on the streets … it was a very new area, and it was just being established.
“It was all bush and dirt. But, paradise for a kid.”
Another remembered the sense of safety the suburb had for local kids.
“Back in the 70s, everyone knew everyone. I knew everyone on my street … I felt very safe there and I loved it. We were surrounded by bush.”
New to the neighbourhood
Graham was relatively new to the area in September 1974, and was living on Felpham Avenue in Balga with her husband Tom, where the couple had plans to buy the state housing property they lived in.
Tom worked at a nearby confectionary store making marshmallows and chocolate. He was Graham’s third marriage at the age of 46.
By today’s standards, the couple would have been considered as being in an open relationship, and Graham would often go to bars, sometimes disappearing for weeks at a time.
Tom – who was 10 years her senior – seemed unbothered by the arrangement.
On the night of her murder, the couple went their separate ways. Tom, to the nearby John Barleycorn Hotel in Nollamara, and Graham to the Malthouse Tavern in Balga.
Tom later told the papers the couple had gone to different venues because Graham had previously been “warned off” from returning to the Nollamara pub, for reasons unknown.
“Instead, she went to the newly-opened Malthouse Tavern where she was not well known,” he told local media at the time.
Tom was not surprised to come home to an empty house on the evening of September 27.
All he found was a note pinned to the door: “Don’t lock me out. Just wait as usual – Blondie”.
Tom said he didn’t call his wife Blondie, and noticed later on the writing on the note had deteriorated as it went on, perhaps indicating she had already had a bit to drink by the time she left the house.
He would later find out that “Blondie” was a nickname Graham had been given by her former husband, Steven’s father Bill, years prior – a private joke between them, given her hair was actually reddish brown.
Tom wasn’t concerned.
“She had been in the habit of going off drinking and had done it several times previously,” Tom would later tell the now-defunct Daily News.
“Plenty of times she had cleared off.”
It wasn’t until four days later he lodged a missing person’s report with the local police.
“My worry had built up,” he said at the time.
Gwen’s last night
For five days after Tom made his report, his home was quiet. Graham didn’t come home, and didn’t make any attempt to make contact. Bar staff remembered walking her to the door at the tavern but couldn’t remember whether they had seen her get into a taxi or accept another lift. By all accounts, she had disappeared into the evening.
In fact, the only sign Graham had even left the pub was found on the side of the road, about a 10-minute walk away from the tavern.
An unnamed Aboriginal woman had been walking on Redcliffe Avenue on the morning of October 2, about a week after Gwen left the pub.
She would later tell police she was walking near bushland when she found a pair of shoes discarded on the side of the road, and picked them up. Locals said they’d been lying there for about a week before the woman collected them.
She decided to bring them to a friend as a gift, and walked on.
If she had looked further, police said she would have also come across some discarded women’s underclothes and a white handbag thrown haphazardly into the shrub.
And just a few hundred metres away, she would have found a woman’s body concealed under an abandoned old refrigerator.
WAtoday is revisiting the case of Gwenneth Graham on the back of the renewed reward for information put forward by police. Part two of the series will be published later this week.

The banks’ fight over $285b in ‘free money’ has a lesson for savers

The banks’ fight over $285b in ‘free money’ has a lesson for savers
When the Reserve Bank raised interest rates this month, most of the media’s gaze was on how the hike would sting people with mortgages. There’s been relatively little said about savers – probably because our hefty levels of household debt leave many people exposed to even fairly small rate rises.
This suits banks nicely. If the humble savings account gets far less scrutiny from politicians and the press than home loans, that makes it easier for banks to get away with tricky pricing.
Lately, however, financial markets have been paying plenty of attention to the $1.7 trillion market for people’s deposits, where there’s a growing fight between banks.
This battle for deposits is important for bank customers and shareholders alike. It has the potential to help people get a better return on their money, while for the big banks, serious profits are at stake.
A crucial reason big banks can make so much money is their easy access to deposits – a low-cost and stable form of funding, much of which comes from households. Banks benefit from the fact that deposits worth up to $250,000 are guaranteed by taxpayers. If banks can access this money more cheaply, it’s a big advantage to their shareholders, and if a bank can hold your money without paying any interest on it, even better for them.
As a result, it’s long been the case that most banks will come up with all sorts of ways to attract enough deposit money so they’re well funded, but also not pay out too generously. Typically, it means offering “bonus” or “reward” accounts that pay a decent rate of interest, but only if you jump through a bunch of complex hoops, such as growing your balance every month, or not making withdrawals.
While these sorts of rules obviously help the bank make more money, they mean that many customers get dudded out of a decent rate of interest on their money.
A 2023 report from the competition watchdog found more than two-thirds of “bonus” interest accounts didn’t receive any bonus interest at all. And if you don’t qualify for “bonus” interest, the “base” rate that you do get paid is typically miserly. Canstar said on Friday that the base rates on “bonus” savers for the big four ranged between 0.01 per cent and 0.25 per cent.
Why is this relevant today? Well, lately, deposit pricing has been on the agenda for a couple of reasons.
First, when official interest rates change, banks often use it as an opportunity to quietly “re-price” their own rates (changing their interest rates by a different amount to the RBA, in a way that suits the bank’s bottom line). Re-pricing mortgages risks a political backlash, but it’s easier for banks to do it on savings accounts.
Second, there’s been much discussion in financial markets about the rise of Macquarie Group, which is trying to disrupt the deposit market, as it has done in home loans.
Macquarie has sought to lure customers by avoiding the complex terms and conditions on savings accounts, and offering an interest rate that’s competitive, without the need to make deposits or a minimum number of transactions.
It’s grabbed a lot of business, doubling its market share from 3.1 to 6.3 per cent since 2020. Like “challenger” brands often do, it’s also taking shots at the bigger incumbents, saying the big four are sitting on about $285 billion in bank deposits that pay zero interest – what Barrenjoey analyst Jonathan Mott calls “free money”. (Macquarie has $5 billion in zero interest deposits from its business customers.)
When interest rates are rising, that “free money” becomes even more valuable to a bank because it still costs the bank nothing, but now it can lend that money out at a higher rate.
Macquarie is clearly doing this for its commercial own goals – it is known as the Millionaires’ Factory for a reason. But all the same, it is difficult to argue with more competition in a concentrated sector such as banking.
As Reserve Bank officials told a parliamentary hearing this month, there’s often less competitive pressure in the deposit market than in home loans, where mortgage brokers have educated much of the borrowing public that they need to regularly shop around for a decent rate.
RBA governor Michele Bullock told the hearing that compared with mortgages, it takes the public longer to think about switching for a better deal on their deposit account.
Bullock reminded customers of an age-old lesson in banking and finance: inertia is the enemy of a good deal. “It comes back to that people are always encouraged to look around for the best deal in mortgages, so look around for the best deal on deposit rates as well. Don’t just sit there. But people sometimes are a bit prone to inertia,” she said.
For the wider banking industry, on the other hand, Macquarie’s attempt to pinch their low-cost deposits is another competitive threat, and it comes just after Macquarie’s home loan onslaught.
For some analysts, such as Jarden’s Matthew Wilson, the disruptive threat of Macquarie’s deposit push is a major long-term threat to bank profits. Wilson, who has a “buy” rating on Macquarie, sees the complex terms and conditions that banks put on deposit accounts as an “unnecessary source of disgruntlement” for customers, and he sees the major banks’ deposit pricing tactics as leaving them open to disruption.
So far, however, recent results suggest Macquarie’s aggressive push for deposits isn’t having a huge impact on the big four banks. Commonwealth Bank last week said it had expanded its already dominant position in its latest half, including winning more deposits that pay no interest.
But over the longer term, Macquarie’s rapid expansion into mortgages has proven it can shake up the retail banking oligopoly. Whether the Millionaires’ Factory can keep on grabbing customers from the big four (and from other banks) looks set to remain one of the most intriguing battles in the local banking industry for years to come.
For customers, the fight brewing over deposits is good news, but as Bullock reminded people, it also requires customers to look around for a good deal. It will be interesting to see how many people follow her advice.

Looming shift in US Navy strategy bodes well for Australia’s subs

Looming shift in US Navy strategy bodes well for Australia’s subs
Washington: The United States Navy is preparing for a significant shift in its plans that could reduce its reliance on Virginia-class attack submarines, potentially making it easier for Australia to acquire the vessels as planned under the AUKUS agreement.
There are also signs the lagging rate of US submarine production is improving, with one shipyard boasting of a 14 per cent jump in productivity and saying the Virginia-class boats had a “very good year”.
The navy has recently advertised its plans for a “hedge strategy” that moves away from reliance on large and expensive aircraft strike carrier groups towards more flexible and adaptable fleets. The shift responds to what Chief of Naval Operations Daryl Caudle called “fiscal, industrial and operational realities”.
A January briefing paper by the Congressional Research Service cited a recent report in Jane’s Navy International, a specialist military publication, which revealed the navy was contemplating cutting its target number of attack submarines from its long-time goal of 66 to 54 – only slightly more than it has now.
The Jane’s report was based on draft plans for the so-called Golden Fleet, the navy’s next fleet iteration, that were seen by the author and under consideration by navy leadership.
If confirmed, the change would be significant because it would reduce the US Navy’s reliance on the Virginia-class subs, making it more likely that it can “spare” some for Australia. Under AUKUS, Canberra is due to purchase three to five boats, starting in 2032.
Bryan Clark, director of the Centre for Defence Concepts and Technology at the Hudson Institute, who has worked directly with the navy on its force level planning, confirmed it was heading in that direction.
He said the navy wanted to build a new generation of large-diameter submarines, as well as new unmanned vessels, making it unrealistic to keep growing the fleet of Virginias.
“I think the impact of the AUKUS subs on the US submarine inventory is decreasing over time,” Clark told this masthead. “Their long-term need for Virginia [subs] is going down a little bit. They’re seeing these uncrewed systems as a way of addressing what they need, so they don’t require a submarine any more.”
Clark said it was too early to be certain if the navy would actually reduce its target for the Virginia-class boats. “But I think internally they are starting to lock it down.”
The Pentagon directed inquiries to the navy, which didn’t respond to questions before deadline.
Since US President Donald Trump confirmed the AUKUS agreement was “full steam ahead” in October, the major roadblocks to the first stage of Pillar I remain the capacity of the US industrial base to produce enough of the submarines, and the US’s need for them.
Under AUKUS legislation, the US president of the day must be satisfied that the transfer of any submarine to Australia “will not degrade the United States’ undersea capabilities”.
The official production rate given by the navy last April was 1.13 vessels a year, but it needs to be at least 2.0. Caudle told his confirmation hearing that the rate needed to double for the US to fulfil its AUKUS commitments to Australia, and at the Apex Defence Forum in Washington last month, he noted that the US defence industrial base “continues to lag well below demand”.
However, there are limited signs that production is improving. The Virginia-class vessels are built by two US companies: General Dynamics Electric Boat (GDEB) and Huntington Ingalls Industries (HII) – the only two shipyards capable of building nuclear-powered submarines.
On an earnings call earlier this month, HII reported a 14 per cent increase in throughput – or productivity – on the Virginia-class boats in 2025.
“There’s an incremental walk-up in throughput required to get to the two Virginia-class per year. But they had a very good year last year,” the company’s president, Chris Kastner, said on the call.
The navy has also reported a slight improvement in progress on its first Columbia-class submarine. Head of strategic submarines Todd Weeks told the West 2026 conference that the vessel was tracking for delivery in 2028 instead of 2029.
The aforementioned Congressional Research Service report garnered attention in Australia for presenting an alternative option to AUKUS, whereby instead of selling submarines to Australia, the US Navy could operate up to eight of the vessels from Australian ports. However, that idea is not new, and has been part of the report in every update since June 2024.
Caudle called AUKUS “one of the most consequential defence partnerships of our lifetime” when he addressed the Naval Submarine League in San Diego last week.
“It’s not just about boats. It’s about shared deterrence, interoperability at the deepest levels, and a long-term commitment to peace through strength in the Indo-Pacific,” he said.
“It also sends an unmistakable message – our undersea advantage is collective, united and formidable, and we intend to keep it that way.”

First GreenWay, now ‘MetroWay’: Sydney’s next cycling route revealed
Residents in Sydney’s south-west will be able to walk, run or cycle along a 13.8-kilometre shared path linking Sydenham and Bankstown under plans to install the track alongside the final stage of the M1 metro rail line.
The project, dubbed the “MetroWay”, will follow the rail corridor and intersect with the six-kilometre GreenWay bike and pedestrian path at Dulwich Hill, connecting users to the route between the Cooks River and Iron Cove.
Transport Minister John Graham said the MetroWay would provide a “city-shaping active transport link” between Marrickville’s pubs and cafés, and the restaurants of Campsie and Bankstown, via Canterbury and Lakemba.
“Combining the MetroWay with the GreenWay will completely unlock the south-west and the inner west for runners, walkers and cyclists,” Graham said.
Commuters in the city’s south-western suburbs have endured lengthy disruptions to the final stage of the M1 metro rail project between Sydenham and Bankstown, which is due to open in the second half of this year.
The shared path will include trees, public art, rest stops, lights and signs. It will link to more than 350 bike spaces at rail stations in the south-west, which the government hopes will spur more people to leave their car at home.
Residents face a long wait for the project, as tenders open this week. A contract is expected to be awarded later this year, and early works should begin soon after. The government has declined to give an estimated cost or completion date for the project.
Graham said the path would connect stations along the M1 metro rail line with existing and planned bike networks and that it would be designed for people of all ages and riding abilities.
“This mega-project is about so much more than building a metro — it’s about housing uplift, new public spaces and ways of getting active,” Graham said.
The final sections of the $57 million GreenWay cycling and pedestrian route opened in December, connecting popular exercise routes along the Cooks River in Earlwood, and the Bay Run loop at Iron Cove.
Summer Hill MP Jo Haylen said the MetroWay would provide “a safe continuous pathway from Bankstown right through to the Iron Cove, connecting to the Greenway and the Bay Run”.
“This is about giving locals real options to walk, ride, and stay active, making our neighbourhoods better connected and easier to get around,” she said.
The final stage of the M1 metro line was due to be opened in late 2025 after a 12-month shutdown of the old heavy rail line. It was later delayed until the second half of this year.
Graham declined to give a target opening date for the project last month, prompting the NSW opposition to push for an explanation as to when services would start.
About 80 per cent of work to convert the existing heavy rail line between Sydenham and Bankstown to metro train standards has been completed, and high-speed testing has ramped up.
A metro train last month travelled the entire length of the 66-kilometre M1 line from Tallawong to Bankstown via the city, stopping at all 31 stations. The train reached speeds of 100km/h on the final section between Sydenham and Bankstown. Six trains are currently being used for testing along the route.

Board of Peace members pledge over $5B for Gaza reconstruction, humanitarian aid: Trump

US President Donald Trump said Board of Peace member states will announce at an upcoming meeting on Thursday a pledge of more than $5 billion for reconstruction and humanitarian efforts in Gaza.
In a post on Truth Social on Sunday, Trump wrote that member states have also committed thousands of personnel toward a UN-authorised stabilisation force and local police in the Palestinian enclave.
The US president said Thursday's gathering, the first official meeting of the group, will take place at the Donald J. Trump Institute of Peace, which the State Department recently renamed after the president. Delegations from more than 20 countries, including heads of state, are expected to attend.
The board's creation was endorsed by a United Nations Security Council resolution as part of the Trump administration's plan to end the Israeli war on Gaza.
Israel and Hamas agreed to the plan last year, with a ceasefire officially taking effect in October, although Tel Aviv has repeatedly violated it.
According to Gaza's Health Ministry, more than 590 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli troops in the territory since the ceasefire began.
While regional Middle East powers including Türkiye, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Israel—as well as emerging nations such as Indonesia— have joined the board, global powers and traditional Western US allies have been more cautious.

After Bnei Brak riots, IDF chief Zamir slams police for failing to protect soldiers

IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir spoke with two female soldiers who were attacked earlier Sunday during a military mission in the ultra-Orthodox city of Bnei Brak, expressing support and demanding accountability for those responsible.
“I asked to speak with you to tell you that the IDF and I stand fully and clearly behind you,” Zamir told the soldiers, according to a statement from the military. “No one may harm your dignity or interfere with the important mission you are carrying out.”
The military said Zamir assured the soldiers they have his full backing and that of the entire defense establishment. “We will investigate the incident to ensure it does not happen again,” he said. “A reality in which IDF soldiers cannot move freely within the State of Israel is intolerable and must be addressed. We will not accept harm to our soldiers, and I expect those who attacked you to be brought to justice.”
Earlier, during the unrest, Zamir issued a sharply worded condemnation, calling the attack on the soldiers “a serious crossing of a red line” and urging firm action against those involved.
The disturbances erupted after word spread among residents that the soldiers had arrived to distribute draft notices. The IDF said the two were in the city as part of a welfare visit related to their military duties.
During the unrest, three police officers were injured. Police used stun grenades to disperse the crowd and deployed a helicopter to the area. In one incident captured on video, a man pushing a baby stroller was seen near officers as stun grenades were thrown, shouting at them to stop.
Tel Aviv District Police Commander Haim Sargarof criticized the lack of coordination with the military. “The army must coordinate entry into the city with us,” he said at the scene. “When they enter without coordinating with us, we are left to respond.”
He said police are reviewing camera footage to identify those involved. “We have reached the person who set the motorcycle on fire. We need to carry out the arrests and restore quiet for residents who need to know there will be zero tolerance for disorder,” he said.

US boards oil tanker in Indian Ocean after tracking from Caribbean
Pentagon says Veronica III attempted to 'defy' Trump quarantine
ISTANBUL
US forces boarded sanctioned oil tanker Veronica III overnight in the Asia-Pacific region, the Defense Department said on Sunday.
"Overnight, US forces conducted a right-of-visit, maritime interdiction and boarding of the Veronica III without incident in the INDOPACOM area of responsibility," the department said on the US social media company X.
The vessel "tried to defy President (Donald) Trump's quarantine -- hoping to slip away," according to the statement. "We tracked it from the Caribbean to the Indian Ocean, closed the distance, and shut it down."
The Pentagon said it "will deny illicit actors and their proxies freedom of movement in the maritime domain."
The boarding marks the latest in a series of such operations by US forces. It had previously boarded a crude oil tanker named Aquila II in the same area of responsibility.
The Veronica III is listed on the US Treasury Department's Specially Designated Nationals sanctions list for engaging in "illegal transportation" of sanctioned Iranian oil on behalf of the National Iranian Oil Company and China Concord Petroleum Company, according to OpenSanctions data.
The Panama-flagged tanker, built in 2006 and previously named Symphonic, Veronica and White Nova, is affiliated with Shanghai Future Ship Management Co Ltd, which Washington sanctioned in December 2024 for activities in Iran's oil sector.

Russia blasts 'fake' claims that opposition figure Navalny died by poisoning
Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova says West tries to divert attention from its own problems
MOSCOW
Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova called "fake" a statement by five European nations claiming opposition figure Alexey Navalny died after being poisoned with a dart frog toxin.
Speaking in an interview with multiple Russian outlets, Zakharova said the Western countries are trying to divert attention from their internal problems.
"There will be test results, there will be formulas of the substances -- then there will be a comment," she said. "Without this, all statements and talk are a fake aimed at diverting attention from the pressing problems of the West."
The spokeswoman pointed out that the news appeared "at the moment when it would be necessary to present the results of the investigation into Nord Stream pipeline explosion.
The 2022 sabotage of the Nord Stream pipelines was an unprecedented attack that caused extensive damage to the infrastructure connecting Russia and Germany beneath the Baltic Sea.
Serhii Kuznietsov, a former Ukrainian army officer accused of being involved in the sabotage, was arrested in Italy. The Ukrainian government has repeatedly denied any involvement.
On Saturday, Germany, the UK, the Netherlands, Sweden, and France released a joint statement, alleging Navalny was poisoned using epibatidine, a poison extracted from the skin of the Ecuadorian poison dart frog.
The conclusion was made based on an analysis of samples of Navalny's biological materials, according to the statement.
Moscow announced Navalny’s death in a Siberia prison in February 2024 while he was serving a 19-year sentence on charges of extremism.

Syrian army takes over al-Shaddadi base after US withdrawal

Syrian army takes over al-Shaddadi base after US withdrawal
The move, in coordination with the US, is the latest implementation of the ceasefire agreement with Kurdish-led forces.
The Syrian army has taken over the al-Shaddadi military base in the northeast of the country following the withdrawal of United States troops, as part of a ceasefire arrangement with the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF).
Syria’s Ministry of Defence announced on Sunday that “forces of the Syrian Arab Army have taken over the al-Shaddadi military base in the Hasakah countryside following coordination with the American side”.
The US had been operating in al-Shadaddi since 2016, after Kurdish-led forces seized it from ISIL (ISIS). On Thursday, the Syrian army also took control of the US base of al-Tanf, near the border with Iraq and Jordan.
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters that the implementation of the ceasefire agreement was “headed in a positive direction”.
“There’s been some days that have been very concerning, but we like the trajectory,” he said. “We have to keep it on that trajectory. We’ve got good agreements in place. The key now is implementation, and we’ll be very involved in that regard.”
He noted that similar agreements needed to be reached with the Druze, Bedouin and Alawite communities in the country.
“We think that outcome, as difficult as it’s been, is far better than the Syria that would have been broken up into eight pieces, with all kinds of fighting going on, all kinds of mass migration, so we feel very positive about that.”
Reduced US presence
Reporting from Aleppo, Al Jazeera correspondent Heidi Pett said residents near al-Shaddadi said in recent days that they were hearing “explosions and seeing fires at the base as Americans destroy remaining material because they’ve been preparing to leave there for a number of weeks”.
“This is part of a broader change in US strategy in the region moving towards partnering directly with the Syrian government,” she said.
The US has been reducing its military footprint in Syria for months, going from 1,500 personnel in July to about 900 currently.
It has been consolidating its ground presence to Tower 22 in Jordan, although it continues to carry out air strikes on ISIL targets in Syria, with US Central Command (CENTCOM) announcing it had conducted 10 air strikes on 30 targets during the February 3-12 period, and killed or captured more than 50 people in two months.
CENTCOM’s commander Admiral Brad Cooper said in a statement that US forces would “remain poised to respond to any [ISIS] threats that arise”.

Powered by women, ‘Wuthering Heights’ digs up $34.8 million at the box office for a No. 1 debut
Powered by women, ‘Wuthering Heights’ digs up $34.8 million at the box office for a No. 1 debut
Emerald Fennell’s bold reimagining of “Wuthering Heights” brought crowds of women to movie theaters this weekend. The Warner Bros. release topped the box office charts and nabbed the title for the year’s biggest opening with $34.8 million in ticket sales in its first three days in North American theaters, according to studio estimates Sunday. According to PostTrak polling, an estimated 76% of those ticket buyers were women. By the end of Monday’s Presidents Day holiday, the total could rise to $40 million from its 3,682 locations.
The romantic drama starring Margot Robbie and Jacob Elordi as the star-crossed Catherine and Heathcliff, won out over the weekend’s other newcomers, including the animated “GOAT” and the heist thriller “Crime 101.” Its biggest day was Saturday’s Valentine’s Day holiday, where it earned $14 million. “Wuthering Heights” is also performing even better internationally, where it’s expecting to rake in an additional $42 million from 76 territories.
The Warner Bros./MRC production cost a reported $80 million to produce, not accounting for the millions spent on marketing and promotion. If the four-day totals match the estimates, that makes for a strong $82 million global debut. And the film still has several big openings on the horizon, in Japan and Vietnam on Feb. 27, and in China on March 13.
The success comes while the future of Warner Bros. hangs in the balance, as Paramount continues to sweeten its hostile takeover bid in hopes of winning out over Netflix. “Wuthering Heights” is the studio’s ninth No. 1 opening in a row.
Fennell’s version of “Wuthering Heights,” which takes many liberties with Emily Brontë’s novel, largely divided critics. It’s currently sitting at a mixed 63% on Rotten Tomatoes. While that didn’t dissuade audiences from buying tickets, only 51% of the opening weekend audience said that they would “definitely recommend” the film to friends. Moviegoers also gave it a less-than-stellar B CinemaScore.
The mid-February weekend has hosted big superhero movies on occasion, including “Black Panther” and “Deadpool,” but a more relevant comparison is “Fifty Shades of Grey” and its two sequels. The first movie opened to over $85 million, the third to $38.6 million.
“This was a solid if not record-breaking Presidents Day/Valentines weekend,” said Paul Dergarabedian, who heads marketplace trends for Comscore. “But that was to be expected without an MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe) film.”
“GOAT,” an animated Sony release produced by basketball star Stephen Curry, landed in second place with an estimated $26 million from 3,863 locations. It’s projected to bring in another $6 million on Monday, which would bring its four day total to $32 million — the biggest animated debut since “Elemental” in 2023. It also pulled in $15.6 million internationally, bringing its global total to $47.6 million.
The family-friendly film was the only new opener of the weekend to get an A CinemaScore. Sony Pictures Animation was also behind “KPop Demon Hunters.”
In third place, “Crime 101” made an estimated $15.1 million in its first three days. Amazon MGM Studios opened the Chris Hemsworth and Mark Ruffalo led Los Angeles-set thriller in 3,161 theaters. It’s expected to pull in about $17.8 million by the end of Monday, but the movie has a long way to go to even hit its production budget, which reportedly exceeded $90 million. Audiences, who were 56% men, also gave “Crime 101” a B CinemaScore.
“Send Help” and “Solo Mio” rounded out the top five with $9 million and $6.4 million, respectively. Further down the charts, at No. 7, was Briarcliff Entertainment’s sci-fi comedy “Good Luck, Have Fun, Don’t Die,” starring Sam Rockwell and Haley Lu Richardson. It made an estimated $3.6 million from 1,610 locations.
The Walt Disney Studios also celebrated a milestone this weekend, becoming the first studio to cross $1 billion at the global box office in 2026, driven almost entirely by “Avatar: Fire and Ash,” but also helped by the continued success of “Zootopia 2,” which remains in the top 10 after twelve weekends in theaters.
The weekend is down significantly from the same weekend last year, when “Captain America: Brave New World” opened, but the pace is starting to pick up and theaters have “Scream 7” and “Project Hail Mary” on the horizon.
“It’s been a rather slow first quarter,” Dergarabedian said. “But this could ignite a spark at the box office.”
Top 10 movies by domestic box office
With final domestic figures being released Tuesday, this list factors in the estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore:
1. “Wuthering Heights,” $34.8 million.
2. “GOAT,” $26 million.
3. “Crime 101,” $15.1 million.
4. “Send Help,” $9 million.
5. “Solo Mio,” $6.4 million.
6. “Zootopia 2,” $3.8 million.
7. “Good Luck, Have Fun, Don’t Die,” $3.6 million.
8. “Avatar: Fire and Ash,” $3.3 million.

Should people with autism and very high needs have a separate diagnosis? Takeaways from AP’s report

Should people with autism and very high needs have a separate diagnosis? Takeaways from AP’s report
As the definition of autism has widened, there’s been a growing push to create a new diagnosis, called profound autism, for those who need constant and lifelong care.
The reason? To ensure that they get the support and services they need.
Judith Ursitti, president of the Profound Autism Alliance, said people in this category now lack appropriate treatments, support and enough providers trained to handle their level of care. And the vast majority of clinical research doesn’t include them.
“If you don’t have research, you won’t have treatments. You won’t have achievable services and supports,” said Ursitti, whose adult son has profound autism. “There are people across the spectrum who have high support needs that are intermittent. The difference with our population is they’re constant.”
Autism rates have been rising for decades, and two of the main reasons for the increase have, in a strange twist, taken some of the focus off of helping people with round-the-clock needs. The diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder is now very broad, including many people with low support needs. Also, better awareness of the condition has helped many more children get diagnosed than in the past — and most of those cases are relatively mild.
At the same time, the Trump Administration is promoting unproven and debunked claims about what causes autism, which experts say muddles efforts to understand the condition and fuels misinformation that threatens public health, even as officials funnel more money into research.
Overall in the U.S., an estimated 1 in 31 children has autism spectrum disorder.
Researchers estimate around a quarter have “profound autism,” a term introduced in 2021 by a group of experts, the Lancet Commission. It describes people who need constant care for life, have a certain level of intellectual disability and are nonverbal or minimally verbal.
In the past, these people may have been diagnosed with autistic disorder – one of five subtypes, along with Asperger’s, of a diagnosis called pervasive developmental disorders. But in 2013, the American Psychiatric Association removed that diagnosis and created autism spectrum disorder.
Some in the autism community worry that creating a separate diagnosis of profound autism would reduce attention on the broader spectrum and the individual needs of everyone on it.
Dena Gassner, an autistic senior research scientist at Drexel University and mother of an autistic adult with moderate support needs, said she struggles with the idea of assigning someone the label of profound autism. She said it could be stigmatizing.
She said there’s nothing wrong with being autistic; the problem lies in “the massive lack of supports and services” in our society. “We need to come together in a unified voice to talk about services for the entirety of the spectrum.”
Andy Shih, chief science officer for Autism Speaks, said no matter where people fall on the debate about profound autism, “there’s absolutely no doubt that we need to elevate awareness about the needs of this group.”

Israel will begin contentious West Bank land registration in new step to deepen control

Israel will begin contentious West Bank land registration in new step to deepen control
Israel will begin contentious West Bank land registration in new step to deepen control
TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Israel will begin a contentious land regulation process in a large part of the occupied West Bank, which could result in Israel gaining control over wide swaths of the area for future development, according to a government decision on Sunday.
It paves the way for the resumption of “settlement of land title” processes, which had been frozen in the West Bank since the Mideast War in 1967. It means that when Israel begins the land registration process for a certain area, anyone with a claim to the land must submit documents proving ownership.
The Israeli anti-settlement group Peace Now said the process likely amounts to a “mega land grab” from Palestinians.
“This move is very dramatic and allows the state to gain control of almost all of Area C,” said Hagit Ofran, the director of Peace Now’s Settlement Watch program. Area C refers to the 60% of the West Bank that is under full Israeli military control, according to agreements reached in the 1990s with the Palestinians.
Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas’ office in a statement called the decision “a grave escalation and a flagrant violation of international law,” which amounts to “de facto annexation.” It called on the international community, especially the U.N. Security Council and the United States, to intervene immediately.
Israeli steps in recent months
The decision is the latest step to deepen Israeli control over the West Bank. In recent months, Israel has greatly expanded construction in Jewish settlements, legalized outposts and made significant bureaucratic changes to its policies in the territory to strengthen its hold and weaken the Palestinian Authority.
Israel’s Foreign Ministry said Palestinian Authority civil planning maps show that the authority has been advancing land registration procedures in Area C for years in violation of agreements that give Israel civil and military control over the area. It said Sunday’s decision was made for greater transparency.
The decision was first announced last May but required further development before it was approved in this week’s Cabinet meeting. Under the decision, Israeli authorities will announce certain areas to undergo registration, which will force anyone who has a claim to the land to prove their ownership.
Ofran said the process for proving ownership can be “draconian” and is rarely transparent, meaning any land that undergoes the registration process in areas currently owned by Palestinians is likely to revert to Israeli state control.
“Palestinians will be sent to prove ownership in a way that they will never be able to do,” Ofran told The Associated Press. “And this way Israel might take over 83% of the Area C, which is about half of the West Bank.”
The registration process could start as soon as this year, she said.
The proposal had been put forward by some of Israel’s far-right members of the ruling coalition, including the Minister of Justice Yariv Levin. “The government of Israel is committed to strengthening its grip on all its parts, and this decision is an expression of that commitment,” he said.
A ‘dangerous escalation’
Jordan’s Foreign Ministry in a statement called on the international community to “assume its legal and moral responsibilities, and to compel Israel, the occupying power, to stop its dangerous escalation.”
Qatar’s foreign ministry said it considered Israel’s decision “an extension of its illegal plans to deprive the Palestinian people of their rights.”
Previous U.S. administrations have sharply condemned an expansion of Israeli activity and control in the West Bank, but Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has a particularly close relationship with President Donald Trump. The two met last week in Washington, their seventh meeting in the past year.
And yet Trump has opposed annexation, Ofran noted.
Palestinians are not permitted to sell land privately to Israelis, though measures announced last week aim to nullify this. Currently, settlers can buy homes on land controlled by Israel’s government. Last week’s decision also aimed to expand Israeli enforcement of several aspects of in the West Bank, including environmental and archaeological matters in Palestinian-administered areas.
More than 700,000 Israelis live in the occupied West Bank and east Jerusalem, territories captured by Israel in 1967 from Jordan and sought by the Palestinians for a future state. The international community overwhelmingly considers Israeli settlement construction in these areas to be illegal and an obstacle to peace.
Over 300,000 Palestinians are estimated to live in Area C of the West Bank, with many more in surrounding communities dependent on its agricultural and grazing lands, including plots for which families retain land deeds or tax records dating back decades.

Trump’s border czar says ‘small’ security force will remain in Minnesota after enforcement drawdown
Trump’s border czar says ‘small’ security force will remain in Minnesota after enforcement drawdown
WASHINGTON (AP) — White House border czar Tom Homan said Sunday that more than 1,000 immigration agents have left Minnesota’s Twin Cities area and hundreds more will depart in the days ahead as part of the Trump administration’s drawdown of its immigration enforcement surge.
A “small” security force will stay for a short period to protect remaining immigration agents and will respond “when our agents are out and they get surrounded by agitators and things got out of control,” Homan told CBS’ “Face the Nation.” He did not define “small.”
He also said agents will keep investigating fraud allegations as well as the anti-immigration enforcement protest that disrupted a service at a church service.
“We already removed well over 1,000 people, and as of Monday, Tuesday, we’ll remove several hundred more,” Homan said. “We’ll get back to the original footprint.”
Thousands of officers were sent to the Minneapolis and St. Paul area for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s “Operation Metro Surge.” The Department of Homeland Security said it was its largest immigration enforcement operation ever and proved successful. But the crackdown came under increasing criticism as the situation grew more volatile and two U.S. citizens were killed.
Protests became common. A network of residents worked to help immigrants, warn of approaching agents or film immigration officers’ actions. The shooting deaths of Renee Good and Alex Pretti by federal officers drew condemnation and raised questions over officers’ conduct, prompting changes to the operation.
Homan announced last week that 700 federal officers would leave Minnesota immediately, but that still left more than 2,000 in the state. He said Thursday that a “significant drawdown” was already underway and would continue through this week.
Homan said enforcement would not stop in the Twin Cities and that mass deportations will continue across the country. Officers leaving Minnesota will report back to their stations or be assigned elsewhere.
When asked if future deployments could match the scale of the Twin Cities operation, Homan said “it depends on the situation.”

A storm system sweeps across the Southeast triggering tornado watches and damaging winds
A storm system sweeps across the Southeast triggering tornado watches and damaging winds
ATLANTA (AP) — A weekend storm system sweeping across the Southeast brought tornado warnings to Mississippi and Louisiana, and then took aim at parts of Georgia and Florida, as people in the Northeast were finally getting a reprieve from weeks of bitterly cold temperatures.
Some of the fiercest weather in the South was reported near Lake Charles, Louisiana, where high winds from a thunderstorm overturned a horse trailer and a Mardi Gras float, damaged an airport jet bridge and flung the metal awning from a house into power lines. The damage was documented by National Weather Service employees who surveyed the area.
Power poles were snapped and toppled near the Louisiana towns of Jena, Cheneyville and Donaldsonville, the weather service reported.
No deaths or serious injuries were reported, but the damage reports came as the storm system continued into parts of south Georgia and the Florida Panhandle, which were under tornado watches on Sunday.
The storms led to some power outages across southern states, but nowhere near the massive number of outages caused by ice storms late last month in northern Mississippi and Nashville, Tennessee. By late Sunday afternoon, around 11,000 customers were without electricity in Texas and more than 9,000 had no service in northern Florida, according to PowerOutage.us, which tracks outages nationwide.
Meanwhile, the Northeast was beginning to thaw after a weekslong stretch of uncommonly cold weather.
Boston was running nearly 7 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 14 Celsius) below average for February last week, and the city was on pace for its coldest winter in more than a decade. Boston remained cold on Sunday, but this week’s forecast called for temperatures climbing into the high 30s and low 40s, which is closer to the seasonal average.
On the West Coast, much of California braced for a powerful winter storm that was expected to bring drenching thunderstorms, damaging winds and heavy snow in mountain areas. Jacob Spender, a weather service meteorologist in Sacramento, urged people to take precautions in the coming days.
“So if they are traveling, packing winter safety kits. Anything to be prepared. This is a bigger system, and a major system,” Spender said.
Rain that began Sunday in the San Francisco Bay Area was forecast to intensify throughout the day and overnight, bringing the risk of flooding. Forecasters said the Sierra Nevada, including ski resorts around Lake Tahoe, could see up to seven feet (two meters) of snow before the storm moves through late Wednesday.
To the south, Los Angeles area residents in some neighborhoods scarred by last year’s devastating wildfires were under an evacuation warning through Tuesday because of the potential for mud and debris flows. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said she’s ordered emergency crews and city departments to prepare to respond to any problems.

What to know about the investigation into Nancy Guthrie’s disappearance and the search for clues
What to know about the investigation into Nancy Guthrie’s disappearance and the search for clues
TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) — Law enforcement agents have been gathering more potential evidence as the search for “Today” show host Savannah Guthrie ‘s mother heads into its third week.
Nancy Guthrie, 84, was last seen at her Arizona home on Jan. 31 and was reported missing the following day. Authorities say her blood was found on the front porch. Purported ransom notes were sent to news outlets, but two deadlines for paying have passed.
Authorities have expressed concern about Nancy Guthrie’s health because she needs vital daily medicine. She is said to have a pacemaker and have dealt with high blood pressure and heart issues, according to sheriff’s dispatcher audio on broadcastify.com.
Here’s what to know about her disappearance and the intense search to find her:
Video of masked man
The Federal Bureau of Investigation released surveillance videos of a masked person wearing a handgun holster outside Guthrie’s front door in Tucson the night she vanished. A porch camera recorded video of a person with a backpack who was wearing a ski mask, long pants, jacket and gloves.
On Thursday, the FBI called the person a suspect. It described him as a man about 5 feet, 9 inches tall with a medium build. The agency said he was carrying a 25-liter “Ozark Trail Hiker Pack” backpack.
Investigators initially said there was no surveillance video available since Guthrie didn’t have an active subscription to the doorbell camera company. But digital forensics experts kept working to find images in back-end software that might have been lost, corrupted or inaccessible.
Studying DNA
Investigators collected DNA from Guthrie’s property which doesn’t belong to Guthrie or those in close contact with her, the Pima County Sheriff’s Department said. Investigators are working to identify who it belongs to.
Evidence requiring forensic analysis is being sent to the same out-of-state lab that has been used since the beginning of the case, the department said.
Investigators found several gloves, the nearest about 2 miles (3.2 kilometers) from Guthrie’s home, and submitted them for lab analysis, the sheriff’s department said. It did not specify what type of gloves.
The sheriff stressed his department is working closely with the FBI.
Sorting through tips
The Pima County sheriff and the FBI announced phone numbers and a website to offer tips. Several hundred detectives and agents have been assigned to the case, the sheriff’s department said.
The FBI said it has collected more than 13,000 tips since Feb. 1, the day Guthrie was reported missing. The sheriff’s department, meanwhile, said it has taken at least 18,000 calls.
The sheriff’s department has not said whether any tips have advanced the investigation.
Intensive searches
Late Friday night, law enforcement sealed off a road about 2 miles (3.2 kilometers) from Guthrie’s home as part of their investigation. A parade of sheriff’s and FBI vehicles, including forensics vehicles, passed through the roadblock.
The investigators also tagged and towed a Range Rover SUV from a nearby Culver’s restaurant parking lot late Friday.
The sheriff’s department said Saturday the activity was part of the Guthrie investigation but no arrests were made.
On Tuesday, sheriff deputies detained a person for questioning during a traffic stop south of Tucson. Authorities didn’t say what led them to stop the man but confirmed he was released.
The same day, deputies and FBI agents conducted a court-authorized search in Rio Rico, about an hour’s drive south of the city.
Family pleas
Savannah Guthrie, her sister and her brother have shared on social media multiple video messages to their mother’s purported captor.
The family’s Instagram videos have shifted in tone from impassioned pleas to whoever may have their mom, saying they want to talk and are even willing to pay a ransom, to bleaker and more desperate requests for the public’s help.
The latest video on Thursday was simply a home video of their mother and a promise to “never give up on her.”
A quiet neighborhood
Nancy Guthrie lived alone in the upscale Catalina Foothills neighborhood, where houses are spaced far apart and set back from the street by long driveways, gates and dense desert vegetation.
Savannah Guthrie grew up in Tucson, graduated from the University of Arizona and once worked at a television station in the city, where her parents settled in the 1970s. She joined “Today” in 2011.
In a video, she described her mother as a “loving woman of goodness and light.”

Trump says Board of Peace will unveil $5 billion in Gaza reconstruction pledges at inaugural meeting

Trump says Board of Peace will unveil $5 billion in Gaza reconstruction pledges at inaugural meeting
Trump says Board of Peace will unveil $5 billion in Gaza reconstruction pledges at inaugural meeting
WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) — President Donald Trump said Sunday that members of his newly created Board of Peace have pledged $5 billion toward rebuilding war-ravaged Gaza and will commit thousands of personnel to international stabilization and police forces for the territory.
The pledges will be formally announced when board members gather in Washington on Thursday for their first meeting, he said.
“The Board of Peace will prove to be the most consequential International Body in History, and it is my honor to serve as its Chairman,” Trump said in a social media posting announcing the pledges.
He did not detail which member nations were making the pledges for reconstruction or would contribute personnel to the stabilization force. But Indonesia’s military said Sunday that up to 8,000 of its troops are expected to be ready by the end of June for a potential deployment to Gaza as part of a humanitarian and peace mission. It’s the first firm commitment that the Republican president has received.
Rebuilding the Palestinian territory will be a daunting endeavor. The United Nations, World Bank and European Union estimate that reconstruction of the territory will cost $70 billion. Few places in the Gaza Strip were left unscathed by more than two years of Israeli bombardment.
The ceasefire deal calls for an armed international stabilization force to keep security and ensure the disarming of the militant Hamas group, a key demand of Israel. Thus far, few countries have expressed interest in taking part in the proposed force.
The Oct. 10 U.S.-brokered ceasefire deal attempted to halt a more than 2-year war between Israel and Hamas. While the heaviest fighting has subsided, Israeli forces have carried out repeated airstrikes and frequently fire on Palestinians near military-held zones.
It is not clear how many of the more than 20 members of the Board of Peace will attend the first meeting. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who held White House talks with Trump last week, is not expected to be there.
Trump’s new board was first seen as a mechanism focused on ending the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza. But it has taken shape with his ambition for a far broader mandate of resolving global crises and appears to be the latest U.S. effort to sidestep the United Nations as Trump aims to reset the post-World War II international order.
Many of America’s top allies in Europe and elsewhere have declined to join what they suspect may be an attempt to rival the Security Council.
Trump also confirmed that Thursday’s meeting will take place at the U.S. Institute of Peace, which the State Department announced in December it was remaining the Donald J. Trump U.S. Institute of Peace.
The building is the subject of litigation brought by former employees and executives of the nonprofit think tank after the Republican administration seized the facility last year and fired almost all the institute’s staff.

Gaza’s Nasser Hospital condemns MSF decision to suspend most services

Gaza’s Nasser Hospital condemns MSF decision to suspend most services
Gaza’s Nasser Hospital condemns MSF decision to suspend most services
CAIRO (AP) — One of Gaza ’s last functioning large hospitals condemned the decision by Doctors Without Borders to pull out of operations over concerns about armed men, claiming on Sunday that the facility had installed civilian police for security.
The rare public friction between two well-known health care providers in Gaza came as the Palestinian death toll since the current ceasefire surpassed 600. At least 11 Palestinians were killed by Israeli fire in the last 24 hours, hospitals said.
Doctors Without Borders, also known by its acronym MSF, said in a statement Saturday that all its noncritical medical operations at Nasser Hospital were suspended due to security breaches that posed “serious” threats to its teams and patients. MSF said there had been an increase in patients and staff seeing armed men in parts of the compound since the U.S.-brokered October ceasefire was reached.
Nasser Hospital said Sunday the increase in armed men was due to a civilian police presence aimed at protecting patients and staff and said MSF’s “allegations are factually incorrect, irresponsible and pose a serious risk to a protected civilian medical facility.”
One of Gaza’s few functioning hospitals
Hundreds of patients and war-wounded have been treated daily at Nasser Hospital in the southern city of Khan Younis, and the facility was a hub for Palestinian prisoners released by Israel in exchange for Israeli hostages as part of the current ceasefire deal.
MSF said its teams had reported “a pattern of unacceptable acts including the presence of armed men, intimidation, arbitrary arrests of patients and a recent situation of suspicion of movement of weapons.” The suspension occurred in January but was only recently announced.
Nasser Hospital staff say that in recent months it has been repeatedly attacked by masked, armed men and militias, which is why the presence of an armed civilian police force is crucial.
Hamas remains the dominant force in areas of Gaza not under Israeli control, including the area where Nasser Hospital is located. But other armed groups have mushroomed as a result of the war, including groups backed by Israel’s army in the Israeli-controlled part of the strip.
Israel’s military said it had intelligence that Nasser Hospital is being used as a headquarters and military post for senior Hamas officials, without providing evidence. It called MSF’s move “an important decision, but one that comes too late.”
Throughout the war, which began with the Hamas-led attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, Israel has repeatedly struck hospitals, including Nasser, accusing the militant group of operating in or around them. Hamas security men often have been seen inside hospitals, blocking access to some areas.
Some hostages released from Gaza have said they spent time during captivity in a hospital, including Nasser Hospital.
11 Palestinians killed in strikes across Gaza
At least 11 Palestinians were killed Sunday by Israeli fire in Gaza, hospital authorities said.
The dead include five men in their 20s who were killed in the eastern part of Khan Younis, according to Nasser Hospital, which received the bodies. The strike hit a group of people close to the Yellow Line that separates Israeli-controlled areas from the rest of Gaza, it said.
Rami Shaqra said his son, al-Baraa, was among the militants securing the area from potential attacks by Israeli forces or Israeli-backed armed groups when they were hit. He said they were killed by an airstrike.
“They were in the area they say is safe,” Shaqra said.
Associated Press footage from the morgue showed at least two of the men had headbands denoting membership in the Qassam Brigades, the militant arm of Hamas.
In northern Gaza, a drone strike hit a group of people in the Falluja area of Jabaliya refugee camp, killing five people, according to Shifa Hospital. A separate drone strike killed a man in Gaza City, according to the hospital.
Israel’s military said it had carried out multiple strikes in response to several ceasefire violations near the Yellow Line, including militants attempting to hide in debris and others who attempted to cross the line while armed.
The U.S.-brokered ceasefire deal that took effect Oct. 10 attempted to halt more than two years of war between Israel and Hamas. While the heaviest fighting has subsided, the ceasefire has seen almost daily Israeli fire.
Israeli forces have carried out repeated airstrikes and frequently fire on Palestinians near military-held zones, killing 602 Palestinians, according to Gaza health officials. The ministry, which is part of the Hamas-led government, maintains detailed casualty records that are seen as generally reliable by U.N. agencies and independent experts. It does not give a breakdown of civilians and militants.
Militants have carried out shooting attacks on troops, and Israel says its strikes are in response to that and other violations. Four Israeli soldiers have been killed.
Two Israeli soldiers attacked by ultra-Orthodox Jews
In Israel, two female Israeli soldiers were rescued from riots in the ultra-Orthodox city of Bnei Brak. Footage shows two soldiers being hurried away by police from thousands of ultra-Orthodox men running after them and yelling.
Many in Israel’s ultra-Orthodox community are furious over laws that may force them to serve in the Israeli military, holding frequent protests.
Israeli police said the soldiers were performing a welfare visit but had not coordinated it with police. At least 22 people were arrested as protesters set police motorcycles on fire, attacked officers, threw trash and overturned a police car, police said.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu strongly condemned the attack on the soldiers but blamed an “extremist minority” for the violence.
Roughly 1.3 million ultra-Orthodox Jews make up about 13% of Israel’s population and oppose enlistment because they believe studying full time in religious seminaries is their most important duty. The broad exemptions from mandatory military service have reopened a deep divide in the country and infuriated much of the general public, especially during the war in Gaza.

Europeans push back at US over claim they face ‘civilizational erasure’
Europeans push back at US over claim they face ‘civilizational erasure’
MUNICH (AP) — A top European Union official on Sunday rejected the notion that Europe faces “civilizational erasure,” pushing back at criticism of the continent by the Trump administration.
EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas addressed the Munich Security Conference a day after U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio offered a somewhat reassuring message to European allies. He struck a less aggressive tone than Vice President JD Vance did in lecturing them at the same gathering last year but maintained a firm tone on Washington’s intent to reshape the trans-Atlantic alliance and push its policy priorities.
Kallas alluded to criticism in the U.S. national security strategy released in December, which asserted that economic stagnation in Europe “is eclipsed by the real and more stark prospect of civilizational erasure.” It suggested that Europe is being enfeebled by its immigration policies, declining birth rates, “censorship of free speech and suppression of political opposition” and a “loss of national identities and self-confidence.”
“Contrary to what some may say, woke, decadent Europe is not facing civilizational erasure,” Kallas told the conference. “In fact, people still want to join our club and not just fellow Europeans,” she added, saying she was told when visiting Canada last year that many people there have an interest in joining the EU.
Kallas rejected what she called “European-bashing.”
“We are, you know, pushing humanity forward, trying to defend human rights and all this, which is actually bringing also prosperity for people. So that’s why it’s very hard for me to believe these accusations.”
In his conference speech, Rubio said that an end to the trans-Atlantic era “is neither our goal nor our wish,” adding that “our home may be in the Western hemisphere, but we will always be a child of Europe.”
He made clear that the Trump administration is sticking to its guns on issues such as migration, trade and climate. And European officials who addressed the gathering made clear that they in turn will stand by their values, including their approach to free speech, climate change and free trade.
British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Saturday that Europe must defend “the vibrant, free and diverse societies that we represent, showing that people who look different to each other can live peacefully together, that this isn’t against the tenor of our times.”
“Rather, it is what makes us strong,” he said.
Kallas said Rubio’s speech sent an important message that America and Europe are and will remain intertwined.
“It is also clear that we don’t see eye to eye on all the issues and this will remain the case as well, but I think we can work from there,” she said.

Iran’s top diplomat to attend ‘indirect’ talks with US in Geneva, state-run IRNA news agency says

Iran’s top diplomat to attend ‘indirect’ talks with US in Geneva, state-run IRNA news agency says
DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Iran’s top diplomat was traveling Sunday from Tehran to Geneva, where the second round of nuclear negotiations with the U.S. will take place, Iranian state media reported.
Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi and his delegation left for the Swiss city after the first round of indirect talks took place in Oman last week. Oman will mediate the talks in Geneva, the IRNA state-run news agency reported on its Telegram channel.
Similar talks last year broke down after Israel launched what became a 12-day war on Iran, that included the U.S. bombing Iranian nuclear sites.
U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly threatened to use force to compel Iran to agree to constrain its nuclear program. Iran has said it would respond with an attack of its own. Trump has also threatened Iran over its deadly crackdown on recent nationwide protests.
Gulf Arab countries have warned that any attack could spiral into another regional conflict.
The Trump administration has maintained that Iran can have no uranium enrichment under any detail, which Tehran says it will not agree to.
Iran continues to insist that its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes, but officials however have increasingly threatened to pursue a nuclear weapon. Before the war in June, Iran has been enriching uranium up to 60% purity, just a short technical step away from weapons-grade levels.
Araghchi is also expected to meet with his Swiss and Omani counterparts, as well as the director general of the U.N.’s atomic watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Earlier on Sunday, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Washington remains interested in a diplomatic solution to ending its differences with Tehran, and that President Trump’s envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner were currently traveling for the new round of talks.
Trump said Friday the USS Gerald R. Ford, the world’s largest aircraft carrier, was being sent from the Caribbean to the Mideast to join other military assets the U.S. has built up in the region. He also said a change in power in Iran “would be the best thing that could happen.”
Rubio said recent military deployments in the Middle East were a protective measure aimed at shoring up the defenses of U.S. facilities and interests. Iran has threatened to attack U.S. bases in the region if Washington decides to strike. Tehran in June attacked the Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, though no American or Qatari personnel were harmed.
“No one’s been able to do a successful deal with Iran, but we’re gonna try,” said Rubio at a news conference after meeting with Slovakian Prime Minister Robert Fico in Bratislava. “We are focused on negotiations.” Trump in recent weeks has suggested that his priority is for Iran to scale back its nuclear program, while Iran has said it wants talks to solely focus on the nuclear program. But Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who earlier this week met with Trump in Washington, has been pressing for a deal that would neutralize Iran’s ballistic missile program and end its funding for proxy groups such as Hamas in the Gaza Strip and Hezbollah in Lebanon.
The Israeli prime minister said in a speech Sunday that any deal between the U.S. and Iran must make sure that “all enriched material has to leave Iran.”
It remains unclear how much influence Netanyahu will have over Trump’s policy on Iran. Trump initially threatened to take military action over Iran’s bloody crackdown on nationwide protests last month, but then shifted to a pressure campaign in recent weeks to try to get Tehran to make a deal over its nuclear program. ___ Associated Press writers Kareem Chehayeb in Beirut and Areej Hazboun in Jerusalem contributed to this report.

Hunting for the flaming pearl was among their favorite pursuits, nine was their lucky number and the entire universe was their home. These are just a few of the many facts visitors learned at the Musée du Quai Branly-Jacques-Chirac in Paris about the dragon, as it has traversed the Chinese imagination for five millennia. Do not imagine it as evil and fire-breathing, as it is often depicted in the West. Instead, it is an embodiment of vital energy, as evidenced by the sumptuous objects on loan from Taiwan for the "Dragons" exhibition. The dragon's many avatars take many forms, from vases to headdresses, tripod cauldrons and inkstones.
It first appears emerging from the egg during the Neolithic era, in jade ornaments unearthed in the tombs of high-ranking individuals. It does not yet have its majestic appearance: more like a "dragon-pig," it emerges with a snout and small ears on one of the very first objects depicting it, which dates to around 3,000 BCE.

Netanyahu says US deal with Iran must dismantle nuclear infrastructure
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
JERUSALEM - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Feb 15 he told US President Donald Trump last week that any US deal with Iran must include the dismantling of Iran's nuclear infrastructure, not just stopping the enrichment process.
Speaking at the annual Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organisations, Mr Netanyahu also said Israel still needs to "complete the job" of destroying all tunnels in Gaza. Israel, he said, has already dismantled 150km of an estimated 500km.
A second round of talks between the US and Iran
Mr Netanyahu said he is sceptical of a deal but it must include enriched material leaving Iran.
“There shall be no enrichment capability - not stopping the enrichment process, but dismantling the equipment and the infrastructure that allows you to enrich in the first place," he said.
Iran and the US renewed negotiations earlier in February to tackle their decades-long dispute over Tehran's nuclear programme and avert a new military confrontation.
The US has dispatched a second aircraft carrier to the region and is preparing for the possibility of a sustained military campaign if the talks do not succeed, US officials have told Reuters.
Mr Netanyahu also said that he aimed to end US military aid to Israel within the next 10 years, after the current 10-year deal of receiving US$3.8 billion (S$4.8 billion) a year - which is largely spent in the United States on equipment - ends in 2028.
Due to a thriving economy, "we can afford to phase out the financial component of the military aid that we're receiving, and I propose a 10-year draw down to zero.
Now, in the three years that remain in the present memorandum of understanding and another seven years draw it down to zero," Mr Netanyahu said.
"We want to move with the United States from aid to partnership," he said. REUTERS

Lawmakers accuse Pam Bondi of ‘purposefully mudding’ list of names associated with Epstein in new DOJ letter
In a six-page letter to members of Congress, the DOJ said it has released ‘all’ documents related to the required disclosures and listed a series of high-profile names – including those of Marilyn Monroe and Janis Joplin
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
Lawmakers who pushed the Department of Justice to release the Epstein files are dissatisfied with its latest disclosure of high-profile names mentioned in the three million documents, believing the DOJ is being purposefully vague to protect those with close ties to Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell.
Saturday evening, the DOJ sent a six-page letter to Congress, including the names of celebrities, politicians, businesspeople and more who were mentioned at least once in the files. But the extensive list failed to explain how the people are connected to the pedophile financier and his fellow offender.
Names ranged from President Donald Trump, who was once friends with Epstein but ceased communication before his 2008 Florida conviction, to apparently unrelated figures whose names happen to have been mentioned, like Marilyn Monroe, the Hollywood star who died when Epstein was nine years old, and the singer Janis Joplin, who died in 1970.
“The DOJ is once again purposefully muddying the waters on who was a predator and who was mentioned in an email,” Rep. Ro Khanna, one of the lawmakers leading the effort, said on X.
“To have Janis Joplin, who died when Epstein was 17, in the same list as Larry Nassar, who went to prison for the sexual abuse of hundreds of young women and child pornography, with no clarification of how either was mentioned in the files is absurd,” Khanna added.
Khanna called on the DOJ to “stop protecting predators” and release all the files with only the names of survivors redacted.
The Independent has asked the Justice Department for comment.
The letter, which was required per the Epstein Files Transparency Act, was sent to members of the House and Senate Judiciary Committees. Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said the department had “released ‘all records, documents, communications and investigative materials in possession of the Department’ that relate to’ Epstein,” signaling it would be the final release.
It listed names of “politically exposed persons” named at least once. However, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche noted that the lawmakers never defined what that means.
As a result, names such as Elvis Presley, Janis Joplin, Cher, Beyonce and other notable celebrities are listed because they are mentioned in emails. But that does not mean the individuals had any connection with, or even knew, Epstein.
Current lawmakers, who may have been mentioned in the DOJ’s press briefings or FBI daily news emails, are also mentioned.
“So one loser sends another loser a NEWS ARTICLE with my name in it and the cover up clan at the DOJ wants to put me in the same drawer as Donald Trump,” Rep. Eric Swalwell wrote on X.
Other lawmakers joined the call for more disclosures, despite the DOJ signalling that the recent three-million-document dump is the final release of the Epstein files.
Republican Rep. Nancy Mace, who has also helped lead the effort for transparency on Epstein, said that the Justice Department is “missing names” on the list. She also promised to push for more disclosures.
“I want to be abundantly clear about the DOJ memo released tonight: Citing ‘Work Product Privilege’ will NOT save the DOJ from releasing all the Epstein files,” Mace wrote.
“If they can give the names, then they can give them in unredacted files. The list is an admission that they can remove those redactions,” she added.
“Not buying this at all and Americans shouldn’t either. I went to the ‘unredacted’ files yesterday and HUNDREDS of pages are still completely blacked out,” Rep. Laura Friedman said on X.
Although more than three million documents have been released, officials initially indicated six million files could be released. Some documents are being withheld because they meet the criteria laid out by Congress in the act – such as protecting the medical privacy of victims, containing images or descriptions of child sexual abuse, being involved in an ongoing prosecution, or other reasoning.
Members of Congress, such as Khanna and his co-sponsor on the Epstein files push, Rep. Thomas Massie, have viewed the unredacted version of the files at the DOJ. They’ve accused Bondi and other officials of purposefully redacting the names of powerful individuals to protect them from prosecution.
No person mentioned on the list has been charged with a crime associated with Epstein and Maxwell’s crimes, other than the two themselves. Being named in the Epstein files does not mean a person participated in, or even knew of, Epstein and Maxwell’s crimes.
Epstein died by suicide while awaiting trial in a New York jail in 2019, while Maxwell is serving a 20-year prison sentence for sex trafficking offenses.

WASHINGTON, February 15. /TASS/. The Board of Peace member countries, who will gather for their first meeting in Washington on February 19, will announce the allocation of more than $5 billion to restore the Gaza Strip, US President Donald Trump said.
"On February 19th, 2026, I will again be joined by Board of Peace Members at the Donald J. Trump Institute of Peace in Washington, D.C., where will announce that Member States have pledged more than $5 billion dollars toward the Gaza Humanitarian and Reconstruction efforts, and have committed thousands of personnel to the International Stabilization Force and Local Police to maintain Security and Peace for Gazans," he wrote on his Truth Social platform.
On January 22, representatives of 19 countries signed the charter establishing the Board of Peace for Gaza in a ceremony on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos. According to US President Donald Trump, more countries have joined it. While the Board was established to govern the enclave, its mission is expected to extend to conflicts in other parts of the world as well.

Trump claims ‘board of peace’ will give $5bn in aid to rebuild Gaza
Many Western countries, such as France and Norway, have said they will not join Trump’s initiative yet

Donald Trump has claimed that the “board of peace” has pledged more than $5bn (£3.67bn) towards rebuilding Gaza.
The US president’s board of peace was originally envisioned as a small group of world leaders to oversee the Gaza ceasefire plan, but the Trump administration has since suggested it could play a role as a global conflict mediator after inviting dozens of nations, including Ukraine and Russia to join.
In a post on Truth Social, the president said that member states would be meeting next week at the Donald J. Trump Institute of Peace in Washington, D.C., where they would announce the pledge of billions of dollars alongside thousands of personnel set to maintain security and peace in the war-torn strip.
Delegations from more than 20 countries, including heads of state, are expected to attend.
“The Board of Peace has unlimited potential,” he wrote on Truth Social. “Last October, I released a Plan for the permanent end to the Conflict in Gaza, and our Vision was unanimously adopted by the United Nations Security Council. Shortly thereafter, we facilitated Humanitarian Aid at record speed, and secured the release of every living and deceased Hostage.
“Just last month, two dozen distinguished Founding Members joined me in Davos, Switzerland, to celebrate its official formation, and present a bold Vision for the Civilians in Gaza, and then, ultimately, far beyond Gaza — WORLD PEACE!”
Concerns have been raised by European nations over the unexpected invitation extended to Russian president Vladimir Putin, who has waged a brutal war in Ukraine since February 2022. There has also been anger among Arab states over the inclusion of Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, whose war in Gaza has led to the deaths of 72,000 Palestinians.
Concerns have also been raised about the role of former British prime minister Tony Blair, who is expected to sit on the “founding executive board” despite concerns raised about his involvement in the Iraq war.
Dozens of countries have so far committed to joining the board, including Armenia, Azerbaijan, Egypt, Hungary, Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates.
Trump continued: “On February 19th, 2026, I will again be joined by Board of Peace Members at the Donald J. Trump Institute of Peace in Washington, D.C., where we will announce that Member States have pledged more than $5 BILLION DOLLARS toward the Gaza Humanitarian and Reconstruction efforts, and have committed thousands of personnel to the International Stabilization Force and Local Police to maintain Security and Peace for Gazans,” he continued.
“Very importantly, Hamas must uphold its commitment to Full and Immediate Demilitarization. The Board of Peace will prove to be the most consequential International Body in History, and it is my honor to serve as its Chairman,” he added, signing off with his full name in capital letters.
Israel and Hamas agreed to a ceasefire plan last year, with it officially taking effect in October, although both sides have accused each other repeatedly of violating the terms. More than 590 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli troops in the territory since the ceasefire began, according to Gaza's health ministry.
Israel has said four of its soldiers have been killed by Palestinian militants in the same period.

Gaza Civil Defense launches campaign to recover bodies from rubble
Civil defense teams begin efforts in Beit Lahia as officials estimate thousands remain missing under rubble of destroyed homes
GAZA CITY, Palestine
Palestinian civil defense crews in Gaza launched a campaign Sunday to recover the bodies of Palestinians killed during Israel’s genocidal war and still trapped under the rubble of their homes in northern Gaza.
The initiative, titled “Dignifying the Martyrs,” began in the town of Beit Lahia, where rescue teams started retrieving remains from the destroyed home of the Abu Nasr family. The house was hit in an Israeli airstrike on Oct. 29, 2024, when it was sheltering about 200 family members and displaced people.
According to official estimates in Gaza, around 9,500 Palestinians remain missing under the rubble, as rescue teams struggle to reach them amid widespread destruction and a lack of heavy equipment.
The campaign “marks the start of broader efforts to recover victims from multiple sites across northern Gaza,” said Mohammed Tamous, an officer with the civil defense, adding that the first phase focuses on homes believed to contain large numbers of bodies.
“We are standing today on the rubble of the Abu Nasr family home, and dozens of bodies are still inside,” Tamous said. “We hope to continue the campaign until all the martyrs are recovered from across the Gaza Strip.”
He said thousands remain buried under debris, while the civil defense lacks sufficient bulldozers and machinery to carry out large-scale recovery operations. One of the vehicles currently in use was provided by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), he added, calling on humanitarian organizations to supply additional equipment.
Aya Abu Nasr, a survivor of the strike, said her extended family had sought refuge in the five-story building as Israeli attacks intensified. About 200 people were inside when it was hit.
She told Anadolu that roughly 150 people were killed in the strike, with dozens more injured, while others remained trapped under the rubble.
Initial recovery attempts during Israeli bombardment were “limited and dangerous,” she said.
“Some bodies were retrieved, but those in the lower floors could not be reached,” Abu Nasr said. “More than a year later, the family is still waiting to recover the remains of those still buried to bury them properly.”
Holding up photos on her phone, she said her brother Mohammed is still missing, expressing hope that his body will be found.
Civil defense personnel have been operating in hazardous health conditions since the start of the Israeli war, with decomposing bodies in exposed areas and limited access to protective gear and biological testing tools.
The Israeli restrictions and blockade on the entry of essential medical supplies have further complicated their work, leaving rescue workers vulnerable to disease and infection during recovery operations.
Gaza’s Health Ministry said Sunday that 726 bodies have been recovered since the Oct. 10 ceasefire deal with Israel.
The ceasefire ended Israel’s two-year war that began on Oct. 8, 2023. Palestinian authorities say the conflict killed more than 72,000 Palestinians, wounded over 171,000 others, and caused widespread destruction affecting 90% of civilian infrastructure. The UN estimates reconstruction costs at approximately $70 billion.
At least 601 Palestinians have been killed and over 1,600 others injured in Israeli attacks since the ceasefire, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry.

UK’s wet weather expected to continue amid flood warnings and alerts

Anyone hoping for relief from the UK’s wet weather may be disappointed next week, with more flooding expected and patches of snow forecast.
The Environment Agency has issued 73 flood warnings, meaning flooding is expected, mainly in areas of the south-west of England and the Midlands. There are also 177 flood alerts – which indicate possible flooding – in place across England.
According to Natural Resources Wales, two flood alerts are in place in South Pembrokeshire and the Lower Severn catchment in Powys. The Met Office said blustery showers would spread across many areas overnight on Sunday, with chilly temperatures for many and frost in the north.
Monday will bring sunny spells and showers, with some heavy rainfall expected. There is a risk of hail and thunderstorms, as well as snow showers in the far north. It will be largely drier and brighter on Tuesday.
There will be the risk of some rain and snow in the south on Wednesday and Thursday but it will be mostly dry in the north, according to the Met Office. Although there are no weather warnings currently in place, the Met Office said it may have to issue them as conditions evolve later this week.
Provisional statistics published earlier this month by the Met Office show Northern Ireland experienced its wettest January in 149 years and second wettest on record.
Southern England recorded its sixth wettest January since the data series began in 1836. Parts of Devon, Cornwall and Worcestershire had rainfall for 40 consecutive days.
Since the beginning of this year, storms Goretti, Ingrid and Chandra have brought misery for people and businesses, with flooding in several regions including Devon and Somerset.
The wet weather is not expected to ease next weekend, with longer spells of rain predicted on Friday and over the weekend.
The Met Office said the weather was likely to be unsettled heading into the weekend but there would be some drier interludes between weather systems.

Renowned Shakespearean actor voices doubts over Oscar frontrunner Hamnet
- Sir Ian McKellen, a renowned Shakespearean actor and Academy member, has voiced his reservations about the film Hamnet, despite its significant Oscar buzz.
- McKellen stated he is “not very interested in trying to work out where Shakespeare’s imagination came from” and believes it did not solely originate from family life.
- He predicted the film would win several Oscars but described certain plot details, such as Jessie Buckley's supposed ignorance of plays, as “improbable”.
- The film, based on Maggie O'Farrell's novel, fictionalises how the death of Shakespeare's 11-year-old son might have inspired his famous play Hamlet.
- Hamnet has garnered eight Oscar nominations, including Best Picture, and has achieved box office success, grossing $74m globally.

20,000 patients needing urgent care blocked from leaving Gaza

20,000 Palestinians needing urgent medical care denied departure through Rafah crossing
Around 20,000 Palestinians require urgent medical evacuation from the war-ravaged Gaza Strip, yet only a few dozen have so far been permitted to leave through the partially reopened Rafah border crossing.
According to Gaza’s Ministry of Health, Israel’s limited and highly restricted operation of the crossing has resulted in only a small number of medical evacuations, leaving thousands of critically ill patients trapped inside the enclave.
The ministry warned that the scale of departures falls dramatically short of urgent medical needs.
Data released by Gaza’s Government Media Office shows that since the crossing reopened, just 488 people have passed through Rafah out of an expected 1,800 who were due to move in both directions - a compliance rate of roughly 27%.
The ministry said that despite the announcement of the crossing’s partial reopening on 2 February, the number of patients allowed to travel remains extremely low and wholly disproportionate to the accumulated medical demand.
It described the current measures as inadequate, failing to meet even the most basic humanitarian obligations towards the sick and wounded.
Officials added that those awaiting evacuation include patients with cancer, heart disease and kidney failure, as well as individuals suffering severe injuries that cannot be treated inside Gaza.
The ministry warned that continuing under the existing evacuation mechanism poses a direct threat to thousands of lives and further deepens the health and humanitarian crisis, urging the international community to fulfil its legal and moral responsibilities.
The statement also referenced what it described as “harsh and painful” testimonies from patients who were able to leave Gaza, many of whom reported being subjected to complex procedures and additional restrictions.
These conditions, the ministry said, compounded their psychological and physical suffering while they were already in extremely poor health.
Gaza’s Ministry of Health called for the permanent and regular opening of the Rafah crossing, which borders Egypt, to ensure unrestricted and timely movement for patients and the wounded.
It also demanded the immediate evacuation of critical cases and a significant increase in the number of travellers in line with the scale of medical need.
The ministry further appealed for urgent intervention by international and humanitarian organisations to guarantee patients’ right to treatment and travel - a right protected under international law - stressing that patients’ lives “are not mere numbers to be postponed”.
Since the crossing reopened, Israel has allowed travel only for a small number of pre-approved and heavily vetted individuals, while the pace of medical evacuations has fallen far short of the figures previously promised.
During the first week following the reopening of the crossing, between 2 and 5 February, only 135 Gaza-based residents, most of them patients and their companions, were able to leave the territory to seek treatment.
Movement has also occurred in the opposite direction, with dozens returning to Gaza during the same period. More recently, 41 Palestinians entered Gaza through Rafah this week, bringing the total number of returnees since reopening to 72.
Meanwhile, only about 250 people have left Gaza overall, according to the Government Media Office.
Multiple reports also indicate that Palestinians attempting to leave Gaza have been subjected to humiliating searches and lengthy interrogations by the Israeli military, which controls the Palestinian side of the Rafah crossing.
Rafah remains the sole entry and exit point for nearly all of Gaza’s more than two million residents. The crossing was kept closed by Israel for most of its genocidal war on Gaza since 7 October 2023.
Following reported pressure from the United States, Israel eventually permitted its partial reopening- a move long demanded by the United Nations and aid groups, and a central element of US President Donald Trump’s proposed "ceasefire" framework for Gaza.
Despite this, humanitarian conditions remain dire, with Israeli attacks continuing to claim Palestinian civilian lives.

Thomas Massie labels Trump’s presidency the ‘Epstein administration’ amid dispute over files

Thomas Massie labels Trump’s presidency the ‘Epstein administration’ amid dispute over files
Kentucky congressman has become Trump’s #1 foe in the GOP over Epstein discharge petition
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
Rep. Thomas Massie branded Donald Trump’s presidency the “Epstein administration” on Sunday as he laid into the president and his deputy, Attorney General Pam Bondi, for what some members of Congress have described as an effort to stonewall the release of the Epstein files.
The Republican representative from Kentucky was one of two members of Congress, along with Rep. Ro Khanna, to lead a discharge petition last year aimed at forcing the Justice Department to publish the extent of its gathered evidence and information relating to Jeffrey Epstein. The measure passed after gaining widespread bipartisan support last year, and was begrudgingly signed into law by the president.
The congressman was asked about the president’s anger towards him during an interview Sunday with ABC’s Martha Raddatz on This Week, and responded by claiming that the Trump administration was still working to protect powerful men named in the files.
"Donald Trump told us that even though he had dinner with these people in New York City and West Palm Beach, that he would be transparent, but he's not. He's still in with the Epstein class. This is the Epstein administration,” said Massie. “There are billionaires that are friends with these people, and that’s what I’m up against in D.C.”
The Independent has contacted the White House for comment.
Massie became a personal foe of the president as a result of breaking with him on various policy issues, culminating with the Epstein files vote. Trump later vowed to bankroll a primary challenge against him.
On Sunday, Massie also reacted to the testimony of Bondi last week before the House Judiciary Committee, where he and several other lawmakers attempted to press the attorney general on redactions in the files and delays in their publication
The DOJ now says it has released all of its files pertaining to the investigation, but Massie and other members of Congress have complained that their access to the unredacted versions — which can only be viewed at DOJ headquarters under surveillance — is still being restricted in some ways.
“They took down some of the most significant documents, two of them involving Virginia Giuffre’s case,” Massie said on ABC. “We want to be able to look at all these files. They can't keep those documents down after they've already produced them."
The Department of Justice remains adamant that the evidence gathered as part of the agency’s 2019 investigation into Epstein did not turn out incriminating evidence against any powerful figures save for Epstein himself and his girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell, who remains in a U.S. prison. The billionaire financier was found dead in his cell in 2019 while awaiting trial on child sex trafficking charges, with federal authorities labeling it a suicide.
Members of Congress who have viewed the unredacted versions say the files contain references to victims as young as nine years old. They’ve criticized the agency over redactions made in the public versions of the files.
“We didn’t want to see any redactions of the names of co-conspirators, accomplices, enablers, abusers, rapists, simply to spare them potential embarrassment, political sensitivity or disgrace of some kind,” Rep. Jamie Raskin, a Democrat on the Judiciary committee, said last week.
“And yet nonetheless, the Epstein […] documents that were released are filled with redactions of names and information about people who clearly are not victims and may fall into that other category.”
Though no one else has been held criminally accountable for associations with Epstein or Maxwell, the fallout from relationships exposed in the files has already been enormous, with a global reach. In the U.K., controversy over former ambassador and Labour peer Peter Mandelson’s association with Epstein led to him resigning from the House of Lords while questions about his appointment have pressured Keir Starmer, the prime minister.
Trump, whose name appears “more than a million times” in the unredacted files according to Rep. Raskin, has not been accused of wrongdoing. But his friendship with Epstein and admission that Virginia Giuffre previously worked at Mar-a-Lago, where she met the sex trafficking pedophile Epstein, have caused massive headaches for the president.
The president has frequently called on Republican voters to drop their interest in the investigation, to little avail.

Trump's border czar says 'small' security force will remain in Minnesota after enforcement drawdown
More than 1,000 immigration agents have left Minnesota’s Twin Cities area and hundreds more will depart in the days ahead as part of the Trump administration’s drawdown of its immigration enforcement surge
- Bookmark
White House border czar Tom Homan said Sunday that more than 1,000 immigration agents have left Minnesota's Twin Cities area and hundreds more will depart in the days ahead as part of the Trump administration’s drawdown of its immigration enforcement surge.
A “small” security force will stay for a short period to protect remaining immigration agents and will respond “when our agents are out and they get surrounded by agitators and things got out of control,” Homan told CBS's Face the Nation. He did not define “small.”
He also said agents will keep investigating fraud allegations as well as the anti-immigration enforcement protest that disrupted a service at a church service.
“We already removed well over 1,000 people, and as of Monday, Tuesday, we’ll remove several hundred more,” Homan said. “We’ll get back to the original footprint.”
Thousands of officers were sent to the Minneapolis and St. Paul area for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's “Operation Metro Surge.” The Department of Homeland Security said it was its largest immigration enforcement operation ever and proved successful. But the crackdown came under increasing criticism as the situation grew more volatile and two U.S. citizens were killed.
Protests became common. A network of residents worked to help immigrants, warn of approaching agents or film immigration officers’ actions. The shooting deaths of Renee Good and Alex Pretti by federal officers drew condemnation and raised questions over officers’ conduct, prompting changes to the operation.
Homan announced last week that 700 federal officers would leave Minnesota immediately, but that still left more than 2,000 in the state. He said Thursday that a “significant drawdown” was already underway and would continue through this week.
Homan said enforcement would not stop in the Twin Cities and that mass deportations will continue across the country. Officers leaving Minnesota will report back to their stations or be assigned elsewhere.
When asked if future deployments could match the scale of the Twin Cities operation, Homan said “it depends on the situation.”

Peace with Israel 'not possible' under constant violations of Palestinian rights, says foreign minister
Varsen Aghabekian Shaheen calls for full ceasefire compliance before phase 2, urges global action against annexation, recognition of Palestine
MUNICH
Palestine's foreign minister on Sunday said peace with Israel is "not possible" while Palestinian rights continue to be violated, stressing international law must be upheld and unilateral measures halted.
Speaking to Anadolu on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference, Varsen Aghabekian Shaheen said "peace with Israel under conditions of constant violation of Palestinian rights is not possible."
She argued that unilateral Israeli actions in occupied territory, West Bank and East Jerusalem, such as illegal settlement expansions and legalizations, undermine prospects for a negotiated settlement.
"Everything that Israel is undertaking unilaterally in occupied territory should be considered null and void," she said, stressing annexation "is in violation of international law, and it is a crime that needs to be stopped."
Shaheen also addressed the Gaza ceasefire process, saying progress to the next stage depends on full implementation of initial commitments.
“We would like to go into phase two, but we need to ensure that phase one obligations are undertaken," she said. The first phase ended after an exchange of Israeli hostages with Palestinian prisoners, and the second includes reconstruction of the enclave Israel destroyed in two years of bombing.
"We still see that we don't have a complete ceasefire. We have a partial ceasefire. The humanitarian assistance is not getting in to the extent that is needed. The Rafah border crossing is partially opened," she added, noting that further measures are required for a smooth transition.
Calling for stronger international action, Shaheen pointed to existing legal and diplomatic frameworks.
“What we would like is for the world to stand up and say, 'Look, enough is enough. International law is very clear,'" she said, referring to international rulings and UN resolutions that deem settlements and occupation illegal.
Shaheen said recent attacks reinforce what she described as Israel being "for no peace,” arguing that if it genuinely sought peace, it would halt violations of international law and Palestinian rights. Instead, she said, Israel is continuing "annexationist colonialist measures" and seeking to "legalize criminality." She urged the international community to say "enough is enough" and uphold international law, including the ICJ ruling and UN Resolution 2334, which she said deem settlements and occupation illegal.
Asked about her call to Germany and Finland to join other European countries in recognizing Palestine, she said: "They will consider at the right time. The vision of recognition is there, but they need to be moving towards it according to their convenience. But to me, the matter is very clear. If you are a two-stater, if you believe in international law, if you want to comply with international law, you need to recognize, because there is no justification whatsoever for not recognizing."
On regional diplomacy, she described Türkiye as a significant actor in reconciliation efforts and humanitarian assistance.
"Türkiye is an important player," she said. "Its humanitarian assistance and development assistance in Palestine is extremely important and we expect that Türkiye, as a key player in the region, to continue this role towards peace."

Report: Trump tells Netanyahu he backs Israeli strike in Iran if talks fail

President Donald Trump told Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in December that he would support strikes on Iran’s ballistic missile program if negotiations between Washington and Tehran fail, CBS News reported, citing two sources familiar with the matter.
According to the report, the conversation took place during a meeting at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago residence. The sources spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of national security discussions.
CBS News further reported that in recent weeks, senior figures within the U.S. military and intelligence community have begun internal discussions about how Washington might assist in the event of renewed Israeli strikes on Iran.
The report said the deliberations have centered less on whether Israel would act and more on the nature of potential U.S. support. Options under consideration include providing aerial refueling for Israeli aircraft and seeking overflight permissions from countries along a possible route, according to U.S. officials cited by CBS.
It remains unclear which countries would grant such permission. Jordan, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have previously stated publicly that they would not allow their airspace to be used for strikes on Iran or for Iranian attacks on other countries.
The reported discussions come as the Trump administration continues diplomatic efforts with Tehran over its nuclear program.
Netanyahu, who has expressed skepticism about diplomacy with Iran, traveled to Washington last week for talks with Trump. He has said any agreement must address not only Iran’s nuclear activities but also its ballistic missile program and funding of regional proxy groups.
Iranian officials have indicated conditional willingness to curb certain levels of uranium enrichment in exchange for sanctions relief, though no written agreement has been announced.
A second round of indirect talks between the United States and Iran is expected to take place Tuesday in Geneva. Iranian state media reported that Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi and his delegation were en route for the discussions.
Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Sunday that Trump prefers diplomacy and confirmed that envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner are traveling for meetings related to the negotiations.
Speaking at the White House on Friday, Trump described the deployment of additional U.S. naval forces to the region as a precaution in case talks collapse, signaling that Washington is maintaining military readiness alongside diplomatic efforts.

‘People want to help’: Canadians rally round Tumbler Ridge after school shooting

When Jim Caruso heard the news of the school shooting in Tumbler Ridge, he knew immediately he needed to be there. He packed his bags and boarded a plane for the community 700 miles away. “I wanted to be here to bring some level of comfort,” he said. “I wanted to hug people, pray for them and, most importantly, to cry with them.”
On Tuesday, a shooter opened fire in the town’s secondary school, killing eight people, most of them young children. It was one of the deadliest attacks in Canada’s history and has left the country reeling.
But it has also elicited a wave of support for the British Columbia town from across Canada, in the form of civic resources, grief and trauma counsellors, therapy animals, food and donations. Hotels are fully booked, pushing new arrivals to towns more than a hour’s drive away.
Caruso, who retired four years ago, worked as a paramedic, pastor and police chaplain – a career at the nexus of grief, tragedy and compassion that he said made him suited to the moment.
“It’s hard but I’m wired for this. I spent my life with first responders. And so I know the police, firefighters, paramedics – they’re just wrecked. They’re destroyed,” he said. “But so are the people here in Tumbler Ridge. And how they’re cared for right now is so important.”
On Friday, police said the shooter had been, “for lack of a better term, hunting”. Armed with two guns, “they were prepared and engaging anybody and everybody they could come in contact with”.
Investigators have identified the suspect as Jesse Van Rootselaar. Police said Van Rootselaar is a transgender woman.
The prime minister, Mark Carney, who travelled to Tumbler Ridge with other federal party leaders in a show of national unity, praised the heroism of first responders and the courage of students and teachers who had been trapped in the school as the shooter stalked the halls..
“Standing here together in your home, we wanted you to hear that Canadians are with you and we will always be with you,” Carney said. “Whatever portion of your sadness that Canadians can bear to help you ease your heavy load, we will gladly do so.”
Caruso said the grim details of the attack would add a layer to how counsellors and support workers would help victims and the broader community navigate the unpredictable and turbulent nature of grief.
“It’s not like there was a car accident. It’s not like it’s a terminal illness. This was murder. Someone did this in cold blood. And as a result, something innocent was stolen,” he said. “I’ve learned over the years that life will go on. But it will also take a piece of you.”
Caruso and his wife intend to spend the next months in town to help residents rebuild emotionally. “It’s hard to not to ask what if I had been here earlier, if we could have been here to bring compassion,” he said. “But there is hope. It might not feel like there is for the parents who lost their kids, or the victims that are gone. But there’s hope for those that remain. That’s what funerals are all about. It’s not for the person that’s gone. It’s for the people around you.”
Speaking at a vigil, Carney said Tumbler Ridge was defined by people who cared for each other. “You held each other – as you’re holding each other right now. This is grace. It’s what we do for each other; it’s what we receive from each other,” he said. “Open hearts when the world falls apart.”
That the tragedy occurred in a community of less than 2,500 people means first responders knew the victims and not a single person was untouched by loss. In a part of the province known as the Peace region, when the residents of Tumbler Ridge hurt, the pain is felt deeply nearby.
“I just wanted to be part of the solution and to do whatever I could to help people,” said Milo MacDonald, the city manager of nearby Fort St John, who had recently arrived in Tumbler Ridge with colleagues. “There’s an awful lot of people right now that want to help. They want to reduce suffering.”
Neighbouring communities are sending large-scale resources and small gestures that have an outsized impact. MacDonald said lifeguards and skating technicians had been sent down from his community to ensure places such as the community swimming pool and ice rink could remain open for children.
MacDonald, who worked as a police officer for 25 years, including relief stints in Tumbler Ridge, said he was devastated by the horror inflicted on a group of “genuinely good” people.
“I experienced tragedies as a police officer, but never anything close to this magnitude,” he said. “And I’ll admit it’s incredibly hard because my sons are a similar age. My hope is that these kinds of things make us focus on our humanity and our common ground. In moments like this you need a confirmation of humanity.”
While the droves of people arriving from outside the community have overwhelmed the town’s infrastructure, their presence is nonetheless welcomed by residents.
Lynn Way, 82, who has lived in the town for more than three decades, said: “When I lost my son not too long ago, I wanted to just shut the world out. I wanted to just die. He didn’t want a service but I had a get-together and people came from all over. People I didn’t even know. I knew then how much my son was loved. And they wanted to come and let me know. That’s what’s happening in this town right now.”
Way said there was a “heaviness” in the air when she stepped outside, but Tumbler Ridge was still a safe town. “You can still leave your door unlocked. That hasn’t changed. This town will get through it, but those poor people that lost their children and their loved ones, it’s going to take longer. That’s a fact of life. All we can do is just say: ‘Hey, if you need something, I’m here for you.’”
In recent days, a logo with mountain peaks and a red heart has appeared with the words Tumbler Ridge Strong, a nod to the collective resilience needed in the town and a confidence that it exists within each resident.
“What feels so hard right now is that none of this is real,” Way said. “It won’t be real until the first funeral. Then you see the grief you never thought possible. When you lose someone close to you, it takes a year before you can really live with it. And you do. But you don’t ever forget. Ever.”

US forces board second sanctioned oil tanker in Indian Ocean

WASHINGTON - US forces boarded an oil tanker in the Indian Ocean that violated President Donald Trump’s blockade of sanctioned vessels in the Caribbean and fled the region, the Pentagon said on Feb 15.
The Panamanian-flagged Veronica III “tried to defy President Trump’s quarantine – hoping to slip away. We tracked it from the Caribbean to the Indian Ocean, closed the distance, and shut it down,” the Pentagon said on X.
The post included a video of US forces boarding a helicopter and then boarding the tanker ship.
The Pentagon intercepted the Aquila II
In December, Mr Trump ordered a “blockade” of sanctioned oil vessels heading to and from Venezuela. At least nine ships have been seized thus far.
But those ships seized in recent months make up only a tiny fraction of the total number of sanctioned “shadow fleet” vessels operating worldwide to evade sanctions, which a senior US Coast Guard officer said number up to 800.
The Veronica III left Venezuela on Jan 3 – the same day that US special forces captured Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro in a raid – carrying around 1.9 million barrels of oil, TankersTrackers.com said.
The ship is listed under US sanctions relating to Iran, according to the website of the US Treasury’s Office of Foreign Asset Control.
“The Department of War will deny illicit actors and their proxies freedom of movement in the maritime domain,” the Pentagon said on X. AFP

Iran’s foreign minister heads for Geneva for 2nd round of indirect talks with US
Abbas Araghchi to attend Oman-mediated negotiations in Geneva, hold meetings with Swiss, Omani officials and UN nuke watchdog chief
ISTANBUL
Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi left Tehran on Sunday for Geneva to participate in a second round of indirect nuclear talks with the US, the Foreign Ministry said.
Araghchi is heading a diplomatic and expert delegation to the Swiss city, where he is also scheduled to hold a series of consultations on the sidelines of the talks, the ministry said in a statement cited by the state-run Press TV.
The second round of negotiations between Iranian and American delegations is set for Tuesday in Geneva, with representatives from Oman acting as mediators.
According to the ministry, Araghchi will meet with his Swiss and Omani counterparts, Ignazio Cassis and Badr Albusaidi, as well as Rafael Grossi, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, and other international officials based in Switzerland.
The latest round of nuclear talks was held in Oman on Feb. 6, more than eight months after the Iran-Israel war put the diplomacy on the backburner.
Türkiye and other regional states recently intervened to help ease tensions and revive the diplomatic channels, particularly after US President Donald Trump threatened to use military action against Iran.

Indonesia says 8,000 troops ready for possible peacekeeping mission in Gaza by June
Indonesia's military said Sunday that up to 8,000 troops are expected to be ready by the end of June for a potential deployment to Gaza as part of a humanitarian and peace mission, the first firm commitment to a critical element of U. President Donald Trump’s post-war reconstruction plan.
The Indonesian National Armed Forces, known as TNI, has finalised its proposed troop structure and a timeline for their movement to Gaza, even as the government has yet to decide when the deployment will take place, army spokesperson Brig. Gen. Donny Pramono said.
"In principle, we are ready to be assigned anywhere," Pramono told The Associated Press, "Our troops are fully prepared and can be dispatched at short notice once the government gives formal approval."
Pramono said the military prepared a composite brigade of 8,000 personnel, based on decisions made during a Feb. 12 meeting for the mission.
Under the schedule, troops will undergo health checks and paperwork throughout February, followed by a force readiness review at the end of the month, Pramono said. He also revealed that about 1,000 personnel are expected to be ready to deploy as an advance team by April, followed with the rest by June.
Pramono said that being ready does not mean the troops will depart. The deployment still requires a political decision and depends on international mechanisms, he said.
Indonesia's Foreign Ministry has repeatedly said any Indonesian role in Gaza will be strictly humanitarian. Indonesia’s contribution would focus on civilian protection, medical services, reconstruction, and its troops would not take part in any combat operations or actions that could lead to direct confrontation with armed groups.
Indonesia would be the first country to formally commit troops to the security mission created under Trump’s 'Board of Peace' initiative for Gaza, where a fragile ceasefire between Israel and Hamas has held since 10 October following two years of devastating war.
Indonesia, the world’s most populous Muslim majority nation, does not have formal diplomatic relations with Israel and has long been a strong supporter of a two-state solution. It has been deeply involved in providing humanitarian aid to Gaza, including funding a hospital.
Indonesian officials have justified joining the Board of Peace by saying it was necessary to defend Palestinian interests from within, since Israel is included on the board but there is no Palestinian representation.
The Southeast Asian country has experience in peacekeeping operations as one of the top 10 contributors to United Nations missions, including in Lebanon.

Trump: 'Board of Peace' members pledge $5 billion for Gaza
February 15, 2026US President Donald Trump said on Sunday that the member states of his so-called "Board of Peace" have pledged more than $5 billion (€4.2 billion) for reconstruction and humanitarian efforts in Gaza.
In a post on his Truth Social platform, the US president announced that he will formally unveil the pledges when the board meets in Washington on Thursday.
The event is expected to draw delegations from more than 20 countries, including heads of state.
Reconstruction of Gaza is expected to cost $70 billion, according to United Nations, World Bank and European Union estimates, after more than two years of war.
The US-brokered October 10 ceasefire calls for an armed international force to provide security and disarm Hamas, but few nations have expressed interest.
Trump wrote that the member states of the board have committed thousands of personnel to the UN-authorized international stabilization and police force in the Palestinian enclave, calling the board "the most consequential international body in history." He didn't name which countries were planning to contribute.
Indonesia's military, however, confirmed on Sunday it expects up to 8,000 troops to be ready by late June for a possible peace and humanitarian mission, the first concrete commitment to the proposed force.
Trump calls on Hamas to disarm
Trump is also urging Hamas to move ahead with full disarmament under his postwar plan for Gaza.
"Very importantly, Hamas must uphold its commitment to full and immediate demilitarization," he wrote in his Truth Social post.
Disarmament is an important part of the second phase of the US-mediated ceasefire plan that was agreed in October between Israel and Hamas. This plan aims to end the conflict that began after Hamas attacked Israel in October 2023.
The second phase stipulates that Israeli forces will gradually withdraw from Gaza, and that Hamas will disarm. An international stabilization force will be deployed to ensure security.
Although Hamas has indicated it could consider handing over its weapons to a future Palestinian governing authority, it has repeatedly said that disarmament is a red line.
Both parties accuse each other on a daily basis of ceasefire violations. According to Gaza's Health Ministry, Israeli troops have killed more than 590 Palestinians in the territory since the ceasefire began. During the same period, Israel reported that four of its soldiers were killed by Palestinian militants.

The Guardian view on Donald Trump and the climate crisis: the US is in reverse while China ploughs ahead | Editorial

Devastating wildfires, flooding and winter storms were among the 23 extreme weather and climate-related disasters in the US which cost more than a billion dollars last year – at an estimated total loss of $115bn. The last three years have shattered previous records for such events. Last Wednesday, scientists said that we are closer than ever to the point after which global heating cannot be stopped.
Just one day later, Donald Trump and Lee Zeldin, the head of the US Environmental Protection Agency, announced the elimination of the Obama-era endangerment finding which underpins federal climate regulations. Scrapping it is just one part of Mr Trump’s assault on environmental controls and promotion of fossil fuels. But it may be his most consequential. Any fragment of hope may lie in the fact that a president who has called global heating a “hoax” framed this primarily as about deregulation – perhaps because the science is now so widely accepted even in the US.
The administration claimed, without evidence, that Americans would save $1.3tn. Never mind insurance or healthcare costs; a recent report found that US earnings would be 12% higher without the climate crisis. The Democratic senator Sheldon Whitehouse called the decision “corruption, plain and simple”. In 2024, Mr Trump reportedly urged 20 fossil fuel tycoons to stump up $1bn for his presidential campaign – while vowing to remove controls on the industry.
In the same week as this reckless and destructive US decision, it emerged that China had recorded its 21st month of flat or slightly falling carbon emissions. As Washington tears up environmental regulations, Beijing is extending carbon reporting requirements. China remains the world’s biggest emitter of greenhouse gases, though its per capita and cumulative historical emissions are still far behind those of the US. But clean energy drove more than 90% of its investment growth last year.
The Carbon Brief website, which published the emissions analysis, says the numbers suggest that the decline in China’s carbon intensity – emissions per unit of GDP – was below the target set in the last five-year plan, making it hard to meet its commitments under the Paris agreement. The shift in emissions may not prove enduring. There is fear that China’s focus may change; the next five-year plan, due in March, will be key. Some subsidies for renewable power have already been withdrawn. The installation of huge quantities of renewable energy infrastructure has been accompanied by a surge in constructing coal-fired power plants, though the hope is that these are intended primarily as a fallback.
There are other grave concerns, including evidence of the use of forced labour of Uyghur Muslims in solar-panel production in Xinjiang. China’s chokehold on critical minerals hampers the ability of others to develop their own technology. And while its cheap renewables technology has resulted in the cheapest electricity in history, it has also hit manufacturers in other countries.
No one can compensate for the grim reversal of belated US action on emissions. There is also a vacuum in climate diplomacy that China shows no signs of filling. But Beijing has a vested interest in encouraging others to cut emissions, even if some nations now want to challenge its “green mercantilism”. In contrast, US billionaires look forward to prospering at the cost of wallets and lives – not only at home, but around the world.

MOSCOW, February 15. /TASS/. A man in Odessa tried to cut off his hand with an angle grinder to evade forcible mobilization, the Ukrainian media outlet Strana reported.
According to it, the man suffered serious injuries and is currently in the hospital.
General mobilization was announced in Ukraine in February 2022 and has been extended several times since, with the authorities doing everything possible so that draft-age men cannot evade military service. Videos of forcible mobilization and clashes with draft officers are regularly surfacing on Ukrainian social networks. Draft-age men use every opportunity to evade being sent to frontlines, for which ends they buy disability certificates, enter universities or illegally flee the country, often risking their lives.

Iran FM heads to Geneva for second round of nuclear talks with US: ministry
Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi headed to Switzerland on Sunday for the second round of renewed nuclear talks with the United States later this week, his ministry said.
Araghchi "left Tehran for Geneva late on Sunday heading a diplomatic and technical delegation to conduct the second round of nuclear talks and hold a number of diplomatic consultations," the ministry said in a statement.
"Indirect Iran-US nuclear talks will be held on Tuesday with the mediation and good offices of Oman."
During his visit to Geneva, Araghchi is expected to hold talks with his Swiss and Omani counterparts as well as the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Grossi, and other international officials, the foreign ministry statement said.
Tehran and Washington restarted nuclear negotiations in Muscat on 6 February, months after previous talks collapsed when Israel launched an unprecedented bombing campaign against Iran last June that started a 12-day war.
The latest talks came with Washington having threatened Tehran with military action and deployed an aircraft carrier group to the region following Iran's deadly crackdown on anti-government protests last month.
On 6 February, Araghchi led the Iranian delegation in indirect nuclear talks with US Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff and US President Donald Trump's influential son-in-law Jared Kushner in Muscat.
Switzerland has played a key role in diplomatic relations between Iran and the United States for decades.
It has represented US interests in Iran since Washington broke off relations with Tehran after the 1980 hostage crisis, a year after the Iranian revolution.
Iranian deputy foreign minister Hamid Ghanbari said Tehran was seeking a deal with the United States that would generate economic benefits for both countries, particularly in sectors such as aviation, mining and oil and gas, the Fars news agency reported.
"For the agreement to be viable, it is essential that the United States also be able to benefit from it in areas with strong and rapid economic return potential," he was quoted as saying.

Paul Anka, 84, teases possible retirement after 70 years in show business
The singer is known for his hits ‘Diana’ and ‘Put Your Head On My Shoulder’

Paul Anka, 84, says that after 70 years in show business, he’ll know when it is time for him to retire.
The iconic “My Way” singer and songwriter reflected on his career in an interview with CBS News.
“When it's time for my body to say enough, I'll know,” he said on the outlet’s Sunday morning program. “I'm playing with the house's money now. I'm one lucky guy!”
For now, Anka has stayed busy with his latest album Inspirations of Life and Love, released Friday. The legendary ‘60s musician has also kicked off 2026 with a North American tour that goes until May 24.
He told People earlier this month, “I know what retirement is. I don't want to retire. He added: “Let’s say I do 75 days a year. I got the rest of the year to do what the hell I want. I get to write. I got my things. This is so much fun. If you can’t have fun in life or in a job that you’re doing, don’t do it.”
The singer has been in the music business since he was just 10 years old, growing up in Ottawa, Canada.
“It was very difficult to go from a modest background in a small town, to everybody's all over you and you're famous and you're a celebrity,” Anka told CBS News.
Anka has stayed on Billboard ‘s Top 100 chart for nearly his entire career. He wrote Frank Sinatra’s classic “My Way,” along his own hit songs like “Diana” and “Lonely Boy.”
Rising to fame in the ‘50s and ‘60s, he performed with Rat Pack legends like Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin. He has recorded over 130 albums and worked with music icons including Michael Jackson, Connie Francis, Celine Dion and Patti LaBelle.
The singer spiked in popularity again in 2020, when singer Doja Cat used a sample of his song “Put Your Head On My Shoulder” in her song “Freak,” subsequently going viral on TikTok.
Although the singer is busy touring, he said that he makes sure to prioritize his family amid his busy schedule. Anka has a large family, including six children and nine grandkids — two from his daughter Amanda and son-in-law actor Jason Bateman.
Anka is also a single dad to his 20-year-old son Ethan after winning custody of him in 2017 after a legal battle with his ex-wife Anna Aberg.

The Guardian view on AI: safety staff departures raise worries about industry pursuing profit at all costs | Editorial

Hardly a month passes without an AI grandee cautioning that the technology poses an existential threat to humanity. Many of these warnings might be hazy or naive. Others may be self-interested. Calm, level-headed scrutiny is needed. Some warnings, though, are worth taking seriously.
Last week, some notable ground-level AI safety researchers quit, warning that firms chasing profits are sidelining safety and pushing risky products. In the near term, this suggests a rapid “enshittification” in pursuit of short-term revenue. Without regulation, public purpose gives way to profit. Surely AI’s expanding role in government and daily life – as well as billionaire owners’ desire for profits – demand accountability.
The choice to use agents – chatbots – as the main consumer interface for AI was primarily commercial. The appearance of conversation and reciprocity promotes deeper user interaction than a Google search bar. The OpenAI researcher Zoë Hitzig has warned that introducing ads into that dynamic risks manipulation. OpenAI says ads do not influence ChatGPT’s answers. But, as with social media, they may become less visible and more psychologically targeted – drawing on extensive private exchanges.
It is worth noting that Fidji Simo, who built Facebook’s ad business, joined OpenAI last year. And OpenAI recently fired its executive Ryan Beiermeister for “sexual discrimination”. Several reports say she had strongly opposed the rollout of adult content. Together, these moves suggest that commercial pressures are shaping the firm’s direction – and probably that of the wider industry. The way Elon Musk’s AI Grok tools were left active long enough to generate misuse, then restricted behind paid access before finally being halted after investigations in the UK and EU, raises questions about monetising harm.
It is harder to evaluate more specialised systems being built for social purposes such as education and government. But since the frenetic pursuit of profit tends to introduce irresistible bias to every human system we have, the same will be true of AI.
This is not a problem within a single company. A more vague resignation letter by the Anthropic safety researcher Mrinank Sharma warned of a “world in peril”, and that he had “repeatedly seen how hard it is to truly let our values govern our actions”. OpenAI was once ostensibly entirely non-profit; after it committed to commercialisation starting in 2019, Anthropic emerged promising to be the safer, more cautious alternative. Mr Sharma’s departure suggests that even firms founded on restraint are struggling to resist the same pull of profits.
The cause of this realignment is clear. Firms are burning through investment capital at historic rates, their revenues aren’t growing fast enough and, despite impressive technical results, it’s not clear yet what AI can “do” to generate profits. From tobacco to pharmaceuticals, we have seen how profit incentives can distort judgment. The 2008 financial crisis showed what happens when essential systems are driven by short-term needs and weak oversight.
Strong state regulation is needed to solve this problem. The recent International AI Safety Report 2026 offered a sober assessment of real risks – from faulty automation to misinformation – and a clear blueprint for regulation. Yet despite it being endorsed by 60 countries, the US and UK governments declined to sign it. That is a worrying sign that they are choosing to shield industry rather than bind it.

India hammer Pakistan to qualify for T20 World Cup Super Eights
Ishan Kishan defies a tricky Colombo pitch with 77 as India beat Pakistan by 61 runs in Group A of cricket’s T20 World Cup.
Defending champions India have thumped Pakistan by 61 runs in a grudge Group A match of the Twenty20 World Cup to secure their place in the Super Eight stage of the cricket tournament.
Ishan Kishan’s breakneck 77 powered India to 175-7 on Sunday at the R Premadasa Stadium, where Pakistan’s spin-heavy attack managed to apply the brakes to an extent after the opener’s exit.

The tournament co-hosts returned to bundle out Pakistan for 114 in 18 overs to register their third win in a row.
The match went ahead after Pakistan earlier reversed their decision to boycott the game in solidarity with Bangladesh, whose team refused to tour India over safety concerns and were replaced by Scotland.
Pakistan captain Salman Ali Agha and his India counterpart Suryakumar Yadav did not shake hands at the toss, though.
India were reinforced by the return of Abhishek Sharma, who missed the first two matches with a stomach infection. But the opener could not make it count.
Pakistan’s Salman sprang a surprise by opening the attack himself, and the move paid off as the spinner trapped Abhishek lbw to remove the reigning number one batter in T20 Internationals.
Pakistan used three spinners in the powerplay to try and stem boundary flow, and India’s score of 52-1 after six overs suggested the ploy worked to an extent.
Kishan could not be contained, though, and the diminutive southpaw tore into the Pakistan attack with his take-no-prisoners batting.
The opener took only 27 balls to race to his second successive fifty of the tournament.
Saim Ayub ended Kishan’s 40-ball blitz, but India were 92-2 at the halfway stage of their innings.
Ayub (3-25) dismissed Tilak Varma (25) and Hardik Pandya with successive deliveries to turn the heat back on India.
Suryakumar (32) and Shivam Dube (27) could not quite provide the late flourish to take India past the 200-mark that had looked well within their reach at one stage.
Pakistan became the first team to employ six spinners in a T20 World Cup match, but the joy of having restricted India under 200 evaporated soon as they slumped to 13-3 in two overs in their chase.
Pandya removed Pakistan’s in-form opener Sahibzada Farhan for a duck, and Jasprit Bumrah dismissed Ayub and Salman in the same over to pin down Pakistan.
Babar Azam (five) did not last long either, and Pakistan were gasping at 38-4 after the six powerplay overs.
Usman Khan (44) defied India for a while, but Axar Patel lured him out to be stumped to effectively snuff out Pakistan’s chances of an unlikely victory.

Western allegations of Navalny poisoning are 'fake', aim to divert attention: Russia

Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova called "fake" a statement by five European nations claiming opposition figure Alexey Navalny died after being poisoned with a dart frog toxin.
Speaking in an interview with multiple Russian outlets, Zakharova said the Western countries are trying to divert attention from their internal problems.
"There will be test results, there will be formulas of the substances—then there will be a comment," she said. "Without this, all statements and talk are a fake aimed at diverting attention from the pressing problems of the West."
The spokeswoman pointed out that the news appeared "at the moment when it would be necessary to present the results of the investigation into Nord Stream pipeline explosion.
The 2022 sabotage of the Nord Stream pipelines was an unprecedented attack that caused extensive damage to the infrastructure connecting Russia and Germany beneath the Baltic Sea.
Serhii Kuznietsov, a former Ukrainian army officer accused of being involved in the sabotage, was arrested in Italy. The Ukrainian government has repeatedly denied any involvement.
On Saturday, Germany, the UK, the Netherlands, Sweden, and France released a joint statement, alleging Navalny was poisoned using epibatidine, a poison extracted from the skin of the Ecuadorian poison dart frog.
The conclusion was made based on an analysis of samples of Navalny's biological materials, according to the statement.
Moscow announced Navalny’s death in a Siberia prison in February 2024 while he was serving a 19-year sentence on charges of extremism.

No arrests made as search for Nancy Guthrie enters third week

The search for Nancy Guthrie, the 84-year-old mother of NBC’s Today show anchor Savannah Guthrie, has entered its third week, as investigators ask neighbors within a two-mile radius to share home video footage and authorities await DNA test results from a pair of gloves found near the home.
Nancy Guthrie was last seen on the evening of 31 January, when she was dropped off at her home in the Catalina foothills north of Tucson, Arizona, after having dinner with her older daughter and son-in-law. She was reported missing the following day, after she failed to arrive at a friend’s house to watch a church service.
Authorities have been investigating her disappearance as a kidnapping, and as of Sunday morning, two weeks since she was reported missing, no arrests have been made and no one is in custody.
On Sunday, the FBI said in statement reported by several news outlets, that the gloves found around two miles from Guthrie’s home “appear to match the gloves of the subject in the surveillance video”.
The agency said that they sent the gloves to a lab in Florida for DNA testing, and that they received preliminary results on Saturday and “are awaiting quality control and official confirmation today”.
“This process typically takes 24 hours from when the bureau receives DNA,” the FBI added.
Investigators have released doorbell camera footage recovered from Guthrie’s home, which showed a masked individual arriving in the early morning hours of 1 February, carrying a backpack and what appeared to be a holstered handgun.
On Thursday, the FBI released new details about the person in the video, describing them as “a male, approximately 5’9” – 5’10” tall, with an average build”.
As the search continues, authorities are requesting that residents within a two-mile radius of Guthrie’s home submit any surveillance footage recorded between 1 January to 2 February. They have asked neighbors to provide “all video footage that includes vehicles, vehicle traffic, people/pedestrians, and anything neighbors deem out of the ordinary or important”.
As the investigation enters its third week, and continues to draw huge national attention, some crime bloggers and true crime podcasters have traveled to Arizona to cover the case.
On Saturday night, Arizona state representative Alma Hernandez, released a statement, saying that she was “sick of watching” the “insane speculation, lies, and BS by random wannabe journalists and YouTubers who have now caused more harm than good to this entire situation and put this serious case in jeopardy.
“Please GO HOME,” she said. “Let law enforcement do their jobs. Stop following them during swat operations and playing detectives.”
Late on Friday night, law enforcement converged on an area around two miles from Guthrie’s home, where they searched a home, and also investigated a car at a nearby Culver’s parking lot.
On Saturday, the Pima county sheriff’s department confirmed that a federal court-ordered search warrant had been carried out at a residence in connection with the case. But they said that no arrests were made during the operation.
Authorities had briefly detained a man earlier in the week, but he was released after questioning.
Investigators have said that splashes of blood found on the front porch of Guthrie’s home tested positive for her DNA. They also said that additional DNA collected from her property, that does not match Guthrie or those in close contact with her, is undergoing testing, along with several gloves reportedly discovered several miles from her residence.
“All collected evidence has been submitted for laboratory analysis,” officials said this week.
The FBI has increased the reward to $100,000 for information that helps find Guthrie, or leads to an arrest and conviction of those involved in her disappearance. The bureau has said it has received more than 13,000 tips from the public about the case since 1 February.
There have also been unverified reports about ransom notes sent to several Arizona television stations, and celebrity news website TMZ.
Since Nancy Guthrie’s disappearance, Savannah Guthrie and her siblings have posted several videos on social media, pleading for help from the public in finding their mother.
A spokesperson for the Pima county sheriff’s department told CNN on Sunday that no news conferences are currently planned.

Hungarian opposition leader Magyar vows to pull Hungary back toward the West in campaign launch
Hungarian opposition leader Péter Magyar is launching his election campaign and says he can return Hungary to a stronger European path
- Bookmark
Hungarian opposition leader Péter Magyar launched his party's election campaign in Budapest on Sunday, vowing to restore Hungary's Western orientation just eight weeks before he faces Prime Minister Viktor Orbán in a pivotal vote.
Magyar, a former insider in Orbán's nationalist Fidesz party, burst onto Hungary's political scene in 2024 after breaking with his political community and quickly forming the center-right Tisza party.
After taking around 30% of the vote in European Parliament elections in June 2024, he has grown Tisza into the most formidable political force Orbán has faced during his 16 years at Hungary's helm. Most independent polls show Tisza with a significant lead before the April 12 vote, an advantage which has held steady for more than a year.
“We’re standing on the threshold of victory with 56 days left to go,” he told supporters during his speech at an exposition center in Budapest on Sunday. “Tisza stands ready to govern.”
Magyar has vigorously campaigned across Hungary's rural, conservative heartland — traditionally an Orbán stronghold — holding rallies and town hall events in scores of villages and towns. He has focused on bread and butter issues such as low wages and rapidly rising living costs that have made Hungary one of the poorest countries in the European Union.
Magyar accuses Orbán and his government of mismanaging Hungary's economy and social services, and overseeing unchecked corruption he says has led to the accumulation of extreme wealth within a small circle of well-connected insiders while leaving ordinary Hungarians behind.
He has also criticized Orbán for conducting a combative foreign policy with the EU while maintaining close ties to Russia despite its war in neighboring Ukraine.
On Sunday, Magyar pointed to meetings he held with numerous European leaders at the Munich Security Conference in Germany over the weekend, and said he would put an end to Hungary “drifting out of the European Union” under Orbán.
“Hungary’s place is in Europe, not only because Hungary needs Europe, but also because Europe needs Hungary,” he said.
Magyar's comments contrasted starkly with statements Orbán made a day earlier at his own campaign launch, where he said the real threat facing Hungary was not military aggression from Russia, but the European Union.
Tisza’s program
In a 239-page program released last week, Tisza outlined its plans for how it would govern Hungary if it wins April’s elections. Fidesz has not released a program, arguing that after governing for 16 years, its voters know what kinds of policies to expect.
On Sunday, Magyar reiterated that his party plans to retain a fence Orbán's government built along the country's southern border in 2015, and said he would maintain Fidesz's policies of opposing illegal immigration and any accelerated procedure for Ukraine to join the EU.
However, Magyar has vowed to bring home billions in funding the EU has suspended to Hungary over its concerns that Orbán has eroded democratic institutions, reduced judicial independence and failed to tackle corruption.
The program also pledges to fulfill conditions for adopting the euro currency by 2030, and to invest in Hungary's faltering state health care and public transportation sectors. Tisza also plans to crack down on corruption and recover public funds it argues have been funneled into the hands of government-connected oligarchs.
"It is time to call corruption what it is: theft," Magyar said Sunday.
Tisza's candidates
For its candidates in each of Hungary's 106 individual voting constituencies, Tisza has largely drawn on political neophytes locally active as entrepreneurs, doctors, economists, educators and other professionals.
Leading the ticket alongside Magyar are international energy expert Anita Orbán (no relation to the prime minister), whom the party tapped as its prospective foreign policy chief, and former Shell executive István Kapitány, who would fill a senior economy position in a future Tisza government.
Such candidates, Magyar has argued, will provide sectoral expertise he says is lacking under Orbán's government, and will help rebuild relations with Western partners and end Hungary's international isolation.
"I am proud that our experts are once again showing what it means to take the country’s fundamental issues seriously and to plan our shared future,” he said Sunday. “We don’t plan to dominate this country, but to serve it."

Europe looks to shore up own defenses amid US uncertainty

Europe looks to shore up own defenses amid US uncertainty
February 15, 2026Europe's collective defense still relies on the NATO trans-Atlantic alliance, the EU's top diplomat told the Munich Security Conference on Sunday.
But there is an urgent need, Kaja Kallas said, for Europe to take the lead in its own defense.
Kallas, the European Commission's high representative for foreign affairs and security policy, channeled the Avengers superhero franchise with her address, titled "Europeans Assemble! Reclaiming Agency in a Rougher World."
She singled out Russia as Europe's biggest threat, saying its "endgame" was not the Donbas region of Ukraine but a wider assault on the region.
"Russia already seeks to cripple economies through cyberattacks, disrupt satellites, sabotage undersea cables, fracture alliances with disinformation, coerce countries by weaponizing oil and gas," said Kallas. "And of course there is also the nuclear threat."
Europe's shield, she said would be a new security strategy, pursuit of a larger bloc with the addition of new member states and new trade agreements beyond its borders like those with India, Mercosur and an upcoming deal with Australia. These partnerships also include security agreements.
"We are getting there, dusting off our capes, pulling on our boots, revving up our engines," she said.
Stoltenberg: Europe has increased defense spending
Speaking on Sunday, MSC head Wolfgang Ischinger stressed the need to plan for European defense, in particular to "ramp up defense production and to create a more cohesive and globally competitive European defense market."
Woven throughout speeches and soundbites from European leaders at the three-day event was an insistence they had started to deliver that, responding to demands from the Trump administration to pull their weight in NATO.
"The European Union is mobilizing up to €800 billion [...] investing in the capabilities we need — from air and missile defense to drone and military mobility," said European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen on Saturday. "We are delivering."
Former NATO chief-turned-Norwegian finance minister Jens Stoltenberg said the US ultimatum had led to European allies and Canada spending "significantly" more on capability.
"When you listen to the US or the Trump administration, the criticism is not primarily against NATO, it's against NATO allies not paying for NATO. And I think that's a valid point, and Europeans are delivering," Stoltenberg told DW.
EU members spent an estimated €381 billion ($452 billion) on defense in 2025 — up from €251 billion in 2021, prior to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
For Kallas, though, it's not merely that NATO members need to meet Donald Trump's demand for 5% of GDP spending on defense, but ensuring it's spent wisely. She said European nations needed to cast their procurement nets wider to maximize return on investment.
"We have too many standards, we have too many different capabilities, and in order to bring down the costs, also bring down the procurement times, we really need to work together," said Kallas. "It's not only how much we spend, but actually how to spend it more wisely."
Estonian Foreign Minister Margus Tsahkna said pooling Ukraine's defense capabilities — now tested for four years in its conflict with Russia — was an opportunity for Europe to advance its own security.
"We need to understand in Europe that it's not about a different national interest, about the defense industry," Tsahkna told DW.
"There is no competition between each other. We actually need more support, more new innovation, and Ukraine is our opportunity."
Europe considers defense future without US
In late January, NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte told lawmakers at the European Parliament that those who thought Europe could defend itself without the United States should "keep dreaming."
And US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, in a speech focused on preserving Western culture and defense in line with Trump's values, said Saturday it wasn't Washington's "goal" to see the end of the trans-Atlantic alliance. Other US lawmakers mingling with the politicians, policymakers and security experts in Munich also tried to ease fears of a Trump-led withdrawal from the continent.
"Let us show [Europe] that we are trustworthy," Delaware Senator Chris Coons — a Democrat — told DW. "That we are the reliable partners that you've come to count on for decades, and find ways that we can share the burden of our shared defense and security needs and find a positive path forward."
But this weekend made it clear that Europe is prioritizing non-US partnerships — European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen explicitly singled out what she called Europe's "closest partners" Norway, Iceland, the UK and Canada for new security collaborations, with the US a notable omission.
While talking up collective defense, European leaders were quick to emphasize the role of NATO for the continent's overall security, particularly for its nuclear deterrent.
Leaders also scuttled talk of a unified European army as a kind of backup to NATO.
"NATO is actually the frame which is working, it's not a theoretical thing, these are the plans and commitments protocols, so we cannot start creating something different," said Tsahkna.
"If we become stronger in conventional capabilities, in cyber, in crisis management — if we take better care of Europe and other continents and thereby also relieve the United States — then I feel safe under the American nuclear umbrella, because the Americans also need us," said Marie-Agnes Strack-Zimmermann, head of the European Parliament's defense committee.
Washington's message was that "the US needs a stronger Europe," said Tsahkna. "Actually, we need a stronger Europe. And I think that this Munich conference showed that Europe is waking up."

After Chinese vessel detained, Japanese premier vows firm enforcement against illegal fishing

After Chinese vessel detained, Japanese premier vows firm enforcement against illegal fishing
Statement comes after Tokyo released detained fishing vessel captain as China submitted documentation guaranteeing payment of deposit
ISTANBUL
Japan’s prime minister on Sunday pledged firm enforcement of laws against illegal fishing after a captain of a Chinese fishing boat was detained last week.
Sanae Takaichi said on the US social media company X that Tokyo will continue to take firm enforcement action to prevent and deter illegal fishing operations by foreign fishing vessels.
On Friday, Japanese authorities released the detained captain of the vessel after China submitted documentation guaranteeing payment of a deposit.
The Japan Fisheries Agency said it seized the vessel on Thursday and detained the captain for allegedly defying an order to stop while within Japan's exclusive economic zone off Nagasaki.
It was the first time a Japanese agency seized a Chinese fishing boat in waters off southwestern Japan since 2022.
Beijing said it hopes Tokyo “will uphold the China-Japan fisheries agreement, enforce the law fairly, and safeguard the lawful rights and interests of the people concerned.”
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said China “always” urges its fishermen to operate “in accordance with laws and regulations,” and that Beijing will firmly safeguard its “lawful rights and interests.”
Relations between China and Japan have been strained since Takaichi said in November that a potential Chinese attack on Taiwan could constitute a “survival-threatening situation” for Japan, possibly enabling the exercise of collective self-defense.
Beijing strongly criticized the comments and advised Chinese citizens against traveling to Japan, and also reinstated a ban on Japanese seafood imports.
- Japan logs diplomatic protest with China
Japan has lodged a diplomatic protest with China over remarks by Beijing, a Foreign Ministry statement said Sunday.
The statement said “a Chinese participant made inappropriate remarks regarding the security policies of the Japanese government at the Munich Security Conference on February 14.”
“Given that China’s assertions are factually incorrect and ungrounded, the Government of Japan hereby reiterates its position,” the statement said.
Saying that some countries have been “rapidly increasing their military capabilities in a non-transparent manner” and “intensifying unilateral attempts to change the status quo by force or coercion,” it added that Tokyo “opposes such moves and distances itself from them.”
“Japan’s efforts to strengthen its defense capabilities are in response to an increasingly severe security environment and are not directed against any specific third country. We expect that the issue surrounding Taiwan will be resolved peacefully through dialogue, and this stance remains unchanged,” the statement added.
“The Government of Japan remains open to dialogue with China and intends to continue responding calmly and appropriately going forward.”
The statement came after China’s foreign minister on Saturday criticized remarks by Takaichi on Taiwan, saying the comments undermine China’s territorial sovereignty.
“This is the first time in eight years that a Japanese Prime Minister has uttered such words. It directly violates China’s territorial sovereignty, and it directly challenges the fact that Taiwan has been returned to China,” Wang said.

Gaza's Nasser Hospital condemns move by MSF to suspend most services
One of Gaza’s last functioning hospitals condemned the move by Doctors Without Borders to pull out of operations over alleged concerns about armed men, claiming on Sunday that the hospital had installed civil police for security.
MSF said in a statement on Saturday that all its noncritical medical operations at Nasser Hospital were suspended due to security breaches that posed "serious" threats to its teams and patients.
MSF added that there had been an increase in patients and staff seeing armed men in parts of the compound since the US-brokered October ceasefire was reached.
Nasser Hospital said on Sunday that the increase in armed men was due to a civilian police presence aimed at protecting patients and staff and said MSF's "allegations are factually incorrect, irresponsible, and pose a serious risk to a protected civilian medical facility".
Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis is one of the territory’s few functioning hospitals. Hundreds of patients and war-wounded have been treated there daily, and the facility was a hub for Palestinian prisoners released by Israel in exchange for Israeli captives as part of the current ceasefire deal.
"MSF teams have reported a pattern of unacceptable acts including the presence of armed men, intimidation, arbitrary arrests of patients and a recent situation of suspicion of movement of weapons," the organisation claimed. The suspension occurred in January but was only recently announced.
Nasser Hospital staff say that in recent months it has been repeatedly attacked by masked, armed men and militias, which is why the presence of an armed civilian police force is crucial.
Hamas remains the dominant force in areas not under Israeli control, including in the area where Nasser Hospital is located. But other armed groups have been operating across Gaza as a result of the war, including groups backed by the Israeli army in the Israeli-controlled part of the strip.
Throughout the war, Israel has repeatedly struck hospitals, including Nasser, after claiming that Hamas were operating in or around medical facilities. Israel's attacks on hospitals plunged healthcare facilities into disaster, leaving thousands of patients without adequate care.
12 Palestinians killed in strikes across Gaza
Gaza's civil defence agency reported that Israeli strikes killed at least 12 people since dawn on Sunday.
The civil defence agency, which operates as a rescue force under Hamas authorities, said one strike hit a tent of displaced people in northern Gaza and another targeted an area in the south.
Five people were killed and several injured when an air strike targeted a tent sheltering displaced people in Jabalia in the north, the agency said in a statement.
Five more were killed and several injured in a separate early morning strike in the southern city of Khan Younis, the agency said, adding that one more was killed in Israeli shelling in Gaza City.
The agency also said that one person was killed by Israeli gunfire in Beit Lahia in north Gaza.
The Al-Shifa and Nasser hospitals confirmed they had received the bodies of at least seven people.
"Israel doesn't understand ceasefires or truces," said Osama Abu Askar, who lost his nephew in the Jabalia attack.
Dozens of relatives and mourners gathered at Nasser Hospital, where the bodies of some of those killed were laid out in white shrouds.
Men and women stood in prayer ahead of the funeral, facing the corpses in the hospital compound.
Hamas spokesman Hazem Qassem in a statement on Sunday accused the Israeli military of violating the ceasefire.
"Targeting of displaced people in their tents is a serious violation of the ceasefire agreement," Qassem said.

Israeli government approves new West Bank land policy

Israeli government approves new West Bank land policy
February 15, 2026Israel's government on Sunday approved a contentious plan to make it easier for Israeli settlers to purchase land in the occupied West Bank and further sideline Palestinian authorities.
Under the decision, Israeli authorities will announce certain areas to undergo registration, requiring anyone claiming the land to prove ownership, even though ownership of the biggest part of West Bank land has never been formally registered.
The decision, endorsed earlier by Israel’s security cabinet, allows private Israeli citizens to buy land and also shifts parts of the administration in the territory from the military to civilian authorities.
The Palestinian Authority rejected the move, which marks the first formal land-registration process in the West Bank since 1967.
It also sparked criticism from the European Union and several Arab states.
Germany condemned the security cabinet’s earlier approval last week, with a Foreign Ministry spokesperson calling the measures "a further step towards de facto annexation" and saying they violate international law.
Far‑right ministers welcome the move
Talking to broadcaster N12, Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz described Sunday's approval as "a significant security and administrative step aimed at ensuring full control, enforcement and freedom of action for the State of Israel in the area."
Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said the government was "continuing the revolution in settlement policy and control over all parts of our country."
He added that, for the first time since Israel captured the West Bank and East Jerusalem in the 1967 Six Day War, the government was "restoring order and governance" to land administration.
He referred to the Palestinian territory as "Judea and Samaria," the term some Israelis use for the West Bank.
More than 700,000 Israeli settlers live in the West Bank and East Jerusalem alongside roughly 3 million Palestinians. The West Bank is among the territories that the Palestinians seek for a future independent state.
According to the Times of Israel, most of the new land registration rules apply to the West Bank's Area C, where Israel has full military and civilian control.
The newspaper said two-thirds of West Bank land has never been formally registered, including most of Area C.
However, the easing of rules about private land purchases by Israelis and the publication of land registries for the first time, applies beyond Area C, to the broader territory.
PA, Peace Now condemns ‘massive land theft’
The Palestinian Authority, which runs the rest of the West Bank, said the move constitutes "a de facto annexation of occupied Palestinian territory," which it said was "aimed at entrenching the occupation through illegal settlement activity."
The Israeli advocacy group Peace Now denounced the government’s decision, saying it amounted to "authorization for a massive theft of land in the West Bank on the way to de facto annexation."
In a statement, the group accused the Israeli government of ignoring international law and dismissing criticism from allied countries, warning that the policy was "dragging us into disaster."
The United Nations' highest court said in a non-binding advisory opinion in 2024 that Israel's occupation of Palestinian territories and settlements there are illegal and should be ended as soon as possible.
Israel disputes this view, claiming historical and biblical ties to the land.

Europe's new gamble on Russia's exiles, explained

Europe's new gamble on Russia's exiles, explained

Nearly four years after Russia's expulsion from the Council of Europe, the Parliamentary Assembly (PACE) has launched a new platform for dialogue with exiled Russian forces.
The move is a major shift in how Europe engages with Russian opposition figures at a time when Moscow remains isolated from the continent's main human rights body and the war in Ukraine continues with no clear end in sight.
The 15 participants of the Russian PACE platform published their first joint statement on Feb. 6, which focused primarily on the war in Ukraine.
In the statement, they place responsibility for launching the war on Russia and describe their home country as "fascist." They call for continued military support for Ukraine, accountability for aggression and other alleged crimes, and the use of frozen Russian assets to fund Ukraine's recovery.
Yet alongside declarations of solidarity and institutional backing, fundamental questions remain about how much the platform can achieve — and who, exactly, it represents.
The Kyiv Independent spoke with several participants to understand how the platform came into being and what its broader political significance might be.
What is PACE?
PACE is an advisory body of the Council of Europe, which brings together 46 countries, including EU member states as well as non-EU countries such as Turkey, Ukraine, and Georgia.
The Assembly works to promote human rights and democracy across member states.
Unlike the European Parliament, PACE does not pass laws, and its resolutions are not legally binding. Even so, the political weight it carries often shapes policy debates.
Russia joined the Council of Europe in 1996 and took an active part in PACE for more than two decades. After Moscow's illegal annexation of Ukraine's Crimea in 2014, PACE stripped Russia of its voting rights, and the Russian delegation stopped attending sessions.
In 2019, the Assembly restored Russia's powers, a decision that was controversial at the time.
For years, the Russian delegation — led by lawmaker Pyotr Tolstoy — included representatives from all of the country's parliamentary factions. None of the permitted factions were opposed to the regime.
That arrangement ended in 2022. After Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the Council of Europe expelled Russia, automatically terminating its participation in PACE.
The newly-created platform, however, is not a replacement for that delegation — a distinction that has already caused confusion.
A platform, not a delegation
In September 2025, PACE's Political Affairs Committee proposed establishing a platform inside the Assembly for dialogue with "Russian democratic forces in exile."
The Assembly set out strict criteria: delegates must be individuals "of the highest moral standing" who unconditionally recognize Ukraine's territorial integrity and commit to working toward "regime change" in Russia.
Delegates will serve one-year terms and may attend committee meetings and discuss "issues of common concern" with Assembly members, but they will not be able to vote on PACE resolutions or hold the formal status once granted to Russia's official delegation.
The platform includes 15 members, though PACE has not publicly detailed how it selected the candidates — a lack of transparency that has fueled debate about the body's legitimacy.
Among the selected participants are Dmitry Gudkov, a former member of the Russian parliament; Vladimir Kara-Murza, an opposition politician and vice president of the Free Russia Foundation; Garry Kasparov, former world chess champion and co-founder of the Free Russia Forum; and Nadya Tolokonnikova, co-founder of the feminist group Pussy Riot.
Five seats are reserved for representatives of Russia's indigenous and minority communities. Among them are Ruslan Kutaev, a Chechen opposition figure; Ekaterina Kuznetsova, an artist and founder of Ingria House, a project focused on Finno-Ugric cultures; and Lana Pylaeva, an indigenous rights consultant and founder of the Komi Daily media outlet.
The remaining participants also include Russian opposition politicians, independent journalists, civil society activists, and other public figures.
Unprecedented advocacy, questions of legitimacy
For representatives of Russia's indigenous peoples and minority communities, participation in the PACE platform offers a rare opportunity to circumvent the federal authorities and entrenched institutions that have long monopolized Russian political discourse.
"I believe that strategically, representatives of Russia's indigenous peoples and Ukrainians are allies," Pylaeva told the Kyiv Independent. "We face a common challenge and a common misfortune: the imperial and colonial nature of Russia."
"As a result, indigenous and regional perspectives are marginalized and effectively ignored," she said. "This platform is the result of serious international efforts and gives indigenous peoples the opportunity to speak directly."
The wide range of perspectives included among the PACE platform's participants, each reflecting different priorities, is generally seen by them as a source of strength for the work that lies ahead.
"It was very important to us that the platform is not dominated by just one or two (opposition) groups. Instead, it brings in a wider range of people and organizations, ensuring there's no monopoly," Natalia Arno, president of the Free Russia Foundation, told the Kyiv Independent.
"We oppose Putin's monopoly in Russia, and we didn't want to see anything similar in such an important international, pan-European institution like PACE."
Nevertheless, the composition of the platform raises a delicate question: by what authority do these 15 individuals claim to represent Russia's democratic opposition?
While Belarus's opposition can point to the 2020 presidential election, which demonstrated strong support for Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, Russian democratic opposition figures have no recent electoral mandate to establish a comparable claim to legitimacy.
The Belarusian opposition also benefits from formalized recognition. In 2022, the Council of Europe created a "Contact Group on Belarus," where representatives of Tikhanovskaya's team participated.
Russian opposition leaders, by contrast, have thus far lacked any comparable institutional platform.
However, Pylaeva explained that the PACE forum is not a national delegation, but a provisional space for dialogue otherwise unavailable within Russia.
"This is a platform for dialogue, created in a situation where Russia is waging an aggressive war," she said. "PACE is establishing a format for communication with representatives of the opposition and civil society."
She acknowledged the criticism but framed it against the stark political realities within Russia, where independent institutions are weak, dissent is suppressed, and meaningful channels for representation — especially for indigenous and regional communities — are virtually nonexistent.
"I see the first year and format of this platform as an experiment," Pylaeva said. "It is a tool, and I believe it is important to use it."
Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the exiled businessman and opposition activist who also joined the platform, described the formation process as foundational rather than final.
"It must subsequently be revised using a procedure of elections among anti-war Russians," he said. "The main thing now is to demonstrate the effectiveness of the new institution in representing the interests of this segment of Russian society."
Notable absence of Navalny's allies
Strikingly absent from the list of PACE platform participants are any allies of the late opposition leader Alexei Navalny, whose network of activists and political operatives has long challenged the Kremlin's authority and shaped Russia's opposition landscape.
Navalny's Anti-Corruption Foundation (FBK) continues to operate after his death under the leadership of his wife, Yulia Navalnaya, and his close associates.
With a robust online footprint, the organization commands YouTube channels and social media platforms that reach millions across Russia and around the world.
A senior FBK representative told the Kyiv Independent that the group received multiple invitations to join the PACE platform but decided, for now, to decline.
"We were indeed invited several times to take part in the work of the platform," the representative said. "We discussed this issue extensively within our organization and decided, at this stage, to refrain from participating."
"Our priority is working… with anti-Putin and anti-war forces within the country," the representative added.
According to FBK, PACE officials said they would monitor the platform's performance for a year before deciding whether any adjustments were needed.
"We will also be watching," the representative said, leaving open the possibility of reconsidering the organization's involvement. "I do not exclude at all that in a year, for example, we may revise our decision."

Support for Ukraine
As Russia's full-scale war against Ukraine enters its fourth year, one of the questions surrounding the Russian democratic opposition is how effectively and to what extent they might use the PACE platform to call for increased military aid to Ukraine.
Tolokonnikova is among those calling for support that goes beyond mere statements of solidarity, urging concrete action to provide Ukraine with more weapons.
"I think it's very important to represent the voices of those fighting Putin not just with words but with actions, including with weapons for the Russian partisan movement inside Russia, as well as people who left to fight on Ukraine's side," Tolokonnikova told the Kyiv Independent.
"These are some of the brightest representatives of the anti-war movement, and yes, their voices are important."
Arno emphasized that Ukraine has "every right to defend itself by all available means" and said that the Free Russia Foundation provides legal support to pro-democracy Russians residing and working in Ukraine as volunteers and soldiers.
The Free Russian Foundation's Kyiv branch is also actively aiding in the search to locate Ukrainian POWs and civilians kept in Russian shadow prisons, she added.
"Unfortunately, we know Russian prisons all too well. We understand the system, and far too many of our people — including our Vice President Vladimir Kara-Murza — have experienced it firsthand," Arno said.
"We have submitted numerous reports to the ICC, the UN mechanisms, and the OSCE. We also bring delegations of Ukrainian families — both those whose loved ones are still imprisoned and those who have been released — so they can share their personal stories."
"Additionally, we document the methods used by Russian authorities, such as the widespread practice of charging Ukrainians with terrorism. Monitoring and exposing these abuses is one of our organization's top priorities."
A long-standing criticism of the Russian democratic opposition has been that some of its leaders frequently invoke the vision of a "beautiful Russia of the future," yet offer little clarity on the practical realities of a post-Putin transition.
Self-proclaimed pessimist Tolokonnikova told the Kyiv Independent that imagining the so-called beautiful Russia of the future is becoming "harder and harder each year" and that it's important for the Russian democratic opposition to convey the threat posed by Russia not only to Ukraine but to all of Europe.
"I can't guarantee to anyone that after Putin's departure, Russia will necessarily become democratic," she said.
"That's why I think it's necessary to contain Russia as a dangerous neighbor to Europe on all possible levels. What's needed is the language of strength and coercion, not the language of requests."

US ‘not disputing’ a ‘troubling’ European report on Navalny poisoning, Rubio says
The UK and 4 allies concluded in the report that Russia poisoned the opposition figure with a toxin from a poison dart frog
Reading Time:2 minutes
Why you can trust SCMP
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Sunday that Washington is “not disputing” a report by five European countries that imprisoned Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny was fatally poisoned with a rare frog “toxin”.
Rubio said the report released on Saturday by Britain, France, Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden was “very troubling”. Britain, which has outright blamed Russia for Navalny’s death, said it was considering new sanctions on Moscow as a result.
Navalny, a staunch critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin, died in a Siberian prison on February 16, 2024, while serving a 19-year sentence. While Russia has never explained the circumstances, it has said Navalny died suddenly and the foreign ministry in Moscow has dismissed the European report.

Rubio, on a brief visit to Slovakia, said Navalny’s death was “very serious” and the US decision not to join the report “doesn’t mean we disagree with the outcome”.
The report said Navalny was poisoned with a “rare toxin”, epibatidine, from an Ecuadorian dart frog. The Europeans also said that Russia was the prime suspect.

The United States has held contacts with Russian officials on improving ties but Rubio said the US administration did not join the statement because it was a European-led initiative.

IAI Begins Flight Tests of Arrow 4 Interceptor

Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) has begun flight tests of the next-generation Arrow 4 interceptor.
Defense-Update reported the development.
The new interceptor is intended to serve as the upper tier of Israel’s missile defense architecture, replacing earlier-generation Arrow systems.
The program is being developed jointly with the United States, with the participation of the U.S. Missile Defense Agency. The project aims to counter maneuverable and hypersonic threats that are increasingly appearing in the arsenals of countries in the region.
Arrow 4 is designed to replace Arrow 2 and Arrow 3. The new interceptor features greater maneuverability and improved accuracy in the terminal phase of engagement.
According to the developer, the system is equipped with advanced satellite-aided inertial guidance.
New aerodynamic control surfaces enable the missile to execute rapid maneuvers at very high speeds.
IAI President and CEO Boaz Levy previously reported that serial production is scheduled to begin in late 2025, paving the way for initial deployment as early as 2026.
In addition to Israel, the Bundeswehr plans to acquire the Arrow 4 missile defense system.
Combined with the deployment of Arrow 3, the first unit of which is set to become operational in northeastern Germany by the end of the year, the system is expected to provide coverage across a broad range of altitudes.
One of the stated advantages of the Arrow 4 interceptor is its compatibility with existing Arrow radars and launchers.
This is expected to make the system a cost-effective solution.

Trump told Netanyahu he would support Israeli strikes on Iran's ballistic missile program, sources say
President Trump told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during a meeting at Mar-a-Lago in December that the president would support Israeli strikes on Iran's ballistic missile program if a deal between Washington and Tehran could not be reached, according to two sources familiar with the matter who spoke to CBS News on condition of anonymity to discuss national security issues.
Two months later, CBS News has learned that internal discussions between senior figures in the U.S. military and intelligence community have started to contemplate the possibility of supporting a fresh round of Israeli strikes on Iran. American deliberations have focused less on whether Israel could act than on how the United States might assist, including the provision of aerial refueling for Israeli aircraft and the delicate matter of securing overflight permission from countries along the potential route, said two other U.S. officials with knowledge of the matter.
It's not clear what countries would grant overflight permission for the U.S. to refuel Israeli aircraft for a potential strike. Jordan, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have all publicly said they would not allow their airspace to be used for any strikes on Iran or Iranian strikes on any other country.
But the ongoing conversations inside the national security apparatus coincided with a visible show of force from the United States towards Iran. On Thursday, CBS News reported that a second U.S. aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald R. Ford and its flotilla of warships, would be dispatched to the Middle East, joining an already substantial American presence. Four U.S. officials said the carrier strike group is expected to redeploy from the Caribbean, a movement that would place formidable firepower within range of Iran at a moment of heightened strain.
All of it comes as the Trump administration pursues negotiations with Tehran over its nuclear program. Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu remains openly skeptical of diplomacy with Iran and flew to Washington last Wednesday for talks with President Trump. Netanyahu released multiple statements insisting that any Iran accord include restrictions on ballistic missiles and funding of proxies in the region, issues that would extend any deal beyond the nuclear program itself.
Iranian officials have signaled a conditional willingness to curb some uranium enrichment in exchange for relief from punishing economic sanctions, but it is unclear what that looks like and talks have yet to produce any written agreement.
The U.S. and Iran are expected to hold a second round of nuclear talks in Geneva on Tuesday in an effort to reach a deal that prevents war. Iranian state media is reporting that Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi and his delegation are on their way to Geneva for the indirect talks, according to the Associated Press.
U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Sunday that he has "made clear he prefers diplomacy" on Iran, and he confirmed that U.S. envoy Steve Wiktoff and Jared Kushner are traveling "to have important meetings" with Iran.
"We'll see how that comes out," he added.
Mr. Trump, speaking at the White House on Friday, framed the carrier deployment as prudent insurance if negotiations between the United States and Iran fail. By shifting additional naval power into the region, Mr. Trump appears intent on sharpening the leverage behind his demands.

Russia claims capture of another settlement in Ukraine
Chief of General Staff Valery Gerasimov says over 200 square kilometers of Ukraine's territory came under Russian control in February, including 12 settlements
MOSCOW
Russia claimed on Sunday that its forces had captured the settlement of Tsvitkove in Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia region.
The Defense Ministry said in a statement that units of the Vostok (East) group of forces continued their advance after capturing the village.
Separately, Chief of General Staff Valery Gerasimov said the Russian army established control over 12 settlements in the first half of February.
On an unannounced visit to inspect the group of forces Tsentr (Center) in a combat zone, Gerasimov said that over the same period, more than 200 square kilometers (77.2 square miles) of Ukraine's territory came under Russian control.
In another development, Ukraine's railway company Ukrzaliznytsia accused Russia of striking railway infrastructure in the Odesa and Dnipropetrovsk regions.
In Odesa, buildings on the territory of a depot were damaged by the attack. A large fire broke out in the area when a tank car caught fire, the company said.
"There were no casualties. The damage did not affect train traffic," it added.
In the same region, it added, critical infrastructure and some consumers were left without power.
Independent verification of the claims is challenging due to the ongoing conflict.

Six Nations: France only team left who can claim Grand Slam after crushing Wales
France

02:12:50 KST

France turned on the flair with a devastating eight-try show of power as they thrashed Wales 54-12 in their Six Nations meeting at the Principality Stadium in Cardiff on Sunday, February 15. Wing Theo Attissogbe scored twice in the second half as France made it two wins from two. The Bordeaux-Begles no. 10 showed off his pace and skills as he scored one try and teed up three others as France made it two wins from two.
After two rounds they are the only side that can still claim a Grand Slam while Wales sit bottom of the table with two thumping defeats. Steve Tandy's side have won just two of their last 25 Tests and have not won in the Six Nations for three years.
The French came into the match on the back of an equally eye-catching win at home to Ireland and the breadth of their game and the pace and power of their runners were far too much for a Welsh side that suffered a similar 48-7 hammering at Twickenham last week.
The new center pairing of Pau teammates Emilien Gailleton and Fabien Brau-Boirie both touched down in the first half, with Louis Bielle-Biarrey also dotting down for his 23rd try in his 24th Test.
Wales responded with a try by Rhys Carre, but France dominated the second period as Attissogbe scored twice with further scores for hooker Julian Marchand and lock Charles Ollivon, both of whom were playing their 50th Tests. Mason Grady picked up a consolation try for Wales in the 78th minute.
Brau-Boirie scores on debut
The first try came after just 90 seconds, Antoine Dupont and Attisogbe combining down the right, feeding to Ollivon who presented Gailleton with the easiest of run-ins. The second came 10 minutes later when Jalibert sent a perfectly-flighted crosskick over to an unmarked Bielle-Biarrey. Two minutes later, Jalibert showed his pace as he cut through the Wales midfield before popping the ball inside to 20-year-old Brau-Boirie who went through to score on his debut in the center.
Wales refused to buckle, and forced their way up to the French line where they were awarded a penalty. Last week captain Dewi Lake made the fundamental error of forgetting to tap before charging at the English line. This time the skipper got it right and from the ensuing ruck, Carre barged his way over.
France threatened with every attack but the Welsh defense stood firm until a minute before the break when a casual grubber from a turnover ricocheted off a blue shirt and bounced into the arms of Attisogbe. A quick inside pass from the wing sent Jalibert away for the score which pocketed an attacking bonus point.
It took the French all of four minutes to get on the board in the second half, a 5-meter line-out resulting in hooker Julian Marchand, winning his 50th cap, crashing over. Shortly after, Bielle-Biarrey burnt down the left wing before feeding inside for Attisogbe to finish. The Pau wing claimed his double when another Jalibert crosskick found him in acres of space on the right. France posted the half-century when Ollivon went over on the hour. It was France's biggest ever score against Wales, improving on the 51 at Wembley in 1998.

Scottish government launches campaign urging boys not to share sexist content
First Minister of Scotland John Swinney says ministers will do "everything we can" to eradicate violence against women and girls
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
The Scottish Government has launched a new advertising campaign urging boys and young men to avoid sharing misogynistic content online, with the unequivocal message: "sexist content is never harmless". The initiative encourages critical thought before engaging with such material.
One video clip shows a boy watching content on his phone, as a voiceover states, "sexist content is never harmless, it hurts girls in real life – including the ones you know". Emojis on his screen transform into the face of an upset girl, mirroring the person beside him, illustrating real-world impact.
The five-week campaign runs on Instagram, Snapchat, Twitch, YouTube, and outdoor advertising.
First Minister John Swinney said: "Social media plays a significant role in most young people’s lives, and the rise of online misogyny means that young boys and men are often seeing harmful, sexist content, even when they have not been searching for it. This is deeply concerning, particularly given that so many of these young audiences may be easily influenced.
“Our campaign is designed to make boys and young men aware of the impact of sexist content on social media and how interacting with that can harm the women and girls they know in the real world – including their sisters, friends and classmates. By choosing not to like, share or comment on sexist content online, boys and men can help stop it spreading."
Mr Swinney said ministers will do "everything we can" to eradicate violence against women and girls.
Rebekah MacLeod, project lead for White Ribbon Scotland, which tackles violence against women and girls, said: "Everyone has a role to play in ending violence against women and girls, but especially men and boys. There is often a disconnect in understanding of how the content that young people consume and share online impacts upon how they see, speak to, and treat the women and girls around them.
“In an online world shaped by algorithms and increasingly divisive and dangerous narratives, harmful attitudes can be normalised, reinforced, and rewarded at speed and scale. We cannot emphasise just how important this campaign is. This campaign empowers men and boys to understand that they play a powerful role by choosing not to engage or share this harmful content."

Tunisian police detain opposition figure Olfa Hamdi at airport

TUNIS, Feb 15 - Tunisian police detained opposition figure Olfa Hamdi as she arrived at the country’s main airport on Sunday, local media reported, in the latest move against a critic of President Kais Saied.
Hamdi, leader of the Third Republic party, was detained shortly after disembarking from a flight, the reports said. She resides abroad and previously served as CEO of Tunisia's national carrier Tunisair.
Hamdi has repeatedly criticized Saied’s rule and called for the formation of a transitional government and early presidential elections.
Opposition figures described the arrest as part of a wider crackdown on dissent, as Tunisia grapples with deepening polarization since Saied assumed sweeping powers in 2021, a move critics have denounced as a coup.
Authorities made no immediate comment on the arrest. Reuters has been unable to contact Hamdi's lawyer or any of her relatives.
In early February, police arrested a member of parliament known for mocking the president, in what opposition called an effort to stifle critic voices.
Many opposition leaders, along with activists and journalists, are behind bars, with critics accusing Saied of having turned Tunisia into a prison since 2021.
Saied rejects the accusations, insisting that he is not a dictator and that the law applies to everyone, regardless of their position. REUTERS

21 Palestinians displaced when Israeli demolishes family home in occupied West Bank
Rights group says 160-square-meter house razed in Jiyus near Qalqilya, leaving children and elderly family members without shelter
RAMALLAH, Palestine
Twenty-one Palestinians were displaced Sunday after Israeli forces demolished their family home in the town of Jiyus, north of Qalqilya in the occupied West Bank, according to a Palestinian rights organization.
Bedouin rights group Al-Baydar said the 160-square-meter (1,722-square-foot) house was demolished over the alleged lack of a building permit.
The displaced family includes children and elderly members who were left without shelter following the demolition, it added.
Israeli authorities prohibit construction or land reclamation in Area C of the West Bank without permits that Palestinians say are “nearly impossible” to obtain.
According to the Colonization and Wall Resistance Commission, Israel carried out 59 demolition operations in January, targeting 126 Palestinian structures, including 77 inhabited homes. It also reported 40 additional demolition notices, most of them concentrated in the city of Hebron.
Separately, the Israeli government on Sunday approved a proposal to register large areas of the occupied West Bank as “state property” for the first time since the Israeli occupation of the territory in 1967.
Israel has intensified operations in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, since launching its military campaign in Gaza on Oct. 8, 2023. Palestinians view the escalation – including killings, arrests, displacement, and settlement expansion – as a step toward formal annexation of the territory.
At least 1,112 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank, about 11,500 wounded, and more than 21,000 detained during that period, according to Palestinian estimates.
In a landmark opinion last July, the International Court of Justice declared Israel’s occupation of Palestinian territory illegal and called for the evacuation of all settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem.

Iraqi embassy in Saudi Arabia issues clarification on viral video of ambassador
The Iraqi Embassy in Saudi Arabia issued a statement today regarding a social media video featuring Ambassador Safia Talib Al-Suhail.
Some posts alleged the video showed "undiplomatic behaviour" toward an official Iraqi delegation.
According to the statement, the ambassador and Iraqi delegation attending the Saudi Defence Exhibition 2026 hosted an event at the embassy’s official residence.
The gathering included Saudi dignitaries and members of the Iraqi community. The embassy emphasised that Iraq was the host, and Saudi guests attended by invitation.
The embassy clarified that the event followed diplomatic customs, with seating arranged by precedence. The occasion was social and introductory, not a formal protocol ceremony.
The statement noted that the video was taken out of context. It showed the ambassador and delegation moving within the residence to invite guests to dinner, in line with the social traditions of both countries. The embassy stated this scene was misinterpreted and did not reflect the actual event.
The embassy explained that the ambassador's and delegation’s movements signalled that the invitation included both Saudi guests and all Iraqi delegation members. This was a routine organisational procedure consistent with hospitality customs, with no breach of protocol or precedence.
The embassy emphasised that the meeting was conducted in a friendly atmosphere, reflecting strong Iraq–Saudi Arabia relations and mutual respect. All actions followed international diplomatic practices, preserving Iraq’s standing and showing full appreciation for the guests.
The embassy affirmed its right to clarify any incomplete or inaccurate public information to maintain transparency and uphold the fraternal relationship between the two countries.
Parliament Orders Investigation
Following the event in Riyadh, Parliament Speaker Haibat al-Halbousi directed the formation of an investigative committee, requested communication with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and called for the Iraqi ambassador in Saudi Arabia to be summoned within 48 hours.
Iraqi social media users are divided over the video. One group stated that the invitation occurred at the ambassador’s residence and that, in Iraqi culture, it is customary for the host to stand and greet guests, which shows respect and does not breach diplomatic protocol.
The other group argues the ambassador and staff violated diplomatic etiquette, suggesting Iraq was "belittled" while Saudis were seated and Iraqis stood.

Dumping Ley may have been the answer, but One Nation has radically changed the question

Dumping Ley may have been the answer, but One Nation has radically changed the question
In the end, the numbers just got worse – no matter what Sussan Ley did.
These poll results offer both a damning indictment of the final days of her leadership and vindication for the Liberal Party’s decision to sack her.
They also offer a glimpse at the momentous challenge ahead for Angus Taylor, even if he has delivered a small lift to the Coalition’s plummeting primary vote.
The official opposition and One Nation each secured a primary vote of 23 per cent, a record low for the Coalition and a record high for Pauline Hanson’s party, as support in the polls has almost quadrupled since 6.4 per cent of Australians voted for her candidates at the election last May.
This month’s Resolve poll was conducted from February 8 to 14, a week that began as Ley struck a bargain with Nationals leader David Littleproud to reunite the Coalition, but ended with Taylor in charge of the Liberal Party. All 1800 respondents were asked to express their primary vote intention with Ley as leader and then with Taylor in charge and the results, for Ley, were disastrous.
With Ley in charge, the Coalition secured a primary vote of just 20 per cent, whereas One Nation won the primary vote of 25 per cent of voters. In other words, things had gotten so bad under Ley that the Coalition was trailing One Nation, for the first time ever in the Resolve poll, by 5 percentage points.
That is a statistically significant movement outside the margin of error of plus or minus 2.3 per cent and it underscores the extent to which voters had switched off from Ley.
Voters started deserting the Coalition for One Nation soon after the last election, and the Coalition’s months-long civil war only hastened the decline in the Liberal primary vote.
One Nation’s popularity has also created a new problem for pollsters estimating the two-party-preferred vote, which has led this masthead – and others – to hold back from highlighting those results.
When voters were asked to state their preferences, Labor held a 10 percentage point, 55-45 lead over the Coalition in the two-party-preferred vote.
But those numbers are potentially inaccurate because in some seats where One Nation is polling well, a two-candidate preferred count that pitched Labor against One Nation, or the Coalition against One Nation, would be more accurate.
One Nation support is typically concentrated in a smaller group of seats – rural and outer urban – so it is not yet clear which seats should be polled on a two-candidate-preferred basis.
Resolve Pollster Jim Reed said the two-party-preferred vote “only works at a national level when you have a binary contest”.
“We’ve always preferred to focus on primary vote, which is how we were able to call the Greens and teals wins in 2022,” he said.
“The political shift here is beginning to look more like the UK experience now, where Reform began cannibalising one side of politics, but then went on to damage both sides of politics.”
The preferred prime minister rating has also not been in the spotlight this month, as it usually is, as the data compared only Ley and Albanese, rather than Taylor and Albanese.
Even if Ley were still the opposition leader, this result would be a disaster as Albanese holds a substantial 16 percentage point lead over Ley, 38-22, with the rest undecided. Last month, Albanese led Ley by 4 points, 33-29.
The ongoing collapse in support for both major parties is spelt out here and in other polls. At the election in May last year, 33.6 per cent of voters gave their first preference to other options, including One Nation, the Greens or an independent.
Less than 12 months later, 45 per cent of voters say they would vote for someone other than the major parties in a contest between Albanese and Taylor. Just under half, 49 per cent of voters, would have voted for minor parties and independents while Ley still led the opposition, an even worse result.
These figures highlight just how far the Coalition has fallen out of favour. The recovery by a couple of percentage points in the first flush of the Taylor-led opposition is nice, but to form government one day, the opposition needs its primary vote to be closer to 40 per cent than 20 per cent.
Oh, before Labor starts gloating, Albanese should remember that his party could be next as disaffection for the major parties grows.

A storm system sweeps across the Southeast triggering tornado warnings and damaging winds
A strong storm system is bringing tornado watches and widespread damage across the Southeast just as the Northeast starts to warm up
- Bookmark
A storm system sweeping across the Southeast late Saturday and Sunday brought tornado warnings to Mississippi and Louisiana, and then took aim at parts of Georgia and Florida, as people in the Northeast were finally getting a reprieve from weeks of bitterly cold temperatures.
Some of the fiercest storms in the South were reported near Lake Charles, Louisiana, where high winds from a thunderstorm overturned a horse trailer and a Mardi Gras float, damaged an airport jet bridge and flung the metal awning from a house into power lines. The damage was documented by National Weather Service employees who surveyed the area.
Power poles were snapped and toppled near the Louisiana towns of Jena, Cheneyville and Donaldsonville, the weather service reported.
No deaths or serious injuries were reported, but the damage reports came as the storm system continued its path into parts of south Georgia and the Florida Panhandle, which were under tornado watches on Sunday.
Meanwhile, the Northeast was beginning to thaw after a weeks-long stretch of uncommonly cold weather.
Boston was running nearly 7 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 14 Celsius) below average for February by midweek, and the city was on pace for its coldest winter in more than a decade. Boston remained cold on Sunday, but the week’s forecast called for temperatures climbing into the high 30s and low 40s, which is closer to the seasonal average.
Elsewhere in the U.S., parts of California were bracing for showers, thunderstorms and snow showers. Jacob Spender, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Sacramento, said a storm system was moving on shore in California throughout Sunday and through the week.
Heavy snow was forecast for elevated areas, Spender said.
“As we get up into the mountains and the foothills, we’re going to be looking at some snowfall,” Spender said. “So there will be snowfall all the way down into the foothills as well."
Spender said people should heed travel advisories in the coming days.
“So if they are traveling, packing winter safety kits. Anything to be prepared. This is a bigger system, and a major system,” Spender said.

Indonesia says 8,000 troops ready to deploy to Gaza by June as Trump touts effort

Indonesia says 8,000 troops ready to deploy to Gaza by June as Trump touts effort
US president says members of Board of Peace, meant to oversee the postwar Strip, pledged over $5 billion toward reconstruction and ‘thousands of personnel’ to oversee security
Indonesia’s military said on Sunday that up to 8,000 troops are expected to be ready by the end of June for a potential deployment in a humanitarian and peace mission to Gaza, as US President Donald Trump said countries had committed “thousands of personnel” to a postwar force for the Strip.
Trump’s 20-point plan for Gaza envisions an International Stabilization Force overseeing the territory’s security as the Israel Defense Forces gradually withdraws. But Trump has struggled to get countries to commit soldiers to the mission, amid uncertainty over whether Hamas will agree to disarm and conflict will again escalate in the territory.
On Sunday, however, he broadcast optimism over the force coming together. The Board of Peace, chaired by Trump and meant to oversee postwar Gaza, will hold its first meeting on Thursday in Washington, DC.
Trump wrote on Truth Social that over $5 billion in pledges toward the reconstruction of Gaza will be announced at Thursday’s Washington summit.
The Times of Israel first revealed the planned donations last week, with two Arab diplomats saying that the US was aiming to announce donations from the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, and Kuwait at around $1.25 billion each. The New York Times reported that the US is also planning on making a similar donation.
Trump said in his Sunday Truth Social post that the Thursday meeting will also see countries announce plans to contribute “thousands of personnel to the International Stabilization Force (ISF) and local police to maintain security and peace for Gazans.”
“Very importantly, Hamas must uphold its commitment to full and immediate demilitarization,” Trump said.
Hamas officials have denied ever making such a commitment and have pledged to hold on to their weapons.
The Indonesian commitment, first announced last week, marks a step forward for the peacekeeping force. Spokesperson Brig. Gen. Donny Pramono said the Indonesian National Armed Forces, known as TNI, has finalized its proposed troop structure and a timeline for their movement to Gaza, though the government has yet to decide when the deployment will take place.
“In principle, we are ready to be assigned anywhere,” Pramono told the AP. “Our troops are fully prepared and can be dispatched at short notice once the government gives formal approval.”
Pramono said the Indonesian military prepared a composite brigade of 8,000 personnel, based on decisions made during a February 12 meeting about the mission.
Indonesia’s Foreign Ministry has repeatedly said any Indonesian role in Gaza will be strictly humanitarian. Indonesia’s contribution would focus on civilian protection, medical services and reconstruction.
Indonesian troops would not take part in any combat operations or actions that could lead to direct confrontation with armed groups, making it unlikely that the country would play a meaningful role in the effort to get Hamas to disarm.
Under the Indonesian military’s schedule, troops will undergo health checks and paperwork throughout February, followed by a force readiness review at the end of the month, Pramono said. He also revealed that about 1,000 personnel are expected to be ready to deploy as an advance team by April, with the rest following by June.
Pramono said that being ready does not mean the troops will depart. The deployment still requires a political decision and depends on international mechanisms, he said. Last week, the Indonesian ministry denied reports in Israeli media that the deployment of Indonesian troops would be in southern Gaza’s Rafah and Khan Younis.
Indonesia, the world’s most populous Muslim-majority nation, does not have formal diplomatic relations with Israel and has long been a strong supporter of a two-state solution, which would see a Palestinian state established alongside Israel. It has been deeply involved in providing humanitarian aid to Gaza, including funding a hospital.
Indonesian officials have justified joining the Board of Peace by saying it was necessary to defend Palestinian interests from within, since Israel is included on the board but there is no Palestinian representation.
Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto is due to attend the meeting of the board this week. His spokesman Prasetyo Hadi said last week that there would be negotiations before Indonesia paid the $1 billion being asked for permanent membership on the Board of Peace. He did not clarify whom the negotiations would be with.
The Southeast Asian country has experience in peacekeeping operations as one of the top 10 contributors to United Nations missions, including in Lebanon.
Addressing the UN General Assembly in September, Subianto said the world must respect Israel’s right to live in security, and ended his speech saying, “Shalom.”

Israel’s law shaped Trump’s historic recognition of Golan Heights - opinion
Unknown

“The State of Israel took control of the Golan Heights in 1967 to safeguard its security from external threats. I, Donald J. Trump, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim that the United States recognizes that the Golan Heights are part of the State of Israel.”
This was the text of the historic proclamation Trump issued as he stood next to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on March 25, 2019. In response to the president’s proclamation, the United Nations Press Office reported, “Most Security Council members expressed regret today over the decision by the United States to recognize Israel’s sovereignty over the Syrian Golan, stressing the importance of upholding international law, as the 15-member organ heard briefings on the situation in that occupied territory.”
Why was President Trump’s proclamation so controversial?
In the Six Day War of 1967, Israel, facing existential threats from Egypt, Jordan and Syria, heroically reclaimed its ancient biblical heartlands in a stunning display of resilience and strategy. This triumphant return to historic Jewish lands culminated in securing the Golan Heights from Syrian aggression, ensuring lasting security for Israel’s northern communities.
The world’s opposition to Israel’s control of the Golan Heights stems primarily from the post-World War II principle that the acquisition of territory by force, even in self-defense, is inconsistent with international law, as enshrined in the UN Charter and reinforced by resolutions like Security Council Resolution 497 (1981), which declared Israel’s annexation that year “null and void” and without legal effect.
Most nations see the Golan Heights as occupied territory
Most nations view the area as occupied Syrian territory, demanding withdrawal to the 1967 lines per Resolutions 242 and 338. Critics highlight ongoing settlement expansion, displacement of Syrians, and resource exploitation as violations of the Fourth Geneva Convention. Only the United States recognizes Israeli sovereignty, while the international community, including annual UN General Assembly votes, overwhelmingly rejects it.
A fascinating note to mark is that although most of the world assumes Israel annexed the Golan Heights, and did so illegally, the Jewish state never actually did. Instead, Israel extended its sovereignty to the Golan Heights. The difference between extending sovereignty and annexing is important and instructs Israel’s future policies.
In a 1994 piece for the Brooklyn Journal of International Law, Leon Sheleff explained that Israel’s 1981 Golan Heights Law, pushed through by prime minister Menachem Begin, never actually annexed the territory Israel took from Syria in 1967. Instead, it simply extended Israeli law, administration, and jurisdiction over the area.
Begin, still recovering from illness at the time, moved fast on this amid ongoing Syrian threats. Notice how the law itself carefully avoids the word “annexation,” a deliberate contrast to something like the explicit unification of Jerusalem.
Back then, after 1967, the Golan had almost no Syrian institutional footprint left. Most people had fled, and the remaining Druze communities were basically running things under their own customary rules. Applying Israeli law filled that empty space without forcing citizenship on anyone. Residents kept their Syrian nationality, and only a small number ever asked for Israeli citizenship voluntarily, a fact Israeli courts later confirmed.
Sheleff pointed out a larger distinction: Applying domestic law isn’t the same as extending sovereignty outright. He brings examples from international practice where laws get imposed on territory without transferring sovereignty, which fits with the rules against one-sided annexation of occupied land.
Philosophically, Begin refused to annex the Golan Heights because he maintained that a nation can’t annex land that has historically always been theirs. He included the Golan Heights in historically Jewish land and therefore felt it could not be annexed.
The economic Cooperation Foundation is a leading Israeli think-tank that was critical of Israel’s extension of sovereignty over the Golan Heights. It described the Israeli Golan law as unilaterally extending Israeli jurisdiction and administration to the Golan Heights. This effectively constituted an annexation of the territory that was occupied from Syria during the 1967 Six Day War.
Passed almost 40 years ago, it doesn’t seem likely that the Golan law will ever be reversed. The discussion over its legal significance seems largely academic, but in truth, it has significance in today’s discussions over other areas aside from the Golan that Israel took control over in 1967, including Judea and Samaria and even Gaza.
Opponents of an Israeli annexation of the other territories claim that Israel isn’t intending to annex these lands.
Instead, they claim, Jerusalem is planning to slowly extend sovereignty over these areas and follow the path taken in the Golan law. Regardless of whether that ever happens, they claim an expanding Israeli footprint in Judea and Samaria is creating de facto Israeli sovereignty.
Proponents of Israeli sovereignty over Judea and Samaria fall into two camps. There are those who campaign for immediate Israeli annexation of Judea and Samaria. Others follow Begin’s path and argue that Israel can’t annex Judea and Samaria because it is historically already Jewish land. They argue for a Golan-like extension of sovereignty over Judea and Samaria.
To summarize, despite widespread assumptions and international condemnation, Israel never formally annexed the Golan Heights in 1981. Instead, through the Golan Heights Law, it extended Israeli law, jurisdiction, and administration, a deliberate distinction allowing governance without explicit sovereignty transfer. This approach, rooted in security needs and historical claims, preserved diplomatic flexibility for potential peace negotiations while achieving de facto control.
President Trump’s 2019 recognition affirmed Israeli sovereignty amid ongoing threats, yet the nuanced legal framing continues to influence debates on whether to apply similar models to other territories like Judea and Samaria, balancing practical retention with sensitivities to international law.

US ‘not disputing’ European assessment of Navalny poisoning, Rubio says
The secretary of state says Washington will not fight European partners on their findings as the UK considers new sanctions.
The United States says it is not disputing European findings that Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny was poisoned with a rare frog toxin as the United Kingdom signals possible new sanctions against Moscow.
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, speaking during a visit to Slovakia on Sunday, called the European report “very troubling” and “very serious”.

- list 4 of 4Europeans say Russia poisoned dissident Alexey Navalny with dart frog toxin
The UK, France, Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden on Saturday accused the Russian state of killing Navalny two years ago in a Siberian penal colony.
In a joint statement, the five countries said laboratory analysis of samples from his body found epibatidine, a toxin associated with South American dart frogs, and argued there was no innocent explanation for its presence.
The announcement, made almost exactly two years after Navalny’s death in February 2024, increases pressure on the Kremlin and raises the prospect of further coordinated Western action.
While Washington did not join the European statement, Rubio said the decision did not signal its disagreement.
“We don’t have any reason to question it,” Rubio said, adding that the US was not seeking “a fight” with its European partners over the findings.
UK threatens further sanctions
The UK warned that it was considering imposing further sanctions on Moscow.
Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper told the BBC that the government would “continue to look at coordinated action, including increasing sanctions on the Russian regime”.
“We believe that it is the partnerships that we build abroad that make us stronger at home. It is by acting alongside our European allies, alongside allies across the world, that we do maintain that pressure on the Russian regime,” she said.
The five European nations said epibatidine is not found naturally in Russia and Moscow had the means, motive and opportunity to administer the toxin while Navalny was imprisoned.
They said the findings underlined the need to hold Russia accountable under international conventions banning chemical and biological weapons.
Russia has denied any involvement. The Russian embassy in London dismissed the accusations as propaganda and questioned the credibility of Western experts.
Moscow has previously said Navalny died of natural causes and has not publicly detailed the circumstances.
Navalny, President Vladimir Putin’s most prominent domestic critic, died while serving a 19-year sentence on “extremism” and other charges he rejected as politically motivated.
His death prompted protests and memorials across European capitals and intensified Western scrutiny of Russia’s human rights record.
Any new sanctions would add to sweeping measures imposed on Russia since its full-scale invasion of Ukraine four years ago, further straining relations between Moscow and Western governments.

Google reinstates popular Palestinian UpScrolled app after brief suspension
UpScrolled, a social media app developed by a Palestinian-Australian software engineer as an alternative to censorship on other platforms has been reinstated on the Google Play Store on Sunday after a suspension lasting approximately one day.
The app, launched by Issam Hijazi in June 2025 after accusations that TikTok was censoring pro-Palestinian content, has grown rapidly to over 2.5 million users, becoming one of the most widely downloaded apps on the Play Store and the App Store.
Many users began switching to UpScrolled when TikTok’s US operations were acquired by a consortium of pro-Israel investors.
It has marketed itself as a space free of the influence of billionaires and algorithms which engage in shadow-banning.
At one point downloads of UpScrolled surpassed those of TikTok in the US, the UK, and Australia and its servers were overwhelmed.
Google initially removed the app from the Play Store on Saturday without providing any explanation, and users searching for it received a “not found” message.
UpScrolled issued a statement sarcastically linking the ban to Valentine’s Day and saying it was working to resolve the issue with the Google Play team.
However, on Sunday, UpScrolled announced that it was back on Google.
"It's official… We're back together! Google Play reinstated," the platform said on the social media platform X.
While still marketing itself as a censorship-free space, UpScrolled has recently expanded its moderation team in response to criticisms that some harmful content was available on the app.

Italy is having its best Winter Olympics of all time at a pace that crushes its 1994 medal count
Italy is having its best Winter Olympics of all time and its medal count continues to climb at the Milan Cortina Games
- Bookmark
It’s official: Host nation Italy is having its best Winter Olympics of all time.
Italy picked up four medals in quick succession on Sunday — two golds, a silver and a bronze — to reach 22 and surpass its previous best medal haul of 20, set more than 30 years ago at the Lillehammer Games in 1994.
And there are still seven days left of competition at the Milan Cortina Games.
Italy's cross-country team set the day off with bronze in the men's 4 x 7.5-kilometer relay, and then came a flurry of three medals in less than an hour.
Federica Brignone won an incredible second gold medal with a victory in the giant slalom, barely a month after returning to racing following a horrific injury last year.
Half an hour later, Michela Moioli and Lorenzo Sommariva finished second in the mixed team snowboard cross to pick up Italy’s 21st medal. Shortly after that, Lisa Vittozzi won gold in the 10-kilometer pursuit biathlon race.
“We are witnessing something historic, for our talented and extraordinary athletes,” local organizing committee president Giovanni Malagò said. "But this success makes us so happy also because we are reaping the fruits of years and years of hard work.”
The total is more than the target of 19 medals set by Italian Olympic Committee president Luciano Buonfiglio before the Games began.
The breakdown so far? Eight gold medals, four silver and 10 bronze.
In Lillehammer, Italy finished fourth in the final medal table — behind Russia, host nation Norway and Germany. At Milan Cortina, the Italians have consistently been in the top two, trailing Norway (24 medals) early on Sunday.
At the last Winter Olympics, in Beijing, Italy won 17 medals. It fared worse the last time it hosted the Games, collecting 11 in Turin in 2006.
The signs that Italy could do something special at its home games were there right from Day 3, when it had a record-breaking day on home snow and ice with a haul of six medals, the most the nation had ever won in a single day at the Winter Olympics.
“What an incredible day: Six medals in 24 hours at the Winter Olympics will go down in history,” Malagò said. “And what’s also incredible is the multidisciplinary nature of the medals. We have become a country that is capable of being competitive in sports where we have never been.
“That is fundamental in the Olympic program and in the final medal table. … I have always been of the opinion that the strength of a country can be seen in how many medals in different sports you manage to earn, not necessarily the number of golds.”
The stories behind some of the medals have added to the feel-good moment sweeping the country.
The 35-year-old Brignone skied through the pain to win gold in the women’s super-G on Thursday, following a year spent largely in rehab after breaking multiple bones in her leg.
Arianna Fontana, the most decorated short track speedskater of all time, won her 12th and 13th medals, equaling fencer Edoardo Mangiarotti’s record for most Olympic medals by an Italian athlete — a mark that has stood since 1960.
“We’re getting to see the Italian team do incredibly well. … I’ve been very fortunate to have gotten to witness Federica’s and Arianna’s golds, which were just incredible,” International Olympic Committee President Kirsty Coventry said on Friday. “Their stories of resilience and fight and everything good in humanity was really showcased.
“Both athletes I have so much respect for … Arianna is now the most decorated Italian athlete, summer or winter Olympian. And to do that at home, it’s so cool. I’m so excited for her. And you could feel in the stadium yesterday, last night, just the passion and the love and the respect.”

Israeli cabinet approves West Bank land registration, Palestinians slam 'de-facto annexation'
Israel's cabinet on Sunday approved further measures to tighten Israel's control over the occupied West Bank and make it easier for settlers to buy land, in a move Palestinians called "a de-facto annexation".
The West Bank is among the territories that the Palestinians seek for a future independent state. Much of it is under Israeli military control, with limited Palestinian self-rule in some areas run by the Western-backed Palestinian Authority (PA).
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is facing an election later this year, deems the establishment of any Palestinian state a security threat.
His ruling coalition includes many pro-settler members who want Israel to annex the West Bank, land captured in the 1967 Six-Day War following an illegal invasion.
Ministers voted in favour of beginning a process of land registration for the first time since 1967.
"We are continuing the revolution of settlement and strengthening our hold across all parts of our land," said Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, a far-right member of Netanyahu's government.
Defence Minister Israel Katz said land registration was a vital security measure designed to ensure control, enforcement, and full freedom of action for Israel in the area to "protect its citizens and safeguard national interests".
The cabinet claimed in a statement registration was an "appropriate response to illegal land registration processes promoted by the Palestinian Authority," and would end disputes.
The PA presidency rejected the cabinet's decision, saying it constitutes "a de-facto annexation of occupied Palestinian territory and a declaration of the commencement of annexation plans aimed at entrenching the occupation through illegal settlement activity".
US President Donald Trump has ruled out Israeli annexation of the West Bank but his administration has not sought to curb Israel's accelerated settlement building, which the Palestinians say denies them a potential state by eating away at its territory.
The United Nations' highest court said in a non-binding advisory opinion in 2024 that Israel's occupation of Palestinian territories and settlements there are illegal and should be ended as soon as possible. Israel disputes this view, saying it has historical and biblical ties to the land.
The land registration adds to a series of measures taken earlier this month to expand control.

Tops Swiss diplomat says sure Russia wants to make step toward peace in Ukraine

GENEVA, February 15. /TASS/. Russia really wants to take a step toward peace in Ukraine, Swiss Foreign Minister Ignazio Cassis said, commenting on his talks with his Russian counterpart, Sergey Lavrov, in Moscow a week ago.
"After these talks, I got the impression that Russia really wants to take a step toward peace. The question is not whether it wants this, but at what price," he said in an interview with the SRF television channel.
"I think that if I had not visited Moscow a week ago, it would have been difficult to imagine that this meeting would now take place in Geneva," he said, referring to another round of talks on the Ukrainian settlement due to be held in Geneva on February 17 and 18.
On February 6, Lavrov held talks with Cassis, who arrived in Moscow in the capacity of Chairperson-in-Office of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) along with OSCE Secretary General Feridun Sinirlioglu. The talks focused on ways to get out of the current profound crisis of the organization. The OSCE officials also raised the issue of the organization’s role in promoting dialogue on the settlement of the conflict in Ukraine.
On January 23, the first day of trilateral security consultations took place in Abu Dhabi. A second meeting was held on January 24. The Russian negotiating team was led by Igor Kostyukov, head of the Main Directorate of the Russian Armed Forces’ General Staff. The Ukrainian part of the trilateral working group was headed by National Security and Defense Council Secretary Rustem Umerov. The second round of trilateral talks were also held in Abu Dhabi on February 4 and 5. Russian presidential press secretary Dmitry Peskov announced another round of trilateral talks on Ukraine in Geneva on February 17 and 18. The Russian delegation will be led by presidential aide Vladimir Medinsky.

Without Ukraine, discussions on European security are impossible – Poroshenko following the Munich Conference
Member of Parliament of Ukraine and leader of the European Solidarity party Petro Poroshenko said following the Munich Security Conference that discussions on Europe’s security situation without Ukraine are impossible.
“Both during the war, which must be stopped, and after the war, as the most powerful army on the continent – the Armed Forces of Ukraine – will remain a key factor for security on the continent,” he said in an interview with Polish broadcaster Slawa TV.
According to him, conference participants demonstrated a growing awareness of the risks associated with a potential reduction of the U.S. role in European security, while the dominant view in Munich was recognition of Ukraine’s key role in ensuring security on the continent.
“…if anyone raises the issue of the United States withdrawing from Europe, this would create a vacuum, and that vacuum would be filled. It would be filled by Russia through elements of hybrid warfare, support for radical left-wing and far-right regimes, and the use of democratic mechanisms to destroy democracy in Europe,” he stressed.
Poroshenko also underlined the importance of transatlantic unity.
“What unites us is not a shared history. What unites us is values. […] Therefore, the key result we must achieve is transatlantic unity,” he said.
The former president added that, in his view, Russia cannot be trusted.
“The only language Putin understands, and the one that can prevent further aggression, is the language of strength,” Poroshenko reiterated.
He noted that effective security guarantees for Ukraine require the presence of partner countries’ military contingents.
“What can stop a future attack by Putin? Not security guarantees if they are limited to weapons supplies, financing, and sanctions coordination. Security guarantees mean only one thing – boots on the ground. The presence of armed forces of partner countries on Ukrainian territory. This is the only thing that can stop Putin from attacking,” Poroshenko said.
Poroshenko also stressed that Ukraine’s accelerated accession to NATO remains relevant, and that allied support is essential during the transition period.

Police in Italy have arrested an Israeli woman at Milan’s airport at Russia’s request over a role she allegedly held during the country’s 2018 elections, according to Russian independent media and her husband.
The independent Russian outlet SVTV reported Saturday that security services at Milan’s airport confirmed the arrest.
In an anonymous Facebook post seeking legal and diplomatic assistance, the woman’s husband described the case as political persecution. He said Russian authorities declared her wanted over her role on a local election commission during the 2018 vote.
“We knew a criminal case had been opened against her after she left Russia in 2022 and that she had been placed on an international wanted list,” he wrote.
According to the husband, she was declared wanted after failing to appear for a court hearing. After she left Russia and moved with him to Israel, where the couple obtained citizenship, an international arrest warrant was issued, he said.
“I desperately need assistance on this matter — who to contact and what to do in this situation?” he wrote.
He said the couple had traveled to Europe twice since leaving Russia without incident. The situation changed during a visit to Lithuania, where customs officials informed the woman that Russia was seeking her and warned the couple. However, he said, they were reassured that they could move freely within Europe without fear.
She was later detained at Milan’s airport, he said.
Human rights activists condemned the arrest, calling it political persecution. Activists who spoke to the independent outlet Port said they had attempted to contact officials at Milan’s airport but were refused information about the reasons for the detention and were referred instead to the Russian consulate.

Trump says Board of Peace members pledged over $5B for Gaza

U.S. President Donald Trump said Sunday that countries in the Board of Peace will commit more than $5 billion for Gaza’s rebuilding and humanitarian relief at a meeting scheduled for Thursday.
In a post on Truth Social on Sunday, Trump wrote that member states have also committed thousands of personnel toward a U.N.-authorized stabilization force and local police in the Palestinian enclave.
The U.S. president said Thursday's gathering, the first official meeting of the group, will take place at the Donald J. Trump Institute of Peace, which the State Department recently renamed after the president.
Delegations from more than 20 countries, including heads of state, are expected to attend. The board's creation was endorsed by a United Nations Security Council resolution as part of the Trump administration's plan to end Israel’s war on Gaza.
Rebuilding the Palestinian territory will be a daunting endeavor. The United Nations, World Bank and European Union estimate that reconstruction of the territory will cost $70 billion. Few places in the Gaza Strip were left unscathed by more than two years of Israeli bombardment.
Israel and Hamas agreed to the plan last year with a ceasefire officially taking effect in October, although Israel continued attacks in Gaza, killing more than 590 Palestinians since. Israel’s brutal war on the blockaded enclave killed more than 71,000 people, mostly women and children, since Oct. 7, 2023.
The ceasefire deal calls for an armed international stabilization force to keep security and ensure the disarming of Hamas, a key demand of Israel. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu previously warned Hamas would be disarmed "the easy way or the hard way, but it will happen."
Hamas has not publicly committed to disarmament, though senior official Khaled Meshal recently suggested the group intends to retain its weapons, stating: "As long as there's an occupation, there's resistance," while adding that armed action against Israel may not be likely "in the next 10 to 15 years."
Thus far, few countries have expressed interest in taking part in the proposed force. Indonesia has said up to 8,000 troops are expected to ready by the end of June for a potential deployment in Gaza. It would be the first country to formally commit troops to the security mission created under Trump’s board.
It is not clear how many of the more than 20 members of the Board of Peace will attend the first meeting. Netanyahu, who held White House talks with Trump last week, is not expected to be there.
While regional Middle East powers including Türkiye, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Israel, as well as emerging nations such as Indonesia, have joined the board, global powers and traditional Western U.S. allies have been more cautious.
Trump's new board was first seen as a mechanism focused on ending the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza. But it has taken shape with his ambition for a far broader mandate of resolving global crises and appears to be the latest U.S. effort to sidestep the United Nations as Trump aims to reset the post-World War II international order.

Rallies held across the world in support of Iran’s anti-government protesters

Hundreds of thousands of people have taken part in rallies around the world to show their solidarity with anti-government demonstrators in Iran whose continued protests have been met with brutal and deadly repression.
On Saturday, Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of Iran’s last shah, addressed a crowd of 200,000 people in Munich, telling them he was ready to lead the country to a “secular democratic future”.
Pahlavi urged Iranians at home and abroad to continue demonstrating, calling on them to chant slogans from their homes and rooftops at 8pm (4.30pm UK time) on Saturday and Sunday to coincide with the protests in Germany and elsewhere.
Thousands more people took part in solidarity demonstrations in cities including Los Angeles, Washington, Toronto, Tel Aviv, Lisbon, Sydney and London.
Washington is preparing for a fresh round of talks with Iranian government representatives in Geneva this week despite Trump’s insistence that a change of power in Tehran would be the “best thing”.
Pahlavi – who is based in the US and who has not returned to Iran since before the 1979 Islamic revolution that ousted the monarchy – told the crowd in Munich that he could lead a democratic handover.
“I am here to guarantee a transition to a secular democratic future,” he said. “I am committed to be the leader of transition for you so we can one day have the final opportunity to decide the fate of our country through a democratic, transparent process to the ballot box.”
One protester, a 62-year-old who is originally from Iran and gave his named only as Said, told Agence France-Presse (AFP): “The Iranian regime is a dead regime. It must be game over.”
Speaking on Friday as he sent a second aircraft carrier to the Middle East to ratchet up military pressure on Tehran, Trump said a change of government in Iran would be the “best thing that could happen”.
Trump had earlier threatened military intervention to support a wave of protests in Iran that peaked in January and were met by a violent crackdown that rights groups say killed thousands.
Although Trump had initially said the US was “locked and loaded” to help demonstrators when the government crackdown began, he has since focused his military threats on Tehran’s nuclear programme, which US forces struck last June during Israel’s 12-day war with Iran.
Representatives of Iran and the US, which have had no diplomatic relations since shortly after the 1979 revolution, held talks on the nuclear programme last week in Oman.
On Sunday, a Swiss foreign ministry spokesperson told AFP that Oman would host talks in Geneva next week.
Videos verified by AFP showed people in Iran this week chanting anti-government slogans despite the crackdown, as the clerical leadership celebrated the anniversary of the Islamic revolution.
According to the US-based Human Rights Activists’ News Agency, at least 7,010 people, mostly protesters, were killed in the crackdown, though they and other rights groups say the toll is likely far higher. It said more than 53,845 people had been arrested.
The Iranian opposition remains divided and Pahlavi has faced criticism for his support for Israel and making a highly publicised visit in 2023 that fractured an attempt to unify opposition camps. He has also never distanced himself from his father’s autocratic rule.

Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has stressed that he is younger than Kremlin leader Vladimir Putin and that Putin "does not have much time".
Source: Zelenskyy in an interview with Politico at the Munich Security Conference
Quote: "I think Putin is also in a difficult position, because I can speak with you and shake hands, I'm not afraid, I want to be free…
I'm here, you see. I'm a free person. And I'm younger than Putin. Believe me, this is important. He does not have much time. Not much time, God bless."
Details: Speaking about possible elections in Ukraine, Zelenskyy said that 90% of Ukrainians oppose elections being held during the war.
"It's interesting that 90% [of Ukrainians – ed.] are against elections now. If anyone is interested in what Ukrainians think," he said.
"If President Trump gives me, by pushing Putin, a ceasefire for two-three months, we will do elections," Zelenskyy promised.
Asked how exactly Trump should exert pressure on Putin, Zelenskyy named three steps: ensure Ukraine has strong security guarantees, provide a recovery package, and call Putin to tell him to "stop where you are now".
Quote: "But if Putin says 'no', President Trump has to give us everything we need to save ourselves and defend ourselves and stay strong. But I think that we need to finish the war, not continue fighting."

Alcaraz and Sinner set for Doha showdown as Qatar ExxonMobil Open returns

Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner headline the Qatar ExxonMobil Open in Doha, recently voted ATP 500 Tournament of the Year. With Novak Djokovic withdrawing, the spotlight shifts firmly to the sport's new generation.
The world’s top two men’s players are set to clash in Doha this week as the Qatar ExxonMobil Open gets underway.
One of just two ATP Tour events in the Middle East, the competition was voted the 2025 ATP 500 Tournament of the Year by the players themselves, a reflection of how highly it is regarded on the circuit.
With more than 2.3 million euros in prize money at stake, World No. 1 Carlos Alcaraz leads a field packed with elite talent. The 22-year-old Spaniard arrives full of confidence and says he has a clear plan for the week ahead as he looks to build momentum early in the season.
“A lot of players i know are trying to catch me up, in terms of they study my game, they study how I play, trying to beat me. Trying to challenge me and i have to be ready for them to see where my level is, where my tennis is. And try to put myself in their minds and think what they could do playing against me.”
For Alcaraz, being the top-ranked player is not just about lifting trophies, it is about staying one step ahead. He is still beaming from his Australian Open title, but knows tennis rarely allows time to linger on achievements.
“Obviously, what I did in Australia was incredible for me and I’m still thinking a little about it. But you know, tennis is just about keep going, tournament after tournament. Every tournament is a good tournament, special. You want to give your 100%. So right now, I’m focused on trying to play my best, trying to improve, doing good things on the court.”
But World No. 2 Jannik Sinner is also chasing the trophy, and for him, this tournament carries a personal touch.
Speaking to Euronews, the 24-year-old reflected on returning to a city he first visited as a junior. “First of all great to play here, you know, for the first time I do remember I was here some years ago because of a junior tournament, so I have great memories in a way and I'm looking forward to it,” he said.
“We try to get the rhythm back from Australia, heading also into the Sunshine Double after in the US, and then we'll see. Of course, we are here trying to perform in the best possible way, and we'll then see how it goes.”
“You know, you have small feedback from training sessions of course you need to play matches trying to understand what works best so let's see what's coming.”
Defending champion Andrey Rublev returns hoping to make it back-to-back titles in Doha.
However, there will be one notable absentee. World No. 3 Novak Djokovic, a two-time champion in Doha, has withdrawn from the tournament citing fatigue.
But with Alcaraz and Sinner leading the charge, Doha feels like a glimpse into the sport's present and future.

Türkiye slams Israeli plan for land registration in occupied West Bank

Türkiye on Sunday strongly condemned Israel's new decision on land registration in the occupied West Bank, calling it a violation of international law.
Earlier Sunday, the Israeli government approved a proposal to register vast areas of the occupied West Bank as “state property,” the first such measure since Israel occupied the territory in 1967.
Türkiye’s Foreign Ministry said in a statement that the move aims to impose Israel’s “authority over the occupied West Bank and expand settlement activities."
"This step, which seeks to forcibly displace the Palestinian people from their land and accelerate Israel's unlawful annexation efforts, constitutes a clear violation of international law and is null and void," the ministry said.
"Israel has no sovereignty over the occupied Palestinian territories," the ministry added, saying that the expansionist policies pursued by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government undermine peace efforts and damage prospects for a two-state solution.
Backing two-state solution
Türkiye called on the international community to take a firm stance against Israeli attempts to create facts on the ground.
The ministry said Türkiye will continue to support efforts to "establish an independent, sovereign and contiguous" Palestinian state based on the 1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as its capital.
Israeli public broadcaster KAN reported that the proposal was submitted by far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, Justice Minister Yariv Levin, and Defense Minister Israel Katz.
“The initial goal is the gradual settlement of 15% of Area C by 2030,” daily Israel Hayom said ahead of the government decision.
Under the Oslo II Accord signed in 1995, Area A is under full Palestinian control, Area B is under Palestinian civil control and Israeli security control, while Area C, accounting for about 61% of the West Bank, remains under full Israeli control.
The Oslo II Accord limits land registration by the Palestinian Authority to Areas A and B, while prohibiting it in Area C.
The move was part of a series of measures approved by Israel’s Security Cabinet last week aimed at expanding illegal settlement building and increasing Tel Aviv’s control of the occupied West Bank.

There’s no end in sight to Starmer’s struggles | Letters

What a great editorial (The Guardian view on Starmer’s trust crisis: it is unlikely to be managed away, 13 February). Your statement that the prime minister has “learned nothing and forgotten nothing” sums up much of his and our present situation. He was put where he is now by apparatchiks who failed to suggest that without any vision he would be at the mercy of people who would tug him to and fro – which they have. This weakness – which was shared by Boris Johnson, and why Dominic Cummings called Johnson “the Trolley” – means few people have any reason to trust him.
That Starmer’s judgment is flawed is demonstrated by the number of U-turns that he has been forced to make. I heard somebody on Radio 4 saying that Starmer “emanates blandness”. On the benches behind him are many stronger people. He needs to be ditched before the country is totally shrouded in gloom.

Your analysis of Keir Starmer’s probable slide out of power quotes his use of the word “fight”. He was well trained by Morgan McSweeney to appear aggressive. But aggression is for opposition. A prime minister should look to govern, aiming for communal unity. As you say, Starmer has learned nothing, instead bigging up the opposition. He has chosen a foolhardy path that will lead him, and perhaps his party, to oblivion.
Andy Jordan
Wirksworth, Derbyshire
As so often, John Harris illuminates the thoughts and feelings of disappointed and sceptical voters, and the political and ethical vacuum at the heart of the McSweeney-Starmer project (Politicians ‘don’t live how we live’, voters tell me, 8 February).
The Starmer government’s disdain not just for critics of Peter Mandelson’s privileged lifestyle and friendships, but for advocates of anything resembling principled leftwing policies, has been responsible for numerous missteps that seem to confirm the “Politicians are all the same” narrative. This applies as much to the international as the domestic sphere.
We should not forget that the main argument (accepted by both Labour and the Tories) for appointing Mandelson as ambassador to Washington was the perceived need to appease Donald Trump. Let’s hope that the Mandelson-Epstein scandal will prompt not just a procedural inquiry into who knew what and when, but also a reckoning with Labour’s overriding obeisance to Trump and his foreign policy.
Dr Chris Sinha

A few of us predicted Starmerism would end, but not in the way that Owen Jones thinks (The left warned that Starmerism would end like this. Now all of Britain faces the fallout, 9 February). Labour’s left wing, the biggest election-losing machine in the party’s history, has lost no time in getting its knives deployed into Keir Starmer’s back.
One expects confected outrage from the opposition to, well, anything, but it is particularly damaging when the party itself is publicly intent on destroying its leader – particularly one who is barely a year into delivering a huge programme of national renewal. If there was ever a time for the left and its supporters to keep their own counsel, this is it, because the only winners out of the current furore will be Reform UK.

Europe aims to rely less on US defence after Trump's Greenland push

Europe aims to rely less on US defence after Trump's Greenland push
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
MUNICH, Feb 15 - European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen reflected a feeling of profound change among European leaders at this weekend's Munich Security Conference when she said: "Some lines have been crossed that cannot be uncrossed anymore".
Transatlantic ties have already been strained over the past year by Donald Trump’s return to the White House. But the U.S. president’s push to annex Greenland dramatically increased European doubts about Washington’s commitment to protect the continent through the NATO alliance.
U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio offered limited reassurance to Europeans in his conference speech. Rubio said the U.S. wanted to work with Europe and used a warmer tone than Vice President JD Vance last year. But he was critical of Europe's recent political course and did not mention NATO, Russia or Moscow’s war in Ukraine - issues on which a gulf has emerged between the U.S. and its partners in the alliance.
With the war about to enter its fifth year and Moscow viewed as an increasing threat by its European neighbours, leaders from the continent declared they would accelerate efforts to boost their own defences and rely less on the U.S.
That, in theory, puts them on the same page as Trump. His administration says it expects Europe to take primary responsibility for the conventional defence of the continent in the coming years. In return, Washington will keep its nuclear umbrella over Europe and uphold NATO’s mutual defence pact.
A 'EUROPEAN PILLAR' OF NATO
German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer pledged their commitment in Munich to a stronger “European pillar” within NATO. But a stronger home-grown defence is also a hedge against Trump or a future U.S. leader deciding not to defend Europe.
“This new beginning is right under all circumstances. It is right if the United States continues to distance itself. It is right as long as we cannot guarantee our own security on our own,” Merz told the conference on Friday.
In another sign of the nervousness surrounding U.S. security commitments, Merz said he had begun talks with Macron about a European nuclear deterrence.
France holds the only truly independent nuclear deterrent in Europe since Britain's Trident nuclear missiles are made and maintained by the United States.
WILL DEEDS MATCH WORDS?
The big question for Europe and its leaders is whether they can match their words with deeds – to buy and develop new weapons systems, to fill gaps in their arsenals in areas such as long-range missiles and to coordinate their work.
The signs so far are mixed.
Driven by fears of Russia and exhortations from Trump, European countries have boosted defence spending. NATO members agreed last year to raise spending on core defence from 2% of GDP to 3.5% of GDP, with a further 1.5% to be spent on other security-related investments.
European defence spending has risen nearly 80% since before the war in Ukraine began, von der Leyen told the Munich conference.
European countries are forming consortia to build complex weapons systems. Defence ministers from France, Germany, Italy, Poland and Sweden signed a letter of intent on Thursday to advance work on European Long-range Strike Approach (ELSA), a project to develop “deep strike” missiles.
On the sidelines of a NATO defence ministers’ meeting on Thursday, coalitions of European countries agreed to work together on four projects, including ballistic missile defence and air-launched munitions.
PROJECTS STRUGGLE DUE TO SQUABBLES
But some high-profile pan-European projects have struggled to get off the ground. The future of the FCAS French-German-Spanish fighter jet project has been in the balance for months, with the partners unable to agree on the share of work for the companies involved.
Debates on European Union defence projects have been accompanied by wrangling over whether they should be limited to EU companies or open to others.
France has been the strongest advocate to “buy European” provisions while the likes of Germany and The Netherlands argue for a more open approach.
Amid the debates in the swanky Bayerischer Hof hotel, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy brought home the reality of modern war, surrounded by giant screens showing images and statistics of Russian attacks. Last month alone, Ukraine was attacked by more than 6,000 drones and 150 missiles.
“During this war, weapons evolve faster than political decisions meant to stop them,” he told the delegates. REUTERS

Regarding your report (Lake District village struggles to find GP – despite ad pledging ‘we’ll never run out of beer’, 11 February), Coniston’s situation is not a question of marketing flair but of structural pressure in rural general practice.
Findings from a recent survey of our member doctors working in rural and remote areas underline the scale of the challenge. One in four doctors told us that working in a single-handed practice has negatively affected their wellbeing or contributed to burnout.
A striking 71% believe rural and remote healthcare is not properly understood by government and policymakers. Doctors have told us that there is a “lack of rural-proofing policy”, with services increasingly centralised and general practice described as “defunded and salami-sliced”. Others describe the pressure of covering wide areas with limited staff and patients who face long journeys to access secondary care.
Rural general practice remains professionally rewarding. But unless policy reflects the realities of isolation, workload and access, recruitment campaigns alone will not secure its future.

Community energy’s success depends on more than money | Letter

Ed Miliband’s £1bn pledge for community energy is a landmark moment (9 February), but its success depends on more than the size of the cheque.
As our Community Energy Citizen Science project shows, the transition is powered by “quiet labour”. Volunteers do the heavy lifting at kitchen tables, translating complex policy into practical advice and managing the invisible burdens of governance and safeguarding.
There is a disconnect between government rhetoric on “cheap local power” and the regulatory reality. To bridge this gap, we must move beyond short-term grants for physical infrastructure, such as heat pumps or solar panels, and provide long-term funding for the people behind it. Without stable support, vital local knowledge is lost each time a contract ends.
Ultimately, this is a social project. One resident who was able to secure insulation and heating said that she was simply glad to be able to sit and sew in a warm room. If this funding is to be transformative, it must value the persistence and care required to ensure the transition is locally rooted and leaves no one behind.

Abuse survivor Pelicot says mindsets need to change in fight against sexual violence
Gisele Pelicot, who was repeatedly drugged by her then husband and offered to strangers for rape, is releasing a book about her experiences
Mindsets need to change in the fight against sexual violence, according to Gisele Pelicot, who was repeatedly drugged, abused and offered to strangers for rape by her then husband over nearly 10 years.
“I believe this can only be achieved through education and through respect and empathy for one another,” the 73-year-old French woman told the news portal of German public broadcaster ZDF in an interview published on Sunday. “We must continue this fight. We must not relent.”
Pelicot became a feminist icon in France due to her resolute stance and her decision not to conduct the trial behind closed doors.
“I believe that this trial has heightened society’s awareness of how men treat women,” Pelicot told ZDF. She said it brought many things to light.
“This continues to this day, as every day we see the tragedies associated with chemical submission.”
The term “chemical submission” in French refers to the malicious drugging with medication or drugs.

Two skiers killed in avalanche in northern Italy
The search and recovery operation involved 15 rescuers, three canine units and two helicopters
- Bookmark
Two skiers have died and another was injured after an off-trail avalanche struck the Italian side of the Mont Blanc massif on Sunday. Their identities have not been released.
The incident occurred around 11:00 a.m. in the Couloir Vesses, a popular freeride route in Courmayeur, located in the upper Val Veny, near the border with France and Switzerland. At least three skiers were caught in the Sunday morning avalanche. One of the victims was initially transported to the hospital in a serious condition but later succumbed to their injuries.
Italy's Alpine Rescue coordinated the search and recovery operation, deploying 15 rescuers, three canine units and two helicopters to the scene.
Courmayeur, a town with about 2,900 inhabitants, is some 200 kilometers (124 miles) northwest of Milan, one of the venues hosting the Milan-Cortina Winter Olympics.
Another person was partially buried by an avalanche in Trentino, but was rescued by his companions, authorities reported Sunday.
A record 13 backcountry skiers, climbers and hikers died in the Italian mountains over a week ending February 8, Alpine Rescue said last Monday, including 10 in avalanches triggered by an exceptionally unstable snowpack.
Fresh snowfall during recent storms and wind-swept snowcaps on weak internal layers have created especially risky conditions along the entire Alpine crescent bordering France, Switzerland and Austria, Alpine Rescue said.
‘’Under such conditions, the passage of a single skier, or natural overloading from the weight of snow, can be sufficient to trigger an avalanche,’’ said Federico Catania, Italy’s Alpine Rescue Corps spokesman.
The avalanche deaths occurred on ungroomed slopes, away from well-maintained and monitored Olympic sites in Lombardy on the Swiss border and Cortina d’Ampezzo in Veneto, as well as cross-country skiing in Val di Fiemme in the autonomous province of Trentino.
“There is no danger for people skiing within managed ski resorts, and in particular no risks to the Olympic sites,’’ Catania said. “All of these areas are constantly monitored and are generally safe regardless of Olympic events.’’

Powered by women, ‘Wuthering Heights’ digs up $34.8 million at the box office for a No. 1 debut
Emerald Fennell’s new “Wuthering Heights” has opened in first place at the North American box office
- Bookmark
Emerald Fennell’s bold reimagining of “Wuthering Heights” brought crowds of women to movie theaters this weekend. The Warner Bros. release topped the box office charts and nabbed the title for the year’s biggest opening with $34.8 million in ticket sales in its first three days in North American theaters, according to studio estimates Sunday. According to PostTrak polling, an estimated 76% of those ticket buyers were women. By the end of Monday's Presidents Day holiday, the total could rise to $40 million from its 3,682 locations.
The romantic drama starring Margot Robbie and Jacob Elordi as the star-crossed Catherine and Heathcliff, won out over the weekend’s other newcomers, including the animated “GOAT” and the heist thriller “Crime 101.” “Wuthering Heights” is also performing even better internationally, where it’s expecting to rake in an additional $42 million from 76 territories.
The Warner Bros./MRC production cost a reported $80 million to produce, not accounting for the millions spent on marketing and promotion. If the four-day totals match the estimates, that makes for a strong $82 million global debut. And the film still has several big openings on the horizon, in Japan and Vietnam on Feb. 27, and in China on March 13.
Fennell’s version of “Wuthering Heights,” which takes many liberties with Emily Brontë’s novel, largely divided critics. It’s currently sitting at a mixed 63% on Rotten Tomatoes. While that didn’t dissuade audiences from buying tickets, only 51% of the opening weekend audience said that they would “definitely recommend” the film to friends. Moviegoers also gave it a less-than-stellar B CinemaScore.
The mid-February weekend has hosted big superhero movies on occasion, including “Black Panther” and “Deadpool,” but a more relevant comparison is “Fifty Shades of Grey” and its two sequels. The first movie opened to over $85 million, the third to $38.6 million.
“GOAT,” an animated Sony release produced by basketball star Stephen Curry, landed in second place with an estimated $26 million from 3,863 locations. It's projected to bring in another $6 million on Monday, which would bring its four day total to $32 million — the biggest animated debut since “Elemental” in 2023. It also pulled in $15.6 million internationally, bringing its global total to $47.6 million.
The family-friendly film was the only new opener of the weekend to get an A CinemaScore. Sony Pictures Animation was also behind “KPop Demon Hunters.”
“Crime 101” made an estimated $15.1 million in its first three days. Amazon MGM Studios opened the Chris Hemsworth and Mark Ruffalo led Los Angeles-set thriller in 3,161 theaters. It’s expected to pull in about $17.8 million by the end of Monday, but the movie has a long way to go to even hit its production budget, which reportedly exceeded $90 million. Audiences, who were 56% men, also gave “Crime 101” a B CinemaScore.
Further down the charts was Briarcliff Entertainment’s sci-fi comedy “Good Luck, Have Fun, Don’t Die,” starring Sam Rockwell and Haley Lu Richardson. It made an estimated $3.6 million from 1,610 locations.
The Walt Disney Studios also celebrated a milestone this weekend, becoming the first studio to cross $1 billion at the global box office in 2026, driven almost entirely by “Avatar: Fire and Ash,” but also helped by the continued success of “Zootopia 2,” which remains in the top 10 after twelve weekends in theaters.

The UN says al-Hol camp population has dropped sharply as Syria moves to relocate remaining families
The U.N. refugee agency says residents are leaving Syria’s al-Hol camp in large numbers, and Syrian authorities plan to relocate those who remain

The U.N. refugee agency said Sunday that a large number of residents of a camp housing family members of suspected Islamic State group militants have left and the Syrian government plans to relocate those who remain.
Gonzalo Vargas Llosa, UNHCR's representative in Syria, said in a statement that the agency “has observed a significant decrease in the number of residents in Al-Hol camp in recent weeks."
“Syrian authorities have informed UNHCR of their plan to relocate the remaining families to Akhtarin camp in Aleppo Governorate (province) and have requested UNHCR’s support to assist the population in the new camp, which we stand ready to provide,” he said.
He added that UNHCR “will continue to support the return and reintegration of Syrians who have departed Al-Hol, as well as those who remain.”
The statement did not say how residents had left the camp or how many remain. Many families are believed to have escaped either during the chaos when government forces captured the camp from the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces last month or afterward.
There was no immediate statement from the Syrian government and a government spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.
At its peak after the defeat of IS in Syria in 2019, around 73,000 people were living at al-Hol. Since then, the number has declined with some countries repatriating their citizens. The camp’s residents are mostly children and women, including many wives or widows of IS members.
The camp’s residents are not technically prisoners and most have not been accused of crimes, but they have been held in de facto detention at the heavily guarded facility.
Forces of Syria’s central government captured the al-Hol camp on Jan. 21 during a weekslong offensive against the SDF, which had been running the camp near the border with Iraq for a decade. A ceasefire deal has since ended the fighting.
Separately, thousands of accused IS militants who were held in detention centers in northeastern Syria have been transferred to Iraq to stand trial under an agreement with the U.S.
The U.S. military said Friday that it had completed the transfer of more than 5,700 adult male IS suspects from detention facilities in Syria to Iraqi custody.
Iraq’s National Center for International Judicial Cooperation said a total of 5,704 suspects from 61 countries who were affiliated with IS — most of them Syrian and Iraqi — were transferred from prisons in Syria. They are now being interrogated in Iraq.

Mikaela Shiffrin's giant slalom at Milan Cortina ended without a medal but plenty of optimism
Mikaela Shiffrin sees her 11th-place giant slalom at the Milan Cortina Olympics as proof she is back in the fight
- Bookmark
Mikaela Shiffrin stood at the start gate atop the giant slalom course at sun-splashed Tofane and made a promise to herself.
“I’m going to do this whole thing here,” she said.
Considering the path the American star has taken to reach the Milan Cortina Olympics, and to this event in particular, that was enough.
So while the leaderboard near the finish line during Sunday's GS needed to flip to the second page before Shiffrin's name appeared in 11th, the most decorated skier in the history of the sport didn't view her finish as a disappointment.
Disappointment is washing out, which she did four years ago in Beijing. Disappointment is wondering if the speed that once came so easily would ever return while recovering from a harrowing crash during a World Cup start in Killington, Vermont, in late 2024 that left her abdomen punctured and her confidence shaken.
What happened during what Shiffrin called “the greatest show of GS skiing we've had in a really long time” was not disappointment. If anything, it was the opposite.
Yes, Shiffrin finished outside the top 10. The way the snow felt underneath her skis and the razor-thin margin that separated the silver medalists from the chasing pack — there was no catching Italy's Federica Brignone on this day — offered evidence she's trending in the right direction heading into slalom, her best event, on Wednesday.
“To be here now like within touch of the fastest women, that’s huge for me,” Shiffrin said. “So I’m proud of that.”
The gap between Shiffrin and co-runners-up Sara Hector of Sweden and Thea Louise Stjernesund was an impossibly tight 0.3 seconds in a discipline that requires skiers to make two runs.
When Shiffrin won gold in the GS in Pyeongchang eight years ago, the gap between silver and 11th was around 1.4 seconds. Four years ago in Beijing, it was nearly 2 seconds. Three weeks ago at a World Cup event in Czechia, where Shiffrin earned her first podium in the GS in two years, it was over 3 1/2 seconds.
On Sunday, Shiffrin was right there. A turn here. A turn there. On a course that was a little flatter and a little less technically demanding that what Shiffrin and the rest of the best skiers in the world usually see — one almost explicitly designed to create a safe and ultracompetitive race — the difference between a medal and the middle was nearly imperceptible.
Shiffrin promised to “learn” after slogging down through the slalom in the women's combined last week, when her skis couldn't seem to “go.” Perhaps too aware of the perception of an Olympic slump — the Games are the only place she hasn't won in the last eight years — she did her best to refocus and block out the noise.
In her mind, she did just that. She could feel herself taking power from the course. As “Killing In The Name Of” by Rage Against the Machine blasted over the speakers during her second run, Shiffrin felt like she was in the moment and not in her head.
“It felt good to push, which was amazing,” she said, later adding: “It felt really good to ski high intensity.”
Shiffrin's intensity feels as if it is slowly but steadily ramping up. She wore bib No. 3, a nod to the fact she's back in the top 7 in the world in the GS, something she considered a “challenging task” when the season began. It's become doable, but Shiffrin has learned progress isn't linear.
While she continues to dominate slalom — in which she's already clinched her ninth World Cup series title with two races to go — GS is another matter. Sure, Shiffrin's 22 career GS victories are a record. But she hasn't won a GS race since late 2023.
Her climb back up the GS rankings has been fueled by consistency. The “lights-out speed” she knows is required to finish atop the podium doesn't come quite as easily as it did when she was at the peak of her powers. That's fine.
“The task ahead of me for the coming months (and) in the coming years is to try to bring that kind of intensity and fire and to continue to work with the team to find those hundredths (of a second) that it takes to actually win races,” she said.
That didn't happen under the snowcapped peaks of the Dolomites on Sunday. Maybe on another course, one with a more difficult setup that would allow her to lean in to her experience, things may have played out differently.
It's not a conversation Shiffrin seems particularly interested in having. The layout allowed for competitive racing. And she pointed to the medal stand — where the 35-year-old Brignone won her second gold in four days and Hector added silver to go with the gold she captured in Beijing in 2022 — as proof the results were not fluky.
“It wasn’t like somebody won who wasn’t supposed to win,” Shiffrin said.
Brignone emerged as a deserving champion. Behind her, however, was chaos. Shiffrin doesn't think that's a bad thing.
“(We were all) close and that’s how that’s how high the competition level, is I think,” she said. “That’s a beautiful show of our sport on an Olympic stage.”

US forces board second Venezuela‑linked oil tanker in Indian Ocean

US military forces boarded another sanctioned tanker in the Indian Ocean after tracking the vessel from the Caribbean Sea in an effort to target illicit oil connected to Venezuela, the Pentagon said on Sunday.
Venezuela had faced US sanctions on its oil for several years, relying on a shadow fleet of falsely flagged tankers to smuggle crude into global supply chains. Donald Trump ordered a quarantine of sanctioned tankers in December to pressure the president, Nicolás Maduro, before Maduro was apprehended in January during a US military operation.
Several tankers fled the Venezuelan coast after the raid, including the ship that was boarded in the Indian Ocean overnight. The defense department said in a post on X that US forces boarded the Veronica III, conducting “a right-of-visit, maritime interdiction and boarding”.
The Pentagon said: “The vessel tried to defy President Trump’s quarantine – hoping to slip away,. We tracked it from the Caribbean to the Indian Ocean, closed the distance, and shut it down.”
Video posted by the Pentagon showed US troops boarding the tanker.
The Veronica III is a Panamanian-flagged vessel under US sanctions related to Iran, according to the website of the Treasury department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control.
The Veronica III left Venezuela on 3 January, the same day as Maduro’s capture, with nearly 2m barrels of crude and fuel oil, TankerTrackers.com posted on Sunday on X.
“Since 2023, she’s been involved with Russian, Iranian and Venezuelan oil,” the organisation said.
Samir Madani, the co-founder of TankerTrackers.com, told the Associated Press in January that his organisation used satellite imagery and surface-level photos to document that at least 16 tankers left the Venezuelan coast in contravention of the quarantine.
The Trump administration has been seizing tankers as part of its efforts to take control of Venezuela’s oil. The Pentagon did not say whether the Veronica III was formally seized and placed under US control. It told the AP in an email that it had no additional information to provide beyond its post.
Last week, the US military boarded a different tanker in the Indian Ocean, the Aquila II. The ship was being held while its fate was decided by the US, according to a defence official who spoke last week.

UK considers new Russia sanctions after Navalny frog toxin finding

01:29:34 KST

The UK is mulling fresh sanctions against Moscow after pinning blame on the Kremlin for the poisoning of the Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, Yvette Cooper has suggested.
The Foreign Office and four of the UK’s allies – Sweden, France, Germany and the Netherlands – announced on Saturday they had determined that Navalny’s death was most likely the result of poisoning using dart frog toxin arranged by the Russian state.
The Russian embassy in London has denied Moscow was involved in Navalny’s death two years ago in a Siberian penal colony and described the announcement as illustrating the “feeblemindedness of western fabulists”.
In a rebuke on the BBC’s Sunday With Laura Kuenssberg programme, Cooper, the foreign secretary, said the accusation against Russia was “deeply serious” and a product of two years of evidence gathering.
She said: “Only the Russian regime had the means, the motive and the opportunity to administer this poison while he was in a Russian prison.”
Analysis of samples from Navalny’s body revealed the presence of a toxin called epibatidine, which is produced by dart frogs in South America. The UK and its allies said Navalny could not have ingested the poison accidentally as it is not found in Russia and is generally produced only by the frogs in the wild.
The five European countries have reported the Kremlin to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons after accusing Moscow of breaching its conventions.
Cooper said the incident showed that “the cold war peace dividend we all believed in and hoped for has gone, and we need to be ready for Russian aggression continuing towards Europe”.
She suggested further sanctions could follow. “We continue to look at coordinated action, including increasing sanctions on the Russian regime. As you know, we have been pursuing this as part of our response to the brutal invasion of Ukraine, where we are also coming up to the fourth anniversary of that invasion as well.
“We believe that it is the partnerships that we build abroad that make us stronger at home. It is by acting alongside our European allies, alongside allies across the world, that we do maintain that pressure on the Russian regime.”
Noting that the government would continue to provide military support to Ukraine and remain vigilant towards other different, hybrid threats, Cooper added: “The other thing that I would say, specifically about Alexei Navalny, is one of the things he said was ‘tell the truth, spread the truth’, because that is the most dangerous weapon of all.”
The US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, said on Sunday that Washington had no reason to question the “troubling” conclusions of the five European allies.
“We obviously are aware of the report. It’s a troubling report. We’re aware of that case of Mr Navalny and certainly … we don’t have any reason to question it,” Rubio told reporters at a news conference in Bratislava during a visit to Slovakia.
When asked why the US had not joined the five countries in making a statement on their findings, Rubio said this was an endeavour by them. “Those countries came to that conclusion. They coordinated that. [It] doesn’t mean we disagree with the outcome. We just, it wasn’t our endeavour. Sometimes countries go out and do their thing based on the intelligence they’ve gathered.”
He added: “We’re not disputing or getting into a fight with these countries over it. But it was their report, and they put that out there.”
The UK’s shadow foreign secretary, Priti Patel, warned of an “axis of authoritarianism” comprising Russia, China, North Korea and Iran faced by the UK and other western nations.
Speaking on Sky News’s Sunday Morning With Trevor Phillips programme in advance of making a speech at the Munich Security Conference, the senior Conservative said the US remained a “natural ally” and partner for European powers.
A statement from the Russian embassy in London denied any involvement in Navalny’s death. It said: “There is no reason whatsoever to credit such ‘findings’ by western ‘experts’. As with the Skripal case, there are strident accusations, media hysteria, zero evidence, and a host of questions the accusers would rather ignore. So what was it in the end – poison derived from the skin of a South American frog or novichok?
“We have become accustomed to the feeblemindedness of western fabulists. One must ask what kind of person would believe this nonsense about a frog. Yet what truly shocks is the method now favoured by western politicians – necro-propaganda. This is not a quest for justice but a mockery of the dead. Even after the death of the Russian citizen, London and the European capitals cannot allow him to rest in peace – a fact that speaks volumes about those who instigated this campaign.”

Palestine: Israeli plan to register West Bank lands as 'state property' is 'de facto annexation'

The Palestinian Authority on Sunday warned that an Israeli government decision to register large areas of the West Bank as “state property” amounts to a “de facto annexation” of the occupied territory and a violation of international law.
In a statement carried by the official news agency Wafa, the Authority said the Israeli move constitutes “a blatant violation of international law and international legitimacy resolutions” and poses a threat to security and stability.
It described the measure as a “de facto annexation of occupied Palestinian land” and an official launch of annexation plans aimed at consolidating the occupation through illegal settlement expansion.
It also constitutes “a termination of the signed agreements and clearly contradicts the resolutions of the UN Security Council, especially Resolution 2334, which considers all settlement activity in the entire occupied Palestinian territory, including East Jerusalem, to be illegal.”
The Authority stressed that unilateral Israeli actions “would not confer legitimacy over Palestinian land and would not change the legal and historical status of the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and Gaza as occupied territory under international law.”
It called on the international community, particularly the UN Security Council and the US administration, to intervene immediately to halt the Israeli measures and compel Tel Aviv to comply with international law to prevent further escalation.
Under the Oslo II Accord signed in 1995, Area A is under full Palestinian control, Area B is under Palestinian civil control and Israeli security control, while Area C, accounting for about 61 percent of the West Bank, remains under full Israeli control.
The Oslo II Accord limits land registration by the Palestinian Authority to Areas A and B, while prohibiting it in Area C.
The move was part of a series of measures approved by Israel’s Security Cabinet last week aimed at expanding illegal settlement building and increasing Tel Aviv’s control of the occupied West Bank.
According to Israeli media, the measures include repealing a law that barred the sale of land in the West Bank to illegal Israeli settlers, unsealing land ownership records, and shifting authority for building permits in a settlement bloc near Hebron from a Palestinian municipality to Israel’s civil administration.
Israel has intensified operations in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, since launching its genocidal war in Gaza on October 8, 2023. Palestinians view the escalation -- including killings, arrests, displacement and settlement expansion -- as a step toward formal annexation of the territory.
In a landmark opinion in July 2024, the International Court of Justice declared Israel’s occupation of Palestinian territory illegal and called for the evacuation of all settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem.

A relationship on the rocks: Europe and America need each other but trust is gone

MUNICH — European and American leaders spent three days pledging cooperation and offering to slap a new coat of paint on the façade of the transatlantic relationship. But the cracks are still showing.
The United States was less combative than a year ago in its showing at the Munich Security Conference, when Vice President JD Vance launched a scorching attack on Europe.
But the gathering showed that while the alliance continues to function, the old order that bound the two sides of the Atlantic for decades has broken down. There is no consensus on how the relationship can move forward given the regular seismic shocks the Trump administration revels in delivering to the system.

Production of FA-50PL Light Fighters for Poland Delayed by at Least Two Years

Poland’s Armaments Agency and Korea Aerospace Industries have officially revised the FA-50PL delivery schedule, postponing the start of deliveries until mid-2027.
The Aviationist reported the delay.
On January 9, 2026, the Polish Armaments Agency and Korea Aerospace Industries signed an addendum to the original September 2022 contract, formally shifting the delivery timeline for the FA-50PL.
Under the initial schedule, the aircraft were to be delivered between 2025 and 2028. According to the updated plan, the first FA-50PL is now expected in mid-2027, with all 36 aircraft due to be delivered by early 2029.
The delay is attributed to a combination of factors, including supply chain constraints, integration of advanced avionics and U.S.-made weapons, notably the AIM-9X Sidewinder and AIM-120C AMRAAM missiles, as well as broader geopolitical considerations.
The FA-50PL is being developed as a significantly more capable platform than the existing FA-50GF, tailored to Poland’s operational requirements. Key upgrades include Raytheon’s PhantomStrike active electronically scanned array radar, an aerial refueling capability, the AN/AAQ-33 Sniper Advanced Targeting Pod, a helmet-mounted display, increased external fuel capacity, and compatibility with AIM-9X Sidewinder and AIM-120C AMRAAM air-to-air missiles.
While Poland has already signed an agreement with the United States to support integration of the AIM-9X short-range missile on future FA-50PL aircraft, integration of the AIM-120 AMRAAM remains planned for a later stage.
In addition to the FA-50PL delay, initial plans had called for upgrading 12 FA-50GF aircraft to the FA-50GL configuration. However, in late 2025, it was reported that the upgrade was deemed “economically unjustified,” and the aircraft would instead be used primarily for pilot training.

Israel approves new West Bank land policy, Palestinians decry ‘de-facto annexation’

01:21:00 KST

The Israeli government on Sunday approved a new proposal to tighten Israeli control over the occupied West Bank and register large areas there as "state property," for the first time since the Israeli occupation of the territory in 1967, in a move Palestinians called "a de-facto annexation".
The public broadcaster KAN said the proposal was submitted by far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, Justice Minister Yariv Levin, and Defense Minister Israel Katz.
"The initial goal is the gradual settlement of 15% of Area C by 2030," Israel Hayom newspaper commented ahead of the government decision.
Palestinian Authority (PA) presidency rejected the cabinet's decision, saying it constitutes "a de-facto annexation of occupied Palestinian territory and a declaration of the commencement of annexation plans aimed at entrenching the occupation through illegal settlement activity."
Under the Oslo II Accord signed in 1995, Area A is under full Palestinian control, Area B is under Palestinian civil control and Israeli security control, while Area C, accounting for about 61% of the West Bank, remains under full Israeli control.
According to the paper, the main implication of the government decision is "the conversion of very large areas into state land, provided that no other ownership is proven."
"In this sense, even in the absence of a political decision to apply the law, Israel significantly strengthens its hold on the land by registering plots that are not owned by other parties in the land registry," it added.
The Oslo II Accord limits land registration by the Palestinian Authority to Areas A and B, while prohibiting it in Area C.
If approved, the Israeli government's Coordination of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT) will be responsible for organizing and registering land ownership in Area C.
The process includes issuing sale permits, collecting fees, and overseeing registration procedures, while preventing the Palestinian Authority from carrying out such tasks in those areas.
The move is part of a series of measures approved by Israel's Security Cabinet last week aimed at expanding illegal settlement building and increasing Tel Aviv's control of the occupied West Bank.
According to Israeli media, the measures include repealing a law that barred the sale of land in the West Bank to illegal Israeli settlers, unsealing land ownership records, and shifting authority for building permits in a settlement bloc near Hebron from a Palestinian municipality to Israel's civil administration.

Lindsey Vonn preparing to leave Italy after Olympics crash, says ski team chief

Lindsey Vonn is preparing to leave Italy one week after Winter Olympics crash, says U.S. Ski Team chief
Lindsey Vonn is preparing to return to the United States, the U.S. Ski Team's chief told The Associated Press on Sunday, saying the champion skier was getting ready to fly back home for further treatment after wiping out in the women's Olympic downhill competition last weekend.
Sophie Goldschmidt, president and CEO of the U.S. Ski and Snowboard Association, told the AP the team's medical staff has been coordinating Vonn's recovery since the crash and subsequent helicopter evacuation at the Milan Cortina Games and would try to accompany her home. Vonn has had multiple surgeries in Italy to repair a complex tibia fracture in her left leg.
"We're working through all of that at the moment," Goldschmidt said. "We've got a great team around helping her and she'll go back to the U.S. for further surgeries."
Spectators tuning in to see Vonn attempt to win a medal at age 41 with a torn ACL in her left knee and a partial titanium replacement in her right knee were thrown into shock when the American standout got hooked on a gate 13 seconds into her run — resulting in a spinning, air-born crash that sent her careening down the Dolomite mountain.
"The impact, the silence, everyone was just in shock. And you could tell it was a really nasty injury," said Goldschmidt, who was in attendance for the fall. "There's a lot of danger in doing all sorts of Alpine sports but it gives more of an appreciation for how superhuman these athletes are.
"I mean, putting your body on the line, going at those speeds, the physicality. Sometimes, actually on the broadcast, it's really hard to get that across," Goldschmidt added. "Danger sometimes brings fans in and is pretty captivating. We obviously hope we won't have injuries like that but it is unfortunately part and parcel of our sports."
Vonn said on Friday that she was expecting to have another surgery for the leg injury, which was slated to happen on Saturday. In a video shared to social media, Vonn told her followers that she could potentially return to the U.S. after that surgery if it went well. At that point, she had already undergone three surgeries since her crash.
But Vonn has no regrets about skiing in the 2026 Olympics.
"When I think back on my crash, I didn't stand in the starting gate unaware of the potential consequences," Vonn said in an Instagram post late Saturday. "I knew what I was doing. I chose to take a risk. Every skier in that starting gate took the same risk. Because even if you are the strongest person in the world, the mountain always holds the cards.
"But just because I was ready, that didn't guarantee me anything. Nothing in life is guaranteed. That's the gamble of chasing your dreams, you might fall but if you don't try you'll never know," Vonn added.
Goldschmidt visited Vonn at the hospital twice and said, "She's not in pain. She's in a stable condition."
"She took an aggressive line and was all in and it was inches off what could have ended up a very different way," Goldschmidt said. "But what she's done for our sports and the sport in general, her being a role model, has gone to a whole new level. You learn often more about people during these tough moments than when they're winning."

Trump says Board of Peace members pledge $6b for Gaza, calls for ‘full and immediate’ disarmament of Hamas
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
WEST PALM BEACH, Florida - US President Donald Trump on Feb 15 urged Hamas to move forward with disarmament under his plan for postwar Gaza, and said members of his so-called “Board of Peace”
“Very importantly, Hamas must uphold its commitment to Full and Immediate Demilitarisation,” Mr Trump said in a post on his Truth Social platform, ahead of a Feb 19 meeting of the board in Washington.
Disarmament is a key part in the second phase of the US-brokered ceasefire plan sealed in October between Israel and the Palestinian militant group to end the war triggered by Hamas’s attack on Israel in October 2023.
The United Nations endorsed the plan in November.
The second phase stipulates that Israeli forces gradually withdraw from Gaza and Hamas should disarm, with an international stabilisation force deployed to ensure security.
Hamas has repeatedly said that disarmament is a red line, although it has indicated it could consider handing over its weapons to a future Palestinian governing authority.
Both sides accuse each other daily of ceasefire violations.
Although originally intended to oversee Gaza’s rebuilding, the charter for the “Board of Peace” does not seem to limit its role to the Palestinian territory.
“The Board of Peace has unlimited potential,” Mr Trump said on Feb 15 in his post.
After an initial meeting on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum
Countries have been asked to pay US$1 billion for permanent membership of the board, and the invitation for Russian President Vladimir Putin, whose country invaded Ukraine in 2022, has drawn criticism.
Key US allies including France and Britain have expressed doubts.
Mr Trump said the US$5 billion in pledges by member states would be formally announced then, and that members also “have committed thousands of personnel to the International Stabilization Force and Local Police to maintain Security and Peace for Gazans.”
Mr Trump has said the organisation will work “in conjunction” with the United Nations.
“The Board of Peace will prove to be the most consequential International Body in History,” he said.
Under the ceasefire plan, a Palestinian technocratic committee has also been set up with a goal of taking over governance in the battered Gaza Strip. AFP

Gaza Board of Peace member nations "have committed thousands of personnel to the International Stabilization Force," United States President Donald Trump confirmed in a Truth Social post on Sunday.
The personnel are set to participate in a local police force that will, in collaboration with the International Stabilization Force, maintain security and peace for Gazans, he added.
In addition to personnel, board members have pledged over $5 billion to humanitarian and reconstruction efforts in Gaza, Trump announced.
An official announcement regarding personnel and funding will be made during a board meeting scheduled for Thursday at the Donald J. Trump Institute of Peace in Washington, he said.
The board, which Trump is chairman of, "has unlimited potential" and "will prove to be the most consequential International Body in History," he claimed.
Trump calls for Hamas disarmament
Trump added a call for Hamas to uphold its commitment to full and immediate demilitarization.
Hamas's disarmament and demilitarization may begin as early as March, two sources involved in the board told KAN News on Saturday.
The implementation of the National Committee for the Administration of Gaza, a technocratic body tasked with governing the Gaza Strip, will kick off the disarmament process.

Criticism without a platform, the problem with Bennett’s return - opinion

As Israel moves toward elections that could shape the country’s trajectory for years to come, one striking feature of the political landscape stands out: not the intensity of debate, but the absence of substantive policy discussion at its center. This void is especially evident in the emerging campaign of former prime minister Naftali Bennett.
No one doubts that Bennett is an intelligent and accomplished individual. He has succeeded in business and worked his way, impressively, through the political system. Yet his political re-entry has been framed almost entirely around opposition to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu the man, rather than to his policies. While Bennett has criticized the lack of a State Commission of Inquiry and the haredi (ultra-Orthodox) draft issue, substantive policy proposals have largely been absent.
Criticism of a sitting prime minister can be legitimate and even necessary. But criticism alone is not a governing platform. Leadership begins where critique ends and responsibility begins. To date, Bennett has offered little clarity about what he would actually do if entrusted once again with power.
Rather than advancing a coherent agenda on security, the economy, housing, judicial reform, or governance, Bennett’s campaign has leaned heavily on sharp rhetoric and personal attacks. This approach may generate attention, but it does not amount to a serious roadmap for Israel’s future. A public grappling with war, economic pressure, and deep social strain deserves more than slogans and rhetorical flourishes.
That tone was on full display in early February, when Bennett mocked Netanyahu’s response to the state comptroller, likening the prime minister to “Forrest Gump.” However biting such metaphors may be, ridicule is not a substitute for strategy: It offers no answers to the complex challenges Israel faces. For someone who openly broke a major public campaign promise in the past, it is striking that attacks on character and truthfulness would be the strategy he now chooses to pursue.
Bennett’s policy ambiguity, opportunistic alliances
More revealing than the rhetoric is what remains unsaid. Bennett has yet to articulate clear positions on several of the most consequential issues confronting the country. There is no detailed proposal for post-war governance in Gaza, no articulated framework for long-term security control, and no clear vision for rebuilding deterrence while managing international pressure.
On the economic front, he has offered little guidance on tax reform, cost-of-living relief, or how to address the growing burden on Israel’s productive middle class, including the hundreds of thousands of reserve soldiers who dropped everything over the past two years to fight for their country. Similarly absent is a concrete plan for Judea and Samaria, an area that once stood at the core of his political identity.
This lack of policy definition has been accompanied by an increasing willingness to engage in ad hoc political alliances. Once regarded as a consistent figure within the national camp, Bennett now signals openness to partnerships that appear driven more by coalition arithmetic than by shared principles. Tactical pragmatism, untethered from a clearly articulated worldview, risks sliding into opportunism.
His repeated overtures toward figures such as Yair Golan underscore this concern. Golan represents an ideological outlook fundamentally at odds with Bennett’s past positions. He continues to champion a two-state solution rooted in the Oslo framework, has publicly disparaged residents of Judea and Samaria, and has made controversial statements regarding Israel’s soldiers and the role of religion in Israeli society. These views stand in sharp contrast to the values Bennett once championed, yet they no longer appear to pose a barrier to political cooperation.
This approach is not merely theoretical. Bennett has even floated the idea of appointing Golan as energy minister in a future government. The remark, delivered casually, suggested a view of governance in which ministerial portfolios are treated as bargaining chips rather than as serious responsibilities. Israel’s political history offers ample evidence of the costs of appointments driven by coalition convenience rather than merit. The Energy Ministry oversees strategic assets central to Israel’s economic strength and geopolitical standing. It is not a portfolio for improvisation.
The same standard applies across government. Finance, defense, health, and internal security are not ceremonial roles. They demand leadership grounded in knowledge, experience, and judgment. A campaign that treats these responsibilities lightly offers a preview of how its candidate would govern.
At its core, Bennett’s challenge is not stylistic but structural. A campaign defined primarily by negation leaves little room for coherent policy development. In the absence of clear principles, alliances become transactional and governance risks becoming reactive rather than strategic.
Many Israelis recognize that the country must move forward from the current government and its divisive model. They are seeking an alternative that places at its center those who work, serve, pay taxes, and shoulder shared national responsibility.
But Israel deserves better than a campaign built on negation. It deserves a leadership conversation focused on real choices: security doctrine, economic reform, governance, and national resilience. The question voters must ask is not whether Naftali Bennett can criticize Benjamin Netanyahu – we already know he can. The real question is whether he has demonstrated the clarity, competence, and governing vision required to lead a country facing historic challenges.
So far, that answer remains absent.

Religious Zionism is under attack in Israel - opinion

Anybody reading the secular or the haredi (ultra-Orthodox) press in recent months knows that the Religious Zionist sector is under attack from both opposing sides of the political spectrum. And anybody reading the religious and right-wing press in recent months knows that the Religious Zionist sector is also tearing itself apart.
The issue at hand is the draft exemption law for the haredi world, which is being debated in the Knesset.
Obviously, the Religious Zionist public and political and rabbinic figures associated with it are broadly supportive of efforts to draw haredi men into national and military service. The debate is over how demanding to be in the intent to draft haredi men, how fierce a draft law – or how weak a draft exemption law – to pass, and whether to risk the current and possibly future nationalist-haredi coalition governments over this matter.
I am strongly in favor of forcing real societal change through tough sanctions on the haredi world, which refuses to participate in the privilege of national security service – although I understand those who fear the shattering of the political Right if haredi leaders are pushed harder.
What I cannot tolerate is the demonizing of the Religious Zionist public in this debate – especially the savaging of brave Religious Zionist women, wives, and mothers of courageous soldiers – who have led campaigns for the passage of an effective and enforceable haredi draft law.
Devoted military service
No sector in Israeli society has “carried the burden” of the past two years of war with more devoted military service, and alas with more casualties, than the Religious Zionists.
This assessment was borne out in a first-of-its-kind detailed academic study published last month. Writing in The Israeli Journal of Society, Military, and National Security (published by the Maarachot think-tank of the Defense Ministry and The Association of Civil-Military Studies in Israel), Dr. Roe Naon and Prof. Uzi Ben-Shalom assert that the Religious Zionist sector suffered four times the losses of any other in Israel.
The authors studied the conscript and reserve units serving in the Israel-Hamas War (Swords of Iron) as well as the rolls of wounded and fallen soldiers.
They found that 257 fallen soldiers, equaling 34 percent of all soldiers killed in the war, were “religious” Israelis; way beyond the less-than-10% of the overall public that identifies as “dati.” Again, the losses among the religious soldiers are four times larger than the size of this community within the broader Israeli public, and 2.5 times larger than the size of this community in relation to men of draft age.
Among reserve soldiers, religious men account for a whopping 45% of the casualties in this war. They are 29% of the casualties among soldiers in the standing army, and 27% of those in the professional army ranks.
Among junior officers in the military, religious soldiers account for 43% of the fallen. Among non-commissioned officers (NCOs), religious soldiers are 41% of the fallen. Among infantry-based NCOs, religious soldiers make up 30% of the fallen.
In the units most implicated in frontline, heavy combat, namely in the engineering, armored, and infantry corps, over one-third of the fallen are religious soldiers.
Additionally, a preponderance of these fallen religious soldiers hail from Jerusalem, Judea and Samaria, and peripheral towns in Israel – where many religious Jews live – as well as from the lower socioeconomic strata of Israeli society.
In summary, the authors of the study note the high degree of ideological, communal, familial, and national commitment of the Religious Zionist sector to the military defense of Israel, and the great emphasis on “national unity” and the “privilege” of serving the country that marks this sector.
All of this accounts for the disproportionate share of fallen and wounded soldiers in this sector of Israeli society.
What Naon and Ben-Shalom have not yet studied are the large families that these religious soldiers often have – especially reservists – and the deep, disrupting, and traumatizing impact that long military service, wounding, and death have had on very many religious families.
All the more ugly
This reality, both heroic and bone-chilling, makes the current attacks on Religious Zionists all the more ugly.
It is bad enough that some radical secular leftists accuse Religious Zionists of uber-nationalism (calling them “messianic” or “bloodthirsty”), while the defeatist policies of the Left ever since Oslo have led Israel to disaster.
And it is bad enough that haredi leaders accuse Religious Zionists of “abandoning Torah values,” while haredi indifference to the suffering and national burden of all other Israelis is the very opposite of Torah values.
But it is outrageous and infuriating to witness the savage attacks on brave women like Noa Mevorah and Shvut Raanan of Shutafim LaSheirut (Partners in Service: Religious Women in Favor of IDF Service).
They are being called “traitors” and “useful idiots of the Left” for their outspoken, principled advocacy of strong haredi draft legislation.
These are women whose husbands and sons have collectively served thousands of days of tough military duty, and they have every right to demand a sea change in the “contract” between the serving Israeli public and the mostly non-serving haredi public.
They are now facing an avalanche of delegitimizing ads and digital posts across a broad swath of right-wing and religious newspapers (such as B’Sheva), magazines circulated in synagogues (like Olam Katan and dozens of other haredi publications), and broadcast platforms, notably Channel 14.
The attacks have broadened to include assaults on all religious women who do “only” national service and on religious men who do “only” hesder service (program for religious men, alternating yeshiva study with active IDF service and long and intensive years of frontline reserve duty).
Netanyahu’s coalition
Alas, the unifying theme behind these attacks appears to be slavish devotion to the principle of “Thou shalt not harm Netanyahu’s coalition,” while downplaying the overarching moral demand for equalizing military service responsibilities at the historic inflexion point now before Israeli society.
Unfortunately, a “hardal” coalition of 40 rabbis (composed of community rabbis and yeshiva deans within Religious Zionism who tend toward haredi ideology and religious practice) this week joined the fracas against Shutafim LaSheirut and in support of Religious Zionist Party leader Betzalel Smotrich – who is leaning toward adoption of the current draft evasion law concocted by Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee Chair Boaz Bismuth.
They bury the real ideological and political questions of the day under a blanket of smarmy niceties about “brotherly love” for the haredi public. They glibly term opposition to draft-evasion legislation as a “trap” caused by “troublemakers” meant to bring down the current right-wing government.
They furthermore make the nonsensical assertion that the proposed legislation will indeed help draft many haredi soldiers – “three times as many haredi soldiers.” (Three times what? The current number of near-zero.)
And, in a further insult to our intelligence, these narrow-minded rabbis aver that the Bismuth bill will “ease the burden on reservists,” including, supposedly, the many Religious Zionist reservists whose communities they helm – although even the most ardent advocates of the bill do not make this ridiculous claim.
It will take decades of effective haredi draft until a mass of combat soldiers is sufficiently absorbed and trained enough to lead to a real easing of the reservist burden.
As a deeply religious Zionist myself, even an unabashed “messianist,” I too seek brotherly love and unity but not at the expense of ideological distortions, false narratives, and malicious defamation.

Reform by-election candidate said it was ‘insane’ to jail man who said ‘burn asylum hotels’
Exclusive: It comes after The Independent revealed that Matt Goodwin called for ‘young girls’ to be given ‘biological reality’ check

The Reform candidate in an upcoming Westminster by-election is under scrutiny after saying it was “insane” a man was jailed for 18 months for social media posts calling for people to burn asylum hotels to the ground.
Matt Goodwin responded to a Daily Mail report from December that Luke Yarwood, from Christchurch, Dorset, was jailed inciting racial hatred. He said in a post on X: “Welcome to the UK. Where you go to prison for 18 months for anti-immigration tweets. This is insane.”
Yarwood had reportedly called on Brits to “gang together, hit the streets and start the slaughter” in a series of anti-Muslim and anti-immigration posts from 21 December 2024 to 29 January 2025.
“Violence and murder is the only way now. Start off burning every migrant hotel then head off to MPs' houses and Parliament, we need to take over by FORCE”, he said, following a car attack in Germany which killed six people, as misinformation spread on social media suggesting it was linked to Islamic extremism.”
While his lawyer reportedly defended him by pointing out that only 33 people had read the post, he was still jailed for 18 months.
Reform UK hit back at criticism around Mr Goodwin’s tweet, claiming it was “desperate stuff” from Labour after The i reported about his post and the party’s deputy leader Lucy Powell called on the Denton and Gorton candidate to reject support from members of his campaign team that have been accused of racism.
A Reform UK spokesman said: “This is desperate stuff from a Labour Party that has also just been revealed to have been smearing journalists. Criticising the fact that people are being jailed for what they write on social media is clearly not the same as defending those views.
“The fact that our political opponents are conflating these two things is outrageous and a sign of how desperate they have become. Vote Reform, vote for common sense.”
Mr Goodwin hit the headlines last week after The Independent revealed he had called for women and young girls to be given a “biological reality” check as he warned of an impending “fertility crisis”.
This publication also revealed that he had previously suggested people who don’t have children should be taxed extra as punishment and warned that “many women in Britain are having children much too late in life”.
The polling cited by Mr Goodwin, who is standing for Reform UK in the Gorton and Denton by-election at the end of this month, also showed more than 50 per cent of the public wanted taxes and spending to increase, while 40 per cent wanted them to remain the same.
He also once described his party’s economic plans as an “utterly toxic combination”, explaining that he “cannot stress enough how UNPOPULAR slashing taxes and cutting spending on public services is” in a post on LinkedIn three years ago.
The former academic was pointing to polling from the highly respected British Social Attitudes survey which showed that reducing both was backed by just 6 per cent of the public.
In November, Nigel Farage said his party “will cut spending” and “we want to cut taxes”. And last month he doubled down, saying: “We are going to reduce excessive government spending.”
In a speech last year, Mr Farage said “substantial tax cuts” were not realistic at the current moment “given the dire state” of the country’s finances but said that his party would raise the threshold at which workers start to pay tax and scrap Labour’s ‘family farm’ inheritance tax changes.
However, he rowed back from his party’s 2024 election promise to cut £90bn of taxes, which leading economic think tank the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said Reform had failed to set out how they would achieve.
Last month Mr Farage also told an event in Davos that he thought “the one big lesson of the Liz Truss-Kwasi Kwarteng Budget is that they did not propose to cut spending. So for our programme to work, what we absolutely have to tell people that we are going to reduce welfare spending, we are going to reduce excessive government spending.”
A Labour Party spokesperson said: “Matt Goodwin’s comments show that it’s not just Labour saying Reform’s economic plans are ludicrous – their own candidate thinks so too.
“Reform UK offers nothing but a return to austerity, enacted by a party stuffed full of the same Tories that broke our public services in the first place.”
A Reform spokesperson told The Independent: “Labour’s campaign in Gorton and Denton truly must be on the ropes if they have had to resort to polling analysis by Matt from three years ago when the economy was in a much different place.
“We will take no lectures from a party under whose watch the economy has tanked. By voting Reform the voters of Gorton and Denton can get Keir Starmer out and help bring an end to this failed Labour government.”

Israel resumes contentious West Bank land registration in new step to deepen control

Israel resumes contentious West Bank land registration in new step to deepen control
Israel is resuming a land registration process in the occupied West Bank that critics say can shift large areas into state control
- Bookmark
Israel will begin a contentious land regulation process in a large part of the occupied West Bank, which could result in the country gaining control over wide swaths of the area for future development, according to a government decision on Sunday.
The decision paves the way for the resumption of “settlement of land title” processes, which had been frozen in the West Bank since the Mideast War in 1967. It means that when Israel begins the land registration process for a certain area, anyone with a claim to the land must submit documents proving ownership.
“This move is very dramatic and allows the state to gain control of almost all of Area C,” said Hagit Ofran, the director of Israeli anti-settlement watchdog group Peace Now. Area C refers to the 60 per cent of the West Bank that is under full Israeli military control, according to agreements reached in the 1990s with the Palestinians.
The decision is the latest step to deepen Israeli control over the West Bank. In recent months, Israel has greatly expanded construction of Jewish settlements, legalised outposts and made significant bureaucratic changes to its policies in the territory to strengthen its hold and weaken the Palestinian Authority.
Sunday’s decision was first announced last May but required further development before it was approved in this week’s Cabinet meeting.
Under the decision, Israeli authorities will announce certain areas to undergo registration, which will force anyone who has a claim to the land to prove their ownership.
Ms Ofran said the process for proving ownership can be “draconian” and is rarely transparent, meaning any land that undergoes the registration process in areas currently owned by Palestinians is likely to revert to Israeli state control.
“Palestinians will be sent to prove ownership in a way that they will never be able to do,” Ms Ofran told The Associated Press. “And this way Israel might take over 83 per cent of Area C, which is about half of the West Bank.”
The registration process could start as soon as this year, she said.
The proposal had been put forward by some of Israel’s far-right members of the ruling coalition, including the justice minister Yariv Levin. “The government of Israel is committed to strengthening its grip on all its parts, and this decision is an expression of that commitment,” he said.
Palestinian Authority president Mahmoud Abbas’ office in a statement called the decision “a grave escalation and a flagrant violation of international law”, which amounts to “de facto annexation.” It called on the international community, especially the UN Security Council and the United States, to intervene immediately.
Previous US administrations have sharply condemned an expansion of Israeli activity and control in the West Bank, but prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has a particularly close relationship with Donald Trump. The two met last week in Washington, their seventh meeting in the past year.
And yet Mr Trump has opposed annexation, Ms Ofran noted.
Palestinians are not permitted to sell land privately to Israelis, though measures announced last week aim to nullify this. Currently, settlers can buy homes on land controlled by Israel’s government. Last week's decision also aimed to expand Israeli enforcement of several aspects of in the West Bank, including environmental and archaeological matters in Palestinian-administered areas.
More than 700,000 Israelis live in the occupied West Bank and east Jerusalem, territories captured by Israel in 1967 from Jordan and sought by the Palestinians for a future state. The international community overwhelmingly considers Israeli settlement construction in these areas to be illegal and an obstacle to peace.
Over 300,000 Palestinians are estimated to live in Area C of the West Bank, with many more in surrounding communities dependent on its agricultural and grazing lands, including plots for which families retain land deeds or tax records dating back decades.

Offer to join Trump’s new era is met with growing sense of European steeliness

If JD Vance’s thuggish speech to last year’s Munich Security Conference, directed at the solar plexus of Europe, marked the moment when a transatlantic breakup started, this weekend’s conference, in a rainy and cold Bavaria, was where the debate about the terms of the divorce settlement got under way.
Marco Rubio, the chosen Washington representative this year, is a diplomat, so he softened the Trumpian tone with references to German beer, the Beatles, Dante and the Mayflower. But his speech was a stern warning that if Europe wanted to continue on its path of civilisational decline, as this US administration sees it, America would not be interested and has different hemispheres on which to focus.
“Yesterday is over,” he said, and then he spelled out what yesterday meant. Mass migration threatening civilisational erasure and the continuity of Christian culture, unfettered trade, massive welfare states, weak defences, climate cults, the outsourcing of sovereignty to international institutions, the rationalisation of a broken status quo by people “shackled with guilt and shame”. Unlike Vance, he did not laud rightwing European populist parties, but he nonetheless wrapped himself in their ideology. His next stop after Munich was Budapest, where Viktor Orbán faces a battle in April to remain in power.
And yet there were some, such as the organiser of the conference, the distinguished German diplomat Wolfgang Ischinger, who claimed to be reassured by the conditional offer to join this journey into a new era with Donald Trump. If Europeans were reassured by Rubio, it was, as Mark Leonard, the director of the European Council on Foreign Relations, observed, “a classic example of the soft bigotry of low expectations”. One reference by the US secretary of state to his country being “a child of Europe” and the older romantics of transatlanticism melted.
But that was not the dominant European mood at this sprawling conference. An iron has entered the European soul about Trump, egged on by the many Democrats attending, and there is a willingness if not to confront him then at least to end the dependence and learn the lessons of the standoff over Greenland.
Talk of a stronger independent European pillar of Nato was heard repeatedly, and even adopted by Keir Starmer in his speech pledging greater integration on defence with Europe. His Valentine’s Day speech to Europe was remarkable for two other reasons. He declared the Brexit era was over and, unlike Rubio, he praised societal diversity and a Britain where “people who look different to each other can live peacefully together”. So much for Rubio’s risk of civilisational erasure.
But the German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, who is due to go to China in April, said the era of US hegemony was coming to an end, and more quickly than many thought if the US believed it could act alone. “We don’t believe in tariffs and protectionism but in free trade. And we stand by climate agreements and the World Health Organization because we are convinced that we can only solve global challenges together,” he said.
Merz signalled Berlin was already preparing for a smaller American footprint in Europe, and that Germany may at times diverge from the US. “We Europeans are taking precautions. In doing so, we arrive at different conclusions than the administration in Washington,” he said.
The dispute over Ukraine and Trump’s leniency towards Vladimir Putin still appals much of Europe and is at the centre of what is driving Trump and leaders on the continent apart. It was an American, Hillary Clinton, who expressed the anger best: “The effort that Putin and Trump are making to profit off the misery and death of the Ukrainian people is a historic error and corrupt to the nth degree … He’s betrayed the west. He’s betrayed human values.”
The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, now a leading contributor to European defence technology, said “war reveals forms of evil we did not expect” and asked why it was, he felt, Ukraine and not Russia being asked by Trump to make the concessions. He admitted he felt keenly the mistake of Europe’s absence at the negotiating table.
Radoslaw Sikorski, the Polish foreign minister, further made the point. He said it was natural for the US to take the lead in the negotiations when it was providing the bulk of the military assistance. “But we are now paying for this war. The US outlay for the war last year was close to zero. We are buying the weapons to be delivered to Ukraine. There is no prospect of a package in Congress. If we are paying, and it is affecting our security and not just Ukraine’s, we deserve a seat at the table.”
Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president, rebuked Mark Rutte, the Nato secretary general, for telling Europe to dream on if it thought it could defend itself without the US.
At one level, the US and Europe vehemently agree that Europe should take greater responsibility for its own conventional defence. Elbridge Colby, the deputy secretary for war and the nearest thing the Trump administration has to a theoretician, said: “People get it, 2025 was the year to reframe and reorient, and now we have a lot of buy-in. Look at what Germany has been doing with a massive increase in spending.”
But what the US and Europe have only started to debate is what this more independent Europe will be permitted to do by the US. For the moment an interregnum exists.
Emmanuel Macron, the French president, in a speech that lost some impact owing to its late scheduling, was the one who spelled out the wider consequences of Europe becoming its own protector. With new responsibilities came new rights, some of which Trump may dislike.
Not only did Europe deserve a place at the Ukraine negotiating table, since it was Europe’s existential challenge, it had a right to speak to Putin directly apart from the US, Macron said. Ideally, the US should be weaned off its belief that a just deal is acceptable in the short term.
In any negotiations about what may replace the collapsed arms control agreements with Russia, Europe could not again be a bystander while the US unilaterally withdrew from agreements such as the INF treaty. He had learned of the US withdrawal from the intermediate-range nuclear forces treaty in the newspapers, as did all allies, Macron complained.
Macron argued that to be credible at such a negotiation, Europe needed better deep strike capacities to match those of Russia. European defence firms should not be browbeaten into buying US military hardware. “We will be credible only if we are able to procure and produce what we need, without foreign strings attached.”
Europe could strengthen its own rules on tech and AI. It would be “crazy” if free speech meant giving “the mind, the brain, the heart of my teenagers to the algorithm of big guys with whom I’m not totally sure I share their values”, he said.
Above all, Macron, Merz and Starmer referenced the deeply sensitive discussions on which they are to embark as to how France and the UK could make their nuclear deterrents available to Europe, thus reducing the need for the US nuclear umbrella. It is a hugely expensive and politically fraught undertaking.
Merz made a brief but deliberate reference to the initial talks he had held with Macron, and in an article for Foreign Affairs he said he hoped to agree the first concrete steps this year. Macron was also an enthusiast, pointing to the cooperation with Britain.
If European sovereignty ever extends this far it will make the US uncomfortable. But it is a sign of the times that it is on the agenda. Yesterday is truly over.

Gaza’s real reconstruction problem isn’t concrete, it’s culture - opinion

Imagine a society in which a child walks to school on a street named for a mass murderer, studies in a building honoring a terrorist ideologue, and spends afternoons in youth centers commemorating men famous for killing civilians. Imagine further that this child is taught – by state-sanctioned television – that the highest aspiration in life is death, preferably violent, preferably in the service of God.
This is not a dystopian thought experiment. It has been everyday life in Gaza.
Before October 7, a Palestinian child might have walked along Abu Jihad Street – named for the architect of a bus hijacking that killed 38 Israelis, including 13 children – before arriving at a school bearing the name of Hamas founder Ahmad Yassin.
After class, the same child could attend activities in a center honoring Abu Iyad, one of the planners of the Munich Olympics massacre.
On a popular Palestinian TV program, an adult host asks an 11-year-old girl if martyrdom is beautiful. “Very, very beautiful,” she replies. “Everyone yearns for shahada. What could be better than going to Paradise?”
This cultural environment did not emerge by accident.
Majority of Palestinians express support for Hamas before the October 7 massacre
And it helps explain a grim statistic often treated as impolite to mention. On October 7, polls showed that roughly 70 percent of Gazans and 80% of West Bank Palestinians expressed support for Hamas. For decades, scholars and policymakers have warned about the institutionalized radicalization embedded in Palestinian education, media, and civic life – a culture that prizes martyrdom over life and grievance over coexistence.
And for decades, those warnings have been met with a familiar response: denial, relativism, and money – lots of it. Over the past 10 years alone, billions of dollars – a large part from Europe – have flowed into Gaza, with few conditions and fewer consequences, helping sustain a system that glorifies death while promising peace.
Now, after October 7, the Middle East stands at a rare historical inflection point. Israel’s military and diplomatic gains have widened the opening created by the Abraham Accords: a chance to privilege pragmatism over ideology, realism over fantasy.
Gaza, too, sits before such a moment, if the world has the nerve to seize it. Reconstruction, however, cannot mean repeating the errors that led to ruin. Rebuilding Gaza without dismantling the ideology that destroyed it would be less an act of compassion than an exercise in willful blindness. Concrete poured atop radicalization is not reconstruction. It is preparation for the next war.
This brings us to a word that is endlessly invoked and rarely understood: “deradicalization.” Hamas’ disarmament is essential, but it is not sufficient. Weapons can be confiscated, but ideas require confrontation.
Deradicalization is not merely about convincing militants to lay down their arms. It is about dismantling the narratives, symbols, institutions, and incentives that normalize violence and sanctify hatred.
There is a useful distinction here. Deradicalization refers to the ideological retreat from extremist beliefs – something that can happen to individuals (as in the case of Mosab Hassan Yousef, author of The Green Prince and son of a Hamas founding member) or even groups (as with the IRA in late 1990s Ireland).
Counter-Radicalization, by contrast, is preventative, ensuring that extremist ideas fail to capture new generations. Gaza requires both. But above all, it requires societal change.
History offers a precedent that is often invoked and rarely absorbed. Post-war Germany did not abandon Nazism because it was gently persuaded to do so. It did so because Nazism was systematically uprooted. Symbols were removed, and textbooks were rewritten. Media was regulated, and former perpetrators were barred from power.
Accountability was imposed.
Denazification succeeded not because Germans were flattered, but because reality was enforced.
The lesson is uncomfortable but unavoidable: Radicalized societies do not heal through dialogue alone. They require structural reform. For Gaza, that means rewriting curricula that glorify jihad, renaming streets and institutions that honor terrorists, regulating media that incites violence, and permanently excluding Hamas from political authority. Without these steps, the “day after” will look disturbingly like the day before.
This transformation cannot be imposed solely from above. Palestinian civil society, both local and international, must play a role in building cultural immunity against extremism. That includes educational initiatives, exposure to alternative narratives, and yes, carefully structured encounters with the very people Hamas has spent decades demonizing, the Jews.
I say this not as an optimist by temperament, but as someone who has spent years speaking with former jihadists who abandoned ideologies they once embraced unto death. Change is possible. But it is never accidental.
The consequences of failure extend well beyond Gaza. Hamas has proved remarkably adept at exporting its worldview, fusing Islamist extremism with Western progressive rhetoric.
What began as the worst massacre of Jews since the Holocaust has metastasized into a global antisemitic movement, turbocharged by social media and absorbed by students who cannot locate Gaza on a map but chant slogans calling for Israel’s erasure. The spectacle borders on the surreal: LGBTQ activists chanting Hamas slogans and progressive students donning Hamas costumes in European capitals. In the name of liberation, they excuse misogyny, homophobia, honor killings, theocracy, and the murder of Jews, while congratulating themselves on their moral sophistication.
Western governments should recognize the boomerang effect. Funding radicalization abroad imports illiberalism at home. Some Arab states already understand this.
Morocco and the United Arab Emirates have concluded that the Muslim Brotherhood ideology is a threat not only to Israel or the West but also to their own societies. They have acted accordingly, by reforming textbooks, regulating religious discourse, producing media that promote coexistence, and appointing officials explicitly tasked with countering extremism.
Gaza deserves no less seriousness – and no more indulgence.
If the Abraham Accords demonstrated that peace in the Middle East is possible without illusions, then Gaza’s future depends on applying the same realism to Palestinian society itself.
Ideological disarmament is not collective punishment. It is a collective rescue. The window is open, but history will not keep it that way for long.

MOSCOW, February 15. /TASS/. Polish President Karol Nawrotski has said that Poland should seek to possess nuclear weapons.
"I am an advocate of Poland joining the nuclear project. This path, taking into account all international rule, is the oath we should opt for," he said in an interview with the Polsat television channel.
He stressed that he supports any strengthening of Poland’s security, "even on the basis of nuclear capacities."
Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski said earlier that the Polish government is not discussing stationing nuclear weapons on the country's territory. The country’s former President (2015-2025) Andrzej Duda repeatedly advocated for deploying American nuclear weapons in Poland.
In the spring of 2025, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said that Poland would strive to gain access to the most modern types of weapons, including nuclear weapons, backing French President Emmanuel Macron’s idea to extend the French "nuclear umbrella" to other European countries.

Israeli Cabinet approves West Bank land registration, Palestinians condemn ‘de-facto annexation’

JERUSALEM - Israel's Cabinet on Feb 15 approved further measures to tighten Israel's control over the occupied West Bank
The West Bank is among the territories that the Palestinians seek for a future independent state. Much of it is under Israeli military control, with limited Palestinian self-rule in some areas run by the Western-backed Palestinian Authority (PA).
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is facing an election later in 2026, deems the establishment of any Palestinian state a security threat.
His ruling coalition includes many pro-settler members who want Israel to annex the West Bank, land captured in the 1967 Middle East war to which Israel cites biblical and historical ties.
Ministers voted in favour of beginning a process of land registration for the first time since 1967.
"We are continuing the revolution of settlement and strengthening our hold across all parts of our land," said Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, a far-right member of Mr Netanyahu's government.
Defence Minister Israel Katz said land registration was a vital security measure designed to ensure control, enforcement, and full freedom of action for Israel in the area to protect its citizens and safeguard national interests.
The Cabinet said in a statement registration was an "appropriate response to illegal land registration processes promoted by the Palestinian Authority," and would end disputes.
The PA presidency rejected the Cabinet's decision, saying it constitutes "a de-facto annexation of occupied Palestinian territory and a declaration of the commencement of annexation plans aimed at entrenching the occupation through illegal settlement activity."
US President Donald Trump has ruled out Israeli annexation of the West Bank but his administration has not sought to curb Israel's accelerated settlement building, which the Palestinians say denies them a potential state by eating away at its territory.
The United Nations' highest court said in a non-binding advisory opinion in 2024 that Israel's occupation of Palestinian territories and settlements there are illegal and should be ended as soon as possible. Israel disputes this view, saying it has historical and biblical ties to the land.
The land registration adds to a series of measures taken earlier in February to expand control. REUTERS

US not leaving NATO, stronger European defence makes alliance more powerful: Rubio

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio dismissed speculation about Washington leaving NATO, arguing stronger European defence capabilities would enhance rather than weaken the alliance.
"We're not leaving NATO. We're not leaving ... We may move a couple thousand troops from one country to another, but this has always been the case," Rubio told reporters on Sunday alongside Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico in Bratislava, the capital of Slovakia.
He criticised narratives suggesting that asking European allies to contribute more equates to American abandonment of the alliance.
"Every time we say this, people go crazy. They think that means you're going to abandon NATO, you're going to abandon your allies," Rubio said, clarifying: "The point we're making is that the stronger our allies are, the stronger we are collectively."
He emphasised Washington does not view increased European military capability as threatening to US influence but rather as a necessary partnership evolution.
"We are not threatened or feel that it's hostile to see NATO grow in its own capabilities, not independent of the United States, in conjunction with the United States," he said.
‘US wants to be Europe’s partner’
He rejected the notion that Europe should remain dependent on American protection, saying: "We're not asking Europe to be a vassal of the United States. We want to be your partner."
"We don't think it's a negative thing that other countries have more influence in NATO," Rubio added.
He also emphasised the Trump administration's focus on Central Europe. "We are going to show in the weeks and months and years to come that under President (Donald) Trump, this administration is going to make not just Slovakia but Central Europe a key component of how we engage the continent and the world," he said.
"When the national interest of the United States, for example, and the national interest of Slovakia are aligned, this is an extraordinary opportunity for cooperation," he said, noting the US is "very happy" with Slovakia's selection of the F-16 program to strengthen its air force. "We hope you'll consider some others as well ... that we can work together on."

‘Adopt a Statue’ program for Milan’s iconic Duomo restores centuries-old marbles
A restored 15th-century Duomo statue is now on public display in Milan through a donor-backed loan program
- Bookmark
A 15th-century statue that once stood outside Milan’s iconic Duomo has found a new home.
The Bearded Saint with Book was recently restored under the “Adopt a Statue” program, launched in 2020 by the centuries-old institution that oversees the cathedral’s conservation. As of Feb. 13, it is on display at Piazzale Cadorna, behind a glass window at the headquarters of FNM, a Lombardy-based transport company.
The program recruits donors — either companies or individuals — to fund restoration of a statue under a loan agreement that allows it to occasionally be displayed outside the Duomo.
“The uniqueness of this project is that statues that would otherwise remain in our deposits are restored and brought back to their original beauty,” the program’s project manager, Elisa Mantia, said in an interview with The Associated Press. “In that way, they can continue to tell the story of the Duomo even in places that are far from the monument.”
These agreements are in some cases granted for an initial one-year term and may be renewed. The initiative follows previous fundraising campaigns in which donors could adopt gargoyles or spires in exchange for inclusion in the Duomo’s donor register, where contributors’ names are recorded as part of the cathedral’s long history of support.
From storage to public display
The construction of the Duomo began in 1386, under the rule of Gian Galeazzo Visconti, then lord of Milan, in collaboration with the city’s archbishop. The cathedral was built on the site of two preexisting basilicas and its completion took more than five centuries. One of its bronze doors was not installed until 1965.
Because construction spanned centuries, the Duomo’s statues were carved by artists from different regions and periods, resulting in a monument that reads as a timeline of evolving artistic styles.
The Veneranda Fabbrica del Duomo, which oversees the cathedral’s conservation, has sought funding to restore statues removed over the centuries for maintenance or safety reasons.
“Culture can save the world,” Andrea Gibelli, president of FNM, said during a press conference on Feb. 13 to mark the unveiling of Bearded Saint with Book. “We want to spread the cultural riches we are fortunate to have, which are often overlooked or not fully appreciated."
Other sculptures adopted under the program by different sponsors have included a 16th-century David, a depiction of Samson and the Lion, and a statue of Saint Matthew the Apostle.
While the number of adopted statues isn't disclosed and not all are displayed in public spaces, Mantia said that her institution has preselected around 30 sculptures as eligible for restoration. Each case must be authorized by Italy’s cultural heritage authorities, as the process involves a formal loan agreement subject to conservation, insurance and transport regulations.
“We usually select them because they are very beautiful and not so damaged that they would be unsafe to loan,” Mantia said.
Once a donor reaches out, experts like Mantia accompany them to the Duomo’s storage facilities to choose a sculpture. After it is selected, restoration typically takes between one and three months.
Centuries-old marble
Bearded Saint with a Book was originally displayed outdoors. Aside from a black crust from air pollution on its surface, it had no structural damages preventing its loan.
“This often involves only surface finishing or an intervention with compresses or mechanical cleaning,” Mantia said.
The marble used for both the statues and the Duomo itself comes from the quarries of Candoglia in Italy’s Piedmont region. The same stone has been used since the late 14th century, under the supervision of the Veneranda Fabbrica del Duomo.
“Beyond being the symbol of Milan, the Duomo is also a symbol of its history,” Mantia said. “It is a monument that grew together with the city, that tells within itself, in its statues and in the style with which it is decorated, the entire history of the city.”

In another ceasefire violation, Israeli soldiers cross UN-demarcated border into Lebanon
Israeli drone crashes near town of Houla, says Lebanese media
BEIRUT, Lebanon / ISTANBUL
Israeli army soldiers crossed the border into southern Lebanon on Sunday, marking a new violation of a ceasefire agreement in place since November 2024, local media reported.
The state-run National News Agency said two Israeli military vehicles stopped at the southern border, with several soldiers crossing the UN-demarcated Blue Line, a de facto border, into the area of Darb al-Hawrat, southeast of the town of Mays al-Jabal, before withdrawing to the other side of the border.
In a separate development, an Israeli drone crashed near the town of Houla in southern Lebanon, with no further details given.
Israeli ceasefire violations have killed and wounded hundreds of Lebanese, while Israel continues to occupy five Lebanese hilltops seized during the latest war, in addition to other Lebanese areas it has held for decades.
Israel began military operations against Lebanon in October 2023 against the backdrop of the Gaza war and escalated them into a full-scale war in September 2024, killing more than 4,000 people and wounding about 17,000 others.
Lebanese officials have repeatedly called for pressure on Tel Aviv to halt its attacks and abide by the ceasefire, while Hezbollah has affirmed on more than one occasion its commitment to the truce, calling for withdrawal from the areas occupied by Israel during the last war.

Rubio visits central Europe to bolster ties with pro-Trump leaders
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
BUDAPEST, Feb 15 - U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio vowed to deepen cooperation with central Europe on Sunday as he kicked off a trip to Slovakia and Hungary, whose conservative leaders have warm ties with President Donald Trump.
In Slovakia, which, like Hungary, relies on Russian oil and gas and has uneasy relations with the rest of the European Union, Rubio discussed energy and defence with Prime Minister Robert Fico and President Peter Pellegrini.
It was the first visit in seven years by a U.S. secretary of state to the country of 5.5 million people that borders Ukraine.
"Under President Trump, this administration is going to make not just Slovakia but central Europe a key component of how we engage the continent and the world," Rubio said.
"We are not just going to engage in meetings and pleasantries, but in concrete actions that we will take together in ways that are beneficial to your people and our people."
RUBIO COMBINED CRITICISM OF EUROPE WITH MESSAGE OF UNITY
On Saturday Rubio, who is also Trump's national security adviser, delivered a message of unity at the Munich Security Conference while maintaining the administration's criticism of Europe following a scarring year for Transatlantic ties.
Trump's criticism of Europe, imposition of tariffs on EU countries and his ambition to acquire Greenland from fellow NATO member Denmark have prompted Western European leaders to increasingly look at carving an independent path.
"We expect every country in the world to act in their national interest. That is what countries are supposed to do," Rubio said. "When our national interests are aligned ... this is an extraordinary opportunity for cooperation and partnership."
Fico, who has said the European Union is in "deep crisis", visited Trump last month in Florida and showered the Republican president with praise, saying he would bring peace.
Both Fico and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, whom Rubio will meet on Monday in the second leg of his trip, have been accused by EU institutions of weakening the judiciary, media and anti-corruption enforcement.
They have also maintained ties with Moscow, criticised and at times delayed the imposition of EU sanctions on Russia and opposed sending military aid to Ukraine.
ORBAN MEETING ON MONDAY
In remarks before departing Washington on Thursday, Rubio said Trump is very supportive of Orban, who is trailing in most polls ahead of an election in April when he could be voted out of power.
Orban, one of Trump's closest allies in Europe, is considered by many on the American hard-right as a model for the U.S. president's tough policies on immigration and support for Christian conservatism.
Budapest has repeatedly hosted Conservative Political Action Conference events, which bring together conservative activists and leaders, with another due in March.
While other European Union countries secured alternative energy supplies after Moscow invaded Ukraine in 2022, including by buying U.S. natural gas, Slovakia and Hungary have continued to buy Russian gas and oil, a practice the U.S. has criticised. Rubio said this would be discussed during his brief tour.
On nuclear cooperation, Slovakia signed an agreement with the United States last month.
Fico said he hoped an agreement with U.S.-based Westinghouse could be signed by next year that would lead to a consortium that will build a new nuclear power plant in Slovakia by 2040. He added that Slovakia wants to buy four more F-16 fighter jets.
Hungary and Slovakia have raised defence spending to 2% of GDP, less than some others and still far off the 5% of GDP by 2035 agreed by NATO last year after pressure from Trump. Fico said Bratislava was aware it needed to raise its military capabilities and was working on it.
Fico has diverged from Washington in one area, when he criticised the U.S. capture of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro in early January. When asked about the issue at the news conference, Rubio shrugged off the difference of opinion.
"A lot of countries didn't like what we did in Venezuela. That's okay. That was in our national interest ... So what? That doesn't mean we're not going to be friends," Rubio said. REUTERS

Nature reconsidered: why it's making us anxious

Nature reconsidered: why it's making us anxious
February 15, 2026Strolling in a forest, nurturing a garden or even just looking at rolling green hills are interactions with nature that are often seen as a balm for the soul.
There is even a word for the love of nature: biophilia. At the other end of the spectrum is biophobia — the fear of nature.
It might traditionally be used to describe fear of large predators or phobias of spiders, snakes and other poisonous or dangerous creatures.
But in recent years, researchers have been observing biophobia of entirely different proportions.
A team at Sweden's Lund University analyzed almost 200 studies on the relationship between humans and nature.
The result: our relationship with nature seems to be deteriorating.
Many humans no longer have everyday contact with nature
Johan Kjellberg Jensen from Lund University, who led the overview study, said it reveals a clear link between a negative relationship with nature and a growing trend toward urban living.
And that could have impacts down the line, according to Jensen.
"Today, the majority of the world's population lives in cities, which means that future generations could be at increased risk of biophobia," he told DW.
Science has been observing people's alienation from nature since the late 1970s. That's according to Berlin psychologist Dirk Stemper, whose research interests include anxiety management and personal development.
This applies mainly to industrialized nations.
"Children are increasingly growing up in highly sealed, non-natural environments and spend most of their time indoors and in digital environments," he said. "There is a lack of physical and sensory experiences, such as climbing, getting dirty or observing animals."
What happens when nature becomes unfamiliar?
But it is precisely these kinds of experiences that build familiarity with nature — familiarity that psychologist Lea Dohm says is important in terms of planetary stewardship.
"The willingness to stand up for environmental, nature and climate protection is greater when we experience ourselves as connected to nature," said Dohm, who is a member of the German Alliance for Climate Change and Health (KLUG).
Jensen added that the idea of soil being "dirty" and earthworms being "disgusting" can be passed down from one generation to the next.
"If parents have negative attitudes towards nature, that can influence their children, which can then lead to a downward spiral of [less and less] closeness to nature," he said.
Stemper adds that when children are repeatedly told to "be careful of ticks" or not to touch certain things, they are likely to view nature as a place of danger.
Helping people to reconnect with nature
Environmental educator Susanne Sigl has also experienced this.
She works at Querwaldein, a non-profit organization in the German city of Cologne aimed at instilling a positive relationship with nature in people, especially children.
"When we ask children to collect long branches in the forest, some only touch them reluctantly, others even use a handkerchief and some don't touch them at all and don't bring any," she says.
According to Sigl, many children won't touch pinecones or chestnuts, prefering to just look at them. They are even less likely to touch earthworms or harmless insects such as small beetles.
The Lund University team also found that a fear of nature can even turn into hostility. There is research to back up the connection between biophobia and calls for the killing of certain predators such as bears, wolves or sharks.
How stories shape our view of the natural world
Our relationship with nature is also strongly determined by our culture and the stories we have heard about it.
"In Central Europe, the forest used to be seen as a place of danger, wild animals, starvation, predators and magical threats," the psychologist Stemper pointed out.
It was only with the cultural movement of Romanticism in the early 19th century that woodlands became places of longing in Germany.
In the Romantic period — in the late 18th century to mid-19th century — many artists and writers focused on the individual's search for magical, supernatural or miraculous phenomena as a reaction to the rapid technological progress of the time.
"Today, we are experiencing a kind of return of the fear of nature: not due to predators and wild animals, but to alienation, media frames and digital distraction," Stemper said.
He added that digital media often portrays a distorted image of nature, a kind of "hyperreality" that blurs the boundaries between the original and the — mostly filtered — copy.
As a result, "virtual nature experiences such as Instagram feeds or computer games have a more intense and 'real' effect than actual encounters with forests, meadows or animals," he explained.
Too little contact with nature harms our health
So why go into the real woods when the "safe" forest on Instagram looks so much nicer?
Because it's good for us. "When we spend time in nature, it promotes our mental health," Dohm said.
"Studies show that forests and nature alleviate ADHD symptoms, improve attention and concentration, reduce sensory problems and promote emotional regulation," Stemper added.
But because biophobic people avoid nature, they miss out on all these health benefits. So what to do?
Jensen says knowledge can help: the more people know about plants and animals and understand how nature works, the more they can appreciate them. And if the fear of natural hazards is actually justified, it helps to avoid risks, for example by protecting livestock from predators.
Susanne Sigl says the best way to help children reestablish contact with nature is through play: "If children fall down while playing tag in the forest, hide behind a tree or crouch in the bushes, then touching branches is usually no longer a problem."

Starmer facing calls for inquiry into Labour thinktank’s investigation of journalists

Keir Starmer is facing calls by MPs for an inquiry into the commissioning of a report that made “baseless claims” about journalists who were investigating a thinktank linked to the prime minister.
The calls add to pressure on the Cabinet Office minister Josh Simons, who commissioned a report in 2023 on journalists investigating Labour Together, the thinktank that would help propel Starmer to power.
The research was paid for and subsequently reviewed by Simons when he was director of Labour Together, according to sources and documents seen by the Guardian.
In an agreement addressed to Simons, drawn up by Apco Worldwide, the PR consultancy agreed to “investigate the sourcing, funding and origins” of a November 2023 Sunday Times report about the thinktank, in addition to other journalistic investigations into the group.
The Sunday Times reported that the contents of Apco’s investigation were informally shared with Labour figures in 2024, including present cabinet ministers and special advisers. The report contained allegations about Gabriel Pogrund and Harry Yorke, journalists at the paper, which then spread around Westminster.
The paper reported that Tom Harper, Apco’s senior director and a former Sunday Times employee, wrote that he had examined the “sourcing, funding and origins of the Sunday Times story” using documents and “discreet human source enquiries”.
Harper was said to have made “baseless claims” that the emails underpinning the published story were likely to have come from a suspected Kremlin hack of the Electoral Commission.
“The likeliest culprit is the Russian state, or proxies of the Russian state,” he reportedly wrote. Apco’s report was also said to have referred to Pogrund’s Jewish background and made baseless allegations about his faith, upbringing and personal and professional relationships.
Simons was close to the prime minister’s recently departed chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney, who previously ran Labour Together and whose own role in the operation to gather material on journalists is under scrutiny.
An investigation into Apco’s research has been launched by the Public Relations and Communications Association’s standards committee, and this has been welcomed by Simons.
He said in a statement: “I was surprised and shocked to read the report extended beyond the contract by including unnecessary information on Gabriel Pogrund.”
Simons said he had asked for the information to be removed before passing the report to the intelligence agency GCHQ. No other British journalists were investigated in any document he or Labour Together ever received, Simons said.
John McDonnell, the veteran Labour backbencher and former chancellor, said on Saturday he had written three times in recent weeks to the general secretary of the Labour party to call for an independent inquiry into the affair.
“I copied Keir Starmer into each request,” McDonnell said. “Clear to me as secretary of the NUJ’s parliamentary group if true this is unacceptable.”
Another Labour MP, Karl Turner, said the prime minister needed to look into the affair himself and should meet McDonnell to discuss it.
The contract showed that Simons asked for information specifically on the sources for a book by Paul Holden about McSweeney’s role in Starmer’s rise, as well as related articles by the US journalist Matt Taibbi.

U.S. President Donald Trump said the Board of Peace will announce this week that member states have pledged more than $5 billion toward humanitarian and reconstruction efforts in Gaza and committed thousands of personnel to an international stabilization force and local police in the territory.
In a post on Truth Social, Trump said the announcement will be made Feb. 19, 2026, at the Donald J. Trump Institute of Peace in Washington, where he will be joined by member states of the organization, which he chairs.
Trump wrote that member states have pledged more than $5 billion toward Gaza humanitarian and reconstruction efforts and have committed thousands of personnel to an international stabilization force and local police to maintain security and peace for residents of the enclave.
He also said Hamas “must uphold its commitment to full and immediate demilitarization.”
Trump described the Board of Peace as having “unlimited potential” and said it would prove to be “the most consequential international body in history,” adding that it is his honor to serve as its chairman.

Zelenskyy: Putin not being in prison is the biggest compromise the world has made
Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has stated that the world has made its biggest concession regarding Russia, given that Vladimir Putin and his inner circle are still at liberty.
Source: European Pravda, citing Zelenskyy in an interview with Politico
Details: Zelenskyy said he is receiving signals from the United States and President Donald Trump about the need to compromise with Russia.
Quote: "There are some signals from the American side, from President Trump. They say, 'Look, this is the time for compromises, you can make some steps forward.'
We made a lot of compromises. Putin and his friends, they are not in prison. This is the biggest compromise that the world has made already."
Details: Zelenskyy also said that when Trump proposed concluding a truce and temporarily freezing the war, Ukraine agreed to an unconditional ceasefire, but Putin has refused to consider it.
The Ukrainian leader believes this state of affairs will persist until the Kremlin ruler is put under real pressure.
Quote: "Yeah, of course he will refuse… Today one reason, tomorrow another reason, etc. We need pressure on him… Putin will stop this war if real pressure is on him."
Background:
- On 14 February, Zelenskyy said proposals that Ukraine withdraw from Donetsk Oblast without a fight are perilous, stressing that Russia's ambitions go beyond the eastern region.
- He also said he hopes the negotiations with the US and Russia on a potential end to the war will not be slowed down by the changes in the Russian negotiating team.
- New talks on ending the war in Ukraine are to be held on 17-18 February in Geneva. Russia is expected to send Vladimir Medinsky, an aide to Putin, to the talks.
- Rustem Umierov, Secretary of Ukraine's National Security and Defence Council, recently announced the names of the delegates Ukraine plans to send to the talks.

Türkiye condemns Israel's land registration move in West Bank
Ankara says Israel has no sovereignty over occupied Palestinian territories, calling decision ‘null and void’
ISTANBUL
Türkiye on Sunday strongly condemned Israel's new decision on land registration in the occupied West Bank, calling it a violation of international law.
Earlier Sunday, the Israeli government approved a proposal to register vast areas of the occupied West Bank as “state property,” the first such measure since Israel occupied the territory in 1967.
Türkiye’s Foreign Ministry said in a statement that the move aims to impose Israel’s “authority over the occupied West Bank and expand settlement activities."
"This step, which seeks to forcibly displace the Palestinian people from their land and accelerate Israel's unlawful annexation efforts, constitutes a clear violation of international law and is null and void," the ministry said.
"Israel has no sovereignty over the occupied Palestinian territories," the ministry added, saying that the expansionist policies pursued by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government undermine peace efforts and damage prospects for a two-state solution.
Türkiye called on the international community to take a firm stance against Israeli attempts to create facts on the ground.
The ministry said Türkiye will continue to support efforts to "establish an independent, sovereign and contiguous" Palestinian state based on the 1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as its capital.
Israeli public broadcaster KAN reported that the proposal was submitted by far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, Justice Minister Yariv Levin, and Defense Minister Israel Katz.
“The initial goal is the gradual settlement of 15% of Area C by 2030,” daily Israel Hayom said ahead of the government decision.
Under the Oslo II Accord signed in 1995, Area A is under full Palestinian control, Area B is under Palestinian civil control and Israeli security control, while Area C, accounting for about 61% of the West Bank, remains under full Israeli control.
The Oslo II Accord limits land registration by the Palestinian Authority to Areas A and B, while prohibiting it in Area C.
The move was part of a series of measures approved by Israel’s Security Cabinet last week aimed at expanding illegal settlement building and increasing Tel Aviv’s control of the occupied West Bank.
According to Israeli media, the measures include repealing a law that barred the sale of land in the West Bank to illegal Israeli settlers, unsealing land ownership records, and shifting authority for building permits in a settlement bloc near Hebron from a Palestinian municipality to Israel’s civil administration.
Israel has intensified operations in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, since launching its military campaign in Gaza on Oct. 8, 2023. Palestinians view the escalation – including killings, arrests, displacement, and settlement expansion – as a step toward formal annexation of the territory.
In a landmark opinion in July 2024, the International Court of Justice declared Israel’s occupation of Palestinian territory illegal and called for the evacuation of all settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem.

'Washington does not need vassals, but strong partners,' Rubio tells Europe

The top US diplomat says Washington wants stronger allies in Europe who take more responsibility, as he met Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico in Bratislava on Sunday. Slovakia is the first stop of his two-nation tour of central Europe, which will also feature a visit to Hungary.
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said America is not asking European allies to be vassals, but they need to be less dependent on Washington. Rubio made the remarks in a joint press conference in Bratislava after holding talks with Slovakian Prime Minister Robert Fico.
Slovakia is the first stop on Rubio's two-state tour of central Europe, which he began on Sunday after attending the Munich Security Conference the last few days.
He is set to travel to Hungary after Slovakia, where he will meet with Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, to discuss bilateral relations and bolster ties with Trump allies in the region.
Both Fico and Orbán are key allies of the Trump administration in Europe, aligning with the anti-immigration policies of Washington and sharing Trump's vision to end the war in Ukraine.
Rubio downplays troop redeployment concerns
Answering a reporter's question, the top US diplomat played down the recent US decision to pull back a limited number of US troops from the continent.
"We're not leaving NATO, we may move a couple of thousand troops from one country to another, but this has always been the case," Rubio told reporters.
"We don't want Europe to be dependent on us, we're not asking Europe to be a vassal of the United States. We want to be your partner. We want to work with Europe. And our point is: the stronger you are, the stronger the members of NATO are, the stronger NATO is."
On Saturday, in his address to the Munich Security Conference, Rubio said the US and Europe share a common destiny but warned that Europe's cultural and economic decline must be reversed and that mass migration must be stopped.
In January, many EU leaders expressed concern that US President Donald Trump's ambitions to seize Greenland could undermine NATO. This week, the EU Defence Commissioner said that Brussels should prepare to replace US troops on the continent.
Rubio refused to discuss in detail his recent negotiations with Denmark about Greenland. He also played down Slovak criticism of the US military raid in Venezuela that led to the arrest of Nicolás Maduro.
In January, Robert Fico said the raid was a violation of sovereignty and international law.
"A lot of countries didn't like what we did in Venezuela. That's okay. That was in our national interest. I'm sure there's something he'll do one day that we don't like, and we'll say, hey, we didn't like what you did. So what? That doesn't mean we're not going to be friends," said the US Secretary of State.
Rubio also stressed that central Europe will be a key region for the incumbent administration's engagement with Europe, during Trump's second presidency.
Fico criticises EU support for Ukraine
Fico and Rubio discussed nuclear and military cooperation and ongoing peace efforts to bring an end to the war in Ukraine, which reaches its fourth anniversary later this month.
The Slovak premier criticised the EU's approach, as it continues to financially and militarily support Ukraine.
Fico recalled that at the December EU summit, Slovakia, Hungary and the Czech Republic abstained when the EU approved a €90 billion support package for Ukraine.
"The EU grants a loan of €90 billion for Ukraine, and €60 billion is spent on weapons, and €30 billion is so that Ukraine can operate on its own," he said.
"I am proud that we did not participate in this at the European Council," Fico added, noting that continuing to financially support Kyiv will only prolong the war and increase the death toll on both sides.
"Do you know what will happen? In December, we will count the next 100,000 dead on the side of Russia and Ukraine. The only result will be that Russia will be deeper into Ukraine," stressed the Slovak leader.
Fico also harshly criticised the European Union's decision to phase out Russian fossil fuel imports by 2027, saying it carries disastrous consequences for his country and others.
"This will create great trouble, as we do not have any LNG terminals."
Fico also discussed Ukraine's EU ambitions and praised Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orbán for speaking clearly about his rejection.
"We say that Ukraine can join the EU on the assumption they will meet all the necessary criteria. We cannot lie now to Serbia, Montenegro or Albania. Those countries are 100 times better prepared for accession than Ukraine," said Fico.
The Slovak premier also slammed Kyiv for weaponising the issue of oil transfers to Hungary and his country for political blackmail.
Rubio to meet Orbán in Hungary
Marco Rubio continues his central European tour in Hungary, where he meets Prime Minister Viktor Orbán.
According to the US State Department, the talks will focus on "the peace process to resolve global conflicts" and on the US-Hungary energy partnership.
Orbán, also an outspoken critic of the European Union and a staunch Trump supporter, was the first European leader to declare his country's membership in Trump's Board of Peace initiative, which many have doubted is an attempt at replacing the UN and its role.
The US late last year gave Hungary a one-year exemption from secondary tariffs targeting countries importing Russian oil.
In December, Hungary signed a deal with the US energy giant, Chevron, to import 2 billion cubic metres of liquefied natural gas (LNG) from Washington.
Trump is also endorsing Prime Minister Orbán in Hungary's general elections, where the incumbent premier faces his most difficult election in mid-April.
The opposition Tisza Party, led by centre-right Péter Magyar, is leading in opinion polls.

Crowds thronged Kathmandu’s Pashupatinath Temple for Shivaratri, where worship, music and a rare legal tolerance of marijuana marked the festival.
Nepal marked Shivaratri on Sunday as crowds filled Kathmandu and queued for hours at Pashupatinath Temple. Tens of thousands came to pray, sing and dance in honour of Shiva. Although marijuana is banned most of the year, police allow limited use during the festival, reflecting Shiva’s long link to cannabis.
Across the Bagmati river, ash-covered holy men and mostly young devotees smoked openly on nearby hills. Visitors also travelled from India to join the rituals.
Nepal outlawed marijuana in 1976, after decades of legal sales, and recent efforts to decriminalise it remain stalled. For one day at least, tradition takes priority over the law.

Spike Lee brings Palestine message to NBA All-Star Weekend
Oscar-winning filmmaker Spike Lee made a clear show of solidarity with Palestine during an NBA game over All-Star Weekend, appearing with a prominent accessory featuring the Palestinian flag.
The acclaimed director - best known for films such as Malcolm X and Da 5 Bloods - was seen courtside at the game in Los Angeles carrying a bag adorned with the Palestinian flag and a traditional keffiyeh. He also wore a hoodie marking US Black History Month.
As one of the most widely watched events in American basketball, NBA All-Star Weekend ensured Lee’s attire drew significant attention, both in the arena and online, highlighting his long-standing advocacy for human rights and the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Gaza.
"Spike Lee with the Palestine flag on All Star weekend that’s that legendary sh*t in a weekend where the league is trying they’re hardest to push Israel" one user wrote on social media platform X.
Others, however, expressed concern that Lee’s visible pro-Palestine stance could prompt repercussions.
"Spike Lee with the Palestine flag and keffiyeh on his bag for All Star Weekend they’re [about to] ban him from ever being courtside again," another user posted.
Lee’s latest symbolic gesture comes amid his continued public support for Palestine.
He has repeatedly used his social media platforms to draw attention to the suffering of Palestinians, particularly in Gaza, since the outbreak of Israel's war in 2023, including sharing images of the Palestinian flag.
The director also served as an executive producer on the Oscar-nominated film The Voice of Hind Rajab, which centres on the killing of five-year-old Gaza resident Hind Rajab by Israeli forces in 2024.
His high-profile appearance at All-Star Weekend follows growing criticism from basketball fans over what they see as a lack of acknowledgement by the NBA’s biggest stars of Israel’s two-year genocidal war on the Strip.
This stands in contrast to prominent athletes in other sports- including footballer Mohamed Salah and NFL player Azeez Al-Shaair- who have spoken out publicly about the conflict.
In December 2023, former NBA player and activist Etan Thomas addressed the issue in an op-ed published on his website, writing that after commenting publicly on Gaza he received "over a dozen messages from different active NBA players and even more from retired NBA players thanking me".
While many NBA stars have remained silent, some players have openly expressed solidarity with Gaza, including WNBA guard Natasha Cloud and NBA star Kyrie Irving.

Trump says Board of Peace members to pledge over $5B for Gaza reconstruction on Thursday
US president announces thousands of personnel also committed to planned international stabilization force, local police in Gaza Strip
ISTANBUL
US President Donald Trump said on Sunday that member states of the new Board of Peace will announce pledges exceeding $5 billion for Gaza's reconstruction and thousands of personnel for a planned international stabilization force during a Thursday gathering in Washington.
"On February 19th, 2026, I will again be joined by Board of Peace members at the Donald J. Trump Institute of Peace in Washington, D.C., where we will announce that member states have pledged more than $5 billion dollars toward the Gaza humanitarian and reconstruction efforts," Trump wrote on his social media platform Truth Social.
Member states have also "committed thousands of personnel to the International Stabilization Force and local police to maintain security and peace for Gazans," he added.
Trump said the Board of Peace "has unlimited potential," recalling that last month "two dozen distinguished founding members" joined him in Davos, Switzerland, to celebrate its formation and "present a bold vision for the civilians in Gaza, and then, ultimately, far beyond Gaza -- world peace."
"The Board of Peace will prove to be the most consequential international body in history, and it is my honor to serve as its chairman," he wrote.
Trump’s words came amid reports that Indonesia is planning to potential deploy up to 8,000 troops to Gaza.
The White House last month announced the formation of a "technocratic" National Committee for the Administration of Gaza to oversee the transition of power as part of Trump's 20-point plan for the war-battered enclave.
A ceasefire agreement ended Israel’s two-year war in Gaza that killed more than 72,000 Palestinians, and destroyed 90% of civilian infrastructure. The UN estimates reconstruction costs at approximately $70 billion.
At least 601 Palestinians have also been killed and over 1,600 others injured in Israeli attacks since the truce, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry.

The top 3 affordable cities for retirement with low-cost, high-quality healthcare access
Award-winning hospitals, affordable healthcare and cost of living are the sweet spot for retirees
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
Medical costs can make up a chunk of retirement expenses - but where a retiree chooses to live can have a significant impact on that spending.
Most adults 65 or older will rely on the government’s Medicare program for health insurance when they retire. On average, a retiree would need up to $428,000 saved to cover Medicare premiums, deductibles and prescription drugs in their golden years, according to a 2025 study from nonpartisan benefits and public policy research firm Employee Benefit Research Institute. Yet, the average retiree has just under $290,000 saved for retirement.
Therefore, finding a city that has affordable and high-quality healthcare is as important as ever for those getting ready to exit the world of work.
The Independent analyzed all 50 states based on three categories: overall cost of living, state Medicare performance and average annual medical expenses.
In the three states that came out on top, these cities beat the national average for cost of living and had hospitals recognized for outstanding care.
Steeltown savings
Pittsburgh’s blue-collar reputation belies the city’s rise over the past decade as a hot spot for culture, according to tourism publication VisitPITTSBURGH. Overall, Pennsylvania offers a solid trio of affordable cost of living, top-20 Medicare performance, and top-15 health cost of living:
- Overall cost of living: No. 25
- Medicare performance: No. 16
- Health cost of living: No. 12
Pittsburgh’s overall cost of living is 2 percent below the national average, according to workplace compensation firm Payscale. Travel + Leisure magazine named it the best city in Pennsylvania for retirement in 2024, and U.S. News & World Report named Pittsburgh among the top-10 places to retire the same year.
“Steeltown’s” University of Pittsburgh Medical Center is home to multiple award-winning hospitals. Magee Women’s Hospital earned a top-100 award for joint replacements from healthcare ranking and reviews site Healthgrades.
Pittsburgh’s UPMC Presbyterian has earned Healthgrade awards for outstanding patient experience (in 2023 and 2024) and ranked among the top 100 hospitals in the country for gastrointestinal and stroke care.
Cornhusker care
Omaha, Nebraska, has an excellent cost of living and Medicare performance that balances out an average health cost of living:
- Cost of living: No. 13
- Medicare performance: No. 15
- Health cost of living: No. 24
The city’s cost of living is 10 percent below the national average, according to Payscale. The city earned a spot in the National Education Association’s 2026 list of 23 affordable retirement spots for educators.
Omaha’s Methodist Hospital has a consistent track record of providing excellent outpatient care, earning Healthgrades’ Outstanding Patient Experience Award in 2023, 2024 and 2025, and winning Healthgrades’ Excellence Award in 2025 and 2026 for its outpatient joint replacements and prostate care.
The city’s CHI Health Lakeside was named to Healthgrades’ 2026 lists of the 250 best hospitals in the country and the 100 best hospitals for critical care.
Healthy hawkeyes
Des Moines, Iowa, offers a strong combination of excellent cost of living and a top-20 rating for Medicare performance and health cost of living:
- Overall cost of living: No. 9
- Medicare performance: No. 18
- Health cost of living: No. 17
The city’s cost of living is 16 percent lower than the national average, according to employment data site Payscale.
The city’s MercyOne Des Moines Medical Center was named to hospital rankings site Healthgrades’ list of America’s 250 best hospitals in 2024 and was among Healthgrades’ top 100 hospitals for coronary intervention in 2026. Additionally, the hospital won a Healthgrades Coronary Intervention Excellence Award in 2025.

Family Guy hits huge milestone tonight: How to watch
Hit animated series will air its 450th episode Sunday night
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
Family Guy is slated to hit a major milestone when it returns to television tonight.
The season 24 premiere of Fox’s hit animated series — airing Sunday night at 9:30 p.m. ET — will also mark its 450th episode.
“Season 24 will continue to push comedy boundaries, providing an unexpected take on current events, pop culture and family itself,” an official description of the premiere episode read. “The season premieres with its landmark 450th episode, when for the first time in the show's history, Lois and Stewie finally understand each other -- thanks to Brian's edibles — and explore and try to explain their complicated relationship.”
“Also this season Peter and the guys get shipwrecked on Fire Island, Chris and Brian perform a lobotomy on a social-media-crazed Stewie, and Lois and Meg take their love for pumpkin spice latte to criminal extremes.”
Created by Seth MacFarlane, Family Guy premiered in 1999 and centers around the Griffin family. In addition to MacFarlane, the cast features the voices of Alex Borstein, Seth Green, Mila Kunis, and Arif Zahir.
The show has a history of controversial jokes and rarely holds back when choosing to mock certain celebrities. Still, it has retained somewhat of a loyal following — enough to keep it on the air for well over two decades.
Taking a look at how the animated series survived 20 seasons in the era of political correctness, The Independent’s Louis Chilton wrote in 2021: “Family Guy’s enduring survival could be down to a gradual maturation in other areas. The animation, a full-blown eyesore in its early days, has improved ten-fold.
“Increasingly, the humor has scaled back the frenzied, puerile cutaway gags, and increasingly takes a more self-aware tone. More risks are taken, too, with its format, such as an entire episode devoted to a fake in-universe DVD commentary, or a triptych emulating the filmmaking aesthetics of Quentin Tarantino, Wes Anderson and Michael Bay.
“This long-term creative stamina is nothing to be scoffed at: by its own 20th season, The Simpsons was over a decade past its peak and had already lost all trace of what made it such a monumental piece of TV. Regardless, Family Guy’s viewing figures have declined substantially over the years, at least on traditional TV. In 2000, and 2002, Family Guy was twice cancelled by Fox for low viewership ratings, before being revived due to high DVD sales and the popularity of Adult Swim re-runs.
“Now, it draws less than half of what it did at its lowest pre-cancellation ebb. Maybe there just aren’t enough people still watching to really cultivate much offence.”
Season 24 of Family Guy premieres February 15 at 9:30 p.m. ET on Fox. Streaming will be available the next day on Hulu.

Renderings show most detailed vision for Trump’s White House ballroom
Unknown

00:38:15 KST

New renderings released this week provide the most detailed vision yet of Donald Trump’s proposed $400m White House ballroom addition.
The renderings, submitted by the project’s architects and released on Friday by the National Capital Planning Commission (NCPC), depict a vast sprawling structure, expected to be around 90,000sq ft, from multiple angles.
In the images, the proposed building stands level with the White House mansion.
The renderings appear in a 28-page document titled “East Wing Modernization” and is dated 11 February. It was submitted ahead of a 5 March NCPC hearing, when board members are scheduled discuss the proposal.
Trump has appointed several allies to the NCPC commission and he has installed loyalists at the Commission of Fine Arts, which is also tasked with reviewing the ballroom plans.
According to CNN, the renderings were removed from the NCPC website shortly after being uploaded on Friday. The commission did not respond to requests for comment from CNN about the removal.
The ballroom project has generated headlines and outcry from the outset. In October, Trump sparked public backlash when he abruptly began demolishing the East Wing, to clear space for his ballroom, before construction plans had been submitted to oversight bodies.
At the time, White House officials said that demolition did not require the commission’s approval, and said that they would present plans for any construction to the proper commissions.
In December, the National Trust for Historic Preservation filed a federal lawsuit, seeking to block the construction of the new ballroom, arguing that the administration violated multiple laws by tearing parts of the White House “without any review whatsoever”.
Also in December, Trump replaced the architect originally selected to design the gilded ballroom, following reports of disagreements. The White House subsequently chose Shalom Baranes Associates to lead the project.
The most recently reported cost estimate for the ballroom stands at $400m. The project is being financed by private donors and large corporations including Meta, Apple, Amazon, Lockheed Martin, Microsoft, Palantir Technologies, Google and Comcast.
Earlier this week, Trump shared two renderings of the ballroom on social media.
“It is on budget, and ahead of schedule!” Trump wrote. “When completed, it will be the finest Ballroom ever built anywhere in the World, one that has been sought by Presidents for over 150 years – and now they are getting THE BEST!”.
“Because of its unprecedented structural, safety, and security features, it will also be used for future Presidential Inaugurations” he added.
In a 5 February memo to the NCPC, Joshua Fisher, director of the White House Office of Administration, defended the administration’s decision to demolish the East Wing.
“Based on analysis, demolition of the existing East Wing structure and reconstruction of a new East Wing provided the most effective solution to many longstanding issues affecting the White House and delivered the best long-term risk reduction” he wrote.
Fisher said that that preservationists from the National Park Service and General Services Administration “advised on and documented the removal of historical elements of the building and oversaw the manner in which the removals took place” and that “significant historical items associated with the buildings have been meticulously preserved”.
Some of the preserved features include the East Wing cornerstone and plaque, movie theater furniture, the East Colonnade columns, interior wood paneling, chandeliers, historic windows and doors, and more, he said.
“Our goal is to ensure that some of these items will be integrated into the new structure” he added.
Fisher also stated that “all heavy equipment has been kept at a safe distance from the White House mansion as based on industry standards to prevent inadvertent damage to the structure” and said that “to date, the government evaluation following the removal of the East Colonnade and the East Wing buildings is that the condition of the east façade of the White House Mansion is excellently preserved.”
Later in the memo, Fisher said that beyond the ballroom, the administration has plans “for beautifying the visitor experience” including in areas such as Lafayette Park, Sherman Park, First Division Park, and the Ellipse, and said that they are also working to establish a “superior, more efficient, White House visitor security screening center”.

Thousands of Western nationals fought Israel’s war on Gaza: What to know
Thousands of Western nationals joined the Israeli military in its genocidal war on Gaza that killed over 72,000 Palestinians.
Thousands of Western nationals joined the Israeli military amid its genocidal war in Gaza, raising questions over international legal accountability for foreign nationals implicated in alleged war crimes against Palestinians.
More than 50,000 soldiers in the Israeli military hold at least one other citizenship, with a majority of them holding US or European passports, information obtained by the Israeli NGO Hatzlacha through Israel’s Freedom of Information Law has revealed.

Since October 7, 2023, Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza has killed at least 72,061 people in military actions that have been dubbed war crimes and crimes against humanity by rights groups.
Rights organisations around the world have been trying to identify and prosecute foreign nationals, many of whom have posted videos of their abuse on social media, for their involvement in war crimes, particularly in Gaza.
So, what does the first such data reveal about the Israeli military? And what could be the legal implications for dual-national soldiers?
Which foreign nationals enlist most in the Israeli military?
At least 12,135 soldiers enlisted in the Israeli military hold United States passports, topping the list by a huge margin. That is in addition to 1,207 soldiers who possess another passport in addition to their US and Israeli ones.
The data – shared with Al Jazeera by Israeli lawyer Elad Man, who serves as the legal counsel for Hatzlacha – shows that 6,127 French nationals serve in the Israeli military.
The Israeli military, which shared such data for the first time, noted that soldiers holding multiple citizenships are counted more than once in the breakdown.
The numbers show service members enlisted in the military as of March 2025, 17 months into Israel’s devastating war in Gaza.
Russia stands at third, with 5,067 nationals serving in the Israeli military, followed by 3,901 Ukrainians and 1,668 Germans.
The data revealed that 1,686 soldiers in the military held dual British-Israeli citizenship, in addition to 383 other soldiers who held another passport in addition to their British and Israeli ones.
South Africa, which brought a case of genocide against Israel at the International Court of Justice (ICJ), also had 589 of its citizens serving in the Israeli military ranks.
Furthermore, 1,686 soldiers hold Brazilian citizenship, 609 Argentine, 505 Canadian, 112 Colombian, and 181 Mexican, in addition to their Israeli nationality.
Israel’s military comprises an estimated 169,000 active personnel and 465,000 reservists – of whom nearly eight percent hold dual or multiple citizenships.
Can dual nationals be tried for war crimes in Gaza?
Ilias Bantekas, a professor of transnational law at Hamad Bin Khalifa University in Qatar, told Al Jazeera that “war crimes incur criminal liability under international law, irrespective of what the law of nationality says”.
Otherwise, Nazi Germans, whose law allowed and obliged them to commit atrocities, would incur no liability, Bantekas added. “Dual nationality is immaterial to criminal liability,” he said.
However, the major issue in prosecuting the accused “is getting [them] on your territory and putting them before a court”, he noted.
Bantekas also added that there is no difference in the question of liability between native soldiers and those of dual nationalities.
Dual nationals, in fact, “may in addition be liable under laws that prevent military service in foreign conflicts or joining armies of other nations”, the professor said.
Prosecuting foreign nationals has been “pretty much the norm”, he noted.
“Think of Nazi Germans tried by Allied war crimes tribunals after World War II, Japanese officers tried by US military courts, and crimes committed during the Bosnian conflict where alleged offenders were tried by various courts in Europe,” Bantekas told Al Jazeera.
Last May, the United Kingdom’s Foreign Office said that allegations of war crimes should be submitted to the Metropolitan Police.
“The UK recognises the right of British dual nationals to serve in the legitimately recognised armed forces of the country of their other nationality,” it said. “Allegations of war crimes should be submitted to the Met Police for investigation.”
Have foreign nationals been tried for Gaza war crimes?
Nationals with dual or multiple citizenships have not yet been arrested for committing war crimes in Gaza. But rights groups, including lawyers, are trying to get them prosecuted.
In the UK last April, the Gaza-based Palestinian Centre for Human Rights (PCHR) and the UK-based Public Interest Law Centre (PILC) filed a 240-page report to the Metropolitan Police.
Accusations against the 10 British individuals, whose names have not been publicly disclosed, include murder, forcible transfer of people, and attacks on humanitarian personnel, between October 2023 and May 2024.
In September last year, a case was filed in Germany against a 25-year-old soldier, born and raised in Munich, for participating in the killing of Palestinian civilians in Gaza, by PCHR, the European Center for Constitutional and Human Rights (ECCHR), Al-Haq, and the Al Mezan Center for Human Rights.
The sniper, with shootings documented near Gaza’s al-Quds and Nasser hospitals between November 2023 and March 2024, was a member of a unit known as “Refaim”, “ghost” in Hebrew.
Legal proceedings against members of the same unit are also under way in France, Italy, South Africa, and Belgium.
The Belgian public prosecutor’s office also opened a judicial investigation last October into a 21-year-old Belgian-Israeli citizen, a member of Refaim.
The mandatory military service law in Israel exempts dual nationals residing abroad, making the enlistment a voluntary act, an important distinction when such crimes are tried in foreign courts. Lawyers have reportedly noted that the voluntary nature of the soldiers’ service makes them more liable for alleged crimes.
What does international law say about soldiers in foreign wars?
South Africa brought its case to the ICJ in December 2023, arguing that Israel’s war in Gaza violates the 1948 United Nations Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide.
While a final ruling could take years, the ICJ issued provisional measures in January 2024 ordering Israel to take steps to prevent acts of genocide in Gaza and to allow unimpeded access for humanitarian aid. But Israel has continued curb the supply of aid into Gaza in violation of the ICJ interim order.
Under the 1948 Genocide Convention, countries that are party to the treaty have a binding obligation to prevent and punish genocide. Countries can investigate and prosecute individuals who may have committed or been complicit in this crime.
In March last year, the International Centre of Justice for Palestinians (ICJP) announced the “Global 195” campaign to hold Israeli and dual-national individuals accountable for war crimes and crimes against humanity in Gaza.
The coalition aims to work simultaneously within multiple jurisdictions to apply for private arrest warrants and initiate legal proceedings against those implicated, including the Israeli military members and the entire Israeli military and political command in its scope.
For countries that are parties to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC), there is an additional layer, where the ICC can assert its jurisdiction. Palestine has been a state party since 2015.
The State of Palestine is recognised as a sovereign nation by 157 of the 193 UN member states, representing 81 percent of the international community. Most recently, it has been recognised by France, Belgium, Canada, Australia, and the UK.
A foreign national, whose country considers Palestine a “friendly state”, would also be vulnerable to prosecution for participating in the Israeli military’s war crimes in Gaza.
How is the Hind Rajab Foundation tracking alleged war criminals?
The Hind Rajab Foundation – named to honour a five-year-old Palestinian girl whose killing by Israeli soldiers on January 29, 2024 became emblematic of Israel’s genocide in Gaza – has been amassing troves of data with identifiable information about Israeli soldiers.
The Belgium-based foundation is the force behind an international effort for accountability over war crimes in Gaza – and has since filed several cases, including a landmark challenge targeting 1,000 Israeli soldiers.
The foundation identified numerous individuals with dual citizenship, including 12 from France, 12 from the US, four from Canada, three from the UK, and two from the Netherlands, in the complaint.
The foundation has scoured TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube, where the Israeli soldiers boast about atrocities in Gaza, to collect information on the soldiers. It has been using those pieces of evidence to pursue the trail of the accused for war crimes.
“We are in possession of many more profiles of dual nationals beyond the 1,000 soldiers named in our complaint to the ICC. We will be pursuing legal action against all of them in the national courts of their respective countries,” the foundation had said in October 2024. “Impunity must end, everywhere.”
The Hind Rajab Foundation says it pursues criminal accountability for Israeli war criminals, from those who planned and ordered operations to those who executed them, including foreign nationals who have participated in or financed these crimes.
Its founder, Dyab Abou Jahjah, was also threatened by Israeli Minister of Diaspora Affairs Amichai Chikli, who told him to “watch your pager” in a post on X, an allusion to deadly attacks on Hezbollah members’ communication systems in September 2024. At least 12 people were killed and more than 3,000 people were wounded when thousands of pagers were detonated by Israeli operatives during those attacks.
In January last year, a complaint filed by the Hind Rajab Foundation led to a Brazilian judge ordering an investigation into an Israeli soldier vacationing in the country. The soldier had to flee, prompting the Israeli military to order all troops who participated in combat to conceal their identities.
“Criminal liability under international law cannot be dissolved by time bars. It extends forever, and no statute of limitations is applicable,” said Bantekas of Hamad Bin Khalifa University.
However, prosecuting Israeli military members “is practically difficult for two reasons”, he said, noting the difficulty of obtaining firsthand evidence and the wariness of national prosecutors who may fear political or other repercussions.
“If public opinion and political opinion in Europe shifts far more in favour of Palestine than it is now, then national prosecutions will feel more at ease to initiate prosecutions,” he told Al Jazeera.

Jonathan Powell rejects overtures to replace McSweeney as Starmer’s chief of staff

Keir Starmer’s national security adviser, Jonathan Powell, has rejected overtures to become the prime minister’s chief of staff after the resignation of Morgan McSweeney, the Guardian has been told.
Powell’s allies say his decision not to take forward discussions about the job – the same role he undertook under Tony Blair’s premiership from 1997 to 2007 – was largely motivated by an intention to return to the mediation consultancy that he set up in 2011, with little interest in returning to a job he has already done.
He is said to be weighing up a departure from Downing Street at the end of the year, which would represent another significant departure from the prime minister’s senior team.
Downing Street sources firmly denied that Powell had any plans to step down, saying he was not leaving Downing Street and would continue as national security adviser. They said any suggestion Powell had been offered the role of chief of staff was untrue.
Powell is credited with playing a key role in shaping Starmer’s policies on the world stage. The prime minister’s efforts to build a relationship with Donald Trump and act as a self-styled bridge between the US and Europe are seen as one of the more successful elements of his tenure at No 10.
In a continued Downing Street clear-out after the controversy over the decision to make Peter Mandelson the ambassador to Washington, it was announced on Thursday that Chris Wormald, the cabinet secretary, was stepping down “by mutual consent” after just over a year in the job.
It is understood that Powell very strongly advised Starmer not to appoint Mandelson as ambassador, an opinion that could emerge in internal government memos due to be published after a Commons vote earlier this month.
Downing Street sources said they would not comment on advice given to the prime minister.
The mass of documentation, which ministers agreed to release after the controversy over Mandelson’s long-term links to the child sex offender and disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein, will be released after sensitive items are filtered by parliament’s intelligence and security committee.
Powell’s recommendation did owe to any special knowledge of Mandelson’s relationship with Epstein but was because he felt from his personal experience during the Blair government that Mandelson courted controversy and would represent trouble for the prime minister.
As Blair’s chief of staff, Powell had to handle two cabinet resignations by Mandelson and on both occasions felt Mandelson did not handle the controversy as well as he could have done. His opposition to Mandelson underlines the extent to which Starmer and McSweeney ignored top-level foreign policy advice from inside No 10 and the Foreign Office over the appointment.
David Lammy, who was foreign secretary at the time of the appointment, has also let it be known that he opposed the plan, but he may have been reflecting a Foreign Office view that such a high-level diplomatic appointment should go to a professional diplomat and not a former Labour minister.
Powell has been regarded as a highly effective national security adviser, acting as a key liaison between No 10 and the European “coalition of the willing” built to support Ukraine. He has also been at the centre of the controversy over the decision to hand the Chagos Islands to Mauritius.
His consultancy, Inter-Mediate, specialises in working behind the scenes to bring together parties in a conflict. Powell always regarded the highly demanding national security job as a fixed-term appointment.
At Inter-Mediate, Powell – considered to have been one of the key architects of the 1999 Good Friday agreement – played a role in supporting negotiations to end the Basque conflict and demobilise the Eta separatist group. In addition, he served as a peace adviser to the former Colombian president Juan Manuel Santos on his Nobel prize-winning settlement with the Farc rebels.
Powell also worked alongside Mozambique’s former president Filipe Nyusi to end the country’s long civil war through a landmark agreement signed in summer 2019.

22 arrested in Bnei Brak riots; female IDF soldiers say they hid in dumpsters

Two female IDF soldiers rescued by police from violent unrest in the ultra-Orthodox city of Bnei Brak said they had asked their commanders not to enter the area but were instructed to proceed.
“We hid inside dumpsters,” one of the soldiers said in testimony. “I wasn’t carrying a weapon, and that’s fortunate, because in any case I wouldn’t have been able to use it against them.”
The unrest erupted after word spread that the soldiers had arrived to distribute military draft notices. The IDF said the soldiers were in fact conducting a welfare visit as part of their duties.
According to one of the soldiers, a woman who saw them entering a building warned them to hide and told them they were not allowed to be there. “I even wore a skirt in advance to avoid this,” she said.
Tel Aviv District Police Commander Haim Sargarof criticized the lack of coordination with the military.
“The army must coordinate entry into the city with us,” he said at the scene. “When they enter without coordinating with us, we are left to respond.”
He said police are using camera footage to identify those involved in the violence. “We have reached the person who set the motorcycle on fire. We need to make the arrests and restore quiet for residents who need to know there will be zero tolerance for disorder,” he said.
Sargarof said there was no immediate expectation of further unrest but that police were prepared for road closures and additional disturbances. “The incident went from zero to 100,” he said. “We are not updated when soldiers enter for activity, it is not coordinated with us, and we are surprised. Had we been informed, we would have escorted and supported them and would not have allowed them to enter the heart of Bnei Brak, the center of the Jerusalem Faction, without accompaniment.”
Police Commissioner Danny Levy said officers would restore order and arrest everyone involved. “In the State of Israel there is law and it must be respected,” he said. “Anyone who raises a hand against soldiers or police officers, or overturns patrol cars, has a personal problem with me and with my organization.”
Police said 22 people were arrested during the unrest. According to a statement, rioters threw stones at officers, overturned a patrol car and set a police motorcycle on fire, along with tefillin that were on it. Two officers were injured. Stun grenades were used to disperse the crowd, and a helicopter was deployed to the area.
Video from the scene showed hundreds of ultra-Orthodox men surrounding the soldiers as garbage bins were overturned and scattered across the street. In one instance, a man pushing a baby stroller was seen walking near officers as stun grenades were thrown, shouting at them to stop.
Police declared a district-wide emergency protocol, mobilizing forces from stations across the Tel Aviv District, and officers extracted the soldiers from the crowd.
IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir condemned the attack. “I view with severity and strongly condemn the attack on IDF soldiers who carried out a military mission earlier today in Bnei Brak,” he said. “Any harm to IDF soldiers by civilians is a serious crossing of a red line and the attackers must be dealt with firmly. I expect the law to be fully enforced.”
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also condemned the violence, calling it the actions of “an extreme minority” that does not represent the broader ultra-Orthodox community. “We will not allow anarchy, and we will not tolerate any harm to IDF servicemembers and security forces personnel who carry out their duties with dedication and determination,” he said.
Chief Rabbi Kalman Meir Bar denounced the violence, saying Jewish law strictly forbids raising a hand against another person and that the Torah’s ways are “ways of pleasantness and peace.”
Opposition leaders also sharply criticized the events. Former Prime Minister Naftali Bennett called the attack “anarchy” and said a “bright red line” had been crossed. He later visited Bnei Brak and said those responsible should be jailed as quickly as possible.
Opposition leader Yair Lapid called for immediate arrests, saying it was unacceptable for soldiers and police officers to be attacked and that those involved “must find themselves in prison today.”

Transcript: House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries on "Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan," Feb. 15, 2025
The following is the transcript of the interview with House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, Democrat of New York, that aired on "Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan" on Feb. 15, 2026.
ED O'KEEFE: We turn now to House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries, who joins us this morning from New York City. Leader Jeffries, thank you for being here.
DEMOCRATIC LEADER HAKEEM JEFFRIES: Good morning. Great to be with you.
ED O'KEEFE: So as this shutdown continues, I want to remind our viewers what it is, exactly, congressional Democrats are seeking to reopen the Department of Homeland Security. You want immigration agents to show IDs, to wear body cameras, take off their masks, stop racial profiling and seek judicial warrants to enter private property. Talks between the White House and congressional Democrats are continuing. Are you willing to compromise, to let any of these go, to get the government reopened?
REP. JEFFRIES: Well, our value proposition is simple, taxpayer dollars should be used to make life more affordable for the American people, not brutalize or kill them, as we horrifically saw in Minneapolis with the cold blooded killings of Rene Nicole Good and Alex Pretti. We know, and the American people clearly know, that ICE is totally out of control and they need to be reined in. Because the American people deserve immigration enforcement that is fair, that is just, and that is humane. And so, we need dramatic change at ICE, including, but not limited to, the types of things that you laid out before any DHS funding bill moves forward.
ED O'KEEFE: With the exception of some flexibility on body cameras, because they're starting to spend some money to get those out there, some Republicans have rejected this list of policy reform proposals. You guys still seem miles apart. So when, conceivably, will we see this resolved? And again, I ask you, if- are there any of these points that you're willing to let go in order to get the government reopened?
REP. JEFFRIES: Well, we're willing to have a good faith conversation about everything, but fundamentally we need change that is dramatic, that is bold, that is meaningful and that is transformational. And these are common sense things. For instance, judicial warrants should be required before ICE agents can storm private property or rip everyday Americans out of their homes. We need to make sure that there are actual independent investigations, so that if state and local laws are violated, in many cases, violently violated, that state and local authorities have the ability to criminally investigate and criminally prosecute anyone who has violated the law. Because we cannot trust Kristi Noem or Pam Bondi to conduct an independent investigation. We believe that sensitive locations should be off limits, sensitive locations like houses of worship, schools, hospitals or polling sites, and that fundamentally ICE should be targeting violent felons who are here unlawfully, as opposed to violently targeting law abiding immigrant families, which is completely inconsistent with what Donald Trump promised the American people he would do.
ED O'KEEFE: Right. And we, of course, this past week reported that about 14% of those detained had violent criminal records. About 60% of them were wanted on criminal records overall. But it was that 14%, violent criminals. Again, I just- it sounds like this is going to go on a while, because Tom Homan wasn't terribly flexible on anything, especially on the issue of warrants and masks. You're not ceding any ground. So there's a few things coming up here. For example, State of the Union is scheduled for a week from Tuesday. Should it be held if the Department of Homeland Security is shut down?
REP. JEFFRIES: Well, we'll cross that bridge when we get to it. It is certainly my hope--
ED O'KEEFE: --Sounds like you're going to get to it, though. I mean--
REP. JEFFRIES:--we can come to a resolution in advance of it. Well, here's the thing, the administration and Republicans have made a clear decision that they would rather shut down FEMA, shut down the Coast Guard and shut down TSA, than enact the type of dramatic reforms necessary so that ICE and other DHS law enforcement agencies are conducting themselves like every other law enforcement professional in the country. For instance, police officers don't use masks. County Sheriffs don't use masks. State troopers don't use masks. Why is it that ICE agents who are untrained, are being unleashed on American communities with this type of lawlessness, violence and brutality. Unacceptable, unconscionable, and it's un-American.
ED O'KEEFE: Yeah, and we went over this with Tom Homan a little earlier. Of course, they point out that assaults against ICE officers have gone up over 1,300% this past year, from about 275 compared to 19 the year before. So there are some legitimate concerns about those agents being targeted, but your broader point about--
REP. JEFFRIES: --We're going to- yeah--
ED O'KEEFE:-- whether or not law enforcement should behave the same as our law enforcement is heard.
REP. JEFFRIES: Yes, and we're going to continue, of course, to encourage the American people to exercise their constitutional rights, their freedom of assembly and their freedom of speech and their freedom of expression peacefully, as we saw overwhelmingly done in Minneapolis.
ED O'KEEFE: All right, well we'll stay tuned on the shutdown and the negotiations. Let me ask you a few other things while we have you. First of all, you're a member of the Gang of Eight who gets briefed on national security matters. The Pentagon is reportedly planning for the possibility of sustained, weeks-long operations against Iran if diplomacy fails and the president opts to attack. What do you know about those plans? Or what would you want to learn as a member of the Gang of Eight?
REP. JEFFRIES: Well, the administration, as has been the case since the very beginning of this presidency, has been slow to provide information both to the Gang of Eight members of Congress, the legislative leadership and the top Democrats and Republicans on the Intel Committee and certainly hasn't provided a significant amount of information to Congress in general. These people within the administration, the extremists, they don't seem to believe that Congress is a separate and co-equal branch of government. We are. In fact, the power to declare war is exclusively given to Congress in Article I of the United States Constitution. Now, the American people want Donald Trump and Republicans to actually keep their promise and focus on driving down the high cost of living and fixing our broken health care system. It was Donald Trump, who promised, in fact, that costs will go down on day one. Costs haven't gone down. We're in the midst of an affordability crisis that hasn't been resolved. Perhaps the president should focus on making life better for the American people. Period. Full stop.
ED O'KEEFE: I hear you on that. I want to remind our viewers of the current tick tock tight margins in the House. You've got to net at least three seats to take the majority at this point. I want to play for you part of what you had to say about the 2026 elections when you were asked this past Thursday. Take a listen.
(BEGIN TAPE)
REP. JEFFRIES: We only need to net three. It's happening. Democrats are going to take back control of the House, and the only question is, what's the margin?
(END TAPE)
ED O'KEEFE: Right now, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee considers 44 of the 435 seats in the House in play, including, you just added five new ones this past week, South Central Virginia, a district in South Carolina, southern Minnesota, central Colorado and the at-large seat in Montana. Parts of the country where Democrats don't normally win elections, we should point out. So if the election were held today, at minimum, at minimum, how many seats do you see Democrats winning?
REP. JEFFRIES: Well, if the election were held today, we're taking back control of the House of Representatives, and I'm not convinced that it would necessarily be close. But these are battles that are going to be waged, district by district by district, we know we're winning seats now in deep red territory. We saw that in Miami in December, where we won the mayor's race for the first time in 30 years by 20 points. And then in January, of course, we flipped a seat in the Texas State Senate that Donald Trump had just won by 17 points. The Democratic candidate won it by 14. That was a 31 point over performance. And then just last weekend in Louisiana, we flipped the House seat that Trump had won by 14. We won that- or 13--
ED O'KEEFE: So you won it–
REP. JEFFRIES: --by 24 points. That was a 37 point over performance. My point is we're winning across the country, in blue states and purple states and red states, because the American people know we're the only ones focused on driving down the high cost of living, fixing our broken health care system and making sure that immigration enforcement is fair and just.
ED O'KEEFE: You've got to get at least three. Twenty to 25 seats, all 44 seats. What do you think right now? Give me a number.
REP. JEFFRIES: Well, I'm not in the prediction business. I'm in the let's win on behalf of the American people so we can end this national nightmare business.
ED O'KEEFE: All right. Leader Jeffries, to be continued on the shutdown and on the midterms. We appreciate you spending some time with us this morning. We'll talk to you soon, and we'll be right back with a lot more Face the Nation. Stay with us.

Canada Begins Payments for New Batch of F-35As to Keep Its Place in Line

Canada has begun making initial payments for long-lead components required to produce 14 additional F-35A fighter jets.
AeroTime reported the move, citing Canada’s Prime Minister Mark Carney.
Together with the first batch of 16 F-35As already under contract, this brings the total number of aircraft in Canada’s production pipeline to 30. Under current plans, the first Canadian F-35As are expected to be delivered in 2026. They will be based in the United States, while Canada prepares the necessary infrastructure domestically.
During this period, Royal Canadian Air Force pilots and technicians will undergo training at U.S. bases. The aircraft are not expected to be stationed in Canada before 2029.
Responding in the House of Commons to Bloc Québécois leader Yves-François Blanchet, who accused the government of inconsistency following Carney’s remarks at the World Economic Forum about strategic autonomy from the United States, the Prime Minister confirmed the payments. He said the step is intended to preserve options rather than serve as final confirmation of the full purchase.
“Yes, the government is paying a small amount to maintain options. It is good for our defense and helps preserve our negotiating position with the Americans,” Carney said.
So-called long-lead funding typically involves pre-ordering components that must be manufactured well before final assembly of the aircraft. This helps maintain production schedules and keeps procurement options open.
The confirmation comes amid a politically sensitive review of Canada’s fighter replacement program. Officials are considering scenarios that could reduce the overall F-35 purchase and potentially introduce a second aircraft type. Saab’s Gripen E is frequently cited as a possible alternative.

US Navy intercepts Iran-linked tanker in high seas operation

ALBAWABA - On Sunday, the U.S. Department of Defense said that American military forces had tracked a sanctioned oil tanker from the Caribbean to the Indian Ocean, where they boarded it. Officials said this was part of a larger effort to stop illegal oil shipments linked to Venezuela.
The Pentagon says that U.S. forces boarded the ship Veronica 3 at night and followed what it called standard procedures for maritime visits, inspections, interdictions, and boarding. Officials said that the tanker tried to avoid being detained by orders from President Donald Trump.
"The vessel tried to defy the detention order, hoping to escape," the Pentagon said in a statement posted on X. It went on to say that U.S. forces followed the tanker as it moved through several maritime zones before intercepting it and stopping it in the Indian Ocean.
For years, the U.S. has put sanctions on Venezuela's oil sector. Allegedly, Venezuela has used a network of ships with fake flags, known as a "shadow fleet," to move crude oil into international markets.
In December, President Trump ordered the detention of sanctioned tankers to put more pressure on Nicolás Maduro, who was then President. Maduro was later arrested in January during a U.S. military operation.
The U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) says that the Veronica 3, which flies the Panamanian flag, is subject to U.S. sanctions because of Iran.
The Pentagon has released video of American soldiers getting on the tanker. But defense officials didn't say for sure if the ship has been formally taken or put under U.S. control. The Pentagon told the Associated Press in a follow-up email that it had no more information than what was already in its public statement.
The interception is part of a larger plan by the U.S. to stop the flow of oil that is not allowed and make enforcement stricter in international waters.

DOJ memo with list of names further muddies water in Epstein case

A Justice Department letter explaining redactions in newly released files tied to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein has put a spotlight on an extensive list of public figures named in the documents, intensifying criticism from lawmakers who say the approach obscures rather than clarifies accountability.
The six-page letter, first reported by Politico and later detailed by The Hill, was sent to the leaders of the Senate and House Judiciary committees as required by law.
It outlines the categories of redactions applied to the Epstein files and includes a compilation of “government officials and politically exposed persons” referenced anywhere in the materials.
According to the Justice Department, the list encompasses individuals mentioned in a wide range of contexts, from direct communications with Epstein or his longtime associate Ghislaine Maxwell to indirect references such as media clippings or third-party reporting.
The letter does not specify how or why each name appears, nor does it distinguish between substantive involvement and incidental mention.
That lack of context has fueled bipartisan frustration. Lawmakers argue that placing well-known figures on a single list – without explanation – risks conflating people connected to criminal conduct with those named only tangentially.
The list includes numerous high-profile names, including President Donald Trump, despite no accompanying details about the nature of their appearance in the files.
Rep. Ro Khanna said the department was “purposefully muddying the waters on who was a predator and who was mentioned in an email,” criticizing the decision to group unrelated figures together without clarification. He urged the department to release the full records while redacting only survivors’ identities.
"To have Janis Joplin, who died when Epstein was 17, in the same list as Larry Nassar, who went to prison for the sexual abuse of hundreds of young women and child pornography, with no clarification of how either was mentioned in the files, is absurd," he added.
He urged officials to "Release the full files. Stop protecting predators. Redact only the survivor's names."
The controversy follows complaints from members of Congress who reviewed unredacted materials at a Justice Department facility this week and said large portions were masked unnecessarily.
Department officials have defended the redactions as necessary to protect victims and sensitive information, while acknowledging that the list was intended to provide transparency about who is referenced in the files.
Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche criticized lawmakers who publicly disclosed some previously concealed names, arguing that doing so “forced the unmasking of completely random people” with no meaningful connection to Epstein or Maxwell. Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon echoed that view, accusing critics of elevating political considerations over due process.
Separately, Rep. Nancy Mace challenged the department’s legal justification for withholding additional details, questioning whether claims of work product privilege would withstand judicial scrutiny.

The findings from five European governments that Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny was killed with poison are “troubling,” U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Sunday.
France, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden and the United Kingdom said on Saturday that Russia poisoned Navalny with a toxin from a poison dart frog, leading to his death in a penal colony two years ago. Moscow dismissed the accusation.
“We obviously are aware of the report. It’s a troubling report. We’re aware of that case of Mr. Navalny and certainly … we don’t have any reason to question it,” news agency Reuters quoted Rubio as telling reporters at a press conference in Slovakia on Sunday.

Türkiye sends drillship to Somalia for first overseas mission
Energy minister calls deployment historic step in offshore push
MERSIN, Türkiye
Türkiye on Sunday dispatched its deep-sea drillship Cagri Bey to Somalia for its first mission abroad, a move Energy and Natural Resources Minister Alparslan Bayraktar called a historic step in the country’s offshore energy drive.
Speaking at a ceremony at Tasucu Port in Mersin, Bayraktar said the vessel is expected to reach Mogadishu in about 45 days and begin drilling in April at the Curad-1 well.
Türkiye and Somalia signed agreements in 2024 covering onshore and offshore oil and gas exploration. The seismic vessel Oruc Reis previously completed surveys in three offshore blocks.
With the addition of Cagri Bey and Yildirim, the number of drillships in Türkiye’s fleet has risen to six, Bayraktar said. Together with the seismic vessels Oruc Reis and Barbaros Hayrettin Pasa, Türkiye now has the world’s fourth-largest offshore exploration fleet, he said.
Since the beginning of the year, Türkiye has signed strategic agreements with US-based ExxonMobil and Chevron and UK-based BP in oil and gas exploration, Bayraktar said. Another overseas offshore partnership agreement with an international company is planned for next week, he added.
Bayraktar said Türkiye aims for its national oil company to reach production of around 500,000 barrels of oil and gas per day by 2028, with a longer-term goal of increasing capacity to 1 million barrels per day.
“I firmly believe that Cagri Bey, which we are assigning to search for oil outside our territorial waters for the first time, will elevate Türkiye-Somalia relations to a higher level,” Bayraktar said, wishing the crew a safe and successful mission.

WASHINGTON, February 15. /TASS/. The United States has intercepted another tanker in the Indian Ocean that was sailing from the Caribbean, the Pentagon said.
"Overnight, U.S. forces conducted a right-of-visit, maritime interdiction and boarding of the Veronica III without incident in the INDOPACOM (the United States Indo-Pacific Command - TASS) area of responsibility," the US Department of War wrote on its X page. "The vessel tried to defy President Trump’s quarantine —hoping to slip away. We tracked it from the Caribbean to the Indian Ocean, closed the distance, and shut it down."
No further details were provided.
On February 9, the Pentagon reported the interception of the Aquila II tanker in the Indian Ocean that was allegedly operating in violation of Washington's sanctions.

The Wall Street Journal has reported that the Pentagon used Anthropic’s AI model, Claude, as part of its operation to capture Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro.
The newspaper cites people familiar with the matter, saying the Department of War leveraged Claude in last month's raid as part of a technology suite provided by Palantir, another American technology company used extensively by the United States government.
Both the Wall Street Journal and Axios report that someone at Anthropic asked someone at Palantir how exactly Claude was used in the operation.
Technology correspondent Peter O'Brien breaks down what it means for the company that positions itself as a champion of AI safety.

Syria heading in 'positive direction,' trajectory must be maintained: US Secretary of State Rubio
'No one here has ever disputed that the challenge of Syria were going to be a very significant one,' says Marco Rubio
ISTANBUL
Syria is moving in a positive direction despite significant challenges, and the current trajectory must be maintained, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Sunday, defending the Trump administration's decision to work with the new administration.
"No one here has ever disputed that the challenge of Syria were going to be a very significant one," Rubio told reporters alongside Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico in Bratislava, the capital of Slovakia. He was addressing Republican congressional concerns about Syrian leader Ahmad al-Sharaa, who took charge after the 2024 ouster of Bashar al-Assad, potentially moving "backwards."
US Special Envoy for Syria Tom Barrack briefed congressional committees last week with transparency about the difficulties involved, Rubio said, adding: "But we think it's headed in a positive direction, even though it's been tested."
"Is it going to be easy? No. Is it going to be difficult? Absolutely. Is it going to have ups and downs and good days and bad days? No doubt about it," he said, noting there have been some difficult days. "We like the trajectory. We have to keep it on that trajectory."
Rubio outlined two options the US administration faced regarding Syria: allowing the country to fragment into chaos with mass migration, terrorism and Iranian influence, or working with Syrian authorities.
"Guess what? We chose number two," he said, arguing the current outcome "is far better than a Syria that would have been broken up ... with all kinds of fighting going on."
He detailed actions taken to prevent ISIS (Daesh) prisoners from escaping, crediting US President Donald Trump's personal engagement with his Syrian counterpart.
Rubio said Trump urged a halt to fighting to enable transfer of thousands of ISIS prisoners who "could have broken out and created havoc and chaos."
"Al-Sharaa did it. He's kept his word up to this point," Rubio said, noting prisoners have been moved to Iraq, preventing them "running crazy all over the place and threatening us in the future."
ISIS detainees had been released by the YPG/SDF terror group from the al-Shaddadi prison in northeastern Hasakah province in January, according to the Syrian Interior Ministry, which held the terror organization responsible. The Syrian government recaptured all prisoners.

Lindsey Vonn is preparing to fly back to the US with more surgeries to come, team official tells AP
The chief of the U.S. Ski Team says Lindsey Vonn is preparing to fly back to her home country a week after her terrifying head-over-heels crash in the Olympic downhill
- Bookmark
Lindsey Vonn was preparing to fly back to her home country on Sunday after her terrifying head-over-heels crash in the Olympic downhill, the U.S. Ski Team's chief told The Associated Press.
Sophie Goldschmidt, president and CEO of the U.S. Ski and Snowboard Association, told the AP the team’s medical staff has been coordinating Vonn’s recovery since the crash and subsequent helicopter evacuation at the Milan Cortina Games and would try to accompany her home. Vonn has had multiple surgeries in Italy to repair a complex tibia fracture in her left leg.
“We’re working through all of that at the moment,” Goldschmidt said. “We’ve got a great team around helping her and she’ll go back to the U.S. for further surgeries.”
Spectators tuning in to see Vonn attempt to win a medal at age 41 with a torn ACL in her left knee and a partial titanium replacement in her right knee were thrown into shock when the American standout got hooked on a gate 13 seconds into her run – resulting in a spinning, air-born crash that sent her careening down the Dolomite mountain.
“The impact, the silence, everyone was just in shock. And you could tell it was a really nasty injury,” said Goldschmidt, who was in attendance for the fall. “There’s a lot of danger in doing all sorts of Alpine sports but it gives more of an appreciation for how superhuman these athletes are.
“I mean putting your body on the line, going at those speeds, the physicality. Sometimes actually on the broadcast it’s really hard to get that across,” Goldschmidt added. “Danger sometimes brings fans in and is pretty captivating. We obviously hope we won’t have injuries like that but it is unfortunately part and parcel of our sports.”
Vonn herself has no regrets.
“When I think back on my crash, I didn’t stand in the starting gate unaware of the potential consequences,” Vonn said in an Instagram post late Saturday. “I knew what I was doing. I chose to take a risk. Every skier in that starting gate took the same risk. Because even if you are the strongest person in the world, the mountain always holds the cards.
“But just because I was ready, that didn’t guarantee me anything. Nothing in life is guaranteed. That’s the gamble of chasing your dreams, you might fall but if you don’t try you’ll never know,” Vonn added.
Goldschmidt visited Vonn at the hospital twice and said, “She’s not in pain. She’s in a stable condition.
“She took an aggressive line and was all in and it was inches off what could have ended up a very different way,” Goldschmidt said. “But what she’s done for our sports and the sport in general, her being a role model, has gone to a whole new level. You learn often more about people during these tough moments than when they’re winning.”

The findings from five European governments that Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny was killed with poison are “troubling,” U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Sunday.
France, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden and the United Kingdom said on Saturday that Russia poisoned Navalny with a toxin from a poison dart frog, leading to his death in a penal colony two years ago. Moscow dismissed the accusation.
“We obviously are aware of the report. It’s a troubling report. We’re aware of that case of Mr. Navalny and certainly … we don’t have any reason to question it,” news agency Reuters quoted Rubio as telling reporters at a press conference in Slovakia on Sunday.

Palestinian actress Hiam Abbass says 'cinema is a political act' after Berlin festival row
The start of this year's Berlin Film Festival was marked by a row over how far film should venture into politics but for prominent French-Palestinian actor Hiam Abbass, "everything we do is a political act".
Abbass is starring in two films being presented at this year's Berlinale festival and in an AFP interview she emphasised the importance of a politically engaged approach to cinema.
At Thursday's opening press conference jury president Wim Wenders sparked controversy by saying "we cannot really enter the field of politics", in response to a question about Germany's support for Gaza.
"I don't agree," Abbass told AFP.
"There's a lack of courage among people in the film world - among some, not all," said Abbass, who gained global attention for her role as Marcia Roy in the hit HBO series Succession.
She recognised that Wenders's remarks were "taken out of context", as he did talk about cinema's capacity to "change the world", albeit in a different way from party politics.
Nevertheless, Abbass said she was glad to see filmmakers at this year's festival "commit to amplifying stories and voices of minorities, oppressed people, people experiencing bombardment, genocides".
"Today more than ever, if we don't tackle these subjects, we're making art for art's sake, and that's something that doesn't interest me."
'Act of resistance'
Abbass, who was born in Nazareth, l but has been living in France for 37 years, stars in two films at the festival with striking political messages.
"In a Whisper" by Tunisian director Leyla Bouzid addresses the issue of LGBTQ life in Tunisia, where same-sex relationships are illegal.
"In some Arab countries, it's really a very sensitive subject and we need to talk about it," says Abbass, while noting that homophobia is by no means confined to that part of the world.
In "Only Rebels Win" by Lebanese filmmaker Danielle Arbid, Abbass plays a Christian Palestinian living in Beirut who faces a backlash from those around her because of her relationship with a South Sudanese Muslim migrant 40 years her junior.
Israeli bombardments between September and November 2024 forced the production to relocate from Beirut to a studio near Paris, where the team deployed creative solutions to recreate the Lebanese capital.
Abbass said the circumstances turned the film into "an act of resistance".
When the bombardment of Beirut began, "I told Danielle: 'Whatever you do, wherever you go, I'll follow you, because this film has to get made'."
Academy's 'open-mindedness'
Before starting on "Only Rebels Win", Abbass had just finished working on "Palestine 36" by Annemarie Jacir, a depiction of the Palestinian uprising against the British Mandate in 1936.
That film almost did not happen because of the war in Gaza, which has killed over 72,000 Palestinians according to the health ministry in the enclave. Israel's military campaign in Gaza has been labelled as genocidal by the UN, experts and several world leaders.
Abbass said that the "the film waited eight months so that it could be shot," with production forced to move to Jordan instead of the Israeli-occupied West Bank.
Abbass said that the team decided that "at a certain point, we couldn't keep being subject to" the decisions of the Israeli government.
She also welcomed the Academy's decision to include three films highlighting the Palestinian experience in its shortlist for best international feature film: "Palestine 36", Kaouther Ben Hania's "The Voice of Hind Rajab" and Cherien Dabis's "All That's Left of You".
Only Kaouther Ben Hania's film ultimately made the final list of five nominees.
But Abbass praised the "open-mindedness" of the Academy to bring these films "almost to the final stages of the Oscars" after Israel's miliary onslaught in Gaza.

Iran’s top general warns Trump new war would be 'lesson'

Iran’s top military commander warned Sunday that any US war against Tehran would serve as “a lesson” for President Donald Trump, as tensions continue to simmer in the region.
Major General Abdolrahim Mousavi, Chief of Staff of the Iranian Armed Forces, said that the US president should understand he would be entering “a lesson-giving battle.”
Trump said on Friday that regime change in Iran “would be the best thing that could happen,” as tensions escalate amid the deployment of a second US aircraft carrier to the Middle East.
He announced that the USS Gerald R. Ford, described as the world’s largest aircraft carrier, would soon head to the region in case ongoing talks between Washington and Tehran fail.
“In case we don’t make a deal, we’ll need it,” he said. “It’ll be leaving very soon.”
Rising tensions
The USS Abraham Lincoln and a fleet of destroyers are already stationed in the Gulf region, having been dispatched last month amid rising tensions between the two countries.
Mousavi described Trump’s comments as “unworthy of a president” and “reckless.”
He said that if Trump intends to wage war, he should not speak of “negotiations,” referring to the ongoing nuclear diplomacy between the two sides that resumed earlier this month.
The latest round of nuclear talks was held in Oman on February 6, more than eight months after the Iran-Israel war put the diplomacy on the backburner.
Diplomatic channels
Türkiye and other regional states recently intervened to help ease tensions and revive the diplomatic channels, particularly after Trump threatened to use military action against Iran.
The next round of talks is scheduled for Tuesday in Geneva, according to Iran’s Deputy Foreign Minister Majid Takht-Ravanchi, who confirmed the meeting in an interview on Sunday.
He said Washington must demonstrate its commitment to reaching an agreement aimed at resolving the nuclear issue.
“The ball is in America’s court,” he said. “If they are sincere, I’m sure we will be on the road to an agreement.”

Iran questions US intentions on war, "Promises the end of US hegemony"

ALBAWABA - The head of Iran's military has given U.S. President Donald Trump a stern warning, saying that any military action against Tehran would hurt Washington's position as the world's most powerful country. Iran is getting ready for another round of talks with the US about nuclear issues in Geneva.
Major General Abdolrahim Mousavi, the head of Iran's armed forces, said that any fight with Iran would teach Trump what he called a "historic lesson." He said that a war would effectively end America's ability to control the world. Mousavi also asked why Trump talks about negotiations if he wants to start a fight.
Doubt About the Geneva Talks
Iranian officials, on the other hand, have lowered expectations for the talks that are coming up. Ebrahim Rezaei, who is on the Iranian Parliament's National Security and Foreign Policy Committee, said that Tehran isn't too hopeful about how the talks in Geneva will go.
Rezaei says that the Iranian delegation has come up with a list of proposals for the talks. He did, however, stress that Iran will not agree to stop enriching uranium during this round or send its stockpile of enriched uranium to other countries. He went on to say that the United States has accepted these limits and made it clear that the talks in Geneva will not be about Iran's missile program or its policies in the region.
Continued Diplomatic Efforts
On Tuesday, Oman will lead talks in Geneva about Iran's nuclear program and other ways to lower tensions. Oman hosted indirect talks between the two sides earlier this month, on February 6. On the same day, President Trump said that more talks would happen "early next week," but he didn't say when or where.
Washington and Israel keep saying that Iran is trying to get nuclear weapons, but Tehran says that its nuclear activities are only for peaceful purposes, like making electricity.
Iran has said many times that it would respond strongly to any military action and that Western sanctions must be lifted in exchange for limits on its nuclear program.

US not planning to leave NATO — Rubio

BRATISLAVA, February 15. /TASS/. The United States is not going to withdraw from NATO, with thousands of American soldiers taking part in the alliance’s mission, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said.
"We're not leaving NATO. We may move a couple thousand troops from one country to another, but this has always been the case," he told a news conference after talks with Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico in Bratislava, when asked to comment on the United States’ status within NATO amid reports on the reduction of US forces deployed to Europe.
According to Rubio, Washington does not view European countries’ bigger influence within NATO as a negative thing and wants to see Europe as a partner rather than its subordinate. "We're not asking Europe to be a vassal of the United States. We want to be your partner. We want to work with Europe. We want to work with our allies. We want to work in cooperation with you," he said.
NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said earlier this week that it would take time to reduce the number of US troops stationed in Europe. In his words, Washington wants to "pivot more towards Asia."
In 2025, the Pentagon redeployed a brigade from the 101st Airborne Division of the US Army from Romania back to its home base in the state of Kentucky.
Late in 2025, the US Congress approved a defense budget that explicitly barred the Pentagon from reducing the number of American troops stationed in Europe below 76,000 for more than 45 days.

BRATISLAVA, February 15. /TASS/. Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico has spoken in favor of dialogue between the West and Russia.
"We must engage in dialogue with Russia. We must engage in dialogue with Russian President Vladimir Putin," he said at a joint news conference with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, as quoted by the TA-3 television channel.
According to Fico, a direct dialogue with the Russian leadership will promote the soonest settlement of the conflict in Ukraine. The crisis could have been ended three months after its outbreak but "some Western politicians" hampered this, he recalled.
He slammed the European Union’s decision to issue a 90-billion-euro loan to Ukraine, with 60 billion of this sum to be spent to purchase weapons. Sanctions, in his words, will not be able to stop the advance of Russian forces. He also said that the European Union is now in a profound crisis.

President Herzog to press for anti-gun legislation, meets with Arab victims of violent crime
Unknown

00:03:42 KST

President Isaac Herzog announced on Sunday that he will press for anti-gun legislation.
Contrary to National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, who advocates that security can be better assured if more civilians have gun permits, Herzog believes that the more guns there are in civilian hands, the greater the security risk.
The president made this point repeatedly on Sunday, when addressing a delegation of bereaved Arab parents, grandparents, siblings, and other relatives whose loved ones were murdered over the past two to three years.
Herzog said that every local authority should make the banning of guns and violence of any kind a top priority. It is a terrible thing, he said, when one human being shoots another for the purpose of killing them.
The delegation, comprising mostly women, included three men and was led by Qasem Awad, a former mayor of Tamra whose son, Dr. Abdullah Awad, was brutally murdered while treating patients at a health clinic in Kfar Yasif.
Awad previously met with Herzog when the president, alarmed by the escalation of violence in Arab society, visited Sakhnin on January 29.
“We Arabs love you because you tell the truth and we need people to listen to you and to listen to us,” Awad told Herzog when they met again on Sunday.
'We are all law-abiding citizens - help us'
Awad reiterated what other prominent Arab citizens have said: they cannot fight this battle alone.
“We need the help of the Jewish people,” the former mayor said, adding that many Jews are already supporting the struggle against violence in the Arab sector.
Speaking primarily of his own family, but also in reference to the families of the delegation, Awad said, “We are all law-abiding citizens. Help us. Tell us what to do.” The meeting as such was extremely emotional as each member of the delegation told the story of a close relative whose needless death had created an extreme void within the family.
One of the most touching of these stories was of a woman whose abusive husband kept telling her that he was going to throw her out. The woman reported him to the police, who took no action. Two days later, she was dead, leaving behind three children aged 15, seven, and nine months. This was one of the rare cases in which the police later apprehended the perpetrator, said the dead woman’s sister, “But now there are three orphans without a mother or a father.”
Herzog was visibly upset by this information, instructing his staff to obtain full details so the story could be widely published.
One of the delegates told Herzog that in Arab society, when a woman is killed, it is usually because she is perceived as having besmirched the family’s honor. Nevertheless, none of the murdered females related to members of that specific delegation were victims of honor killings; none had done anything that could have invited malice or embarrassed their families.
Herzog was asked throughout the morning to help do away with violence. Members of the delegation refused to accept that his position is merely ceremonial and not executive, telling him he has the influence to effect change.
Almost every speaker reported police inaction, saying law enforcement showed little if any interest in any case involving Arab victims, and failed to provide information.
Due to the frequency of violent killings, children panic in fear whenever they hear gunfire, said one of the delegates.
There was also an inference to racism. More than one delegate noted that “Arab blood is no less important than Jewish blood.”
Herzog said that the violence and killing in Arab society are a stain on both the government and the nation. The president pledged to do his utmost to make legislators aware that what has evolved is not just an Arab problem, but a national issue that affects all sectors of Israeli society.

Turkey opens three mosques in Gaza as Ankara expands religious influence

Turkey’s Diyanet Foundation has opened three mosques in Gaza, according to Turkish state-run broadcaster TRT. A video online showed members of the Turkish charity in blue vests assisting in refurbishing and reopening the mosques.
The report said that the work is designed to enable suitable places for worship during Ramadan. This is part of Ankara’s efforts to increase its influence in Gaza.
According to the report, the organization opened the Abdullah Azzam Mosque in the Sabra neighborhood of Gaza, the Huda Mosque in Jabalya’s refugee camp, and the al-Isra Mosque in the Sheikh Radwan neighborhood. These areas were heavily damaged during the Israel-Hamas War.
Regarding the name given to the first mosque listed, Abdullah Yusuf Azzam was an Islamist jihadist of Palestinian and Jordanian background. Although this was not made clear in the broadcast, it appears that the mosque was indeed named after him.
According to a paper by the Institute for National Security Studies at Tel Aviv University, “While al-Qaeda and Hamas have become household terms, far less familiar is the man behind the idea of al-Qaeda, the Palestinian Sheikh Abdullah Yusuf Azzam, who also did much to support the establishment and entrenchment of Hamas.”
A mosque with a similar name is also located in Nuseirat in central Gaza.
The mosques serve as a foundation of 'brotherhood'
The Diyanet Foundation states on its website that it has conducted work on nine mosques in “Palestine,” but does not mention the three most recent ones. The organization said that it works to build mosques that serve as a foundation of “brotherhood.”
It also noted that “today, mosques are rising with the efforts of the Presidency of Religious Affairs and our foundation to deliver the Adhans [the mosque’s calls to prayer] to every corner of our country and every continent of the earth with the donations made by our beloved nation.”
The work is clearly government-backed and part of Ankara’s mission to engage with Islamic communities worldwide.
To this end, Turkey is working to grow its influence in Gaza. One way it does this is via religious charities. The organization noted that the “Diyanet Foundation, which was established to support the activities of the Presidency of Religious Affairs, delivering religious services to a wider audience and raising the next generation who will take part in religious services, has become a significant civil society movement in our country today.”
The foundation has “1,003 branches and a wide range of activities and international aid activities in 149 countries around the world, from education to culture, social and charitable services to supporting religious services.”
Fidan met with Ali Shaath
In another sign of Ankara’s growing involvement, Turkey’s Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan also met with Ali Shaath of the National Committee for the Administration of Gaza (NCAG). This is the technocratic Palestinian organization that the Board of Peace backs to transition governance in Gaza away from Hamas.
In the past, Ankara has hosted Hamas leaders for meetings and backed Hamas. It is unclear whether this meeting represents a change.
Citing diplomatic sources, Turkey’s state-run media reported that Fidan received Shaath in the Turkish capital.
TRT went on to say, “The NCAG, formed after the October ceasefire in Gaza, is a Palestinian governance body under recent peace efforts to oversee Gaza’s civil administration and reconstruction, with Turkey offering diplomatic backing and humanitarian support to help stabilize and rebuild the besieged enclave.”
Further, “The NCAG said on Saturday that preparations for handing over the institutions of the sector pave the way for its management during the transitional phase.”
Per that same report, “Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas called for the removal of obstacles” to the second phase of the Gaza ceasefire deal, and the NCAG “considered that the statements issued from within the sector regarding the readiness to hand over all public institutions pave the way for enabling the committee to fully assume its responsibilities in managing the transitional phase.”
The meeting with Shaath and the support for mosques in Gaza are part of the multi-pronged efforts by Ankara to increase its influence and also maintain its current level of control in Gaza.

IDF links Hamas command activity to Nasser Hospital in southern Gaza

The Nasser Hospital in southern Gaza, which Doctors Without Borders has left, is not just a weapons storage spot for terror, but a full-fledged Hamas headquarters, the IDF said on Sunday.
"For over two years, the IDF and the defense establishment have warned about the cynical use by terrorist organizations in Gaza of hospitals and humanitarian shelters as human shields to conceal terrorist activity," stated the military.
Following the statement made by Doctors Without Borders, "regarding the reduction of its operations due to the presence of armed individuals, the IDF indeed possesses intelligence indicating that Nasser Hospital is being used as a headquarters and military post for senior Hamas commanders and operatives in southern Gaza."
"This is an important decision, but one that comes too late. This is further proof that reinforces the necessity for the disarmament of the Hamas terror organization," concluded the IDF.
Doctors Without Borders (MSF) on Saturday announced the suspension of all noncritical medical operations in Nasser Hospital after reports emerged of armed men using the facility to move weapons and interrogate patients.
“In recent months, in Nasser Hospital in Khan Yunis, patients and MSF personnel have seen armed men, some masked, in different areas of the large compound of the hospital,” the nonprofit organization said in a statement published on its website.
It also specified that these situations occurred in parts of the medical compound where the MSF is not conducting activities.
“With an uptick since the ceasefire, MSF teams have reported a pattern of unacceptable acts – including the presence of armed men, intimidation, arbitrary arrests of patients, and a recent situation of suspicion of movement of weapons,” MSF said, adding that “these incidents pose serious security threats to our teams and patients.”
The organization said that “MSF formally expressed our strong concern to the relevant authorities, and emphasized the incompatibility of such violations with MSF’s medical mission. Hospitals must remain neutral, civilian spaces, free from military presence or activity, to ensure the safe and impartial delivery of medical care.”
According to a Reuters report, this directive was also applied to several other hospitals in southern Gaza where armed men were spotted.
The Post visits Shifa Hospital
In November 2023, The Jerusalem Post visited Shifa Hospital in northern Gaza up close and saw the extensive, heavy, and regular weapons Hamas had been hiding there.
The stash included rocket-propelled grenades, large offensive drones capable of dropping grenades on soldiers, heavy rifles, and other weapons.
In addition, the Post entered the tunnel network Hamas had been using under Shifa Hospital, which included extensive rooms for various functions and branched in multiple directions to connect the area to other parts of northern Gaza and southern Gaza.

United States Secretary of State Marco Rubio called "troubling" a report by five European allies blaming Russia for killing late Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny using toxin from poison dart frogs, adding that Washington had no reason to question it on Sunday.
"We obviously are aware of the report. It's a troubling report. We're aware of that case of Mr. Navalny and certainly... we don't have any reason to question it," Rubio told reporters at a news conference in Brastislava during a visit to Slovakia.
In a joint statement, Britain, France, Germany, Sweden, and the Netherlands on Saturday said analyses of samples from Navalny's body "conclusively" confirmed the presence of epibatidine, a toxin found in poison dart frogs in South America and not found naturally in Russia.
Russia decries 'Western propaganda hoax'
The Russian government, which has repeatedly denied any responsibility for Navalny's death while he was held in an Arctic penal colony two years ago, dismissed the latest allegations as "a Western propaganda hoax," according to Russia's state news agency TASS.
When asked why the United States did not join the statement, Rubio said this was an endeavor by them.
"Those countries came to that conclusion. They coordinated that. We chose - Doesn't mean we disagree with the outcome. We just, it wasn't our endeavor. Sometimes countries go out and do their thing with based on the intelligence they've gathered." Rubio said.
"We're not disputing or getting into a fight with these countries over it. But it was their report, and they put that out there," he added.
Russian opposition leader Navalny died in an Arctic prison colony in February 2024, after being convicted of extremism and other charges, all of which he denied.

MSC: With Iran in crisis, is Europe just a spectator?
February 15, 2026Ongoing tensions in Iran featured prominently at this year's Munich Security Conference (MSC), coming after the Islamist regime's deadly crackdown on protesters, and with US President Donald Trump continuing to put pressure on Tehran to end its nuclear program.
As Iran's hardline rulers hang on to power after the largest anti-regime protests in decades, Reza Pahlavi, the son of the late Iranian king and a political activist-in-exile, was active at the conference, pleading his case for regime change in Iran.
At a panel about Iran's future on Friday, as well as at a press conference on Saturday, Pahlavi called out the Iranian regime's suppression of human rights, especially the brutal crackdown on citizens during the anti-regime protests in January, which rights groups say killed thousands of people.
Pahlavi, who many Iranians think can unite the nation against 86-year-old Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei's government, even presented a roadmap at the MSC for Iran's political future and a "transitional government."
After a call to action from Pahlavi, some 250,000 people took part in a demonstration in Munich on Saturday against the Iranian regime and in support of a Pahlavi-led opposition.
"I am here to guarantee a transition to a secular democratic future," he said in a speech during the rally.
"I am committed to be the leader of transition for you so we can one day have the final opportunity to decide the fate of our country through a democratic, transparent process to the ballot box."
But the creation of any transitional government depends on the collapse of the current regime.
Despite the current unprecedented challenges to its power, the regime is carrying on and has also reportedly intensified its domestic oppression.
Still, there were extensive discussions at the MSC about the possibility of regime change in Iran.
Will the US strike Iran?
The Iranian opposition-in-exile has signaled that it expects the United States to launch strikes that would eventually result in the dismantling of the fundamentalist regime.
During the anti-regime protests, US President Donald Trump famously claimed that help was coming for Iranians.
Now the Trump administration is engaged in negotiations with Tehran over its nuclear program, something which analysts say is unlikely to yield a clear result.
"I think a lot of Iranians inside and outside hope that an intervention that will neutralize the regime's instrument of repression will finally give us an opportunity for a final solution," Pahlavi said at an MSC panel, arguing that he was asking for a "humanitarian intervention" to prevent more innocent lives being killed in the process.
After Trump stepped back from threats of military intervention over protest deaths, he returned to threats of force if the Iranian regime did not negotiate a new "deal" with the US on its nuclear program.
Last week, the US sent a second aircraft carrier strike group to the Arabian Sea, with Trump warning on Friday that it would be a "very bad day" for Iran if the regime does not make a deal.
Pahlavi admitted that the US president needs to give diplomacy a chance before opting for a military solution. He maintains that President Trump knows the Iranian people still believe in the president's promise made during the height of the demonstrations in January.
However, Karim Sadjadpour, a policy analyst at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said regime change is easier said than done.
"Everybody in Washington, including President Trump, thinks that if they could push a button and get rid of the Iranian regime, they absolutely would," he told an MSC panel, adding that the Trump administration is possibly concerned about fallout such as that seen after US military intervention in Iraq and Libya.
However, Sadjadpour didn't rule out the possibility of a US strike on Iran.
"In 2018, Trump left the [2015] nuclear deal. In 2020, he assassinated Qassem Soleimani [military leader and Khamenei's close aide]. Last summer, he dropped 14 bunker-busters on Iran's nuclear facilities," Sadjadpour said, adding he believes that the chances of Trump striking Iran are higher than the two sides reaching a nuclear deal.
Europe prefers diplomacy to force
As the US continues to put pressure on the Iranian regime with the threat of force, the EU has urged deescalation, and has shown preference towards using sanctions and offering support for civil society within Iran.
In January, when the Trump administration seemed close to striking Iran, German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius told a press conference alongside EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas that the Iranian people "don't want regime change forced by external powers" and warned of unforeseen consequences.
Kallas said history is "full of examples" where regimes have been toppled, "but the question is what comes after."
"You need the alternatives, really from inside, to have a functioning state."
For Iran's exiled crown prince Pahlavi, the Europeans holding off on endorsing US military action against the regime could be seen as equivalent to doing nothing to help force the regime out.
Although Europe plays a major role in sanctioning Iran over its nuclear program, should the US strike the regime, statements at the MSC offered no clarity on what stance Europe would take, as officials have continued to emphasize diplomacy over use of force.
In 2015, major European powers helped broker a landmark agreement aimed at limiting Iran's nuclear program, particularly uranium enrichment, in exchange for lifting economic sanctions.
The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) was signed in July 2015 between Iran and the P5+1 countries (US, UK, France, China, Russia, plus Germany).
It was dubbed as "horrible" and "one sided" by Trump, who pulled the US out of the deal in 2018 during his first term as president, much to the consternation of Washington's European partners.
As Trump pushes for a new nuclear deal with Iran, with a military option on the table, the Europeans may be forced to wait and see.
"The starting point must be the Iranian people demanding freedom, and Europe must align its actions with that reality," said European Parliament President Roberta Metsola at the MSC.
She argued that the EU's decision to designate Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) as a terrorist organization marks a turning point, adding that the time for "routine diplomacy" was over.
"Europe must send a clear signal to those risking their lives in protest: We stand with you," she stressed.
No more business as usual with Iran?
Last year, Europe also reimposed UN sanctions on Iran, citing Tehran's violations of the 2015 JCPOA nuclear agreement, piling more financial pressure on the regime. The protests in January were partly driven by economic grievances including high unemployment and inflation.
Rafael Grossi, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), has admitted that business as usual with Iran might not be possible anymore. After the US strike on Iranian nuclear facilities in July 2025, Tehran stopped cooperating with the IAEA.
"This cannot go on forever. There is a political situation here … on our part, we have been making some progress, but these [nuclear] facilities are there, nuclear material is there — notably highly enriched uranium, which we must continue to monitor. So everything goes in parallel," Grossi underlined.
Another round of nuclear talks between US and Iranian representatives is due in Geneva next week with Oman again serving as mediator.

Jess Phillips calls for Epstein files to be catalyst for long-term legislative change

Institutions can be persuaded to take action on violence against women and girls only when some sort of “calamity” or “political scandal” hits the headlines, Jess Phillips has said.
Phillips, the minister for safeguarding and violence against women and girls, said she wanted to use the momentum from the Jeffrey Epstein files to push for long-term legislative change and greater support for survivors, rather than quick-fix reactive policy announcements.
Writing for the Guardian, the Labour MP for Birmingham Yardley said: “If repentance and sorrow is all we achieve out of the courage of the Epstein victims, we will have failed. Change is all that will suffice.
“The long-term strategy of the government must be exactly that – long term. I am proud of the challenge we have tried to rise to, of the [violence against women and girls] strategy with investment and system change at its heart, but we mustn’t let even that stand still, it must stretch when ambitions are met and it must never only be pulled out and waved around or cared about when it is politically expedient to do so. Epstein’s victims deserve better.”
She said she felt “weary, tired and frankly downright furious that women and children must wait for a crisis to get progress”, and criticised an attitude of “bleed first and act second”.
Phillips said Epstein’s victims deserved for the government ensure that “those who abused them are actually held accountable so they can’t do it again”. She called for investment in prevention so there was “less likely to be a future Epstein in a UK classroom today”.
“I have worked on this issue under many governments, it always felt a bit one-tone, and investment in prevention has never been made. We had to change that, we had to write a strategy that would actually deliver on our commitment to halve violence against women and children,” she wrote.
There needed to be more than a “commitment” and instead an aim that was “actually achievable and practically measurable” in order to hold the government to account and create a sense of focus, she added.
To achieve this, Phillips suggested that the NHS should prioritise abuse in the same way as diabetes; schools should be given tools to deal with how abuses affect their pupils to prevent them growing up as perpetrators of abuse or survivors; and addressing the £13bn lost annually in economic output to domestic abuse should be considered as a key component of improving economic growth and productivity.
On the BBC’s Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme, Yvette Cooper, the foreign secretary, said halving violence against women and girls over the next 10 years was “a priority and a mission” for Labour and across government departments.
“The real focus should be on Epstein’s victims, and also the work that this Labour government has been doing to tackle violence against women and girls,” Cooper said. “So that has to be about listening to women. It also has to be listening to survivors of violence.”

It always takes a calamity – a dreadful murder that reaches every front page, a mass paedophile ring being uncovered, or a political scandal unfolding – to make institutions sit up and act on violence against women and children. These windows of potential energy are never wasted by women’s rights activists. Historically, they have used them to build the #MeToo movement, to fight for legislation change and to push for greater resources for victims.
I’ve done it, many times – “never waste a crisis” is my mantra. In the past few weeks, while the nation’s attention has been on the political fallout from the Epstein files, I have seen the opportunity to push for more, for better. To move beyond the throwaway line about the victims being the most important thing – and to actually make them just that. Deeds not words are what matter. If repentance and sorrow is all we achieve out of the courage of the Epstein victims, we will have failed; change is all that will suffice.
That said, I am weary, tired and frankly downright furious that women and children must wait for a crisis to get progress. I wish that systems and institutions didn’t need us to bleed first and act second. Women ask for this at times of calm, we shouldn’t have to scream.
When we were writing Labour’s violence against women and girls strategy, this was always at the forefront of my mind. The fact that we couldn’t once again just have some nice prepackaged policy that we could pull off a shelf when the going got tough. It had to be long-term, systemic change in our police, in our courts, in our health services, our armed forces, our housing, our schools. We had to start really focusing on preventing the terrible harm from happening in the first place, not just trying to make nicer plasters to cover up the cuts and bruises. We had to get other government departments to realise that the safety, security and wellbeing of half the population wasn’t just a Home Office issue.
I have worked on this issue under many governments – it always felt a bit one note, and investment in prevention has never been made. We had to change that, we had to write a strategy that would actually deliver on our commitment to halve violence against women and children. Of course, I want to end all violence against women and girls, just like I want world peace, but committing to that would be nothing more than a throwaway line, an aspiration, a pipe dream. Our aim had to be actually achievable and practically measurable.
No UK government has ever dared or cared to put a number on the problem before, because this issue has always been seen as too big to deal with or too likely to fail. Our target of halving violence against women and girls within a decade matters to me – it holds us to account, it focuses the minds of those with levers of power and demands that they pull them. Long-term, persistent, consistent, backaching and heartbreaking work is the only thing that is even going to remotely shift the dial on this issue.
The NHS has to take responsibility for the consequences of this abuse just as it would with diabetes. Schools must be given the tools to deal with how these incidents affect their pupils. If children grow up to be perpetrators of abuse or end up as victims, that will ruin their life chances and ability to function in the workplace more completely than not being good at maths. It’s no good having an engineering degree if you end up on the sex offender register – and the growing number of young people becoming perpetrators of these crimes should frighten us all.
Want to tackle growth and productivity? Well, the annual socioeconomic cost for domestic abuse alone is estimated to be £89bn, without even including, rape, sexual harassment, stalking and other abuses. I could go on and cover every area of policy in every government department that would fail if it didn’t stop and think about how this issue will undermine its progress. This is what this government is seeking to do, to really change this thing once and for all – to change the system, not just react.
Epstein’s victims don’t just need me to make sure no UK airport could ever be used to traffic them again. That loophole has been closed, and we will, of course, close any others we need to – but that isn’t enough. They need me to make sure that those who abused them are actually held accountable so they can’t do it again. They need me to make it so there is less likely to be a future Epstein in a UK classroom today; they need me to make sure legislation stops abusers who use naked images and online hideaways to groom them in the first place. They need me to make sure that when they say that they have suffered, not only do they have recourse in the law – but also that their mental health is cared for with therapeutic and social support so that they can recover and live prosperous lives.
I will use the momentum of the current political attention on this subject to get more; I always do and always will. It’s how I have been trained to operate over decades, like the scrappy kid at the dinner table of a large family that I am. But I am damned if I will let these pinch-point moments be the only time those calls are heard. The long-term strategy of the government must be exactly that – long term.
I am proud of the challenge we have tried to rise to, of the strategy with investment and system change at its heart; but even that we must stretch to meet our ambitions, and it must never only be cared about when it is politically expedient to do so. Epstein’s victims deserve better.

‘I was so scared’: US trial witnesses allege Alexander brothers worked together to rape women
Unknown

In their time as real estate brokers, the Israeli-American Alexander brothers – twins Alon and Oren and older brother Tal – were known as “closers”, the salesmen who could a get a sale over finish line, often to wealthy hedge funders who were then making hay in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis.
Their technique, one real estate expert explained outside the 26th floor of the federal court house in lower Manhattan last week, was based on the sense that the property salesmen “were just like their clients” – young, eager and successful. Kim Kardashian and then-husband Kanye West, Jared and Ivanka Trump were clients.
And like many, they were party animals. Nightclubs in Manhattan, the Hamptons, Miami, Aspen, Tulum and Ibiza were seasonal stops. Tal and Oren, 38, were profiled in the New York Times on “How Two Luxury Real Estate Agents Spend Their Sundays”. The Wall Street Journal followed on the family’s $31m sale of their Miami beach home. US Vogue featured Oren’s wedding to a Brazilian model.
But a far nastier picture of their high life has been on display in court for the past few weeks, where the three brothers are on trial for sex trafficking. Prosecutors have accused each of the three brothers of violent, forcible rape of at least 10 women each and in some cases of threatening them if they spoke of their experiences.
The accomplished real estate “closers”, according to prosecutors, took no chances when it came to their pursuit of sex, and worked together in a conspiracy to lure, incapacitate and attack women.
The three brothers have pleaded not guilty and deny the allegations.
The civil case against Oren and his twin began in March 2024 when they were sued by Kate Whiteman, a woman who said she had met at a Manhattan nightclub in 2012. She claimed they had forced her into an SUV as she was leaving and drove her to the Hamptons, where she was assaulted at a party mansion called Sir Ivan’s Castle. A flood of similar allegations followed.
But Whiteman is not in court to testify. It was reported last month that she was found dead near Sydney late last year. Authorities in New South Wales have said the circumstances of Whiteman’s death “were found to be non-suspicious”.
As the trial entered its third week, the court heard from Abusshan Bodjnoud, a woman who testified that she witnessed an unidentified woman being raped by Tal, 39, and one of the twins in the Hamptons in May 2009. Bodjnoud told jurors she was in the house when a party of men returned and she saw Tal “dragging” a woman who “was not walking on her own” to the pool.
“Then the next thing I heard was a woman screaming and just asking people to stop,” she testified. She said she witnessed Tal and the twin “moaning” as they raped the woman in the hot tub.
Bodjnoud, who said she was “terrified” to intervene, said she had written “rapist” and “you need to apologize” on the brothers’ door before she left the house but acknowledged she had not called 911 and was warned that the Alexander brothers “were very powerful”.
A day earlier, jurors were shown text exchanges the government says showed that the brothers coordinated to secure drugs – including ketamine, Xanax, Ambien and GHB – they allegedly used to incapacitate women lured with the promise of luxury travel and exclusive experiences.
In one exchange from September 2011, Alon texted about an upcoming party, telling the recipient to “throw some panty dropper pills in the dishes sent to our table”. Attorneys for the defendants have described some of the references as “crude jokes.”
Maylen Gehret, who is suing Alon and Oren for sexual assault, told the court that Alon raped her in Aspen, Colorado, in 2017 when she was 17. She said she was at a club with two friends when Alon gave her a vodka cranberry. After a second drink, her head began to feel “really heavy” and she could “barely hold it up”.
The twin then allegedly took the girls to an empty hotel room and raped her in the bathroom. “It really hurt, and I was so scared,” Gehret testified.
During the prosecution phase of the case, other accounts have followed a similar path. But when the defense takes its turn, attorneys are set to argue that both the civil lawsuits and criminal allegations against the brothers are an intertwined conspiracy led by women seeking to extort them.
Outside court last week, their father Shlomi Alexander, who emigrated from Israel to the US to start a successful security company before branching into Miami real estate, claimed the cases had begun with a $35m effort to extort him.
Under cross-examination, defense attorneys have pressed witnesses on changes to their testimony, timelines, and claimed that prior statements don’t align with what the jury heard. Juda Engelmayer, a crisis PR consultant for the defendants, said the challenges to witnesses rarely make the headlines.
“The coverage often highlights the most sensational passages from direct, or the one line on cross where a witness confidently insists they ‘remember’ the single detail anchoring the allegation, while leaving out the broader credibility challenges unfolding in real time”, Engelmayer said.
In opening arguments last month, defense attorney Teny Geragos said the brothers were successful, arrogant young men “who liked and pursued women”, adding “that’s not trafficking. That’s dating. That’s hooking up.”
But she acknowledged the jury may frown upon their lifestyle and vulgar communications. “Two things can be true at once – you can disapprove of their lifestyle and still find them not guilty”, Geragos said before a courtroom packed with family and supporters of the brothers.

Progressive Texas organizers hail shock win as far-right Republicans left reeling

Chris Tackett started tracking extremism in Texas politics about a decade ago, whenever his schedule as a Little League coach and school board member would allow. At the time, he lived in Granbury, 40 minutes west of Fort Worth. He’d noticed that a local member of the state legislature, Mike Lang, had become a vocal advocate for using public money for private schools – despite the fact that Lang campaigned as a supporter of public education.
With a little research, Tackett found that Lang had received hundreds of thousands of dollars in campaign donations from the Wilks brothers and Tim Dunn, billionaire megadonors whose deep pockets and Christian nationalist views have consumed the Texas GOP. Tackett published his findings on social media, and soon enough, people started asking him to create pie charts of their representatives’ campaign funds. These charts evolved into the organisation See It. Name It. Fight It.
“There’s so many people out there that are so busy with their daily lives, they’re walking past and not even seeing some of these bad things going on,” he says. “So that’s the first step: you have to see this thing.”
Tackett and his wife Mendi, the organisation’s sole members, now live in Fort Worth, where they’re part of a scrappy community of progressives and anti-extremist organizers who are building momentum amid their town’s deeply embedded Christian nationalism. Tarrant county, in which Fort Worth is the largest city, provided a chilling preview of Texas’s gerrymandering efforts, and the county is widely regarded as a hotbed for far-right actors. But most recently, the county was the site of a Democratic victory that sent the Texas Republican party reeling.
Taylor Rehmet, a Democrat and local union leader, won a runoff for a state Senate seat that’s been held by Republicans since 1992. What’s more, he bested Republican Leigh Wambsganss despite having one-tenth as much money. Much of Wambsganss’s funding came from Dunn and the Wilks brothers.
Republicans blamed low turnout for Rehmet’s victory, while pundits opined that the Trump administration’s unpopularity was to blame. But people in Fort Worth say local organizing was central to the upset – and it will be key to any future victories in Texas, too.
Alexander Montalvo, a longtime grassroots organizer in Tarrant county, points to several examples where local advocates have successfully rallied for causes they believe. There was the pushback against a proposal to split a local school district. Then there were the school board elections last May, where every candidate endorsed by the Christian nationalist cellphone carrier Patriot Mobile lost their election. Patriot Mobile – where Wambsganss works as an executive – had previously racked up several wins across Tarrant county, effectively taking over multiple boards.
Now, after those May losses and Rehmet’s win, the company’s political influence is in doubt.
“There is something very local here in Tarrant county that is happening and that has been happening,” he says. “There is a collective groundswell that’s been building.”
Tackett says he’s in close contact with organizers like Montalvo and other Tarrant County residents who meet up for what’s called the “817 Gather”: a monthly meeting of people activated by the extremism that’s run rampant in their area.
“It’s a bunch of folks that are Black, brown, white, mostly progressive, but we’ve got a few folks that play into that former Republican space, as well,” he says. “It’s not about Republican versus Democrat. It’s really all about what we stand for, because we can agree that public education is foundational to the success of our democracy. We can agree that a person should have rights over their own body, and it should be easier to vote, not harder to vote.”
People have found their roles within this community, and in one way or another, their efforts always lead back to voting. Montalvo and fellow organizer EJ Carrion, one of the hosts of the local podcast the 817 Pod, frequently inspire large crowds for local city council and county commissioner meetings. The Tacketts publish social media videos spotlighting their concerned neighbors – often as they speak at those local meetings – and putting local extremists on display.
Before Rehmet’s victory, their organisation shared a video of Wambsganss appearing on the podcast of former Trump consigliere Steve Bannon. After the election, the Tacketts published a video breaking down how local Republicans reacted to the Rehmet victory at a meeting held the day after Rehmet’s win.
In the video, a candidate for Texas agriculture commissioner claimed Texas was at risk of falling under Sharia law. Others framed politics as a spiritual battle that will determine whether the US remains a Christian nation. That meeting was hosted by For Liberty & Justice, a local political organisation affiliated with a Fort Worth church called Mercy Culture which is seeking actively encourage conservative Christians to run for office and break down barriers between church and state in the US.
When it comes to Christian nationalism in Tarrant County, multiple people interviewed for this story say no institution looms larger than Mercy Culture.
“Mercy Culture is not just a church,” says Wesley Kirk, a lifelong Fort Worthian and one of the hosts of the 817 Pod. “It’s a political machine. They are organizing people. They are endorsing candidates.”
Chanin Scanlon, a former Fort Worth resident who recently moved to San Antonio, puts it bluntly.
“This is Christian nationalism,” she says. “It’s not subtle. They are very clear about what they want. They want to take over institutions.”
The Tacketts have used their popular social media presence to chronicle Mercy Culture’s rising influence. But Chris Tackett is also still making pie charts. After the Rehmet victory, he dove deep into the data to see if the narrative about low turnout was true. Turnout was down across the board, he found, which undermined the local GOP’s narrative that Republicans who stayed home were the ones to blame.
Using a voter score analysis, Tackett also found that 57% of runoff voters fell into one of two groups: true independents, or “Democratic-leaning voters who regularly vote in Republican primaries because, in ‘deep-red’ Texas, the GOP primary is the only election that matters in most cycles.” (Fifty-seven percent is the total percentage of the electorate that Rehmet won.)
“What we saw wasn’t massive Republican crossover,” he wrote. “It was Democrats – many of whom have been forced to play in GOP primaries for years – finally getting a meaningful choice and showing up.”
Brandon Rottinghaus, a political science professor, agrees with the idea that Democrats had a strong candidate to back in the runoff.
“I think they figured out the secret sauce to candidate recruitment,” he says of the Democratic party. “Being an authentic person goes a long way for voters these days.”
Montalvo, meanwhile, finds himself motivated by Tackett’s pie chart.
“There’s actually a big enough and a diverse enough base amongst Democratic voters in Tarrant county that if we actually invest in those communities, we have the votes to be able to win,” he says.

Even amid rising economic uncertainty, now is not the time to hug your job

After all the employee protests over the past few years – the “great resignations”, the “quiet quittings”, the “bare-minimum Mondays” and “coffee badgings” – we have finally arrived at “job hugging”.
Amid all the economic uncertainty and the rising costs of everything, people aren’t feeling as confident as they once were. Instead of slacking off while you hunt for something better, everyone’s scared about losing their jobs. With all the news about big corporate layoffs and the ominous and still-undefined threat of AI, it’s understandable that people are hugging their jobs.
A recent report from job search site Monster.com found that nearly half of employed workers say they’re currently staying in their roles longer than they otherwise might, for comfort, security or stability, with three-quarters expecting to remain in the same job for at least two more years.
“Workers are holding on tighter than ever, but not because they’re complacent,” said Vicki Salemi, a career expert at Monster. “It’s because they’re cautious. Job security and stability have become emotional safety nets. The new loyalty is about survival, not necessarily satisfaction.”
If you’re one of these job huggers, then take it from me: you’re killing your future.
I’m not saying you should leave your current job. If you really like the company you’re working at and the work that you’re doing and the people you’re working with, then good for you. But don’t just hug your job. Because – unless what you do doesn’t involve a computer – your job isn’t going to be the same in a very short period of time. It may not even exist at all. Tech companies are rolling out AI-based agents, bots and software that will – in the not-too-distant future – do everything from write press releases, answer customer questions, place orders and reconcile bank accounts. Hugging your existing job is like hugging your sick dog who’s about to be put down. There is no miracle that’s going to save either.
The good news is that your employer is just as confused as you. I’d love to make time stand still. But I see big changes coming for my business too, and I don’t have all the answers. My business depends on my people. I want them to come to me with solutions. I want them to have my back just as much they want me to have theirs. Hugging their existing job may prove their loyalty. But it’s not helping my business. I know that my business will have to adapt to the technology wave that’s fast coming. I’ll be loyal to any worker who is willing to step up and adapt along with me.
Which is why a job hugger hurts employers like me. People are so concerned about losing their job that they only think about what they can do for themselves and not my company. They make decisions to protect what they do. They don’t take risks. They avoid additional work. They are averse to taking chances. They’ll shun responsibility. This can only last for so long.
Business owners like myself are never “hugging” our jobs. We’re constantly looking for new ways to make money. Or cut costs. Or run more efficiently. Job hugging is a form of suicide. If we stay still, we die. It’s no different if you’re an employee.
If you’re not a big fan of the company, don’t just sit there. Look for something else while you still have your existing job. You’re much more marketable (and have a stronger negotiating position) when you’re still employed.
It may seem that clinging to stability is the safe way to go. But it’s a perilous long-term strategy. You’re not learning new skills. You’re not adapting. You’re not taking strategic risks. Job hugging is a losing strategy. Now is not the time to stand still.

Who truly benefits from the delay with Iran?

The standoff with the Islamic Republic of Iran has entered its sixth consecutive week of escalating rhetoric, mutual threats and visible shows of force. The US has continued what officials describe as an unprecedented military buildup in the region, led by the deployment of the world's largest aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald R. Ford. The move is expected to last at least three weeks.
Iran, for its part, has pressed ahead with propaganda videos and public displays of its military capabilities. At the same time, indirect negotiations are ostensarily underway, with a second round set to take place in Switzerland in midweek. Once again, there is a vast gap between the combative public declarations and rigid opening positions on both sides and the very fact of their meeting.
A key question is whether these talks are merely a tactic to buy time. Each side has its own interest in delay. For Washington, additional time allows for further force accumulation and the completion of operational planning. Tehran, meanwhile, appears to be betting that the longer the crisis drags on, the weaker the international legitimacy for a US strike will become. From the regime's perspective, the further events recede from the recent wave of domestic protests, the greater its chances of survival.
In my assessment, the American explanation appears more realistic, especially given the slim prospects of reaching even a minimal agreement on Iran's nuclear program. Such a baseline deal would require "zero enrichment" and the transfer of enriched material to a third country, let alone the far more complex issue of restricting and enforcing limits on Iran's ballistic missile arsenal.
Countdown to a decision
Public discourse in recent weeks has focused largely on one question: When will the US strike? As time passes and developments unfold, the possibility of defusing tensions without some form of military action, whether limited or extensive, seems to be fading.
Recent signals suggest that a countdown has begun toward the moment Trump decides to authorize that operation. While such a decision would not come as a surprise, its timing carries strategic significance. In June 2025, an Israeli strike carried out in full coordination with Washington took place just one day before scheduled talks between Iran and the US in Vienna, beyond the two-month ultimatum Trump had previously set.
Will history repeat itself, with another round of talks collapsing at the last minute due to military action? An answer may come as early as this week, possibly before the weekend, a time when Trump has often chosen to greenlight military operations over the past year.
Meanwhile, Iran continues to conduct itself as though the recent "12-day war" and the latest wave of protests never occurred, seemingly unaware that its current situation is the most precarious it has faced since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
Whatever the timing of a potential strike, it will immediately shift attention to the "day after" and to a range of pressing short-term and long-term questions. In the immediate aftermath, how will Iran respond, and how broad will the confrontation become as a result? What targets will be hit, and how will those choices affect the duration of the conflict?
Over the longer term, equally weighty issues loom. Could military action trigger a renewed wave of protests leading to regime change, or to some other form of political transformation? Might the confrontation significantly alter the balance of power in the Middle East? From Israel's national security perspective, would the immediate threat posed by thousands of ballistic missiles, alongside the potential nuclear threat, truly be removed from the table?
Those who believed the central question was merely when the Americans would strike may soon find themselves disappointed. The day after a decision on military action, whenever it comes, will usher in a series of profound questions that are likely to linger for weeks to come.

UK far right lines up behind Rupert Lowe in challenge to Reform

On a cold night in a dilapidated theatre tucked away at the end of Great Yarmouth’s Britannia Pier, Rupert Lowe was launching a far-right revolution. “Millions will have to go,” the MP said as he pledged a policy of mass deportations to rapturous applause and foot stamping from the hundreds of people gathered for what had been billed as the launch of a local “Great Yarmouth First” party.
But after introducing five councillors who will stand at the next Norfolk county council elections under that banner, the former Reform UK figure went further by announcing that his Restore Britain movement would become a national party.
In an electoral battlefield littered with failed startups, Lowe’s new party is, for now, little more than a pebble in the shoe of Nigel Farage’s Reform, from which he parted ways last year after a bitter falling out.
However, over the weekend other parties and figures to the right of Reform quickly rallied behind the new party. Advance UK, led by the former Reform deputy leader Ben Habib and backed by the far-right activist known as Tommy Robinson, said it would consider a merger.
Such a force could cost Reform a number of seats – and potentially even power, in a wafer-thin general election result – by splitting support among those drawn to hard-right anti-immigration populism.
One seasoned Tory strategist said: “We’ve had a general election with a big Labour win but where a lot of their MPs had margins of around 1,000 votes, so you could see small challengers on the right disrupting Reform’s attempts to follow that.” In 2024, 46 seats were won with a margin of less than 2%.
While Reform has placed great store in social media, Habib and, in particular, Lowe have significant presences on X, where each have been amplified by Elon Musk, who funded Robinson’s legal bills last year.
Musk, who has taken a dislike to Farage in favour of Lowe, retweeted the latter on Saturday, saying: “Join Rupert Lowe in Restore Britain, because he is the only one who will actually do it!”
A cohort of young rightwing would-be influencers pushing a more exclusive, ethnically nationalistic view of British identity have flocked to Lowe, who had attained a cult appeal among many Reform members.
Among those at his event in Great Yarmouth was Lucy White, an activist and sometime GB News contributor accused of racist tweets. Steve Laws, a prominent activist and “ethnonationalist” influencer, tweeted: “Rupert Lowe is our leader. GET IN LINE.”
Other figures such as the millionaire businessman Duncan Bannatyne and the actor John Cleese have also given approving signals.
Advance UK, meanwhile, has cultivated street protest. Large numbers of its flags – in some cases handed out to people unaware of the group – were prominent among the thousands of people who marched through the town of Crowborough last month against the use of a former military base to house asylum seekers.
“Reform are vacating the part of the political spectrum on which it was founded. We’re the old Reform, and Reform is becoming the Tories 2.0,” Habib said before the launch of Advance’s first policies at the Emmanuel Centre, a Westminster venue let out by an evangelical church. The former Brexit party MEP says he has put £100,000 into the party and it has raised £600,000 from other sources.
“We have people joining us because they’re fed up with the way Reform is run, or because they have an ideological conviction and see Farage changing the message,” he said. “Our original Reform manifesto had rejected the World Economic Forum and yet there was Farage taking an Iranian billionaire’s money to go to Davos.”
An early indication will come this month in the Gorton and Denton byelection where Advance is standing Nick Buckley, who received an MBE for his charity work but who has since become known for his extreme language on race and Islam.
Lowe’s party, meanwhile, has adopted a decentralised structure that is likely to show up the top-down approach of Farage’s party. The Great Yarmouth First party is aiming to win all of the nine seats in the borough whenever postponed county council elections take place. This will be a pilot for Restore Britain, which will act as an umbrella for others.
Separated from Reform, Lowe has proven himself able to attract attention. A self-styled “inquiry” that he set up into the grooming gangs scandal attracted the involvement of Tory MPs including Nick Timothy, Esther McVey and Gavin Williamson.
In Great Yarmouth, one of the English coastal towns with high levels of deprivation, which Reform used as a springboard for its 2024 breakthrough, a clash between Lowe and his old party looms at the next general election. “We won it last time and we will win again,” Reform sources said.
But Lowe remains a rallying point for others. Rightwing activists and former Reform supporters had travelled from as far away as Scotland to attend the event. They included Maria Bowtell, an East Riding of Yorkshire councillor and single mother who was once regarded as a Reform rising star and who had driven down with her young son.
“Reform used to stand for something hopeful but it’s clear they won’t really change anything, plus people like me just weren’t supported,” Bowtell said. “I went on Woman’s Hour and was hung out to dry. I’m attracted now to the idea of independents getting together.”

Explosion at fireworks shop in eastern China kills 8
Authorities say blaze triggered by improperly set off fireworks
ISTANBUL
An explosion followed by a fire tore through a fireworks retail store in Donghai county in eastern China’s Jiangsu province on Sunday, killing eight people, state media reported.
Two others suffered minor burns, local authorities said, according to the state-run Xinhua News Agency.
The blast occurred when a villager improperly set off fireworks near the shop in Dong’an village, authorities said.
Emergency crews responded quickly and brought the fire under control. It was fully extinguished by Sunday afternoon.
Those responsible for the incident have been taken into custody.
Authorities have launched an investigation to determine the exact cause of the explosion, and follow-up measures are underway.

Slovak prime minister says Ukraine war has ‘no military solution,’ urges dialogue with Russia
'Only result will be hundreds of thousands of deaths and a stronger position of Russian Federation,' says Robert Fico
ISTANBUL
Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico said on Sunday that the war in Ukraine “has no military solution,” calling for dialogue with Russia to end the armed conflict continuing since 2022.
In a press conference with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio in Bratislava, Fico said Slovakia faces pressure whenever it pursues policies others dislike. “When someone doesn't like this sovereign independent behavior of Slovakia, they are always automatically trying to create obstacles to this sovereign, independent behavior.”
He reiterated his position that continued fighting will not resolve the conflict.
“The conflict in Ukraine has no military solution. It has no military solution,” he said, warning that if hostilities persist, “the only result will be hundreds of thousands of deaths and a stronger position of Russian Federation.”
Fico questioned the effectiveness of sanctions on Moscow, saying the “20th sanctioned packages are getting ready, how many of them do we need so that we could stop the progress of Russian Army?”
He added that European countries should prioritize diplomacy instead. “We should have come up with 20 peace initiatives.”
On energy disputes, he said Slovakia lost significant income after gas transit changes and accused Kyiv of politicizing supplies.
“We made 500 million euros per year just on transit fees,” he said, adding that “supplies of gas, of oil from Ukrainian side towards Hungary and Slovakia have become an instrument of political, political blackmail and pressure on Slovakia and Hungary.”
Fico also voiced criticism of the EU’s economic direction, saying: “The EU is economically in a deep crisis,” and warned that “if we will not admit that we passed senseless, ideological, climatic goals, we will not get out of this crisis.”
Despite his criticism, he said Slovakia supports Ukraine’s EU aspirations if conditions are met.
"We say that Ukraine can join the EU under the assumption they will meet all the necessary criteria,” he said, adding that Western Balkan candidates were “100 times better prepared for accession than Ukraine.”
Calling for engagement with Moscow, Fico stressed the importance of communication even with adversaries. “We have to lead discussion with Russian Federation. We have to lead dialog. We have to have a dialogue with the Russian president, Vladimir Putin,” he said.

Welsh charity buys more than 405 hectares for rewilding

A Welsh charity has bought more than 480 hectares (1,195 acres) in Ceredigion to establish Cymru’s “flagship” rewilding project, helping the country catch up with large-scale nature recovery projects under way elsewhere in the UK.
Tir Natur (Nature’s Land), founded in 2022, announced it had acquired the site at Cwm Doethie in Elenydd, or the Cambrian mountains, after a fundraising drive launched last year raised 50% of the £2.2m purchase price. A philanthropic bridging loan enabled the sale.
Fundraising efforts to begin early restoration work and community activities on the rewilding site – Wales’s largest – are ongoing.
The naturalist and broadcaster Iolo Williams, an ambassador for the charity, said: “I am hugely excited by their efforts to purchase land and showcase the benefits of rewilding, not only to wildlife and the physical environment but to farming, Welsh communities and culture. Nature needs this.”
Tash Reilly, Tir Natur’s chair, said: “This site will demonstrate what’s possible when we allow nature to take the lead and work for people again. It’s a hopeful, practical vision anyone can contribute to.”
Tir Natur says the project will restore Cwm Doethie’s natural landscape, which includes rivers, peat bogs and ancient woodland, acting as a carbon sink and reducing the risk of flooding downstream. It aims to encourage the return of red squirrels, pine martens, polecats, curlews and hen harriers, and to create new nature corridors and habitats for beavers and butterflies.
The charity plans to use a wild grazing system involving traditional cattle, pony and pig breeds to act as “ecosystem architects” that kickstart natural regeneration by turning over soil.
The site had previously been considered poor for grazing and unsuitable for commercial forestry owing to its location in a site of special scientific interest (SSSI).
Ian Rickman, the president of the Farmers’ Union of Wales (FUW), told Cambrian News the union had concerns over “the scale and transparency of this project”.
He said: “While it is positive that the role of livestock has been acknowledged, questions remain over how such a large area of land will be managed and funded in practice.” He said the FUW would seek to work with the charity “to ensure the voices of local farmers and rural communities are properly heard and considered”.
Reilly said Tir Natur was seeking a long-term approach and was “keen to engage with farmers and their representatives as the project moves forward”.
“We respect that there are different views about rewilding,” she said. “The recent Natural Resources Wales and Welsh government reports show nature in Wales is continuing to decline, which is our motivation … We will improve this site’s ecological health while ensuring it is a working rural landscape.”
The valley in the Cambrian mountains is set to become Wales’s largest rewilding site by far: some of the biggest in the UK are Cairngorms Connect at 60,000 hectares, Rewilding Affric Highlands, currently 80,000 hectares, and the Lake District’s Wild Ennerdale (4,400 hectares).
The UK ranks 229th out of 240 nations, with an average score of 50%, in the Natural History Museum’s biodiversity intactness index.
In 2017, another major rewilding project in Wales, Summit to Sea, aimed to establish a protection area stretching from the Pumlumon massif in Elenydd to Cardigan Bay, encompassing 10,000 hectares of land and a 28,000-hectare marine zone, but it faced criticism from the local community.
It was re-established as Tir Canol (Middle Ground) in 2020 and is now focused on a smaller area of mountainous Elenydd.

US forces intercept sanctioned oil tanker tied to Venezuela in Indian Ocean
‘Vessel tried to defy President Trump’s quarantine,’ says Pentagon as military forces boarded the Veronica III overnight
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
US military forces have boarded a sanctioned tanker in the Indian Ocean, having tracked the vessel from the Caribbean Sea in an operation targeting illicit oil linked to Venezuela, the Pentagon announced on Sunday.
Venezuela has been subject to US oil sanctions for several years, leading to its reliance on a 'shadow fleet' of falsely flagged tankers to smuggle crude into global supply chains. Donald Trump ordered a quarantine of sanctioned tankers in December to exert pressure on then-President Nicolás Maduro, who was later apprehended in January during an American military operation.
The Defense Department confirmed via a post on X that US forces boarded the Veronica III overnight, executing "a right-of-visit, maritime interdiction and boarding."
The Pentagon stated: "The vessel tried to defy President Trump’s quarantine – hoping to slip away. We tracked it from the Caribbean to the Indian Ocean, closed the distance, and shut it down."
The Veronica III, a Panamanian-flagged vessel, is listed under US sanctions related to Iran, according to the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control website. Video released by the Pentagon depicted US troops boarding the tanker.
The Trump administration has been seizing tankers as part of its wider efforts to take control of Venezuela's oil. However, the Pentagon's post did not specify whether the Veronica III had been formally seized and placed under US control.
This incident follows another boarding last week, when the US military intercepted the Aquila II, a different tanker, also in the Indian Ocean. That vessel is currently being held while its ultimate fate is determined by the United States, a defence official stated last week on condition of anonymity.
The Aquila II was one of at least 16 tankers that departed the Venezuelan coast last month after US forces captured President Nicolás Maduro, according to Samir Madani, co-founder of TankerTrackers.com. He said his organization used satellite imagery and surface-level photos to document the ship's movements.
The Aquila II is a Panamanian-flagged tanker under US sanctions related to the shipment of illicit Russian oil. Owned by a company with a listed address in Hong Kong, ship tracking data shows it has spent much of the last year with its radio transponder turned off, a practice known as “running dark” commonly employed by smugglers to hide their location.

Amid snags, EU mission tries to help frustrated Gazans traverse Rafah’s tortuous crossing

Amid snags, EU mission tries to help frustrated Gazans traverse Rafah’s tortuous crossing
EUBAM head Nataliya Apostolova acknowledges complaints but says operations at reopened terminal are steadily improving, in close coordination with authorities in Jerusalem and Cairo
For nearly two decades, a European Union mission meant to train and assist Palestinian border agents at the Rafah Crossing between Gaza and Egypt was little more than a shell, downsized after two years of operation to a skeleton staff after the violent 2007 Hamas takeover of the Gaza Strip from the Palestinian Authority.
Today, the European Union Border Assistance Mission, or EUBAM, is active again at the crossing, the Strip’s sole conduit to the outside world and a key bellwether for the type of fragile cooperation between various actors that will characterize Gaza’s postwar recovery period.
Tasked with overseeing Palestinian Authority border and customs agents to ensure their proper management of the crossing, the EU mission has been able to watch, but not act, as hopes around the crossing’s reopening this month have been dampened by procedural issues limiting the number of Palestinians entering or leaving Gaza to even fewer than the small number agreed to by Israel and Egypt.
“The technical details, at the end of the day, can delay the whole process,” EUBAM Rafah head Nataliya Apostolova told The Times of Israel recently from her Ramat Gan office.
The crossing is seen by Israel as a strategic concern, as lax oversight could allow Hamas to smuggle weapons into Gaza, as the terror group did before the war that broke out with the October 7, 2023, Hamas invasion of southern Israel. For Gazans, its a lifeline to the outside world.
On February 2, the crossing opened for two-way pedestrian traffic for the first time since the Hamas attacks, but it has been a rocky start.
According to the agreement between Egypt and Israel on the reopening of the crossing, 50 Gazans are allowed to enter and exit Gaza each day. The 50 civilians heading into Egypt for medical care are also each allowed to take two family members to accompany them.
But in the nine days that the crossing was open from February 2 through Friday, 316 Gazans left and 312 have come in, for an average of around 35 in each direction every day, according to EUBAM and Israel Defense Forces statistics.
The outgoing traffic consisted of 125 medical patients and 191 family members, according to EUBAM.
But Palestinians who have made the journey through the crossing have complained of a feeling of imprisonment, long wait times and intrusive inspections. In at least one instance, passengers were forced to camp at the crossing overnight, with no suitable facilities, due to technical or practical holdups.
There have also been allegations of harsh treatment by Israelis forces and by an Israel-aligned armed militia during the passage between the crossing and the Hamas-controlled part of the Strip.
After 18 years away, EU border experts began ramping the Rafah mission back up during the temporary January 2025 ceasefire. Today, with the crossing reopened, the crew consists of 31 staff members, including a team to provide security for the crew of experts.
“Our task and obligation is to monitor how this operation is implemented by the Palestinian team,” Apostolova said.
Under rules governing the crossing’s reopening this month, Israel has no physical presence at the crossing, but is able to monitor who is passing through and controls the gates remotely.
Those coming into Gaza enter the part of the Strip currently controlled by Israeli troops, though contact with civilians is generally done through armed Israel-aligned militias that also operate in that part of the enclave. Most civilians only pass through the Israel-controlled area on their way to the 47 percent of the Strip where most Gazans live.
Lugging luggage and keeping a balance
The Rafah terminal, housed in a warren of shipping containers after Israel destroyed the original buildings in 2024, is only open for six hours a day, from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m., in order to ensure that the European staff is able to leave Gaza before dark, though in practice they stayed longer during the first few days to facilitate the crossings.
Even with the extended opening, a slew of unforeseen snags have slowed the work, meaning only a few Gazans get through the crossing daily.
Gazans coming back from Egypt are allowed to bring one piece of luggage, but there is no size limit on the suitcases. After years of being away, many returning Gazans bring massive suitcases that don’t fit into the scanning machines.
“The luggage doesn’t go in, so everything is taken out,” explained Apostolova, a Bulgarian diplomat who formerly headed the EU mission to train Palestinian policemen. “It is put into buckets, and it goes through the scanner one by one.”
Some suitcases are too large to be carried by hand through the various checks, so the Palestinian border agents wind up doing double duty as porters. Or they commandeer golf carts meant for moving handicapped civilians through the crossing to transport the suitcases. All of this holds up the process.
Another factor keeping numbers down is an agreement between Israel and Egypt that the number of Palestinians going into and leaving Gaza be equal every day.
They work carefully to maintain that balance, though there have been four more Gazans who have left during the first two weeks.
If 12 injured Gazans are slated to exit to Egypt, they have to wait until an equal number have been processed and let in, explained Apostolova: “You have to wait until 12 people complete the procedure in the reverse traffic.”
Because only 12 Gazans were allowed in, the rest had to camp on the Egyptian side of the border overnight, according to the Associated Press.
The agreement limits what Gazans can bring into the Strip, with electronics, cigarettes, liquids and electronics banned, save for a single cellphone.
Gazans entering the Strip can only bring NIS 2,000 ($647) in cash, and those leaving are only allowed to take NIS 1,000 ($323).
The need to check for restricted goods and confiscate them slows the process.
Apostolova said the technical delays and the confiscation of forbidden items were the main source of the complaints.
The travelers “stayed many hours before they crossed the border, yes,” she conceded, “because at the moment, what we need is a bit more organization, even around the transportation of this luggage.”
“That’s why you have articles about people who are mistreated, and who stayed for hours before they crossed the border,” she insisted.
Some of the complaints are being addressed, Apostolova said. She noted Israel is building portable toilets and shade in the waiting areas.
The IDF’s Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories, which facilitates the movement of Palestinian civilians, told The Times of Israel that crossings were contingent on submission of approved manifests from Egypt and the World Health Organization, as well as “the crossing’s capacity.”
The crossing is open only for the passage of Gazan Palestinian pedestrians. Foreigners, including aid workers, who seek to enter Gaza can only do so via Israel’s crossings with the Strip. Goods and aid continue to go through the Israeli crossings. Israel is also still refusing to allow the unsupervised entry of foreign journalists into Gaza.
‘Absolutely perfect’ coordination
EUBAM is a “third party, a neutral party,” stressed Apostolova.“Our role as a mentor and adviser in this border operation is through our expertise… [on] how to make this process smoother, respectful, respecting the dignity of people, and fast. This is what we want.”
The mission’s mandate comes from the Agreement for Movements and Access signed by Israel and the Palestinian Authority in 2005, and initially consisted of 188 staffers.
In keeping with the EU’s no-contact policy with terrorist groups, the Rafah Crossing mission left Gaza and moved to Ramat Gan when Hamas seized power in Gaza in 2007, downsizing to just a few staffers.
EUBAM returned in January last year, as the crossing opened to outgoing pedestrian traffic into Egypt. Most of those leaving were medical evacuations, with a limit of 150 crossings out of Gaza a day.
That mission lasted 47 days, with around 4,000 crossings, before the ceasefire fell apart, said Apostolova.
EUBAM returned in October, as part of the ceasefire brokered by US President Donald Trump.
Every morning, its staffers head from Ashkelon to the Israel-Gaza border near the south of the Strip, where they meet an IDF convoy that accompanies them into Gaza and on to the crossing.
Coordination with the IDF has been “absolutely perfect” thus far, said Apostolova.
The United Nations World Health Organization is a central player in the complex effort. Most of those leaving Gaza are doing so for medical reasons, and the WHO sets the lists for who gets to leave using its own selection process. “The moment they have the names, they put them in a vetting procedure, which is Israel and Egypt,” explained Apostolova. “When the list is approved, it comes to us.”
The WHO is also the only organization ferrying injured Gazans in ambulances from the Hamas-controlled part of the Strip to the Rafah Crossing, which requires extensive coordination.
The WHO convoys can’t cross the Yellow Line into Israel-controlled territory on their own, so the organization has to coordinate with COGAT’s Coordination and Liaison Administration, or CLA, for Gaza.
The CLA then informs EUBAM that a convoy is moving and when it will reach the crossing point each morning.
EUBAM has lists of who will be crossing 24 hours in advance, with names and passport numbers.
The WHO transfers the patients from their ambulances to “sterile ambulances” that never leave the Rafah crossing compound.
Those crossing into Egypt without passports are given a document with their name and the date that they crossed, and then they have to go to the Palestinian embassy in Cairo within 48 hours to get a passport.
Controversially for Israel, the border agents have been stamping documents with the Palestinian Authority logo, even though Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has pledged that the PA would have no part in the running of Gaza.
Gazans coming from Egypt present their documents to the Palestinian Authority border agents when they reach the crossing, then are IDed by a facial recognition camera operation by the CLA. Once they are positively identified, a door opens and they enter to crossing itself.
Once through, they move to the shipping container to have their documents processed, then head to a customs check where machines scan their belongings.
Once that is done, they move to a waiting area, then head to a parking lot inside the Gaza Strip where buses are supposed to take them through IDF-controlled territory to Khan Younis, on the other side of the Yellow Line.
The buses are operated by the Abu Shabab militia, an armed anti-Hamas group that has worked with Israel inside the Strip, according to Gazans who have spoken to Israeli and international media.
The Gazans are then brought to an IDF checkpoint some five kilometers (1.8 miles) from Rafah, where they undergo an additional security screening. Only afterward are they permitted to continue toward the Hamas-controlled areas of Gaza.
Citing unnamed sources, the Qatari Al-Araby network said those who successfully returned to Gaza were interrogated several times during their journey, including by masked gunmen who stopped them at a checkpoint some 500 meters from the Rafah Crossing.
The sources said that the armed individuals handed the returnees over to IDF troops, whereupon they were interrogated and their belongings were confiscated.
Apostolova declined to comment on those reports. “We want to keep to the limits of our mandate, and we do not want to step in something that is already the responsibility of someone else,” she insisted.
“Our mandate does not allow us to go beyond the perimeter of the compound,” she said.
‘All sides are trying’
The process at the crossing is steadily improving, said Apostolova, and she and her team are holding regular “technical meetings” with Egypt and Israel. Some of the meetings take place in the Civil-Military Coordination Center in Kiryat Gat with American involvement, while others occur in the EUBAM or COGAT offices.
Egypt and Israel “have their own considerations, and they have their own challenges in this process,” she said, hinting at the political sensitivity of the operation.
She said the mission had not been in touch with the new National Committee for the Administration of Gaza, the nascent body set up by US President Donald Trump’s Board of Peace to run postwar Gaza, nor had it been in contact with the Board of Peace Executive Committee heading up the transition.
EUBAM does have a permanent representative at the CMCC, however, which oversees many of the aid convoys moving in and out of Gaza.
“Israel will continue working closely with its partners to facilitate the entry and exit of Gazans through the Rafah Crossing, in line with the agreed framework,” COGAT promised.
“All sides are trying, I must say,” Apostolova maintained. “We have very good cooperation with Israel and with the Egyptian side as well. We try to solve it, but it does not happen in a week.”
If so, we have a request.

French 'ultra-left' behind killing of right-wing youth, says justice minister Darmanin
France

The "ultra-left" in France was behind the deadly beating of a French youth aligned with the far right whose death has inflamed political tensions in the country, the justice minister said on Sunday, February 15. Gérald Darmanin also accused hard-left politicians, including from the La France Insoumise (LFI) party, the largest left-wing faction in parliament, of fueling violence with their language.
The victim, identified only as Quentin, aged 23, had been hospitalized and placed into a coma on Thursday after being attacked in Lyon. Supporters said he was providing security at a protest against an appearance by Rima Hassan, an LFI member of the European Parliament, at Sciences Po Lyon university when he was assaulted by a gang of rival activists.
The office of the Lyon prosecutor on Saturday told AFP he had died of his wounds. An investigation has been opened into suspected aggravated manslaughter, it has said, adding Sunday that "significant" testimony had already been gathered and investigators were working on identifying the perpetrators.
"It was clearly the ultra-left that killed him," Darmanin told RTL radio. "There are indeed speeches, particularly from La France Insoumise and the ultra-left, which unfortunately lead to unbridled violence on social networks and then in the physical world," he said. "Words can kill," Darmanin added, accusing Hassan and LFI leader Jean-Luc Mélenchon of "not having a word to say for the family of the young man."
Calls for calm
According to the Némésis collective, which is close to the far right, Quentin was providing security for its protesters and was assaulted by "anti-fascist" activists. The family's lawyer said in a statement that Quentin appeared to have been ambushed by "organized and trained individuals, vastly superior in number and armed, some with their faces masked."
The incident has further fueled tensions between France's far right and radical left ahead of municipal elections nationwide in March and the 2027 presidential election. Three-time presidential candidate Marine Le Pen, who is still hoping to stand in 2027 despite a graft conviction, said on X that the "barbarians responsible for this lynching" should be brought to justice.
Demonstrations called by the far right in memory of Quentin took place in the southern city of Montpellier and Paris, where protesters unfurled a banner reading "antifa murderers, justice for Quentin."
The far right has pointed the finger at La Jeune Garde ("Young Guard"), an anti-fascist youth offshoot of LFI. But its founder, Raphaël Arnault, an LFI lawmaker, has expressed his "horror" at the fatal beating.
LFI lawmaker Eric Coquerel, speaking to Franceinfo, condemned "all political violence" but said the activists responsible for Hassan's security "were in no way involved in what happened." He pointed instead to a particular "context" in the southeastern city marked by violence from "far-right groups."
President Emmanuel Macron has called for "calm" and "restraint."
Lyon's Green mayor, Grégory Doucet, who is standing for re-election next month, said what happened was "a tragedy" and added that "such an outburst of violence in the heart of the city is unacceptable."
At Saint George's Church in Lyon, which the young man attended and where he volunteered for charities, priest Laurent Spriet called on Sunday for prayers "for the peace of Quentin's soul." "Everything in its own time. Now is for compassion, for respect, for prayer, for letting the police and the justice system do their work," he said.

Polish President Karol Nawrocki thinks his country should start developing nuclear defenses, given the threat from Moscow.
In an interview with Polsat television on Sunday, Nawrocki described himself as "a great supporter of Poland joining the nuclear project" and argued that the country should develop its security strategy "based on nuclear potential."
He added: "This path, with respect for all international regulations, is the path we should take. ... We must work towards this goal so that we can begin the work. We are a country right on the border of an armed conflict. The aggressive, imperial attitude of Russia toward Poland is well known."

Russia Switches to T-72A Modernization as T-72B Stocks Dwindle
Unknown

New footage from Uralvagonzavod shows that Russia has begun modernizing the T-72A, likely due to the depletion of newer T-72B stocks.
Armored vehicle researcher Andriy Tarasenko published the video of the equipment on his Telegram channel.
According to the researcher, the footage from the tank plant captures a T-72A fitted with Relikt explosive reactive armor on the turret. In addition, the track-side fenders have been fitted with protection modules instead of the standard auxiliary fuel tanks.
“If UVZ can continue through 2026 and 2027 using the ‘obsolete’ T-72A, then Omsk will exhaust its stocks of Soviet-era T-80B (BV) tanks as early as 2026. Can the Russian Federation now organize mass production of new tanks?” the researcher wrote.
According to analysts at Frontelligence Insight, as of autumn 2025, Russia planned to repair and upgrade more than 800 T-72 tanks to the T-72B3M standard over a 10-year period. This figure corresponds to the estimated number of remaining T-72s in storage and at armored repair plants.
The analysts reviewed internal documentation from Uralvagonzavod and, based on the volume of ordered components, reconstructed projected output for the repair and modernization of T-72 tanks.
The data indicates that Russia plans to overhaul and upgrade 828 vehicles to the T-72B3M configuration by 2036, with peak activity expected around 2028. Between 2027 and 2029, 498 T-72B3M tanks are projected to be repaired or upgraded.
OSINT researcher Jompy, who analyzes satellite imagery to estimate remaining Russian equipment stocks, said the figure closely matches the number of T-72 tanks still in storage.
At the same time, roughly two-thirds of these stocks consist of older T-72A tanks, which entered service in 1979 and were produced until 1985. Some have already been transferred to Uralvagonzavod.
A full modernization of T-72A tanks to the T-72B3M standard would be technically complex, requiring the replacement of electronic systems, modifications to the chassis and autoloader, and upgrades to the hull and turret armor packages.
However, restored but not fully modernized T-72A tanks, fitted with reactive armor to a T-72B3-type standard, were observed in Russian service in 2024.
In addition to the T-72 program, Russia plans to manufacture, modernize, or overhaul 1,118 T-90M and T-90M2 tanks between 2027 and 2029.

Did Hong Kong souvenir shop tread on IP rights with viral ‘MTR station’ wall?
Wall featured signs nearly identical to ones found in rail stations before workers took down lettering
A souvenir shop in Hong Kong has taken down lettering from its viral wall featuring designs nearly identical to MTR station signage amid concerns over possible trademark and copyright infringement.
The MTR Corporation on Sunday declined to say whether the move by the Causeway Bay store was done at its request.
The company “attaches great importance to the protection of intellectual property, which is safeguarded under the law of Hong Kong, and we shall act accordingly in the event of suspected infringement,” a spokesman for the rail operator told the South China Morning Post.
Earlier this month, the wall next to the storefront belonging to Hong Kong Souvenir on Kai Chiu Road in Causeway Bay was transformed into a “check-in” spot that soon attracted photo-snapping crowds.

Palestine warns Israeli plan to register West Bank land as ‘state property’ amounts to ‘de facto annexation’

Palestine warns Israeli plan to register West Bank land as ‘state property’ amounts to ‘de facto annexation’
Palestinian Authority says Israel's move constitutes ‘termination of signed agreements,’ urges UN Security Council and US to intervene
ISTANBUL
The Palestinian Authority on Sunday warned that an Israeli government decision to register large areas of the West Bank as “state property” amounts to a “de facto annexation” of the occupied territory and a violation of international law.
In a statement carried by the official news agency Wafa, the Authority said the Israeli move constitutes “a blatant violation of international law and international legitimacy resolutions” and poses a threat to security and stability.
It described the measure as a “de facto annexation of occupied Palestinian land” and an official launch of annexation plans aimed at consolidating the occupation through illegal settlement expansion.
It also constitutes “a termination of the signed agreements and clearly contradicts the resolutions of the UN Security Council, especially Resolution 2334, which considers all settlement activity in the entire occupied Palestinian territory, including East Jerusalem, to be illegal.”
The Authority stressed that unilateral Israeli actions “would not confer legitimacy over Palestinian land and would not change the legal and historical status of the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip as occupied territory under international law.”
It called on the international community, particularly the UN Security Council and the US administration, to intervene immediately to halt the Israeli measures and compel Tel Aviv to comply with international law to prevent further escalation.
The Palestinian group Hamas decried the Israeli decision as “void” and issued by “an illegitimate occupation authority.”
This decision “is an attempt to impose Judaizing settlement facts by force, in a flagrant violation of international law and relevant UN resolutions,” it said in a statement.
The group vowed “to continue to confront all attempts by the occupation to impose annexation, Judaization and displacement plans.”
The Palestinian people “will not allow these colonial projects to pass, and the will of our people and their adherence to their land and their established national rights will remain the impenetrable barrier in the face of the occupation’s policies and expansionist plans.”
It called on the UN and international parties to take urgent action “to stop the occupation’s aggression and its ongoing violations against our Palestinian people, foremost among which is their right to their land, to self-determination, and to establish their independent Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital.”
Earlier Sunday, the Israeli government approved a proposal to register vast areas of the occupied West Bank as “state property,” the first such measure since Israel occupied the territory in 1967.
Israel’s public broadcaster KAN reported that the proposal was submitted by far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, Justice Minister Yariv Levin, and Defense Minister Israel Katz.
“The initial goal is the gradual settlement of 15% of Area C by 2030,” the Israel Hayom newspaper commented ahead of the government decision.
Under the Oslo II Accord signed in 1995, Area A is under full Palestinian control, Area B is under Palestinian civil control and Israeli security control, while Area C, accounting for about 61% of the West Bank, remains under full Israeli control.
The Accord limits land registration by the Palestinian Authority to Areas A and B, while prohibiting it in Area C.
The move was part of a series of measures approved by Israel’s Security Cabinet last week aimed at expanding illegal settlement building and increasing Tel Aviv’s control of the occupied West Bank.
According to Israeli media, the measures include repealing a law that barred the sale of land in the West Bank to illegal Israeli settlers, unsealing land ownership records, and shifting authority for building permits in a settlement bloc near Hebron from a Palestinian municipality to Israel’s civil administration.
Israel has intensified operations in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, since launching its military campaign in Gaza on Oct. 8, 2023. Palestinians view the escalation -- including killings, arrests, displacement and settlement expansion -- as a step toward formal annexation of the territory.
In a landmark opinion in July 2024, the International Court of Justice declared Israel’s occupation of Palestinian territory illegal and called for the evacuation of all settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem.

Gisèle Pelicot speaks

Gisèle Pelicot speaks
WARNING: This story contains descriptions of sexual abuse.
For 50 years, Gisèle Pelicot lived with her husband, Dominique Pelicot, whom she described as "a kind man, a devoted family man. It was a beautiful love story, until the day I found myself facing the horror of the facts."
Those facts shattered Gisèle's seemingly normal life, and put her at the center of a mass rape trial – an unthinkable crime that gripped France and received worldwide attention. But it was her response that would be defining.
She sat down with "CBS Sunday Morning," for what she said was her first-ever interview: "Yes, it's a first," she said through an interpreter. "I'm not used to speaking in front of cameras. I used to be a very discreet woman."
It all unravelled in 2020, inside a supermarket in Mazan, France, when what seemed like a small crime uncovered a far greater one. Dominique Pelicot was caught taking video up women's skirts. His arrest led to the discovery of disturbing footage taken inside their home of Gisèle Pelicot unconscious.
"My world collapsed"
At a local police station, an investigator told Gisèle what they found: "He said, 'Mrs. Pelicot, do you recognize yourself in these photos?'" she recalled. "And I said, 'No, it's not me.' Then he said, 'This is your bedroom.' And I see a woman I don't recognize at all, completely asleep with a man beside her. I don't know this man. And then he says, 'I'm going to tell you something shocking: You were raped by 53 individuals.' My world collapsed."
She described the woman in the video as looking like a rag doll. That woman was her. "Yes, it was me, but this woman was lifeless," she said. "She looked dead."
Her response? "I could not speak. I was in such a state of shock. All I wanted was to go home, to get my life back as it was before."
But that life was gone. The man she knew as a loving father to their three children, and a doting grandfather, had been drugging her with sleeping pills and muscle relaxants, then inviting men he met online to abuse her.
Her lawyer, Stéphane Babonneau, said it represented hundreds of rapes over at least 10 years. He and Gisèle started to grasp the scale of the crimes as they prepared for trial – "In the range of hundreds, if not thousands" of photos, he said. "And for videos, definitely hundreds."
Among the evidence: messages Dominque Pelicot posted online ("I'm looking for a pervert accomplice to abuse my sleeping wife..."), and text messages ("I'm about to dose her... We have to wait at least one hour to abuse").
"It's been a real journey into the darkness," said Babonneau. He described the images as "scenes of torture. There is no other word for that. … On this video we see a human being, being treated as an object. We see men who desecrate a human body, who desecrates someone, Gisèle, who is in profound distress, because her life was at risk at every moment where she was drugged and abused."
Victims of sexual abuse can remain anonymous in France. So up until the trial in 2024, Gisèle Pelicot's name was not known. But then she made a bold decision: to demand an open trial, allowing the public and the press into the courtroom.
Revealing her identity to the world, she said, was difficult: "It was very hard. I didn't want anybody to discover and know about this woman who had experienced all this violence. Because, in truth, victims always feel shame about what happened to them. I told myself that if I opened the closed-door proceedings, the shame would change sides."
The words "Shame Has to Change Sides" are the subtitle of her intimate account of the ordeal, "A Hymn to Life" (to be published Tuesday by Penguin Press).
Babonneau said he was worried when he heard that she wanted to have an open trial: "Because we knew that there would be a tremendous pressure on her," he said.
"Anger and hatred build nothing; they destroy"
At trial, the accused hid their faces as they filed into court. They ranged in age from 26 to 74. Among them: a firefighter, a soldier, and a nurse. In court, many claimed Gisèle Pelicot must have known, must have been complicit.
But Dominique Pelicot admitted everything, testifying, "It was always against her knowledge," adding he drugged her two to three times a week. "I had an addiction," he said.
Looking back, Gisèle said, there were warning signs: "I only knew I had blackouts, and I had health problems," she said. There were also periods where her memory was affected. "I couldn't remember that I'd been to the hairdresser; it was only the next day that I realized I had," she said. "And when I called my children, it was the same – I didn't remember our conversations.
"I thought I was seriously ill. I consulted neurologists, I had a CT scan – nothing was found," she said.
Even recounting her horrifying ordeal to "Sunday Morning," Gisèle Pelicot maintained her poise. "I've always been this way," she said. "Anger and hatred build nothing; they destroy. And I didn't want to go down that path."
The trial made headlines worldwide, and drew huge crowds of supporters, who praised Gisèle Pelicot for her bravery, holding her up as a feminist hero. Seeing those supporters, she said, made her feel that she was not alone: "It was an incredible source of strength for me."
All of the 51 men eventually put on trial were convicted. Dominique Pelicot was sentenced to the maximum of 20 years.
He has asked for his (now ex-)wife's forgiveness. But Gisèle Pelicot says, "No. Forgiveness is extremely difficult. But I don't want to live in hatred. I do need to speak with him – and it will also be to say goodbye."
But she does want to see him again. "Yes," she said. "I need answers. I may never get them. But that's also part of my journey."
During our interview, just off camera, was Gisèle's new partner, Jean-Loup, who was also by her side during the trial, along with her children.
"I never thought I'd fall in love, or even want to," she said. "It's a beautiful story. As for the rest, it belongs to us, and I keep that to myself."
But you're in love? "Indeed. You can fall in love at any age. Everything is possible. That, too, is a message of hope, to tell yourself that nothing is lost in life."
Despite the details of her ordeal, by the end of the book, her story is, miraculously, uplifting. "I was always wondering what my mission on Earth was, why I had been born," she said. "Some are painters, some are poets, others are writers. I think my mission was to give others hope, that even after hardship, you can rise again and choose happiness. I think that was my mission."

Iran says energy, mining and aircraft deals on table in talks as US prepares for next round

Iran is pursuing a nuclear agreement with the U.S. that would deliver economic benefits for both sides, an Iranian diplomat was reported as saying Sunday, days before a second round of talks between Tehran and Washington.
Iran and the U.S. resumed negotiations earlier this month aimed at resolving their decades-long dispute over Tehran’s nuclear program and averting a new military confrontation. The U.S. has dispatched a second aircraft carrier to the region and is preparing for the possibility of a sustained military campaign if the talks fail, U.S. officials told Reuters.
“For the sake of an agreement’s durability, it is essential that the U.S. also benefits in areas with high and quick economic returns,” Foreign Ministry Deputy Director for Economic Diplomacy Hamid Ghanbari said, according to the semi-official Fars news agency.
Iran has threatened retaliation against any U.S. attack but struck a conciliatory tone Sunday.
“Common interests in oil and gas fields, joint fields, mining investments and even aircraft purchases are included in the negotiations,” Ghanbari said, arguing that the 2015 nuclear pact with world powers did not secure U.S. economic interests.
U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, speaking at a news conference in Bratislava, said President Donald Trump had made clear he prefers diplomacy and a negotiated settlement.
“No one’s ever been able to do a successful deal with Iran but we’re going to try,” Rubio said.
In 2018, Trump withdrew the U.S. from the pact, which had eased sanctions on Iran in exchange for limits on its nuclear program, and reimposed sweeping economic sanctions on Tehran.
On Friday, a source told Reuters that a U.S. delegation including envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner would meet Iranian officials in Geneva on Tuesday. A senior Iranian official confirmed the meeting Sunday.
“Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner will be traveling, I think they are traveling right now, to have important meetings and we’ll see how that turns out,” Rubio said, without elaborating.
While the talks that led to the 2015 agreement were multilateral, the current negotiations are limited to Iran and the U.S., with Oman serving as mediator.
Deputy Foreign Minister Majid Takht-Ravanchi signaled Iran’s readiness to compromise on its nuclear program in return for sanctions relief, telling the BBC on Sunday that the ball was “in America’s court to prove that they want to do a deal.”
He cited a statement earlier this week by Iran’s atomic chief that Tehran could agree to dilute its most highly enriched uranium in exchange for sanctions relief as evidence of flexibility.
However, he reiterated that Iran would not accept zero uranium enrichment, a key sticking point in previous negotiations. Washington views enrichment inside Iran as a potential pathway to nuclear weapons, an allegation Tehran denies.
In June, the U.S. joined Israel in a series of airstrikes targeting Iranian nuclear sites.
The U.S. is also increasing economic pressure on Tehran. At a White House meeting earlier this week, Trump and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu agreed that the U.S. would work to reduce Iran’s oil exports to China, Axios reported Saturday.
China accounts for more than 80% of Iran’s oil exports, meaning any reduction in that trade would significantly cut Tehran’s oil revenue.

Mikaela Shiffrin finishes 11th in giant slalom, continuing Olympic drought

Mikaela Shiffrin fails to make the podium in women's giant slalom as Olympic drought continues
Mikaela Shiffrin's Olympic drought continues after she missed the podium of the Milano Cortina Games women's giant slalom on Sunday, finishing in 11th place.
The U.S. standout had a combined time of 2:14.42. Her runs were clean but just not quick enough to challenge for a podium spot. She didn't show any outward signs of disappointment after her second run, blowing out her cheeks and waving to the fans in the grandstand with both hands.
The 30-year-old, who is the winningest athlete on the World Cup circuit, has now failed to win a medal in eight straight Olympic events since the 2018 Winter Games in PyeongChang.
Italy's Federica Brignone took home the top prize, her second gold medal of these Games and her fifth medal overall. Remarkably, it was a split silver medal after Sweden's Sara Hector and Norway's Thea Stjernesund posted the same time in both the first and second runs.
After Brignone crossed the line to loud cheers from the home crowd, Hector and Stjernesund ran into the finish area and bowed down to the champion to a backdrop of chants of "Fede" from fans.
"That was, like, the greatest show of GS skiing that we've had in a really long time," Shiffrin said. "And to do it, you know, at the Olympics where people actually have eyes on the sport. Federica skied incredible. That was so cool to watch."
Redemption for Shiffrin, who came in fourth place with teammate Breezy Johnston in the women's team combined event on Thursday, could come at her best event — the slalom — on Wednesday.

ROME – Two off-piste skiers were killed on Feb 15 and another was in serious condition after an avalanche struck a slope near Courmayeur, Italy’s alpine rescue said.
Italy’s central alpine rescue service (CNSAS) said the two victims and injured person were a woman and two men, and were “probably” French.
The avalanche hit a stretch of the Canale dei Vesses, known for steep passages popular with off-piste skiers, west of Courmayeur in the Val Veny area at the foot of the Mont Blanc.
Fifteen rescuers participated in the search, along with search-and-rescue dogs and two helicopters, the CNSAS said.
One person died on site and the other after being transported to the emergency room, rescuers said. The injured person was in hospital in Turin. AFP

Iran’s top general warns new war will be ‘lesson’ for Trump ahead of next round of talks
Next round of US-Iran nuclear talks is scheduled for Tuesday in Geneva
By Syed Zafar Mehdi
TEHRAN, Iran (AA) - Iran’s top military commander warned Sunday that any US war against Tehran would serve as “a lesson” for President Donald Trump, as tensions continue to simmer in the region.
Major General Abdolrahim Mousavi, Chief of Staff of the Iranian Armed Forces, said that the US president should understand he would be entering “a lesson-giving battle.”
Trump said on Friday that regime change in Iran “would be the best thing that could happen,” as tensions escalate amid the deployment of a second US aircraft carrier to the Middle East.
He announced that the USS Gerald R. Ford, described as the world’s largest aircraft carrier, would soon head to the region in case ongoing talks between Washington and Tehran fail.
“In case we don’t make a deal, we’ll need it,” he said. “It’ll be leaving very soon.”
The USS Abraham Lincoln and a fleet of destroyers are already stationed in the Persian Gulf region, having been dispatched last month amid rising tensions between the two countries.
Mousavi described Trump’s comments as “unworthy of a president” and “reckless.”
He said that if Trump intends to wage war, he should not speak of “negotiations,” referring to the ongoing nuclear diplomacy between the two sides that resumed earlier this month.
The latest round of nuclear talks was held in Oman on Feb. 6, more than eight months after the Iran-Israel war put the diplomacy on the backburner.
Türkiye and other regional states recently intervened to help ease tensions and revive the diplomatic channels, particularly after Trump threatened to use military action against Iran.
The next round of talks is scheduled for Tuesday in Geneva, according to Iran’s Deputy Foreign Minister Majid Takht-Ravanchi, who confirmed the meeting in an interview on Sunday.
He said Washington must demonstrate its commitment to reaching an agreement aimed at resolving the nuclear issue.
“The ball is in America’s court,” he said. “If they are sincere, I’m sure we will be on the road to an agreement.”

Woman who filmed Snapchat videos while speeding jailed after killing two
A woman jailed after overtaking on the wrong side of the road and causing a fatal collision had repeatedly posted videos of herself speeding while using her mobile phone to social media.
Taxi driver Octavian Codreanu was killed at the scene on the B4425 near Aldsworth in December 2022, and his passenger, schoolteacher Moyra Whelan, later died from her injuries.
Liberty Michell, 21, pleaded guilty to two counts of causing death by dangerous driving, three counts of causing serious injury by dangerous driving and two counts of causing death by driving whilst uninsured.
Mitchell had passed her driving test just three weeks before the crash.
Gloucestershire Police said footage from Mitchell’s Snapchat account showed her driving on narrow roads at speeds of up to 100mph.
Mitchell, 21, of Chipping Norton, was sentenced to six years and eight months at Gloucester Crown Court on Friday (13 February) and banned from driving for more than eight years.

As Sudanese city returns to life after two-year siege, drone threat lingers
Markets reopen in Dilling, South Kordofan’s second largest city. Yet residents face critical medical shortages and persistent aerial attacks.
Life is cautiously returning to the streets of Dilling, the second largest city in South Kordofan state, after the Sudanese army broke a suffocating siege that had isolated the area for more than two years.
For months, the city had been encircled by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) and the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement-North (SPLM-N), cutting off vital supply lines and trapping civilians in a severe humanitarian crisis.

While the lifting of the blockade has allowed goods to flow again, local authorities and residents said the city remains under the threat of drone attacks.
Al Jazeera Arabic’s Hisham Uweit, reporting from Dilling, described a city “recovering slowly” from the economic strangulation.
“For over two years, heavy siege conditions were imposed on the city. Movement disappeared, goods vanished and livelihoods narrowed,” Uweit said.
“Now the eyes of buyers pick through the few available goods … as if the market itself is announcing its recovery at a leisurely pace, drawing determination from the patience of its residents.”
Markets return to life
The immediate impact of the army’s advance is visible in the local markets, which were largely shuttered during the blockade. Fresh produce, absent for months, has begun to reappear in stalls.
“The market and vegetables have all returned,” a local trader told Al Jazeera. “Before, the market didn’t exist. Now we have okra, potatoes, sweet potatoes, chillies and lemons. Everything is with us, and the market has returned to normal.”
However, the resumption of trade masks deep scars left by the isolation. The blockade devastated the local economy, stripping residents of their savings and leaving infrastructure in disrepair.
‘The price of isolation’
While food supplies are improving, Dilling’s health sector remains in critical condition. The city’s main hospital is struggling with a severe lack of equipment and essential medicines, a shortage that has had life-altering consequences for the most vulnerable.
Abdelrahman, a local resident suffering from diabetes, paid a heavy price for the siege. During the months of encirclement, insulin supplies ran dry. His condition deteriorated rapidly, ultimately leading to the amputation of both his legs.
“He had a medical appointment after a month, but the month closed off his check-ups,” a relative of Abdelrahman said. “He is suffering severely. He is missing his insulin. There is a shortage of food, and he is tired. His health has declined sharply.”
‘Chased like locusts’
Despite the Sudanese army asserting control over access routes, the security situation in Dilling remains precarious. Authorities said the city is subjected to almost daily drone strikes launched by the RSF and SPLM-N, targeting infrastructure and residential areas.
For Maryam, a mother displaced multiple times by the conflict, the breaking of the siege has not brought peace. She described the terror of the unmanned aerial vehicles that hover over their homes.
“Now the drones bombard and chase us. They chase us like locusts,” Maryam said. “When they come, we just run to hide. When they hover over us, they burn the thatch [roofs], start fires and force you to leave your home.”
She added that the constant threat of aerial bombardment makes normal life impossible: “If you are having a meal, like porridge, … the moment you see them, you leave it.”
Uweit said that while the lifting of the siege is a “glimmer of hope” and a first step towards recovery, the dual challenge of rebuilding a shattered health system and fending off persistent military attacks means Dilling’s ordeal is far from over.

After Munich Speech, Rubio Visits Trump’s Allies in Slovakia and Hungary

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio arrived in Slovakia on Sunday, continuing his European tour with visits to countries led by right-wing allies of President Donald Trump, with the next stop Hungary.
The visits come a day after Rubio called on Europeans to defend “Western civilisation” in a speech at the Munich Security Conference, urging them to rally behind the US president’s vision of a “renewal” of the world order.

During a visit of several hours in Bratislava, Rubio is scheduled to meet Slovakian Prime Minister Robert Fico, a nationalist leader who has positioned himself as an ally to Trump.
During a recent visit to Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, Fico reportedly expressed concern about the US president’s mental state, according to Politico, citing anonymous European diplomats.
Both Washington and Bratislava have vehemently denied this.
The Slovak leader said after the Mar-a-Lago meeting that he and Trump had had “extremely important” discussions on nuclear energy.
The US Secretary of State will then travel to Budapest for meetings on Monday with Hungarian officials, including Prime Minister Viktor Orban.
Trump makes no secret of his support for the right-wing Hungarian nationalist leader, whom he describes as a “strong and powerful man,” ahead of parliamentary elections scheduled for April 12.
Orban faces the toughest challenge to his grip on power since returning to office in 2010, as his Fidesz party trails opposition leader Peter Magyar’s TISZA party in the polls before the election.
Zelensky Pokes Fun at Orban’s ‘Belly’ at Munich
- Friend of MAGA movement -
In a speech on Saturday, Orban pledged to continue his fight against “bought pseudo-civil organisations, journalists, judges and politicians”.
Orban’s rhetoric and politics often echo those of Trump, and he has cast himself as a European friend of Trump’s MAGA movement.
Many American conservatives admire Orban for his hardline anti-immigration stance, resistance to LGBTQ rights and war against “gender ideology”.
Orban has also announced plans to travel to Washington next week to attend the inaugural meeting of Trump’s “Board of Peace”.
Orban also managed to secure Hungary an exemption from US sanctions on importing Russian oil and gas during a visit to the White House last year.
Former Democratic president Joe Biden had a much more hostile relationship with Orban, whom he accused of “looking for a dictatorship” in Hungary, including by muzzling independent media.
Energy is expected to be a major topic of discussion for Rubio in both Bratislava and Budapest, US officials indicated ahead of the trip.
These two nations are landlocked Central European countries that have sought to keep warm ties to the Kremlin despite the 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
Both also depend heavily on Russian fossil fuels, and both countries have found themselves locked in a standoff with the European Union over the decision to end imports of Russian gas.
US officials said Washington intends to strengthen energy ties with its two right-wing European allies.

The Smoke-and-Mirrors Rhetoric Shielding Georgia’s Outcast Autocracy

This week, US Vice President JD Vance paid visit to two capitals in the South Caucasus while snubbing a third. Nikol Pashinyan and Ilham Aliyev, the respective leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan, welcomed Vance amid a thaw in relations between their countries. For both states, this marks the highest-level visit of a US official to date.
“You know what the context of Georgian-American relations is. This context is very difficult,” admitted the prime minister of neighboring Georgia, Irakli Kobakhidze, during a press conference following the announcement of Vance’s visit.

Follow our coverage of the war on the @Kyivpost_official.
Two decades ago, Georgia’s capital Tbilisi hosted then President George W. Bush with great ceremony, but as of late the only procession seen on its main thoroughfare, Rustaveli avenue, has been that of the anti-government protests that have continued for over a year.
The Trump administration, of course, is not averse to making overtures to autocrats, as Baku’s presence on Vance’s tour attests. But Georgia’s authoritarian course has seen the country become particularly isolated on the world stage.
“It’s not only the US, it’s the whole West,” says Giga Bokeria, co-leader of the Federalists opposition party. In another political life, Bokeria had a prominent role in Georgia’s previous pro-Western government – the same that hosted Bush – and so feels keenly the country’s current ostracization under the ruling Georgian Dream party.
European Debate Over Nuclear Weapons Gains Pace
“What does it mean for us that they are isolated fundamentally from the UK, from the EU, from the US, all the important allies...? It’s a very dangerous thing – to be left alone vis-à-vis Russia in this region,” he told Kyiv Post.
Georgia’s government has been routinely accused of courting Russia, which invaded the country in 2008 and continues to occupy approximately 20 percent of its internationally recognized territory, during its drift away from the West.
But this alignment cannot be trumpeted. While the Kremlin has made some quietly complimentary gestures in Georgia’s direction – Russia’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova praised its avoidance of a “Ukrainian or Moldovan scenario” in March – Georgian Dream must still pay lip service to a largely pro-European, anti-Russia population in order to survive politically.
The government continually relies on an arsenal of warped foreign policy talking points to shrug off their lost friendships, conceal their appeasement of their northern neighbor, and to maintain their grip on power.
“Immense gaslighting” over Europe
Despite doing everything it can to tarnish its relationship with the EU, Georgian Dream rarely pillory the bloc directly, opting instead for what George Melashvili, a Georgian civic activist and political sciences scholar, calls “rhetorical shenanigans.”
“One of the major pillars of Georgian Dream’s ability to control the country is immense gaslighting,” he told Kyiv Post. This includes an insistence that Georgia can still join the EU at the end of the decade, “a notion that simply does not stand against any critique.”
The period following the government’s suspension of EU accession talks in November 2024 – ostensibly a temporary measure – has seen violent crackdowns on protests, government critics imprisoned, and major opposition parties threatened with bans.
In recent months, Kobakhidze has given a series of interviews to pro-government media where he has claimed openness to cooperation with Europe while expressing concern, of all things, for the state of its democracy – a tactic that Melashvili calls “mirroring.”
“We sometimes joke that whatever Georgian Dream actually is itself, they’re trying to project on others,” he adds.
For an insight into Georgian Dream’s unfiltered feelings about Europe, Melashvili considers its satellite parties an “excellent place” to look. Last week one of these, United Neutral Georgia, called for pro-government broadcasters to host debates on the “harmful process of EU integration.”
Russia’s “natural ally”
Following Russia’s 2008 invasion of Georgia and subsequent recognition of its two breakaway regions – Abkhazia and South Ossetia – as independent states, Georgia severed and has not renewed diplomatic relations with its neighbor. Critics argue, however, that an under-the-table relationship has taken root under Georgian Dream.
Much of the blame for this is directed at one man: while Kobakhidze heads the government officially, billionaire oligarch and Georgian Dream founder Bidzina Ivanishvili is widely regarded as Georgia’s de-facto ruler. He made his fortune in Russia in the years after the Soviet Union’s collapse.
Melashvili is convinced that Ivanishvili’s Russia alignment, if not projected openly, is clear in substance: “I cannot say whether or not Ivanishvili or Kobakhidze are receiving folders with orders from the Kremlin or the [FSB headquarters] Lubyanka, but what we can do is evaluate the results... Georgia’s economic dependency on Russia has increased. Georgia’s political dependency on Russia has also increased.”
Bokeria agrees that the presence or absence of direct Russian orders is beside the point: “The nature of [Ivanishvili’s] rule, his regime, the instincts he plays on... make him a natural ally of Russia.”
“He’s a guy from the 90s in Moscow,” he told Kyiv Post, “that’s where his mentality was shaped and formed.”
The rhetoric this produces, again, is indirect. “The main purpose of GD [Georgian Dream] propaganda is not to portray Russia as the good guys. They know it is impossible,” says Melashvili, instead they “gaslight the Georgian public into believing that the European Union is equally [as bad] or even worse than Russia.”
Russia’s war on Ukraine, Bokeria notes, has gifted Georgian Dream further rhetorical cover for its Kremlin appeasement. “Fear of change is connected with the fear of war in the propaganda of GD,” he explains.
Last year Ukraine’s Foreign Ministry condemned a Georgian Dream campaign ad that placed images of Russia’s war alongside the slogan “Choose peace!”
A bad balancing act
For all its multifarious duplicity, this foreign policy rhetoric is less a masterplan than a desperate gambit.
“All that they care about... it’s not Georgia’s long-term interest or strategy, it’s to sustain the absolute power that they have right now,” Melashvili affirms.
This tunnel vision seems to blind the government to its mounting ostracization. Before Vance landed in Armenia, there were no invites for Georgia to the WEF meeting in Davos, nor to Trump’s recently conceived “Board of Peace.”
Moreover, the president’s “Trump Route for International Peace and Prosperity,” set to commercially reconcile Armenia and Azerbaijan, threatens to harm Georgia’s strategic importance in the so-called “Middle Corridor.”
“Georgian Dream would absolutely love to be participating in all those meetings and events,” says Melashvili, but “if the cost is to give away even small parts of their power, they will never concede such actions.”
Georgian Dream’s appeals to the Trump administration, both in professed ideological kinship and in calls to lift Biden-era sanctions on government officials, have gone unanswered.
While Georgia’s president Mikheil Kavelashvili claimed Vance expressed a desire for renewed relations when they met at the Winter Olympics in Milan last week, any significant practical steps in this regard are yet to be taken.
If Trump provides a model for playing both sides of the divide between Europe and Russia, then Georgian Dream has been thus far incapable of emulating it. “If we’re talking about a balancing act, then Georgian Dream is doing a horrible job,” says Melashvili. “[They have] not been able to balance Russia with the West or with China or with the United States. They have simply been putting more and more coins on the scales of Russia.”
But the Georgian people have proved more difficult to back into a corner than their government. “We’re not yet in the situation of Belarus, even though we’re getting very close to it,” Melashvili says. “The Georgian public continues to fight.”
Georgian Dream’s press officer did not respond to a request for comment.

Ukrainian freestyle skier Kateryna Kotsar had a Valentine’s Day to remember, clinching a spot in the Winter Olympics big air medals contest and receiving a marriage proposal on the slopes.
Kotsar landed two strong jumps in Monday’s qualifying round, securing 11th place – just above the cutoff of 12 skiers advancing to the final.

Minutes after her final run, her boyfriend, Bohdan Fashtryha, surprised her by getting down on one knee at the side of the Alpine slope. She said yes.
“I think he was nervous. It was so cute, to be honest,” the 25-year-old Kotsar told reporters.
Fashtryha told Suspilne Sport that he had been planning the proposal for two years. When their relationship began, Kotsar had been considering whether to continue her sports career.
With support from her parents, Fashtryha convinced her to stay in the sport.
“She was really thinking about whether to continue her athletic career. I, along with her parents, encouraged her to go on, because the chance to go to the Olympics is unique and can’t be missed. I imagined this moment even back then – two years ago. Since then, so many things have happened, and now Katya is at the Olympics. The brave find happiness. It just so happened that I could be here,” he said.
Earlier in the day, Kotsar had a hard crash on her third run, sending both skis and goggles flying – but her strong first two jumps secured her place in the final. After the proposal, she removed her ski glove to show off her engagement ring.
Kotsar also revealed a message on her glove that read “Freedom of memory”, a gesture of solidarity with skeleton athlete Vladyslav Heraskevych, who was disqualified by the IOC for wearing a “memory helmet” honoring fallen Ukrainian defenders and athletes.
“I still am excited and can’t understand what happened tonight because it’s two really huge things for me,” Kotsar said.
Her final Olympic performance is scheduled for Monday, Feb. 16, at 8:30 p.m. Kyiv time.

IDF strikes continue as key meetings loom over Hezbollah disarmament in Lebanon

The IDF continued overnight Sunday to strike sites in Lebanon used for storing weapons and operating launchers belonging to Hezbollah, as daily attacks target what officials describe as the terrorist organization’s efforts to rebuild its capabilities.
Strikes have been carried out by fighter jets, drones targeting vehicles carrying Hezbollah terrorists, as well as artillery and machine gun fire. Despite the sustained military activity, there has been no significant diplomatic breakthrough, and the situation along the northern front appears to be in a holding pattern pending broader regional developments, particularly involving Iran.
Three upcoming meetings are expected to clarify or potentially advance developments.
The first is a Lebanese government session scheduled for Monday. Lebanese Army Commander Rodolphe Haykal provides monthly updates to the cabinet on progress in implementing a plan to consolidate weapons under state control. According to recent reports, he is expected to present the second phase of that plan, covering areas north of the Litani River.
Hezbollah has refused to relinquish its weapons, arguing that U.N. Security Council Resolution 1701 applies only to the area south of the Litani. The terrorist organization maintains that instead of pressuring it, the Lebanese government should focus on securing the withdrawal of remaining forces from southern Lebanon.
Hezbollah Secretary-General Naim Qassem is also expected to deliver a speech Monday at a memorial event for leaders of the terrorist organization, and is anticipated to address developments in Lebanon and the wider region.
Another key meeting, set for the 25th of the month, involves the ceasefire monitoring mechanism committee, which has convened 13 times in 2025. The body was initially limited to military representatives but was later expanded to include Simon Karam, a former Lebanese ambassador to the United States, as the civilian head of the Lebanese delegation.
Senior Hezbollah officials opposed Karam’s inclusion, describing it as a “second mistake,” following what they called the first error — the plan to consolidate weapons — undertaken “under continued occupation of Lebanese territory and daily attacks.”
From Hezbollah’s perspective, any discussion of its weapons must take place solely within the framework of a domestic Lebanese national defense strategy, free of external pressure and only after several conditions are met: a halt to attacks, the return of Lebanese prisoners and a full withdrawal from southern Lebanon.
The terrorist organization views the ceasefire monitoring committee as having a strictly technical mandate limited to implementing commitments under the agreement, which it says applies only to areas south of the Litani River. Hezbollah lawmaker Ibrahim Mousawi reiterated that position earlier this month.
Al-Akhbar, a Lebanese newspaper affiliated with Hezbollah, published an article Friday titled: “What if the state dared to withdraw from the mechanism?” The piece argued that as long as attacks, destruction and killings continue following the 2024 ceasefire declaration, and as international promises remain unfulfilled, reconsidering cooperation with the mechanism becomes a legitimate question.
The article outlined potential advantages and disadvantages of suspending cooperation, concluding that such a move would restore Lebanon’s national dignity and its right to defend itself “by all means,” asserting that the world respects only those who respect themselves.
A further significant date for Lebanon is March 5, when a conference in France is scheduled to support the Lebanese Army and security forces. A preparatory meeting is expected beforehand. Earlier this month, Lebanese Prime Minister Nawaf Salam called on Arab states to participate in the conference, saying, “We need your help.”
Lebanese leadership, including President Joseph Aoun, Salam and Haykal, has emphasized in meetings abroad that the army requires substantial assistance to carry out its missions. Haykal recently returned from a visit to the United States, where he met with political and military officials to discuss ways to enhance military cooperation and support the army’s capabilities.
In a statement, the Lebanese Army said American officials praised its performance and operations south of the Litani River.

Details: Sobyanin reported around 15:00 Kyiv time that a drone flying towards Moscow had been shot down. He later said Russian air defences had destroyed 13 UAVs by 16:25. Emergency services are working at the locations where debris from the drones fell, the mayor added.
RIA Novosti says Domodedovo airport temporarily restricted aircraft arrivals and departures, but the measures were later lifted.
Bogomaz claimed that Bryansk Oblast has been under large-scale UAV attack since early morning and that 120 drones have been destroyed so far.
The Russian Defence Ministry claimed earlier that between 09:00 and 13:00 Moscow time (08:00-12:00 Kyiv time), Russian air defence had destroyed 102 Ukrainian fixed-wing drones over the territories of Bryansk, Kaluga and Tula oblasts as well as over the Moscow area, including three flying towards the Russian capital.

Lions lived in Japan thousands of years ago: Study
Study says lions reached Japan between 73,000 and 38,000 years ago when lower sea levels connected it to Eurasia
ISTANBUL
Lions once roamed much of Japan tens of thousands of years ago, researchers said, after fossils long thought to be tiger remains were identified as belonging to an extinct species of lion.
A study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, found that DNA and protein analysis of fossils previously attributed to tigers showed they were from cave lions, Kyodo News reported Sunday.
Scientists collected organic material from 26 subfossils across Japan. By comparing mitochondrial and nuclear DNA and proteins from five samples with global data, they determined that all belonged to cave lions.
“Our findings challenge the long-held view that tigers once took refuge in Japan, showing instead that cave lions were widespread in northeast Asia during this period,” researchers from institutions including the Graduate University for Advanced Studies and Peking University said.
Lions left Africa about 1 million years ago and spread across Eurasia, reaching Japan between 73,000 and 38,000 years ago, when lower sea levels connected the archipelago to the continent.
Fossil evidence from Yamaguchi prefecture suggests they reached western Japan. Humans arrived around 40,000 to 35,000 years ago, and cave lions likely went extinct about 10,000 years ago.
“The findings are significant in terms of studying interaction between lions and tigers and their influence on ecosystems,” said Takumi Tsutaya, an assistant professor at the Graduate University for Advanced Studies.
Large feline fossils have been discovered across Japan, from Aomori Prefecture to Oita Prefecture, and were long assumed to be tiger remains because of the country’s warm, humid climate.

Iran seeks to get out of FATF blacklist amid domestic political divisions
North Korea and Myanmar are the other two countries on the global financial blacklist as Tehran promises to continue efforts to get out of it.
Tehran, Iran – Iran says it will continue efforts to get out of a blacklist of a prominent global watchdog on money laundering and “terrorism” financing despite “20 years of obstruction” from domestic opponents.
The statement by the Financial Intelligence Unit of Iran’s Ministry of Economic Affairs on Sunday came two days after the Paris-based Financial Action Task Force (FATF) renewed its years-long blacklisting of Iran, according to a report by the official IRNA news agency.

The FATF also ramped up measures aimed at isolating Iran from global financial markets with a particular focus on virtual asset service providers (VASPs) and cryptocurrencies.
It recommended member states and financial institutions around the world to:
- Refuse to establish representative offices of Iranian financial institutions and VASPs or consider the noncompliance risks involved.
- Prohibit financial institutions and VASPs from establishing offices in Iran.
- On a risk basis, limit business relationships or financial transactions, including virtual asset transactions, with Iran or people inside the country.
- Prohibit financial institutions and VASPs from establishing new correspondent banking relationships and require them to undertake a risk-based review of existing ties.
Even the flow of funds involving humanitarian assistance, food and health supplies as well as diplomatic operating costs and personal remittances are recommended to be handled “on a risk basis considering the “terrorist” financing or proliferation financing risks emanating from Iran”.
What does the FATF move mean?
Iran has been blacklisted by the FATF for years and is currently on the list in the company of just two other countries: North Korea and Myanmar.
Since October 2019, Iran has had “heightened measures” like supervisory examination and external audit requirements recommended against it and has been subject to “effective countermeasures” since February 2020.
This contributed to making access to international transactions increasingly difficult or impossible for Iranian banks and nationals and made the country more dependent on costlier shadowy third-party intermediaries for transactions.
The new countermeasures emphasise existing frameworks but also specifically cite virtual assets, signalling an increased focus.
The fact that the FATF also urges countries and global institutions to remain wary of risks of having any dealings with Iran may mean even more limited transaction opportunities for Iranian entities and nationals.
Small banks maintaining old correspondent relations with Iranian counterparts may also reconsider after being recommended to re-evaluate existing links.
The isolation has hobbled state-run or private income streams and contributed to the continuous depreciation of the Iranian rial over the years.
Links with Iran’s nuclear dilemmas
The FATF, formerly known by its French name, was established by the Group of Seven (G7) countries in 1989 to combat money laundering but later had its mandate expanded to countering financing of “terrorism” and weapons of mass destruction.
It has been formally raising concerns about Iran since the late 2000s, which is also when it started calling for countermeasures as international tensions grew over Iran’s nuclear programme and the country was sanctioned by the United Nations Security Council.
But a year after Iran signed a landmark 2015 nuclear deal with world powers that lifted the sanctions, the FATF also acknowledged a “high-level political commitment” from Iran and agreed to an action plan for the country to address its compliance requirements.
The centrist government of President Hassan Rouhani, who had clinched the deals, pressed ahead with ratifying several laws needed to fulfil the action plan despite opposition from hardliners who were firmly against the increased financial transparency and international supervision.
But United States President Donald Trump unilaterally reneged on the nuclear deal in 2018, imposing a “maximum pressure” campaign that has remained in effect until today. The move empowered the argument from the hardliners in Tehran, who succeeded in blocking the ratification of the rest of the FATF-linked legislation, leaving the issue dormant for years.
Washington has retained the sanctions over the years with some of the latest – including the blacklisting in January of two United Kingdom-based cryptocurrency exchanges – allegedly connected to Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.
The UN Security Council sanctions were also reinstated against Iran in September when Western powers triggered the “snapback” mechanism of the nuclear accord. They include an arms embargo, asset freezes and travel bans as well as nuclear, missile and banking sanctions that are binding for all UN member states.
Support for ‘axis of resistance’
The Iranian hardliners railing against any progress on FATF-related legislation have presented two main concerns.
They assert that fully adhering to the watchdog’s guidelines would curb Tehran’s ability to back its “axis of resistance” of aligned armed groups in Lebanon, Iraq, Yemen and Palestine. The axis lost its base in Syria with the fall of President Bashar al-Assad in December 2024.
Hardliners have also suggested that Iran’s ability to circumvent US sanctions may be significantly compromised by disclosing all the information required by the FATF.
Iran has been selling most of its oil to China at hefty discounts, using a shadow fleet of ships that turn their transponders off to avoid detection in international waters. The country has also for years been forced to rely on a capillary network of currency exchanges and intermediaries, some of them based in neighbouring countries, such as Türkiye and the United Arab Emirates.
To assuage some of the domestic concerns, two FATF-related laws ratified by Iran in 2025 were passed with special “conditions” and reservations infused in the text.
One of the main conditions was that the ratified regulations must not “prejudice the legitimate right of peoples or groups under colonial domination and/or foreign occupation to fight against aggression and occupation and to exercise their right to self-determination” and “shall not be construed in any manner as recognition of the Zionist occupying regime”, a reference to Israel.
Iran also said it would not accept any referral to the International Court of Justice and asserted that its own Supreme National Security Council would determine which groups qualify as “terrorist” outfits.
Those conditions were rejected by the FATF, leading to the increased countermeasures.
The watchdog also said it expects Iran to identify and freeze “terrorist assets” in line with relevant UN Security Council resolutions. Some of Iran’s nuclear and military authorities are among individuals sanctioned by those resolutions.

Berlinale head urges ‘cool heads’ amid backlash over Wim Wenders’ no-politics comment
Some guests pull out of event after famed German filmmaker said Berlin Film Festival has ‘to stay out of politics’; festival director says artists are free to express opinions
BERLIN, Germany — The head of the Berlin Film Festival has sought to draw a line under a row over whether filmmakers should take political stances that has marked the opening days of the event.
In a statement released late Saturday, festival director Tricia Tuttle reacted to the controversy sparked by comments made by jury president Wim Wenders at a press conference on Thursday when he was asked about the German government’s support for Israel.
“We have to stay out of politics,” Wenders said, stressing that filmmakers had to “do the work of people, not the work of politicians.”
That prompted a backlash, including the decision by award-winning Indian novelist Arundhati Roy to withdraw from the festival, where she had been due to present a restored version of a 1989 film she wrote, “In Which Annie Gives It Those Ones.”
“It is hard to see the Berlinale and so many hundreds of filmmakers and people who work on this festival distilled into something we do not always recognize in the online and media discourse,” Tuttle said in her statement.
Some have defended Wenders, saying his remarks were taken out of context.
In the press conference he also spoke of how “movies can change the world” and of the power of films to “change the idea that people have of how they should live.”
In her statement Tuttle thanked the filmmakers, juries and others working at the festival for their “cool heads in hot times.”
She emphasized that artists “are free to exercise their right of free speech in whatever way they choose” and should not “be expected to speak on every political issue raised to them unless they want to.”
The festival has a reputation for socially conscious programming and Tuttle pointed out that this year’s offering includes “films about genocide, about sexual violence in war, about corruption, about patriarchal violence, about colonialism or abusive state power,” some of them from filmmakers who themselves have experienced persecution.
“We do not believe there is a filmmaker screening in this festival who is indifferent to what is happening in this world, who does not take the rights, the lives and the immense suffering of people in Gaza and the West Bank, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, in Sudan, in Iran, in Ukraine, in Minneapolis, and in a terrifying number of places, seriously,” Tuttle said.

Hiam Abbass: Silence is not neutral

The start of this year's Berlin Film Festival was marked by a row over how far film should venture into politics but for prominent French-Palestinian actor Hiam Abbass, "everything we do is a political act".
Abbass is starring in two films being presented at this year's Berlinale festival and in an AFP interview she emphasised the importance of a politically engaged approach to cinema.
At Thursday's opening press conference jury president Wim Wenders sparked controversy by saying "we cannot really enter the field of politics", in response to a question about Germany's support for Gaza.
"I don't agree," Abbass told AFP.
"There's a lack of courage among people in the film world -- among some, not all," said Abbass, who gained global attention for her role as Marcia Roy in the hit HBO series Succession.
She recognised that Wenders's remarks were "taken out of context", as he did talk about cinema's capacity to "change the world", albeit in a different way from party politics.
Nevertheless, Abbass said she was glad to see filmmakers at this year's festival "commit to amplifying stories and voices of minorities, oppressed people, people experiencing bombardment, genocides".
"Today more than ever, if we don't tackle these subjects, we're making art for art's sake, and that's something that doesn't interest me."
'Act of resistance'
In "Only Rebels Win" by Lebanese filmmaker Danielle Arbid, Abbass plays a Christian Palestinian living in Beirut who faces a backlash from those around her because of her relationship with a South Sudanese Muslim migrant 40 years her junior.
Israeli bombardments between September and November 2024 forced the production to relocate from Beirut to a studio near Paris, where the team deployed creative solutions to recreate the Lebanese capital.
Abbass said the circumstances turned the film into "an act of resistance".
When the bombardment of Beirut began, "I told Danielle: 'Whatever you do, wherever you go, I'll follow you, because this film has to get made'."
Academy's 'open-mindedness'
Before starting on "Only Rebels Win", Abbass had just finished working on "Palestine 36" by Annemarie Jacir, a depiction of the Palestinian uprising against the British Mandate in 1936.
Abbass said that the "the film waited eight months so that it could be shot," with production forced to move to Jordan instead of the occupied West Bank.
Abbass said that the team decided that "at a certain point, we couldn't keep being subject to" the decisions of the Israeli government.
She also welcomed the Academy's decision to include three films highlighting the Palestinian experience in its shortlist for best international feature film: "Palestine 36", Kaouther Ben Hania's "The Voice of Hind Rajab" and Cherien Dabis's "All That's Left of You".
Only Kaouther Ben Hania's film ultimately made the final list of five nominees.
But Abbass praised the "open-mindedness" of the Academy to bring these films "almost to the final stages of the Oscars" after what she said Israel's genocide in Gaza.

Increased US military presence in Middle East aims to defend forces: Rubio
Secretary of state emphasizes diplomacy with Iran as Witkoff, Kushner travel for negotiations
ISTANBUL
The US’ increased military presence in the Middle East is intended to defend American forces from potential threats rather than signal an imminent attack on Iran, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Sunday.
"We are postured in the region for one simple reason, and that is that we understand that there could be threats to our forces in the region," Rubio told reporters alongside Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico.
Washington wants to ensure "sufficient capacity to defend them, if, God forbid, that were to happen," he added.
Asked whether the Trump administration would consult and inform Congress before attacking Iran or removing Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Rubio said US President Donald Trump "prefers diplomacy and an outcome of negotiated settlement."
"We're dealing with people who make political, geopolitical decisions on the basis of pure theology, and it's a complicated thing," Rubio said, adding "No one's ever been able to do a successful deal with Iran, but we're going to try."
The US attacks on Iran last June were carried out without congressional approval or notification of top Democratic leaders in Congress. Some lawmakers objected, saying the attacks took place despite there being no imminent threat to the United States.
Rubio also said special envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, who have been active in the Middle East, are currently traveling for "important meetings," adding: "We'll see how that turns out."
The secretary of state pledged to "always comply with the applicable laws of the United States in terms of involving Congress" in any decisions, adding: "But right now, we're not talking about any of that. We're talking about negotiations."
"The president made that clear: If that changes, it'll be obvious to everyone, and obviously whatever the law requires us to do, we'll do," Rubio said.
The US has significantly increased its military presence in the region, deploying the USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group with reports of plans to send the USS Gerald R. Ford aircraft carrier amid heightened tensions with Tehran.

Iran’s Araghchi slams European powers for ‘irrelevance’ in nuclear talks
Foreign minister says regional powers have been ‘far more effective’ than European countries.
Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi has derided the Munich Security Conference as a “circus”, accusing European powers of “paralysis and irrelevance” in efforts to revive nuclear negotiations with the United States.
Iranian officials were not invited to the annual security meeting in the German city.

“Sad to see the usually serious Munich Security Conference turned into the ‘Munich Circus’ when it comes to Iran,” Araghchi wrote on X on Sunday.
“The paralysis and irrelevance of the EU/E3 is displayed in the dynamics surrounding the current talks over Iran’s nuclear program. … Once a key interlocutor, Europe is now nowhere to be seen. Instead, our friends in the region [the Gulf] are far more effective and helpful than an empty-handed and peripheral E3.”
The E3 – which included France, the United Kingdom and Germany – were key players in the previous round of nuclear negotiations between world powers and Iran. That process culminated in 2015 with the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, a landmark agreement aimed at limiting the scope of Iran’s nuclear programme in exchange for sanctions relief.
The US under the first administration of President Donald Trump withdrew from the deal in 2018 and ramped up sanctions on Iran. Since then, the process has largely stalled. Still, the E3 maintained a role as a go-between with Tehran and Washington.
But since negotiations resumed last year, Gulf countries, such as Oman and Qatar, have taken the lead in facilitating talks between the US and Iran.
Araghchi made the remarks before leaving Tehran to lead a diplomatic and technical delegation to Geneva for a new round of nuclear talks with the US. The talks follow last week’s indirect negotiations in Oman, which is mediating the process, Iran’s Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
During his visit, Araghchi is expected to meet his Swiss and Omani counterparts, as well as the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Grossi, and other international officials.
Abas Aslani, a senior research fellow at the Center for Middle East Strategic Studies, said Araghchi’s comments “indicate a policy shift from the Iranian side that the E3 mechanism … is no longer a valid channel for resolution”.
“This nuclear mediation has moved from Europe to the region, and now the heavy lifting in diplomacy is done by regional players,” he said.
On Tuesday, Oman is to host talks between the US and Iran in Geneva after previous indirect negotiations in Muscat on February 6. Those talks were attended by US envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump’s son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner.
US and Iranian officials previously held several rounds of talks in the Omani capital to discuss Iran’s nuclear programme last year. But that process was halted as Israel launched a 12-day war with Iran in June, which the US briefly joined by bombing three Iranian nuclear facilities.
The new rounds of negotiations come as tensions in the region remain high, with Trump moving more US military assets to the Middle East. On Friday, the US president said he was sending a second aircraft carrier to the region while openly talking about a change in Iran’s government.
Despite the new push for diplomacy, the two sides have maintained their positions. Iran has shown flexibility in discussing its nuclear programme, but the US wants to widen the talks to include Iran’s ballistic missiles and its support for regional armed groups – two issues that Tehran says are nonnegotiable.

Despite Qatar’s moderate image, its textbooks are filled with antisemitism – report
Schools in country continue to teach Jew-hatred, portray Christians as infidels and idolators, and legitimize violent jihad, IMPACT-se says
Zev Stub is the Times of Israel's Diaspora Affairs correspondent.
School textbooks in Qatar teach antisemitic content, portray Christians and other non-Muslims as infidels and idolators, and legitimize the call for violent jihad, according to a report released last week by the Institute for Monitoring Peace and Cultural Tolerance in School Education (IMPACT-se).
The study, part of IMPACT-se’s research program, examined primary and secondary school textbooks across multiple subjects, measuring them against UNESCO-based standards for peace and tolerance in education.
Despite Qatar’s efforts to present itself as a modern state working for peace in the Middle East, problematic content remained unchanged for the fourth straight year, showing that reforms have effectively “plateaued,” IMPACT-se said. This is despite public condemnation of the curriculum by the US State Department in 2024, it added.
Researchers examined 52 textbooks across subjects including Islamic education, social studies, history, and Arabic literature, and found that they continue to reproduce narratives that contradict Qatar’s international image as a moderate diplomatic hub.
Textbooks portray Jews as “materialistic, arrogant, deceitful, and hostile to Islam.” Jews are associated with traits such as lying, scheming, and breaching agreements.
In history education, the portrayal of the 20th century remains highly problematic. A 12th grade history textbook covering World War II fails to mention the Holocaust, Nazi policies against Jews in Germany and elsewhere, or the antisemitic components of Hitler’s ideology. Instead, the text vaguely alludes to Hitler’s “racist ideas” without identifying the victims of his policies.
The curriculum also often denies Jewish historical ties to the region. The 1917 Balfour Declaration is presented not as a recognition of Jewish national claims, but as a cynical British move to curry favor with “Jewish influence” in the United States and Russia.
Violent interpretations of jihad and the glorification of martyrdom are “prominent features” of the curriculum. Islamic education lessons praise the upbringing of children “to love jihad” and teach that God rewards those who die fighting for Islam with entry into paradise.
Non-Muslims, including Christians, are frequently treated with disrespect, referred to as “infidels” (kufr) and “polytheists.” The curriculum characterizes these faiths as being in a state of “ignorance” and “polytheism” from which the Prophet Muhammad came to rescue humanity.
Textbooks warn students that non-belief in Islam results in eternal punishment in “hellfire.” Objective information about other faiths is rare, and non-Islamic nations, particularly Western countries, are occasionally treated with suspicion.
The curriculum also maintains a consistently anti-Israel stance that often legitimizes violence. Israel is framed exclusively as an “occupation,” and its existence is erased from maps, which label the entire territory as Palestine.
Attacks by Hamas and other terror groups are euphemistically described as “military operations.” Students are encouraged through poetry and prose to “draw swords” and sacrifice their lives in the fight against “the Zionist enemy.”
The curriculum rejects the UN Partition Plan and the two-state solution, asserting that Muslims must not concede “any part” of Palestine.
All of this is at stark odds with the “educational vision grounded in moderation, dialogue, and rejection of hatred” put forward by Qatari officials, the report said.
“Education policy offers a revealing window into how a state understands itself, its values, and its relationship to other nations,” the report said. “Following the Hamas terror organization’s attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, developments within Qatar’s education ecosystem have underscored the persistent gap between official rhetoric and institutional practice.”
Previous investigations by IMPACT-se have found worrying trends in school curricula in European countries like Ireland and Poland. Recent reports on schools in Gaza and Syria have shown continued promotion of antisemitism, violence, and martyrdom within their educational systems.

Poll: Around 62% of Czechs want Prague-led ammunition initiative for Ukraine to keep going
Around 62% of Czech citizens support the continuation of a Prague-led initiative to purchase ammunition for Ukraine.
Source: České noviny, a Czech news outlet, as reported by European Pravda
Details: A poll conducted in January found that 62% of Czechs back the continuation of the Czech-led initiative, while 36% are against it.
Another 3% of respondents were undecided.
Pavel Ranocha, an analyst at Kantar CZ, the Czech branch of the global market research firm Kantar, says almost 100% of opposition party voters back the continuation of the initiative to supply ammunition to Ukraine.
Among supporters of ruling parties, two-thirds of Motorists voters would approve such a decision. Half of ANO supporters and one-fifth of SDP supporters gave the same response.
Background:
- Before taking office as Czech prime minister, Andrej Babiš promised to scrap the Czech-led initiative that helps supply Ukraine with artillery ammunition.
- After a meeting of the Coalition of the Willing in Paris, Babiš said the initiative on ammunition for Ukraine can continue if it is financed by other states.
- A senior NATO official recently said the Czech-led initiative has found significantly more shells than expected.

German Chips Widely Used in Russian UAVs Despite Sanctions

Despite sanctions, German components continue to be found in Russian drones used in attacks on Ukraine. According to journalists, their number may reach hundreds of thousands.
DW reported on this.
Electronic components made by German manufacturers have been identified in Russian UAVs targeting Ukrainian cities. German media again highlighted the issue in January 2026 after analyzing the new Geran-5 jet drone.
In late January 2025, after experts from Ukraine’s Defense Intelligence (DIU) examined the wreckage of a new Russian jet drone, they reported finding transistors produced by Germany’s Infineon Technologies among other foreign components.
According to the DIU, most foreign components in Russian military equipment originate from the United States and China, while 137 items of German origin were documented. More than half were found in drones, with the rest identified in missiles, radar systems, military vehicles, and helicopters.
The most common German components are transistors, accounting for around 50 items. Other parts include pumps, inductors, generators, capacitors, transformers, and batteries. Most of the German transistors were found in UAVs.
The Bavarian company Infineon Technologies accounts for 58 of the 137 identified German components, most of them transistors used in drones. EPCOS AG manufactured seven electronic components found in drones. Nine parts were produced by Würth Elektronik, five of them identified in UAVs. Three pumps made by Pierburg, a subsidiary of Rheinmetall, were found in the Geran-2 UAV.
In an interview with DW, a DIU representative stressed that Russia has recently sought to reduce its dependence on Western components in UAV production. While in 2023, U.S.-made components accounted for up to 80% of parts in some versions of the Shahed-136 family, Chinese components now make up as much as 60%. At the same time, the use of German transistors remains widespread despite sanctions.
According to the DIU, Russian manufacturers have been reluctant to replace German parts with lower-quality Chinese alternatives due to their availability and reliability.
“Infineon transistors are used in a large number of household appliances and general-purpose goods, so there are no significant obstacles to purchasing them in the required quantities,” he said.
DW contacted the German companies whose products were identified in Russian weapons. The manufacturers claimed that they comply with sanctions but acknowledged that controlling the resale of civilian products is extremely difficult. Infineon stated that all deliveries to Russia have been halted since 2022, but added that “it is difficult to control the resale of products throughout their entire life cycle, as Infineon produces about 30 billion chips per year.”
According to DW’s estimates, Russia could require nearly 500,000 German transistors in 2025 for the production of Geran-2 strike drones alone.
The DIU believes that, in many cases, German-made transistors are purchased for Russia directly in Germany via intermediaries to conceal the supply chain. The components are then routed to Russia via third countries considered friendly to the Kremlin or through smuggling channels.
German law professor Viktor Winkler, an expert on sanctions policy, told DW that since 2022, deliveries of components from Germany to Russia have become increasingly likely to be routed directly through German shell companies rather than via third countries.

12 said killed in IDF Gaza strikes, including senior Islamic Jihad commander
Military says it targeted terror operatives after ‘blatant’ ceasefire violation; Nasser Hospital warns MSF of consequences if it doesn’t retract claim of gunmen in hospital
The Israel Defense Forces launched a wave of airstrikes in the Gaza Strip overnight and on Sunday morning, saying it targeted terror operatives in response to a “blatant violation” of the ceasefire a night prior.
At least 12 people were killed in the strikes, Hamas authorities said, with media reports saying that the dead included a senior Palestinian Islamic Jihad commander.
The IDF, in a statement, said it had targeted terror operatives in northern Gaza, Gaza City, and Khan Younis, after five Palestinian gunmen emerged from a tunnel and approached troops on the Israeli side of the ceasefire line on Saturday night.
The targeted terror operatives “had recently been working to restore the capabilities of the terror organizations in the Strip and were advancing terror attacks against IDF troops and the State of Israel,” the military said.
Among those killed in the strikes was a Hamas terrorist — named as Ahmad Bayouk — who infiltrated the Re’im military base during the October 7, 2023, onslaught, according to the IDF.
“The IDF views any violation of the ceasefire agreement with utmost severity and will continue to operate against any attempt by terrorist organizations in the Gaza Strip to carry out attacks against IDF troops and the State of Israel,” the military added.
According to Palestinian media reports, an Israeli airstrike on western Gaza City’s Tel al-Hawa killed a senior commander in the al-Quds Brigades, Palestinian Islamic Jihad’s wing, and wounded several other people.
Media outlets, including the PIJ-affiliated Palestine Today channel, identified the commander as Sami al-Dahdouh, 56.
Dahdouh’s three brothers, including former Quds Brigades commander Khaled Dahdouh, were reportedly assassinated by Israel in separate attacks in Gaza some two decades ago. Other than Dahdouh, the identities of people reported killed were not immediately published in major Palestinian outlets.

The Gaza civil defense agency, which operates as a rescue force under Hamas authorities, said one strike hit a tent of displaced people in northern Gaza and another targeted an area in the south.
Five people were killed and several injured when a separate airstrike targeted a tent sheltering displaced people in Jabalia in the north, the agency said in a statement.
“Israel doesn’t understand ceasefires or truces,” said Osama Abu Askar, who said his nephew was killed in the Jabalia strike. He said the people killed there were hit as they slept.
“We’ve been living under a truce for months, and they’ve still targeted us. Israel operates on this principle — saying one thing and doing another,” Abu Askar told AFP.
Five more people were killed and several injured in a separate early-morning strike in the southern city of Khan Younis, the city’s Nasser Hospital announced. According to the hospital, all five were men in their 20s.
Rami Shaqra told the Associated Press that his son, al-Baraa, was among a group of gunmen who were “securing the area” when they were killed by an airstrike. AP footage from the morgue showed at least two of the men had headbands denoting membership in Hamas’s military wing.
The civil defense agency also said that one person was killed by Israeli gunfire in Beit Lahia in northern Gaza. The reports did not differentiate between civilians and terror operatives.
Hazem Qassem, a Hamas spokesperson in Gaza, accused Israel of committing a new “massacre” against displaced Palestinians. A military official called Sunday’s strikes “precise” and in line with international law.
In a separate incident on Sunday, the military said several Palestinians who were carrying out “suspicious activity on the ground” and approaching troops in the northern Gaza Strip were targeted in an airstrike.
According to the IDF, troops of the Gaza Division’s Northern Brigade identified the terror operatives on the Israeli side of the Yellow Line. The army said that in addition to “carrying out suspicious activity on the ground,” the operatives approached the soldiers “in a manner that posed an immediate threat.”
After they were identified, the Israeli Air Force struck and “eliminated two of the terrorists to remove the threat,” the IDF said. It did not specify what happened to the others.
Meanwhile, the IDF also announced that a strike on Monday, in response to an attack by gunmen on troops in southern Gaza’s Rafah a day prior, killed a Palestinian Islamic Jihad commander.
Azem Abu Huli, who headed Islamic Jihad’s elite forces in the Strip’s center, was responsible for supplying weapons to other terror operatives, as well as advancing attacks against troops, the army said.
Abu Huli also commanded Islamic Jihad terrorists who invaded Israel on October 7, and throughout the war, also trained operatives “to practice scenarios involving the abduction of IDF soldiers,” the IDF added.
Nasser Hospital warns MSF over suspending work due to ‘armed men’
Meanwhile, after Doctors Without Borders announced it was suspending nonessential activities at Nasser Hospital due to the presence of gunmen, the hospital on Sunday accused the aid group, known by its French acronym MSF, of “aiding in manufacturing consent” for potential attacks on the southern Gaza medical center.
The Khan Younis hospital said there will be “foreseeable and grave consequences” if MSF does not retract the statement.
In the English-language press release via the Hamas-run Gaza health ministry, the hospital claimed the presence of armed men “is aimed at securing safety for the staff and patients.”
According to the hospital, the armed men seen on site are not military personnel but rather police carrying out “protective, civilian and lawful” action against “uncontrolled individuals and groups” that have attacked the hospital.
“Despite full transparency and repeated clarification, MSF issued statements that misrepresent facts and mirror narratives historically used to justify attacks on hospitals,” Nasser Hospital said. “MSF is aiding in manufacturing consent for attacks against the hospital.”
The hospital issued a “formal notice” to MSF to “immediately retract” its allegations.
“Failure to do so risks material contribution to the endangerment of a protected medical facility, with foreseeable and grave consequences,” said the hospital.
Last week, MSF said it was suspending its work at the facility due to “a recent situation of suspicion of movement of weapons.” The aid group also said that armed men had been arresting patients.
Israel has long offered evidence of medical facilities’ regular use by Palestinian terror groups as bases of operations due to their protected status. Hostages have also said they were held at Nasser Hospital.
Last year a doctor who also serves as a spokesperson for Nasser Hospital hinted that he had been threatened by Palestinian Islamic Jihad due to his refusal to let the terror group’s operatives enter and use the hospital.
Israel announced earlier this month that it was terminating all the organization’s activities in Gaza and the West Bank after it failed to provide a list of its Palestinian staff. MSF slammed the move, which takes effect on March 1, as a “pretext” to obstruct aid. Israel has accused MSF of having at least two employees who held membership in the Palestinian Islamic Jihad and Hamas terror groups.
MSF has been a key provider of medical and humanitarian aid in Gaza, particularly since the October 7, 2023, Hamas-led invasion and massacre in southern Israel triggered a two-year war in the enclave.

Syria assumes control of another base from US forces, the second within days
Syrian Arab Army takes over Al-Shadadi in northeast of country, close to Jordan-Iraq border; site formerly housed prison where Kurdish forces held Islamic State members
DAMASCUS, Syria — Syria’s defense ministry said on Sunday it had taken over the Al-Shadadi base in the northeast from US forces, days after assuming control of a facility near the Jordan-Iraq borders.
“The forces of the Syrian Arab Army have taken over the Al-Shadadi military base in the Hasakeh countryside following coordination with the American side,” a ministry statement said.
US forces operating as part of the international coalition against the Islamic State group had been stationed at the base outside the town of the same name.
The town housed a prison where Kurdish forces detained members of the extremist jihadist organization, before government forces advanced into the area last month.
Sunday’s announcement follows US confirmation on Thursday that its forces had vacated Al-Tanf base near Syria’s borders with Jordan and Iraq.
The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) were a major partner of the US-led international coalition against ISIS, and were instrumental in the group’s territorial defeat in Syria in 2019.
But following the fall in December 2024 of longtime ruler Bashar al-Assad, the United States has drawn closer to the new government in Damascus, recently declaring that the need for its alliance with the Kurds had largely passed.
Despite ISIS’s territorial defeat, the group remains active, however.
On Saturday, the US Central Command said its forces had struck more than 30 ISIS targets in Syria this month.
A CENTCOM statement said the air strikes between February 3 and 12 hit ISIS “infrastructure and weapons storage targets.

France Considers Purchasing South Korean K239 Chunmoo Multiple Launch Rocket Systems

The French Army is considering the purchase of South Korea’s K239 Chunmoo multiple launch rocket systems as a temporary solution to enhance its long-range strike capability.
According to Opex360, France’s artillery units currently operate only a small number of outdated LRU (M270) launchers. These systems require extensive maintenance and are no longer suited to the demands of modern high-intensity warfare.
France officially plans to develop its own long-range strike system, the FLP-T (Frappe Longue Portée – Terrestre), designed to provide a credible deep-strike capability. However, the system is not expected to enter service before 2030.
As a result, France has examined foreign alternatives, including the U.S.-made M142 HIMARS and Israel’s PULS system. Nevertheless, a recent study by the French think tank IFRI recommends the South Korean K239 Chunmoo, manufactured by Hanwha Aerospace, as the preferred option.
The expert analysis highlights that the K239 Chunmoo is a modern, multi-role, multiple-launch rocket system with a wide range of available munitions and relatively short delivery timelines.
It is already in service or on order in several European countries, including Norway and Estonia, as well as Poland, which is expanding ammunition production in Europe for this system.
Under the 2024–2030 Military Programming Law (LPM), France is focusing on a sovereign solution to replace its M270 LRU launchers as part of the Long Range Land Strike (FLP-T) program. Two teams are working in parallel on the project – Safran/MBDA and Thales/ArianeGroup – with the selection of the winner expected in 2026.
The target specifications for FLP-T include a range of over 150 km, with delivery to the armed forces by 2030, followed by a gradual increase in range to 500–1,000 km. These timelines have prompted France to consider India’s Pinaka multiple-launch rocket system as a temporary measure to bridge the capability gap until the national system enters serial production.
In April 2025, at the exhibition in Le Bourget, the French company unveiled the fully French-made Foudre multiple launch rocket system, positioned in the same category as the American HIMARS.
The developers present it as a “100% French-made” system capable of directly competing with HIMARS.
In October 2025, French defense companies MBDA and Safran developed the Thundart multiple-launch rocket system to compete for a new system of this type for the French Army.

At the World Defense Show 2026 in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, Chinese company SKYFEND presented an interceptor drone and a drone equipped with a radio-electronic reconnaissance (RER) system.
Militarnyi’s correspondent reported on this.
Founded in 2020 and headquartered in Shenzhen, SKYFEND Technology specializes in developing counter-UAV technologies targeting small unmanned aerial vehicles.
The company shared that the Skyfend Thunder interceptor drone uses artificial intelligence for autonomous navigation and interception of aerial threats, including fixed-wing drones.
Guided by ground-based sensors, Thunder can independently calculate interception routes and approach targets. The system incorporates visual recognition algorithms and is designed to autonomously lock onto and intercept targets.
“Key features include a central artificial intelligence core with intelligent data processing, cost-effective threat response, and machine learning algorithms capable of adapting to new types of threats,” the company said.
According to the manufacturer, the probability of successful interception is at least 90% against loitering targets moving at speeds of up to 150 km/h. The maximum takeoff weight is 4 kg, and the maximum interception speed reaches 230 km/h. The cruising speed is 100 km/h.
The tactical range is 5 km, and the service ceiling is 3 km. The drone weighs 3.5 kg. Its dimensions are 731 × 731 × 448 mm with propellers and 420 × 420 × 448 mm without propellers. Flight endurance is up to 7 minutes.
The Skyfend Tracer Air II is an electronic reconnaissance system designed to detect radiation sources across a frequency range of 0.4-6 GHz.
The company says the system provides high-precision three-dimensional direction finding, positioning, and AI-based visual recognition to detect communication channels of unmanned systems in complex electromagnetic environments.
The Tracer Air II can detect and localize UAV control channels in real time, including FPV links, electronic warfare systems, radar stations, and communication nodes.
The system supports autonomous mission management, real-time cloud connectivity, cloud-based operational planning, and AI-assisted targeting.
The carrier platform is the SOA200 UAV, with a total weight of 16.8 kg, including the battery, mounting system, radio detection module, and propellers. The video transmission range exceeds 8 km. Hover time is more than 30 minutes, and the maximum flight duration exceeds 32 minutes with the radio detection module installed.
The drone is equipped with a wide-angle camera with an 84-degree field of view and a STA200 radio detection module operating in the 0.4-6 GHz frequency range. The detection range is at least 3 km for DJI RC Pro controllers (FCC, 33 dBm at 2.4/5.8 GHz) and jamming sources, and at least 10 km for 1 W FPV controllers operating in the 0.4/0.9 GHz bands under line-of-sight conditions without electromagnetic interference.
The direction-finding error is less than 1.5–3.0 degrees, depending on the selected frequency band. The system can simultaneously track at least six targets.
Previously, the Ukrainian company SEE (System Electronic Export), together with NAUDI, presented the SEEDIS air target interception system at the World Defense Show.

The NATO Support and Procurement Agency (NSPA) has placed an order with Rheinmetall for 120mm tank ammunition worth approximately €200 million.
Rheinmetall announced this in a press release.
This order is the first firm contract under the 2025 framework agreement for 120mm ammunition. The end customers will be various NATO countries.
The framework agreement signed with NSPA in July 2025 outlines the terms and conditions, as well as the technical specifications, for various types of 120mm tank ammunition. NATO countries and states with equivalent status can use this framework agreement to streamline the procurement of Rheinmetall ammunition.
They can order them directly through NSPA, which significantly simplifies the procurement process of 120mm tank ammunition within the Alliance.
Rheinmetall is actively increasing its ammunition production capacity in Europe. For instance, in the fall of 2025, it was announced that agreements had been made to build new ammunition factories in Lithuania, Latvia, Romania, and Bulgaria.
According to the plan, the company aims to produce at least 1.1 million 155mm artillery shells annually by 2027.

19:50:37 KST

Latvia will receive the first of the 84 ordered ASCOD infantry fighting vehicles (IFVs), known locally in the Latvian Armed Forces as Hunter, in spring 2026.
The Spanish outlet elEconomista reported on this.
According to the media, Santa Bárbara Sistemas, the manufacturer of the ASCOD IFV, has signed a contract with Piedrafita, a company specializing in suspension systems for defense vehicles, to supply the suspension system for the Hunter IFVs destined for Latvia.
The first suspension system units have already been delivered and are currently being integrated at the Santa Bárbara Sistemas plant in Trubia, where the Hunter IFVs are being assembled and prepared for delivery under the international contract.
The Hunter IFV, developed on the ASCOD platform in line with the requirements of Latvia’s Ministry of Defence, will be equipped with a suspension system manufactured by Piedrafita. Santa Bárbara Sistemas, a subsidiary of the U.S.-based General Dynamics, stated that this cooperation “strengthens the export of national technologies and the role of the Spanish defense industry within Europe.”
According to the media, the first IFVs are expected to arrive in Latvia this spring, one year after the Latvian Ministry of Defence signed the contract for the initial batch.
The procurement process started in early 2023 and included several stages, notably a comprehensive pre-selection of potential suppliers.
In the autumn of the same year, functional trials of various IFV types were conducted to assess their performance characteristics under real-world conditions.
After the trials were completed, the Latvian National Armed Forces conducted a detailed analysis that considered factors such as compliance with operational requirements, technical specifications, available equipment, total life-cycle cost, delivery timelines, and the level of local industrial participation.
As a result of the evaluation, the ASCOD platform was selected. The contract for the delivery of the first batch of ASCOD infantry fighting vehicles was signed on January 30, 2025. Its value amounted to €387 million. In June 2025, the Latvian Cabinet of Ministers approved the Ministry of Defence’s proposal to procure an additional 42 ASCOD IFVs at the same price. The first vehicles are planned to enter service by autumn 2026.
The procurement contract also covers partial localization of production. Assembly and maintenance of the ASCOD IFVs will take place at the Patria armored vehicle production facility of Defense Partnership Latvia (DPL) in Valmiera, which was opened in May 2024.
According to the Latvian Ministry of Defence, the ASCOD IFVs will be equipped with an automatic cannon, anti-tank guided missiles, a machine gun, and “other modern technologies” to enhance soldiers’ situational awareness on the battlefield.
The IFV crew consists of three servicemen. The vehicle can transport and deploy six fully equipped soldiers.
The ASCOD features Level 4 ballistic protection under the STANAG 4569 standard – capable of withstanding 14.5 mm armor-piercing rounds – as well as Level 4a/4b mine protection, corresponding to resistance against the detonation of 10 kg of explosives.

Israeli man said arrested in UAE over killing of alleged crypto fraudster
Michael Greenberg, a private detective working in Thailand, reportedly found to have ties with group of Russians suspected of gruesome slaying of Roman and Anna Novak last year
An Israeli man was arrested about three months ago in Dubai in connection with the killings of an alleged crypto scam artist and his wife, Hebrew-language media reported Sunday.
Michael Greenberg (also known as Mike Green), a private investigator in Thailand, is not suspected of killing Russian national Roman Novak and his wife Anna in the United Arab Emirates last year, but is alleged to have had some kind of involvement, according to Channel 12, which cited a report last week from the Intelligence Online website.
Greenberg is suspected of having ties to eight suspects in the case who have been arrested. Russian investigators found information on the suspects’ phones that led to Greenberg being arrested in Dubai, according to the report.
There was no immediate comment from the Foreign Ministry.
In November, the New York Post and other outlets reported that Novak raised $500 million through the creation of a fraudulent cryptocurrency app, then went on the run with the money.
Novak and his wife Anna, who were living in the UAE, were apparently lured by criminals to a desert location where an extortion attempt took place.
According to the report, when the kidnappers found that Novak’s crypto wallet was empty, they apparently murdered the pair and dismembered them.
A December report from the Daily Mail, which cited Russian newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda, said the husband and wife were forced to watch each other being tortured and that their remains were encased in concrete, and then dumped in the desert where they were eventually found by investigators.

BREST, 15 February (BelTA) – The 38th Independent Guards Air Assault Brigade is in the highest state of readiness for the duration of the ongoing snap inspection of Belarus’ Armed Forces. The units of the Special Forces Command in Brest under review are ready to carry out missions, BelTA learned from Sergei Kuprik, Advisor to the State Secretary of the Security Council.
In line with the Armed Forces’ combat readiness inspection plan upon the decision of the head of state the 38th brigade was brought to the highest state of readiness on 10 February. The paratroopers had to pass a tactical and special training exam during the first stage. An evaluation of their firearm qualifications and physical fitness qualifications began after that.
“They completed a series of tactical qualifications and tasks. They handled them successfully. They began conducting qualifications in firearms training and physical fitness. Yesterday they passed their physical fitness qualifications with flying colors. They did pull-ups in combat conditions in the open air. It should not be any other way for paratroopers. Today they are going through a 5km forced march with full gear. Tomorrow they will continue with qualifications in firearms training by shooting from armored personnel carriers and small arms during the day and at night. A realistic picture will be reported to the head of state as a result,” said Sergei Kuprik.
He assessed the combat readiness of the Brest paratroopers. “It can be said without a doubt that the units under review are ready to carry out their missions,” emphasized the advisor to the state secretary of the Security Council.
The days of the inspection were marked by unstable weather, which manifested itself in frost, snow, thaw, rain, fog, and ice. Sergei Kuprik emphasized that it should in no way affect the accomplishment of tasks by military personnel. “If the weather is bad, will we not defend our Motherland? Out of the question. We must carry out our tasks in any conditions,” noted the advisor to the state secretary of the Security Council.
BelTA reported earlier that the large-scale inspection of the Armed Forces began on 16 January upon instructions of the Belarus president. The primary goal is to see an objective picture, a real state of the troops, and evaluate actions of the military personnel.

MINSK, 15 February (BelTA) – Internationalist warriors defend national interests together with the entire Belarusian nation. State Secretary of the Security Council of Belarus Aleksandr Volfovich made the statement during a rally held on the Island of Courage and Sorrow in Minsk on 15 February. The rally was dedicated to the 37th anniversary of the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan, BelTA has learned.
Aleksandr Volfovich said: “Internationalist warriors have made a significant contribution and today together with the entire Belarusian nation they defend national interests and continue doing their part by bringing up the younger generation. We thank them for what they did back then and we thank them for what they do today.”
The state secretary of the Security Council noted that participants of the rally traditionally gather on the Island of Courage and Sorrow to pay tribute to and honor the memory of internationalist soldiers, participants in the Afghan War, and participants in all local conflicts.
He noted that no one back then thought that this war would drag on for many years. During the Afghan War more than 620,000 Soviet military personnel fulfilled their duty, demonstrated courage, and remained true to their oath, helping the Afghan people defend their freedom and independence.
“In addition to combat operations the Soviet citizens carried out a noble mission: they built schools, hospitals, enterprises, and helped develop the national economy,” Aleksandr Volfovich added.
Today the world has not become simpler. The geopolitical situation is probably even more acute and complex than it was then, the state secretary of the Security Council continued. But the Belarusian nation knows and remembers its history. After all, those who ignore the lessons of history risk repeating its terrible pages. “More than 60 conflicts of varying intensity are taking place in the world. Perhaps the most striking conflict is near the borders of the Republic of Belarus, in the territory of Ukraine,” he said.
“The Belarusian nation does not want to repeat what happened more than 80 years ago when our grandfathers and great-grandfathers fought to defend and protect the world from Nazism and fascism,” Aleksandr Volfovich emphasized. “We respect our grandfathers and great-grandfathers, we respect the internationalist soldiers who carried out a noble mission. This is why matters of historical memory in our country are considered to be a national interest”.
In his comments to reporters the state secretary of the Security Council mentioned an important task: it is necessary to use such events as examples in order to educate the younger generation so that young people would know that peace and security are the most precious things. This is why today in Belarus all measures are being taken to preserve a peaceful and secure sky over the country’s territory.
“And Afghan War veterans certainly do a lot. They educate generations, they pass on their experience, they are examples of patriotic citizens of their country, and this is very important. This is why such events are held everywhere today. Our head of state attaches great importance to these events,” said Aleksandr Volfovich, adding that the annual address to internationalist soldiers, veterans of the war in Afghanistan, which was read out during the rally today, confirms it.

U.S. Air Force Denies Rumors About Missing Radars on New F-35A Jets

The U.S. Air Force has denied reports that new F-35A fighter jets are being delivered without onboard radars.
According to The War Zone, which cited an official U.S. military response, the Air Force confirmed that Lot 17 F-35A aircraft are currently being supplied with AN/APG-81 radar systems.
“Lot 17 F-35A aircraft are being delivered to the U.S. Air Force with AN/APG-81 radars,” a U.S. Air Force spokesperson told The War Zone.
Previously, Defense Daily claimed that beginning in June 2025, F-35A jets were being delivered without radars.
The journalist claimed that the reason was the lack of readiness of the new AN/APG-85 radar systems, which were planned for use in the latest production batches of the fighter.
According to the media, developers had not completed work on the AN/APG-85, and the older AN/APG-81 version allegedly could not be installed due to modified mounting points.
The publication’s sources claimed that, to maintain proper balance, weight ballast was being installed on the aircraft instead of radars.
Meanwhile, photos of an F-35A fighter fitted with metal disc-shaped weights started circulating online, presented as supposed evidence that the aircraft was being delivered without radars.
Photos of an F-35A fighter fitted with weight ballast instead of a radar, circulated online as “proof” of problems with the new aircraft, actually show a training airframe used by emergency response crews.
This aircraft is not part of the new production batches of the fighter jet.
The photo shows the first-of-its-kind Course for Damaged Disabled Aircraft Recovery (CDDAR), held at Hill Air Force Base in Utah.
A decommissioned F-35A airframe was used to train personnel.
This aircraft sustained significant damage in 2016 due to an engine fire while stationed at Mountain Home Air Force Base.
Because the cost of repairs was deemed excessive, the aircraft was written off and later converted into a training platform.
Specialists from the 388th Maintenance Group, together with the F-35 Joint Program Office, assembled the aircraft over three weeks using parts that had been stored in depots.
The training platform is used to practice scenarios that cannot be performed on operational aircraft due to the high risk of damage.
In particular, during the five-day course, 29 technicians from the United States and partner countries practiced:
It was precisely to simulate the aircraft’s actual weight and center of gravity during such operations that weight ballast was installed on this training airframe, which ultimately led to false reports.

Iran willing to compromise on nuclear deal if sanctions relief on table, diplomat says
Deputy FM tells BBC ‘ball is in America’s court,’ says talks have been ‘positive’; Iran won’t give up missiles, senior diplomat says, calling them ‘defensive capabilities’
Iran is ready to consider compromises to reach a nuclear deal with the United States if Washington is willing to discuss lifting sanctions, Iran’s Deputy Foreign Minister Majid Takht-Ravanchi told the BBC in an interview broadcast on Sunday.
Iran has said it is prepared to discuss curbs on its nuclear program in return for the lifting of sanctions, but has repeatedly ruled out linking the issue to other questions including its missile arsenal.
“The ball is in America’s court,” he said, “to prove that they want to do a deal.”
“Sanctions have to also be on the table,” Takht-Ravanchi said, referring to the crippling international sanctions that his country faces, which have contributed to the near-collapse of the Iranian economy.
Takht-Ravanchi confirmed that a second round of nuclear talks would take place on Tuesday in Geneva, after Tehran and Washington resumed discussions in Oman earlier this month.
“(Initial talks went) more or less in a positive direction, but it is too early to judge,” Takht-Ravanchi told the BBC.
Asked if his country was willing to transfer its stockpile of enriched uranium to a third country, the diplomat said “it was too early to say what will happen in the course of negotiations.”
Iran’s atomic chief said on Monday the country could agree to dilute its most highly enriched uranium in exchange for all financial sanctions being lifted. Takht-Ravanchi used this example in the BBC interview to highlight Iran’s flexibility, though he pushed back on the idea that Tehran would fully give up its ability to enrich. The “issue of zero enrichment is not an issue anymore and as far as Iran is concerned, it is not on the table anymore,” he said.
The diplomat also pushed back on the idea of giving up Iran’s ballistic missile arsenal, which Israel seeks to include in any deal between the Washington and Tehran.
“When we were attacked by Israelis and Americans, our missiles came to our rescue so how can we accept depriving ourselves of our defensive capabilities?” Takht-Ravanchi said, referring to last year’s 12-day war with Israel, during which Iran launched hundreds of missiles at Israel, which killed nearly three dozen Israeli civilians and wounded thousands.
“We are hearing that they are interested in negotiations,” the senior diplomat said, though he lamented the mixed messages from the US, noting that what Trump says publicly is different from the messages Iran receives in private. “They have said it publicly; they have said it in private conversations through Oman that they are interested to have these matters resolved peacefully.”
Trump has repeatedly threated to use military force against Iran if the talks fail, and said Friday that regime change “seems like that would be the best thing that could happen.”
“We are not hearing that in the private messages,” Takht-Ravanchi said, adding: “If we feel this is an existential threat, we will respond accordingly.”
“It is not wise to even think about such a very dangerous scenario because the whole region will be in a mess,” he added.
“We see an almost unanimous agreement in the region against war,” he continued. “We are hopeful we can do this through diplomacy, although we can’t be 100 percent sure.”
“We will do our best but the other side also has to prove that they are also sincere,” Takht-Ravanchi said.
A US delegation, including envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, will meet with the Iranians on Tuesday morning, a source had told Reuters on Friday, with Omani representatives mediating the US-Iran contacts.
Iran, whose leaders are sworn to destroy Israel, denies seeking to acquire nuclear weapons, but has enriched uranium to levels that have no peaceful application, obstructed international inspectors from checking its nuclear facilities, and expanded its ballistic missile capabilities.
The Islamic Republic has refused to expand the scope of the negotiations to include its ballistic missile program and support for regional proxy forces, which Israel is demanding be included in any deal.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, returning from a meeting with Trump at the White House, on Thursday said any agreement with Iran must cover “not only the nuclear issue, but also ballistic missiles and Iran’s regional proxies.”
The premier expressed “general skepticism about the possibility of reaching any agreement with Iran,” but said Trump believes the Iranians could be forced into “a good deal.”

India plans to increase orders for French Rafale fighter jets.
According to La Tribune, in addition to the 114 aircraft planned under the MRFA program, India intends to purchase 31 carrier-based fighters for deployment on its aircraft carriers.
If the contract is finalized, the total number of Rafale jets ordered by India will increase to 145.
For Dassault Aviation and India, this would represent a strategic milestone.
In addition to the 36 aircraft contracted by India’s Ministry of Defence in 2016, the country ordered 26 new Rafale M fighters for the Navy in 2025.
In September 2016, the governments of India and France signed an intergovernmental agreement for the supply of 36 multirole fighter jets.
The value of that contract amounted to €7.87 billion. Dassault Aviation has already completed delivery of the entire batch, enabling the Indian Air Force to form two full squadrons.
The procurement is primarily a political choice by New Delhi. France’s Dassault Aviation, together with India’s defense industry, is implementing a production localization program.
The key Indian partner is the private company Reliance Defence, which is part of the joint venture Dassault Reliance Aerospace Limited (DRAL). The production facilities are located in Nagpur.
At the initial stage, the Indian side will focus on manufacturing fuselages and airframe components.
France is also involving the state-owned corporation Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) in maintenance operations and the future integration of Indian weapons systems.
In addition, France is granting India exclusive rights to manufacture certain components and precision-guided weapons.
In particular, Indian enterprises will begin producing modular AASM Hammer (Armement Air-Sol Modulaire) aerial bombs.
Previously, these munitions were manufactured exclusively by the French company Safran Electronics & Defense.

Strike drones attacked the main oil and gas facility in the village of Volna, Krasnodar Krai.
The regional operational headquarters reported the attack and its aftermath.
According to official information, one of the petroleum product storage tanks caught fire. Russian sources claim the blaze was caused by falling debris.
However, downplaying the causes and consequences remains a standard propaganda tactic of the Russian authorities.
Veniamin Kondratyev, Krasnodar Krai Governor, noted that, in addition to the storage tanks, a warehouse and terminal facilities were also damaged.
However, the official did not provide further details about the extent of the destruction.
The settlement of Volna hosts one of the key logistical facilities of Russia’s fuel and energy complex on the Black Sea.
This refers to the terminal of the company Tamanneftegaz (part of the OTÉKO Group), which operates at the Port of Taman near Cape Zhelezny Rog.
The facility plays an important role in supporting Russian oil exports and in the logistics of the Russian Black Sea Fleet, given its proximity to the Crimean Bridge and the occupied peninsula.
According to available information, the terminal’s capacity reaches about 19.9 million tons of oil and petroleum products per year.
The facility’s tank farm for storing petroleum products and liquefied gas has a total capacity of over 1 million cubic meters.
It is worth noting that this is not the first attack on the oil and gas facility. In particular, on January 21, 2026, the Ukrainian Defense Forces struck oil infrastructure at the Russian Port of Taman in Krasnodar Krai.
At that time, four petroleum product storage tanks caught fire on the terminal’s premises.
In addition, the previous attack on the Port of Taman took place two months earlier – on the night of December 21–22, 2025, when drones also targeted the facility.

MINSK, 15 February (BelTA) – A tactical exercise involving a unit of an air defense missile regiment took place in a military training area of the Air Force and Air Defense Command on 14 February, representatives of the Belarusian Defense Ministry told BelTA.
The unit marched to the designated area and practiced switching the vehicles from a travelling configuration to the combat configuration, changing positions, and accomplishing air defense engagement tasks.
The training exercise proceeded in conditions resembling an actual combat as much as possible: the unit had to deal with sabotage and reconnaissance forces and drones, get across a polluted sector of terrain along barely passable routes while dealing with electronic countermeasures all the time. Weather conditions that were not characteristic of the region represented an additional complication.

Obama deplores lack of shame after Trump racist monkey clip
In interview, former US president asserts most Americans find such behavior ‘deeply troubling,’ will hurt Republicans in midterms; denounces ‘dictatorship-like’ immigration policies
WASHINGTON, United States — Former US president Barack Obama criticized a lack of shame and decorum in the country’s political discourse, responding Saturday for the first time to a post on Donald Trump’s social media account that depicted him and first lady Michelle as monkeys.
In a wide-ranging podcast interview with left-wing political commentator Brian Tyler Cohen released Saturday, Obama also likened the actions of agents enforcing the president’s immigration crackdown in Minnesota to those of dictatorships.
The video, shared on Trump’s Truth Social account on February 5, sparked censure across the US political spectrum, with the White House initially rejecting “fake outrage” only to then blame the post on an error by a staff member and take it down.
Near the end of a one-minute-long video promoting conspiracies about Trump’s 2020 election loss to Joe Biden, the Obamas — the first Black president and first lady in US history — were shown with their faces on the bodies of monkeys for about one second.
“The discourse has devolved into a level of cruelty that we haven’t seen before… Just days ago, Donald Trump put a picture of you, your face on an ape’s body,” Cohen said in the interview.
“And so again, we’ve seen the devolution of the discourse. How do we come back from a place that we have fallen into?”
Without naming Trump, Obama responded by saying the majority of Americans “find this behavior deeply troubling.”
“There’s this sort of clown show that’s happening in social media and on television, and what is true is that there doesn’t seem to be any shame about this among people who used to feel like you had to have some sort of decorum and a sense of propriety and respect for the office, right? That’s been lost.”
‘Rogue behavior’
Obama predicted that such messaging would hurt Trump’s Republicans in midterm elections, saying, “ultimately, the answer is going to come from the American people.”
Trump has told reporters he stood by the thrust of the video’s claims about election fraud, but that he had not seen the offensive clip at the end.
It is absolutely positively real. Donald Trump posted this video that depicts the Obamas as apes. It’s 59 seconds into the video.
I just screen grabbed it for the people who are saying it isn’t true.
Was it snuck in there? If so it needs the apology of all time. pic.twitter.com/0ALSFH1Il0

Turning to Trump’s policies, Obama criticized his immigration crackdown in Minnesota and blasted the conduct of agents during the controversial weeks-long operation that was brought to an end this week.
Obama called the behavior of federal officers, which included two fatal shootings that sparked mounting pressure on Trump’s mass crackdown, as the sort that “in the past we’ve seen in authoritarian countries and we’ve seen in dictatorships.”
Thousands of federal agents — including those with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) — carried out weeks of sweeping raids and arrests in what the Trump administration claims were targeted missions against criminals.
“The rogue behavior of agents of the federal government is deeply concerning and dangerous,” Obama said.
But he added he had found hope in communities pushing back against the operations.
“Not just randomly, but in a systematic, organized way, citizens saying, ‘this is not the America we believe in,’ and we’re going to fight back, and we’re going to push back with the truth and with cameras and with peaceful protests,” he said.
“That kind of heroic, sustained behavior in subzero weather by ordinary people is what should give us hope. As long as we have folks doing that, I feel like we’re going to get through this.”
The aggressive immigration operation in Minnesota had triggered large protests and nationwide outrage.
The Department of Homeland Security was subject to a partial government shutdown Saturday as US lawmakers fought over funding the agency overseeing much of Trump’s immigration crackdown.
Democrats are opposing any new DHS funding until major changes are implemented over how ICE conducts its operations.

After overseeing rough handling of Palestinian prisoners, Ben Gvir posts proud video

After overseeing rough handling of Palestinian prisoners, Ben Gvir posts proud video
Far-right minister tours Ofer Prison with relatives of terror victims, boasts of tough policies as bound inmates paraded at gunpoint; prisoners’ rights group decries ‘revenge’ tactics
National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir toured a prison where he oversaw guards roughly manhandling Palestinian security prisoners, posting on Saturday a video of the visit in which he boasted about the implementation of his minimalist policy for inmate conditions.
A Palestinian prisoner’s rights organization accused Ben Gvir, whose portfolio includes the Israel Prison Service, of exacting “revenge” on detainees.
Just days before the start of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, far-right Ben Gvir visited Ofer Prison in the West Bank, accompanied by Prison Service chief Kobi Yaakobi as well as relatives of victims of deadly Palestinian terror attacks.
In footage filmed on Friday, around 20 police officers are seen storming a hallway leading to prison cells, brandishing their weapons and firing stun grenades.
They then pull five detainees from their cells, their hands tied behind their backs, and force them face-down onto the floor.
“It is simply a source of pride — arriving at a prison like this, a prison for terrorists, the vilest of the vile, seeing them like this,” Ben Gvir said in the video, while offering no context or explanation for the depicted scenes.
“I want one more thing: to execute them — the death penalty for terrorists,” he added as he stood in a cell, gesturing towards a group of prisoners lying piled together, face down, their arms bound behind them, in a corner of the room.
הגעתי יחד עם משפחות שכולות לעקוב מקרוב אחר ההיערכות לרמדאן ולוודא שמדיניות המינימום שאני מוביל יחד עם נציב שב״ס מיושמת במלואה, בלי הנחות למחבלים.
באתי לחזק ויצאתי מחוזק.
הרגע שבו נתי סמדר, שאיבד את אביו בפיגוע הנורא בקרית יובל, הודה לי, נתן לי כוח להמשיך.מחויב למשפחות השכולות… pic.twitter.com/siG0yAD557

The visit took place as a bill proposing the death penalty for Palestinian prisoners convicted of terrorism awaited a final vote in the Knesset.
“This is all part of ongoing displays meant to take revenge on Palestinian detainees,” Abdallah al‑Zaghari, head of the Palestinian Prisoners’ Club, told AFP on Saturday.
“Everything Ben Gvir and the far‑right government are doing affects not only the Palestinian people and prisoners in detention camps — it also impacts the global legal and human rights system,” he added.
The Hamas terror group on Saturday said Ben Gvir’s remarks were “a new war crime and a blatant challenge to international humanitarian law regarding prisoners.”
Ben Gvir, known for his inflammatory rhetoric, is considered one of the hardest-line members of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s ruling coalition.
The minister, who took up his position at the end of 2022, has repeatedly boasted of making conditions more difficult for security prisoners, including reducing rations, arguing he was “here to make sure the terrorists get the bare minimum.”
In September, the High Court of Justice ruled that the IPS was failing to provide enough food for Palestinian detainees and ordered conditions be improved. Still, recent testimony from released prisoners indicates conditions have not changed, with some reporting extreme hunger and abuse.
Previous reports compiled in 2024 from the Public Defender’s Office of Israel’s Justice Ministry showed that Palestinian security detainees held in Israeli prisons suffered from severe and systematic violence from prison guards, deprivation of food, and medical neglect, while also having been subjected to unsanitary conditions that caused and exacerbated outbreaks of disease in the prisons.
Independent verification of the treatment of detainees has become more difficult since the start of the war in Gaza following the Hamas-led October 7, 2023, attack, when Israel barred prison visits by the International Committee of the Red Cross, a role the Geneva-based body has played in conflicts around the world for a century.
International rights groups have repeatedly warned of alleged abuse and mistreatment inflicted in Israeli prisons since Hamas’s October 7, 2023, attack that killed 1,200 people in southern Israel and triggered the war. A ceasefire was reached in October 2025.
While the death penalty exists for a small number of crimes in Israel, the last person to be executed was the Nazi Holocaust perpetrator Adolf Eichmann, in 1962.
