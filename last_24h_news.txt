An Australian man who described Jews as “the greatest enemy” of the nation during a public rally has been sentenced to one year in prison, in one of the first high-profile cases prosecuted under Australia’s recently expanded hate crime laws.
Brandon Koschl, 31, was arrested after delivering an antisemitic speech at an anti-immigration march in Sydney on Australia Day, January 26. During the 40-second speech, Koschl accused Jewish groups of influencing hate speech laws and claimed Jews were responsible for undermining Western civilization.
“Jews are the greatest enemy of this nation,” Koschl said, according to remarks cited in court. “They are the enemy of Western civilization.”
The speech, which drew applause from some in the crowd, was circulated online and sparked widespread condemnation.
Judge Sharon Freund found Koschl guilty of publicly inciting racial hatred and causing fear. She ruled that the remarks were “clearly antisemitic” and amounted to vilification of the Jewish people.
Freund said Koschl was aware that his comments could be redistributed and potentially contribute to an increase in violence. She also noted the vulnerability of Australia’s Jewish community following the Hanukkah terror attack in Bondi, in which 15 people were killed. “We will not tolerate signs or normalization of hatred directed at the Jewish people,” Freund said, adding that the sentence was intended to deter others.
Koschl pleaded guilty, and the court noted that he had shown no remorse. Freund said she had carefully considered whether Koschl’s remarks met the threshold for prosecution under the anti-hate law. “The laws were enacted in response to antisemitic acts,” she said. “Violence begins with language.”

Cyber CEO released to house arrest after shooting 15-year-old

The Central District Court in Lod on Thursday rejected a police appeal and ordered the release to house arrest of the CEO of a cyber company suspected of shooting a 15-year-old boy near Yavne. The suspect had been held in custody for 10 days.
Judge Abbas Assi ruled that the executive would remain under house arrest until Feb. 24. “The wall of silence is deafening,” police said in response to the decision.
The shooting occurred last week in Moshav Ben Zakai in central Israel. According to an initial investigation, residents suspected the teenager and his friends of attempting to break into a building. A confrontation developed, during which the cyber company CEO — who serves in a local civilian emergency response squad — was stabbed and sustained very light injuries.
Police allege that in response, he drew his weapon and shot the teenager. The boy’s friends drove him toward a gas station at the southern exit of Yavne. The teen himself called police and reported that he had been shot in the abdomen.
The CEO is suspected of discharging a weapon in a built-up area and obstructing an investigation.
His attorneys, Gilad Baum and Hedva Baum, said their client is “a salt-of-the-earth Israeli” whom police are portraying as a criminal. They described him as a commander in the local emergency squad with no criminal record, a police volunteer, a firearms instructor and a holder of high-level security clearance.
“He responded to a WhatsApp alert from the moshav about three masked individuals entering,” his lawyers said. “From his perspective, he arrived at what he believed was a terrorist incident. During the event he was stabbed in the thigh. He is in severe emotional distress.”
They added that even after days of investigation, police have not fully clarified what happened. “He left his home as a member of the emergency squad believing there was a terrorist infiltration. He was stabbed in the leg, and the single shot may have been accidental discharge — possibly self-defense.”
During the hearing, Gilad Baum said: “A salt-of-the-earth Israeli goes out as part of an emergency squad established by police to defend the moshav. From his perspective this was a terrorist incident. Let us not forget we are after Oct. 7. He finds himself entangled, and police are acting as if they caught a criminal.”
Judge Assi, after reviewing investigative materials from the Shfela District police unit, appeared to question the sequence of events. According to statements made in court, investigators are still uncertain who stabbed the emergency squad member — an injury that allegedly led to the shooting.
A police representative argued there was concern the suspect could obstruct the investigation if released. He said that despite multiple opportunities, the emergency squad member did not report the incident to the police emergency hotline.
“Everything points to a wall of silence between him and others in the moshav,” the police representative said. “He did not activate the emergency squad. Everything happened in the dark. There is a public interest in getting to the truth.”
A resident of the moshav defended the suspect, saying, “They are treating him like the worst of criminals. We are ashamed of what was done to him. Suddenly masked men who arrive in a moshav at midnight become teenagers who came to spray graffiti. It hurts us. He is an amazing person. On his own initiative he would guard outside the synagogue to give us a sense of security. Let it be known that anyone who holds a weapon as part of an emergency squad could get into trouble and be left alone.”
The court imposed a gag order on the CEO’s identity, citing his security-related occupation.

MINSK, February 19. /TASS/. The United States did not issue entry visas to members of the Belarusian delegation to the Board of Peace meeting, despite the fact that Minsk complied with all necessary procedures, the Belarusian foreign ministry said.
According to the ministry, the Belarusian side in due time informed the meeting’s organizers that in accordance with President Alexander Lukashenko’s decision, the country will be represented by Foreign Minister Maxim Ryzhenkov. All necessary formal notifications were sent to the US protocol services as per established procedures. The documents for visas were submitted well in advance. "But despite the fact that we fulfilled all required procedures, our delegation was not issued visas," the ministry said.
"In this situation, we have a logical question: what kind of peace and what kind of consistency are they talking about when the organizers failed to carry out even basic formalities for our participation? And it was US president [Donald Trump] that sent an invitation to take part in the Board of Peace meeting to the Belarusian head of state. Enough said," the ministry added.

Trump outlines global commitments to rebuild Gaza during Board of Peace debut
The gathering in Washington comes as Trump seeks to cultivate a reputation as a peacemaker, even as the US escalates threats against Iran and bolsters its military presence in the region
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
U.S. President Donald Trump convened the inaugural meeting of his Board of Peace on Thursday, announcing that nations had pledged $7 billion towards a Gaza reconstruction fund.
The ambitious initiative aims to rebuild the war-torn enclave, but hinges on the disarmament of Hamas, an objective currently far from realisation. The gathering in Washington comes as Trump seeks to cultivate a reputation as a peacemaker, even as the United States escalates threats against Iran and bolsters its military presence in the region.
The substantial sum for Gaza’s recovery was reportedly contributed by countries including Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, the United Arab Emirates, Morocco, Bahrain, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Uzbekistan, and Kuwait. Trump also declared that the United States would contribute $10 billion to the Board of Peace, though he did not specify the source of these funds or whether congressional approval would be sought. Further pledges included: $75 million from FIFA for football-related projects in Gaza and $2 billion from the United Nations for humanitarian assistance. These figures, however, fall significantly short of the estimated $70 billion required to rebuild Gaza, which has been devastated by two years of conflict.
The Board’s membership is predominantly comprised of Middle Eastern nations, alongside leaders from outside the region who may be seeking to curry favour with Trump.
Notably, some key Western allies, concerned about the initiative's scope, are absent. While Israel is a member, Palestinian representatives are not included. Trump’s suggestion that the Board’s remit could extend beyond Gaza to address other global "hotspots" has sparked anxiety that it might undermine the United Nations' established role in international diplomacy.
Despite this, Trump asserted, "We're going to strengthen the United Nations," even as the US faces arrears in its payments to the global body. Norway, initially cited by Trump as a host for a Board event, later clarified it was not joining the initiative.
A significant component of the plan involves the deployment of an International Stabilisation Force to Gaza. Trump stated that several nations are preparing to send thousands of troops, with Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto announcing a contribution of up to 8,000 personnel.
This force, led by a US general with an Indonesian deputy, is intended to begin operations in Israeli-controlled areas, starting with Rafah, to train a new police force. The ultimate goal, according to Trump, is to prepare 12,000 police officers and deploy 20,000 troops.
The disarmament of Hamas remains a critical and contentious issue. Trump expressed hope that force would not be necessary, claiming Hamas had promised to disarm and "looks like they're going to be doing that, but we'll have to find out." However, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu issued a stark warning, stating, "Very soon, Hamas will face a dilemma - to disarm peacefully or disarmed forcefully."
In Gaza, Hamas spokesperson Hazem Qassem indicated that any international force must "monitor the ceasefire and prevent the (Israeli) occupation from continuing its aggression," adding that disarmament could be discussed without a direct commitment. Hamas, which has resumed administration of the enclave, claims it is ready to hand over to a US-backed committee of Palestinian technocrats, but alleges Israel has blocked their entry into Gaza.
The Board of Peace meeting unfolded against a backdrop of heightened tensions with Iran. Even as Trump presented himself as a proponent of peace, he maintained a hawkish stance towards Tehran, stating he expected to know within 10 days whether a "meaningful deal" to end the standoff was possible. The event itself reportedly bore the hallmarks of a Trump campaign rally, complete with blaring music from his eclectic playlist and attendees receiving red Trump hats.
U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio underscored the gravity of the situation, stating, "We have to get this right. There is no plan B for Gaza. Plan B is going back to war. No one here wants that." The path forward for the Board of Peace, particularly regarding Hamas disarmament and the broader geopolitical landscape, presents considerable challenges.

Five Key Takeaways From Trump’s First Gaza Board of Peace Meeting

04:32:32 KST

President Donald Trump convened the inaugural meeting of his newly formed Board of Peace at the United States Institute of Peace headquarters on Thursday, unveiling funding pledges and outlining plans for Gaza’s reconstruction.
Trump first announced the initiative at the World Economic Forum in Davos last month, presenting it as part of Phase Two of his U.N.-endorsed 20-point peace plan for Gaza. He invited dozens of countries to join the board.
But several close U.S. allies have hesitated to participate or refused to do so, amid concerns that the structure could sideline the United Nations. Reports that permanent membership would be granted to countries that contribute $1 billion in cash within the first year have also raised questions about whether authoritarian governments could gain influence within the body.
The meeting brought together Trump, who serves as chairman of the board, Vice President J.D. Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, Special Envoy Steve Witkoff, and representatives from participating countries. FIFA President Gianni Infantino was the only attendee not serving in a political role.
Trump opened by praising board members and criticizing allies who have not joined the initiative, accusing them of “playing cute.”
Here are five key takeaways from the meeting.
Trump vowed $10 billion U.S. commitment
Trump announced that the United States would contribute $10 billion to the Board of Peace.
“The Board of Peace is showing how a better future can be built, starting right here in this room,” he said. “I want to let you know that the United States is going to make a contribution of $10 billion to the Board of Peace.”
He did not clarify whether his Administration has formally requested congressional approval for the funds, which would be required.
“We've had great support for that number,” Trump added. “That number is a very small number. When you look at that compared to the cost of war, that's two weeks of fighting, it's a very small number.”
Five nations pledged boots on the ground
General Jasper Jeffers, appointed commander of the planned International Stabilization Force (ISF) for Gaza, said Indonesia, Morocco, Kazakhstan, Kosovo, and Albania have committed troops to the force. Egypt and Jordan, he said, have agreed to train police.
“For the last few months, we've had a team on the ground of U.S. military experts preparing the infrastructure for the ISF,” Jeffers said. “This team is already operating from a combined joint operation center that's going to be the headquarters for the entire ISF.”
He said the force will operate across five sectors, beginning in Rafah. The “midterm objective is to continue to expand sector by sector, all moving to our long term, 12,000 police and 20,000 ISF soldiers,” he said.
Jeffers also confirmed that Indonesia will serve as deputy commander of the ISF.
Nine nations pledged $7 billion in relief
Trump announced that nine countries had pledged a combined $7 billion toward Gaza relief.
“I'm pleased to announce that Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, UAE, Morocco, Bahrain, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Uzbekistan, and Kuwait have all contributed more than $7 billion toward the relief package,” he said.
The pledges come amid a fragile cease-fire in Gaza following the initial phases of Trump’s 20-point peace plan. According to Gaza’s health ministry, 603 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli strikes since the cease-fire deal brokered by Trump and mediated by Turkey, Qatar, and Egypt came into effect on Oct. 10, 2025.
Trump also said the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Assistance has agreed to raise an additional $2 billion “for the support of Gaza.” Japan will host fundraising events for the Board of Peace, Trump said, with expected participation from South Korea, the Philippines, Singapore, China, and Russia.
Additionally, “FIFA will be helping to raise a total of $75 million for projects in Gaza,” Trump said.
Board of Peace will be ‘looking over’ U.N., Trump says
Trump suggested the Board of Peace would effectively oversee the United Nations.
“The United Nations is going to be much stronger, and the Board of Peace is going to almost be looking over the United Nations and making sure it runs properly,” he said.
While saying he was “working very closely” with the U.N., Trump added that the organization has not lived up to its “tremendous potential.”
The remarks come as U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres has warned the body faces “imminent financial collapse” unless member states reform funding rules or pay outstanding dues. The U.S. currently owes $2.196 billion to the U.N.’s regular operating budget, including $767 million for this year.
“We're going to strengthen the United Nations. We're going to make sure its facilities are good. They need help, and they need help money wise. We're going to help them money wise,” Trump said, without specifying an amount.
Iran remains a central tension point
Throughout the meeting, Trump repeatedly described Iran as a “threat” to “the stability of the entire region.”
“Now is the time for Iran to join us on a path that will complete what we're doing, and if they join us, that will be great. If they don't join us, that will be great too, but it will be a very different path,” he said. “They cannot continue to threaten the stability of the entire region, and they must make a deal. If that doesn't happen, maybe I can understand, but bad things will happen.”
The warning comes amid mounting speculation about possible U.S. military action against Iran. The U.S. has expanded its military presence in the region. Trump confirmed that the U.S. has ordered 22 additional B-2 stealth bombers, the same aircraft previously used to strike three Iranian nuclear sites.
“We do have some work to do with Iran. They can't have a nuclear weapon. It's very simple,” Trump said. “They can't have peace in the Middle East if they have a nuclear weapon. And they can't have a nuclear weapon. And they've been told that very strongly.”
Trump added that whether a deal is reached, or whether the U.S. will need to “take it a step further,” should become clear “probably over the next 10 days.”
Meanwhile, Rep. Ro Khanna of California said he and Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky will seek a vote next week to limit the President’s ability to use force against Iran without congressional approval.“Trump officials say there's a 90% chance of strikes on Iran. He can’t without Congress,” Khanna wrote on social media. A similar effort failed last June, nearly a week after the President ordered strikes against Iranian nuclear facilities without consulting Congress.

Rescue group in Las Vegas tries to catch a toucan that escaped its owner before it's too late

Rescue group in Las Vegas tries to catch a toucan that escaped its owner before it's too late
The life of a toucan seen flying around the Las Vegas desert is at risk unless it can be captured soon
- Bookmark
Katherine Eddington was driving in North Las Vegas last week when she thought she saw a big black bird carrying a banana fly across the intersection.
But after a closer look, she realized it was a toucan — a tropical bird native to rainforests in Central and South America known for their large, colorful bills.
“They’re beautiful birds, so being able to see something like that so close to home was fascinating,” said Eddington, who recognized the bird from social media and contacted animal rescue.
That toucan is named Sam, and he has been living in the area since November, when a resident posted online that he'd escaped from his cage. After surviving the Las Vegas desert for months, Sam has captivated community birding groups, with people posting occasional sightings around town.
A local rescue group has been trying to catch him for months — and the clock is ticking.
“I’m really worried about him,” said Skye Marsh, president and co-founder of SouthWest Exotic Avian Rescue. The Las Vegas-based group has spent hours searching for him, only to find the bird 50 feet (about 15 meters) up in a palm tree, limiting rescue options. They have not been in touch with the owner, she said.
Las Vegas is not a good environment for a toucan to be in the wild with its too-hot summers and cold winters, said Donald Price, a professor and biologist at the University of Nevada in Las Vegas who studies how winged animal species adapt to different environments.
Marsh, who has two toucans of her own, said Sam is starting to show signs of struggle. His eyes are sunken in, and the skin around his beak is starting to get discolored, she said.
Sam likely lived off figs and pomegranates from trees in the Los Prados neighborhood, located about 15 miles (24 kilometers) from the Las Vegas Strip, when he first escaped in November, Marsh said. Those fruits have since disappeared, and Sam has moved on to citrus, which are harmful to toucans, she said. Their livers cannot process the calcium, and the iron can be deadly.
“This bird is not in good shape,” Marsh said.
Bird experts and enthusiasts alike are surprised the toucan has survived so long in Las Vegas. Exotic birds that escape often have difficulty finding food and avoiding predators, and the changing weather in Las Vegas has also likely taken a toll on the toucan.
Birds can thermal regulate, but only for so long. It takes a lot of energy, so the toucan would need more food, Price said.
“If it’s still alive, it could be in trouble, I can imagine. So hopefully they catch it," he said.
The toucan has been spotted in one specific location, a sign he’s running out of energy, she said. The rescue group set up a cage with food in it and urged neighbors to stop feeding it. The toucan has scoped out the cage but gets spooked when people are around, Marsh said.
The rescue group will rush him to the vet as soon as he's caught, Marsh said. He’ll need fluids, and his system will need to be flushed to remove the iron he’s eaten.
Marsh urged neighbors to not get close to the toucan or try to trap Sam themselves.
“The more people that are out there, the worse it’s going to be because he doesn’t like people,” she said. “So just let us do our thing, and we’ll get him.”

Will this helmet prevent concussions in footballers?

Study to test whether helmet will significantly reduce risk of concussion in football players
It's getting toward the pointy end of pre-season for the Brighton Bombers Senior Women's football squad.
Before training, their strength and conditioning coach, Kelley, takes them through a meticulous warm-up. High knees, grapevine, sprints.
"It's just to prevent injury mainly," says Lily, 20, who has sweat sliding down her forehead from the run-throughs.
"One wrong movement can cause a torn muscle or something like that."
It makes sense. An injury can derail any athlete's preparation.
So can a concussion, and repeated concussions can have significant long-term consequences. So what do these players do to protect their heads?
"Nothing, if I'm honest. I've never worn a helmet or anything like that," Bonnie, 19, admits.
"My parents have told me to before because I've had a few head knocks. But look, I just think it's part of the game sometimes, so I don't really do much to prevent it," Lily says.
A potential solution
"We want to achieve for concussion what seatbelts achieved for road safety."
That's the bold claim made by industrial designer Graeme Attey at the beginning of a promotional video for Australian sportswear company GameGear. In his hands is his latest invention, a helmet specifically designed to reduce an athlete's chance of getting concussion.
"It was actually back in 2012; it was a game of Friday night footy," says Attey, reflecting on the origin of his design.
"Two guys just went head to head and down cold, both of them, and I thought, 'That's it. This is ridiculous,' because I could just see that they don't need to suffer these sorts of injuries.
"If you design a helmet that's specifically made correctly for football, they shouldn't be suffering such severe concussions."
The AFL and NRL's treatment of concussions has shifted dramatically in the past decade. In 2021 the AFL introduced a mandatory minimum 12-day return-to-play period after a player receives a concussion. This was extended in 2024 to a 21-day minimum for community football.
Little focus has been paid to prevention, however.
"It's probably been our biggest frustration all along," Attey says.
"Initially there was this issue of all the focus and money and everything … going into what do you do after someone's concussed? And we were waving our hands saying, 'But stop the concussions first before you treat them.'"
The result of Attey's frustration is a helmet made up of a lattice of connecting spheres that, according to independent testing undertaken at the NSW Crash Lab, can reduce the force transmitted to a player's head during impact by more than 90 per cent.
"The reason I wanted to use spheres is because they have a progressive resistance to impact," Attey says.
A concussion is a mild traumatic brain injury that occurs when force is transferred to the brain from a hit to the head or body.
Attey's helmet is designed to reduce the amount of force that is transferred to the brain.
"What causes a concussion is head acceleration. So what you want to do is slow the acceleration of the head because that's what is causing the concussion," he says.
"If you take a circle and then you compress it, when an impact first strikes through the cross-sections of the ball, there's not much resistance initially because it's only sort of the peak of the ball, and then as it squashes down and down, it becomes more and more resistant to the force."
Loading...What does the science say?
Across a range of sports, including Aussie Rules, soccer, rugby union, and a combination of those sports, the science appears settled: helmets are not associated with a reduced risk of concussion.
Attey says there's a reason for this.
"It all started back in 1993 with World Rugby in the UK deciding that they would allow headgear to be worn in rugby games, but it was to protect the ears in a scrum," he says.
These guidelines are still in place, and state that the only injuries that headgear should protect are cuts and abrasions.
"So it actually stipulates it can't work," Attey says.
He says many helmets on the market have been made to adhere to these specifications, so it's no surprise the science says they do nothing for concussions.
"You hear over and over again in the press, people in the medical field saying helmets have been proven not to work. There's no point in wearing helmets, and yes, it's true, but they were testing helmets that we already knew didn't work," he says.
"So, there should never be a conclusion that because that occurred, therefore, no helmet is ever going to work, because it's just crazy.
"You know, no-one will get anywhere with that sort of attitude."
World-first concussion trial approved
While the GameGear helmets have had promising results in a laboratory setting, the next step is to test them in the field.
Over the next couple of years scientists from Monash University, with support from non-profit organisation Connectivity Traumatic Brain Injury Australia, will study600 players aged 16 and over whowill wear the helmets during elite and community football and rugby games across the country.
The study will look at real-world exposure data, biomarkers and clinical assessments to help determine whether these helmets significantly reduce a player's risk of getting a concussion.
Adelaide University senior lecturer in exercise science Hunter Bennett is curious to see the results.
"This is actually a really interesting topic of research," Dr Bennett says.
"What we tend to see in like laboratory settings is that those helmets really do a good job of preventing or reducing the amount of force that's transferred to the skull, and often to a pretty meaningful degree, or what you would think would be a meaningful degree.
"But then when it comes to research out in the field, we tend to see those helmets maybe not having as large an effect on reducing concussion as what we would expect."
Dr Bennett says hits during a game can be unpredictable, and every individual will have a different threshold to concussion.
"Maybe your force threshold is different to my force threshold. Maybe that force threshold reduces if you experience multiple head knocks in a game," he says.
"So maybe there's sort of an accumulated effect where we receive 10 head knocks in a game and even though not a single one of them is really large, maybe accumulated, those 10 could result in a concussion occurring.
"There's so many things that occur throughout a duration of a game that just maybe the helmet does prevent some of those contributing factors to concussion, but it just can't impact all of them."
Attey says these variables are why the field trials are vital in determining whether his helmets will be an effective strategy in reducing concussion risk.
"Some guys will get a 100g [g-force] hit and be OK. Another guy will get a 60g hit and go down cold.
"We know the impacts will be reduced hugely out there on the field for any sort of head hit, but we just need to know how much overall, at the end of the day … that [will] reduce concussion."
Should helmets be mandated?
If, at the conclusion of Monash University's study, it is shown that these helmets unequivocally reduce a player's chance of getting a concussion, Attey says they should be a compulsory part of contact sport.
"It should be mandated everywhere if it's proved to reduce concussion because otherwise you can't say you're looking after the health and safety of the players."
Dr Bennett agrees, but with some caveats.
"I think you would have to sort of question if these helmets have a really, really robust effect on concussion," he said.
"You would almost make the sort of assumption that it's almost the duty of care to mandate it.
"But then I'm sure there's also going to be issues around funding, like these helmets aren't cheap.
"Do players take on that cost? Do parents? What if parents can't afford it? Then maybe it becomes an equity issue where only those players who can afford to buy these helmets can participate in the sport, and that's going to have a negative effect from a general health perspective."
No helmet is ever going to completely rule out a player's chance of getting concussion, and we are certainly a long way off any helmet being mandated.
But for some of the players at Brighton, it might be the only way they would wear one.
"I would also look into it because I've had a few knocks as well and a few concussions, but I don't think I would wear it straight away," Sava, 17, says.
"I feel like I'd have to get maybe one more and then be like, maybe?"
"I got concussed in 2021, so then after that, my parents made me wear a helmet for the rest of that season, but I took it off as soon as I could," says Milla, with notable disdain in her voice.
"It was quite embarrassing, I think, to be wearing a helmet as a girl because no-one else was wearing a helmet and it's just, yeah, wasn't very flattering.
"I feel like if everyone was doing it, I would probably be able to get on board. I wouldn't feel so isolated."

Abigail Spanberger tapped to deliver Dem response to Trump’s State of the Union address
Spanberger became Virginia’s first female governor earlier this year
- Bookmark
Virginia Gov. Abigail Spanberger will deliver the Democratic response to President Donald Trump’s State of the Union address next week.
She was tapped for the rebuttal just months after resoundingly winning an office previously held by a Republican.
The Democratic response will immediately follow Trump’s address to Congress next Tuesday, offering the party’s most high-profile opportunity to deliver a countermessage.
Spanberger, who served three terms in Congress, became Virginia’s first female governor earlier this year.
House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries said in announcing Spanberger as the party’s pick that she “embodies the best of America as a mother, community leader and dedicated public servant.”
In a statement, Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said, “Gov. Spanberger will lay out a clear path forward: lower everyday costs, protect healthcare, and defend the freedoms that define who we are as a nation.”
A former CIA case officer and member of Congress, Spanberger’s November victory made her the state’s 75th governor.
It was a historic first as only men had held the post since Virginia became a commonwealth in 1776, with no woman serving as a colonial governor prior.
She defeated Republican Winsome Earle-Sears, succeeding Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin.
Spanberger won the race by a double-digit margin, campaigning on affordability and lowering costs for families.

Gaza administration committee opens applications to form new police force
Committee says planned force will be built on accountability, transparency and rule of law as it calls on qualified Palestinians to apply
By Hosni Nedim
ISTANBUL (AA) – The National Committee for the Administration of Gaza (NCAG) announced Thursday that it has opened applications to establish a new Palestinian police force in the Gaza Strip.
In a statement published on its website, the committee invited “qualified and committed individuals” to submit applications to serve the community and strengthen public security.
It said it aims to recruit Palestinian men and women with “high professional competence and a commitment to maintaining order and stability, supporting the rule of law and protecting society with discipline and national responsibility.”
The committee described joining the force as “a national duty and an active contribution to rebuilding trust and security within Gaza’s society.”
It said the recruitment process targets individuals who demonstrate “professionalism, integrity and a sense of public responsibility, to be at the forefront of protecting families, safeguarding human dignity and helping shape a more secure future for coming generations.”
The planned police force will be built on “solid foundations of accountability, transparency and respect for the law,” the committee said.
Members of the force will operate under “clear codes of conduct and continuous oversight and accountability,” the statement added.
The NCAG is a nonpolitical body formed under a Gaza plan proposed by US President Donald Trump. It is tasked with managing daily civil service affairs in the enclave.
It comprises 11 Palestinian figures and is led by Ali Shaath. The committee began operating from the Egyptian capital, Cairo, in mid-January but has yet to start work inside Gaza, where about 2.4 million Palestinians face severe humanitarian conditions.
It has yet to begin operating from inside Gaza, despite Hamas saying it had completed logistical and administrative procedures to hand over civil governance duties.
Entry of committee members into Gaza requires field and security coordination through crossings controlled by Israel. No official explanation has been issued by the committee regarding the delay, and Israel has not commented on the matter.

Iranians grieve defiantly for thousands killed in last month’s crackdown
Iranians grieve defiantly for thousands killed in last month’s crackdown
CAIRO (AP) — Standing on her balcony in the Iranian capital, Tehran, the teacher shouted out into the darkness, “Death to the dictator!” and “Death to the murderer, Khamenei!” on a recent night, joining the slogans coming from windows and rooftops around her relatively affluent neighborhood.
A few voices in the darkness responded with slogans in support of Iran’s 47-year-old Islamic Republic.
“Shut up! Choke on it!” her neighbors shouted back, drowning out the pro-government voices, the teacher recounted to The Associated Press, speaking on condition of anonymity for her safety.
Iranians across the country are still reeling with shock, grief and fear after massive nationwide protests were crushed by the deadliest crackdown ever seen under the rule of the 86-year-old Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei. Thousands were killed and tens of thousands are believed to have been arrested.
But a vein of defiance persists. A seething anger at Iran’s rulers is evident in videos shared on social media and in conversations with protesters. At the same time, three protesters reached by the AP also expressed futility over what can be done after hundreds of thousands braved taking to the streets only to be met with overwhelming violence. The protesters all spoke on condition of anonymity, fearing retribution or arrest.
Adding to the uncertainty is the United States’ threat to strike Iran. The U.S. has positioned warships and fighter jets nearby even as it holds negotiations with Iran over its nuclear program.
The defiance appears in the shouting of slogans from windows and rooftops at night, a ritual displayed in past waves of protests.
It is also evident at memorial gatherings for those killed 40 days earlier. Such commemorations -- known as the “chehelom,” Persian for “the 40th” – are traditionally held by families for anyone who has died. But in times of unrest, chehelom can have a political dimension.
Commemorations turn to protests
This week marks 40 days since Jan. 8 and 9, the deadliest days of the crackdown, and multiple videos circulating online show 40-day ceremonies in towns and cities around Iran. Some appear to have drawn hundreds of people, who often break into anti-government chants.
Often they are festive, with friends and loved ones of the slain protester singing and throwing flowers – a rejection of the solemn atmosphere encouraged by the state at official ceremonies. Most avoid calling the dead “shaheed,” or “martyr,” a term with Islamic religious connotations. Instead, they use the term, “javid nam,” a Persian phrase meaning, “Long live the name.”
Videos posted this week and verified by the AP showed a crowd of hundreds at the main cemetery in the small western Iranian town of Abdanan, chanting, “Death to Khamenei” and pumping their fists at the chehelom of Alireza Seydi, a 16-year-old boy killed on Jan. 8. The videos show security forces firing from an armored vehicle, raising clouds of what appeared to be tear gas, sending men and women running.
During the 1979 Islamic Revolution that toppled the shah and brought the Islamic Republic to power, 40-day memorials for slain protesters often turned into rallies that security forces tried to crush, causing new deaths – which then would be marked 40 days later with new protests.
Postings on social media have reported security forces trying to restrict people from attending some chehelom ceremonies.
“For every person killed, a thousand more stand behind him,” a crowd of several hundred chanted Tuesday while gathered in the eastern city of Mashhad for the chehelom of Hamid Mahdavi, according to a video verified by the AP. When a few police officers harassed some people commemorating Mahdavi, a fireman shot to death in January protests, the crowd shouted, “Shameless! Shameless!”
The government held its own chehelom for those killed, whom the Revolutionary Guard in a statement depicted as victims of violence caused by foreign-backed armed “terrorist” groups that exploited “legitimate public demands.” It said the 40-day commemoration was “a chance to renew commitment to national unity.”
‘Mass depression’ and anger
“More than sad, people are angry. Everyone is so angry. Everyone is waiting for some kind of explosion,” said a resident of Karaj, a city just outside of Tehran.
He joined street marches on Jan. 8 and Jan. 9 and said five of his relatives and family friends were killed when security forces opened fire on protesters.
The Human Rights Activists News Agency has so far counted more than 7,000 dead and believes the death toll is far higher. Iran’s government offered its only death toll on Jan. 21, saying 3,117 people were killed; it has depicted many of the protesters as “terrorists.”
“I don’t know anyone around me who doesn’t know someone who was killed, or someone who was arrested or wounded,” the 26-year-old teacher in Tehran said. Two of her acquaintances were killed and the husband of one of her co-workers arrested, she said.
Iranians are also struggling with a rapidly worsening economy, as the value of their currency plummets.
Every day, prices rise, said the Karaj resident. “We are getting near an economic collapse,” he said. “Buying fruit has become a luxury.”
A resident of north Tehran who works in tourism and joined last month’s protests said that with the Persian New Year approaching in March, the bazaar would usually be full of shoppers, but not now.
“It’s a combination of grieving, lack of money and inflation,” he said, describing people in the capital as being in a state of “mass depression.”
The mood has dampened Iran’s normally vibrant cultural sphere. One prominent actor posted that she would no longer accept new roles “in this land that smells of blood.”
Alireza Ostad Haji, who referees a popular television strongman competition, offered condolences to “all mourning families” in an Instagram post and resigned from two national athletic committees. He broke down in tears as he spoke of a former bodybuilding champion, Masoud Zatparvar, who was killed. “He was not a terrorist, he was a protester,” he said.
‘They see no alternative’
There is also a fear that street protests can’t bring change in the face of the state’s overwhelming use of violence.
The Karaj resident and the Tehran protester who works in tourism both expressed support for the son of the ousted shah, Reza Pahlavi, who from exile has put himself forward as a leader of the fragmented Iranian opposition. Pahlavi has encouraged protests and called for the U.S. to strike Iran.
The depth of support for Pahlavi around Iran is impossible to gauge. But during January’s wave of protests, chants in support of him were common, a notable change from the past, when the shah’s son drew scant attention within the country or was seen as out of touch.
Some are even taking what was a previously unimaginable step for many -- expressing hopes for an American attack.
“Every night, every hour, I wish I could hear (U.S.) strikes,” the protester who works in tourism said. “We cannot fight anymore with our fists against machine guns.” He said many of his friends who took to the streets alongside him in January say they won’t do so again because of the state’s violence.
The teacher said that, while she joined past protests, she didn’t in January because she didn’t like the expressions of Pahlavi support.
But she said some of her friends who also oppose the shah’s son joined the January protests and even repeated the slogan, “Long live the shah!”
“People have become very tired, and they see no alternative,” she said.
She worried a U.S. attack will bring war, civil strife and even more bloodshed.
“I am afraid there will be more massacres,” she said.

Trump extends sanctions against Russia over war in Ukraine for another year
This is stated in the president's official notice published in the Federal Register, which is set to take effect on March 6, Ukrinform reports.
"In accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13660," the document reads.
The notice specifies that the national emergency related to the situation in Ukraine remains in effect. It covers sanctions introduced in March and December 2014, as well as in September 2018 and February 2022, under executive orders issued by previous U.S. presidents.
U.S. executive orders declaring a national emergency and imposing sanctions on foreign states remain in force for one year. They must then be renewed by a separate order from the president to remain in effect for another year.

Scientists develop universal vaccine to protect against allergies, cold and flu
The vaccine could replace multiple jabs every year for winter respiratory infections and may even work against new pandemic bugs
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
A universal vaccine that can protect against cold, flu, Covid and allergies is a significant step closer, scientists believe.
Stanford Medicine researchers in the US have tested a vaccine formula on mice that protects against a range of respiratory viruses, bacteria which causes sepsis and even house dust mites.
The vaccine is delivered through a nasal spray and provides broad protection in the lungs for several months.
If this vaccine was developed for humans it could replace multiple jabs every year for winter respiratory infections and may even work against new pandemic bugs.
“I think what we have is a universal vaccine against diverse respiratory threats,” Dr Bali Pulendran, director of the Institute for Immunity, Transplantation and Infection at Stanford Medicine and lead author said.
“Imagine getting a nasal spray in the fall months that protects you from all respiratory viruses including Covid-19, influenza, respiratory syncytial virus and the common cold, as well as bacterial pneumonia and early spring allergens,” Dr Pulendran said. “That would transform medical practice.”
For the study published in the journal Science, mice were given a drop of the vaccine, known as GLA-3M-052-LS+OVA, in their noses which offered protection for several months.
Researchers demonstrated that helpful T cells in the lungs, which are working against pathogens, could send signals to the body’s innate immune cells to keep them active.
Instead of trying to mimic part of a pathogen, the vaccine mimics the signals that immune cells use to communicate with each other during an infection.
Dr Pulendran thinks two doses of the nasal spray would be enough to provide protection in people and estimates that, depending on funding, the vaccine might be available within five to seven years.
Although Professor Ian Jones, a virologist at Reading University, believes the new vaccine design will be used in the future, he warns a universal vaccine is a way off.
“We are some way from a true one-jab-and-forget-it vaccine as the safety considerations are considerable given how diverse the human population is. A one size fits all may not work, and the current seasonal jabs, for flu or Covid or RSV, will remain the norm for some time yet,” he told the Independent.
Professor Jonathan Ball, virologist at Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine (LSTM) also believes scientists are “big steps” away from a truly universal vaccine.
He said: “We have to ensure that keeping the body on 'high alert' doesn't lead to friendly fire, where a hyper-ready immune system accidentally triggers unwelcome side-effects.”
Professor of vaccinology at University of Oxford, Daniela Ferreira, found the research “exciting”.
“Over our lifetime, we’re constantly exposed to viruses and bacteria that infect the airways. As a result, most of us carry ‘memory’ immune cells, including some that live in the lining of the nose and lungs. This research shows it may be possible to use that existing immune memory as a foundation for broadly protection - even of unrelated pathogens,” she explained.

A thousand Kenyans 'recruited' for Russia's war — new report
February 19, 2026Kenya's National Intelligence (NIS) said that 1,000 Kenyans have been recruited to fight for Russia in Ukraine after allegedly being duped by the promise of employment.
The NIS findings were presented to lawmakers by parliamentary leader Kimani Ichung'wah on Wednesday.
Kenyans duped into fighting by job offers
Ichung'wah accused Russian embassy officials of colluding with recruitment agencies and human trafficking syndicates to recruit Kenyans to fight in Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, under the guise of being given employment.
He said the Russian embassy officials issued them tourist visas.
"So far over 1,000 Kenyans have been recruited and departed to fight in the Russia-Ukraine war," Ichung'wah said.
Ichung'wah said that according to the NIS report, 89 Kenyans were on the front line, 39 were hospitalized, 28 were missing in action and at least one was confirmed dead.
According to the report, recruiters targeted former soldiers and police officers, as well as unemployed people, with promises that they would earn around 350,000 shillings (€ 2,300, $2,715) per month and get bonuses of up to 1.2 million shillings ($9,309).
In November, Kenya said that over 200 of its citizens were fighting for Russia, now with the NIS findings, the number is five times more than previously thought.
Moscow refutes allegations
Moscow's embassy in Nairobi denied the allegations in a statement on Thursday saying that no visas were issued to anyone intending to travel to Russia to fight in Ukraine.
The Russian embassy did however say that "the legislation of the Russian Federation does not preclude citizens of foreign countries from voluntarily enlisting in the armed forces.”
Ukraine has previously said that hundreds of citizens from 36 African countries were fighting alongside Russian forces on its territory, with some recruited through deception.
South Africans who fought for Russia return home
On Wednesday, South Africa's Foreign Ministry announced that four South African men who had been lured into fighting for the Russian forces in Ukraine had returned home.
This follows talks held by South African President Cyril Ramaphosa with his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, on the return of South Africans caught up in the war in Ukraine.
In November, Pretoria said it had received "distress calls" from 17 men who had been tricked into joining mercenary groups and were trapped in the epicenter of the fighting in Ukraine's Donbas region.
South African law prohibits its citizens from fighting for a foreign army without government authorization.

US sanctions 3 RSF commanders for atrocities in Sudan
Treasury Department cites ethnic killings, torture, sexual violence during 18-month siege of El Fasher
ISTANBUL
The US Treasury Department sanctioned three commanders Thursday from Sudan's Rapid Support Forces (RSF) for their roles in a brutal campaign during the paramilitary group's siege and capture of El Fasher.
"These individuals were involved in the RSF's 18-month siege of and eventual capture of El-Fasher, in which the RSF perpetrated a horrific campaign of ethnic killings, torture, starvation, and sexual violence," said the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control.
The RSF and its allied militias have committed "widespread atrocities, including war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide" since Sudan's civil war broke out in April 2023, it added.
Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent urged the RSF to commit to an immediate humanitarian ceasefire. "We will not tolerate this ongoing campaign of terror and senseless killing in Sudan," he said, warning that without a swift end to the conflict, Sudan risks "further destabilizing the region, creating conditions for terrorist groups to grow."
The US action follows similar designations by the UK in December and the EU in January.
Sudan has been locked in a bloody conflict between the army and the RSF since April 2023, killing tens of thousands, displacing 13 million people, and creating one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises, according to UN reports.
Actions by the RSF during their late-October takeover of El Fasher show “hallmarks of genocide” and indicate an ongoing risk of further atrocities, UN investigators said in a report Thursday.

Cats could hold the key to understanding breast cancer
Scientists discovered the genetic changes that drive cancer formation in cats are similar to those seen in humans
- Bookmark

Household cats could help us understand how breast cancer develops in humans.
That’s according to the first study of multiple cancer types in cats that has identified genetic changes that could help treat the condition in humans and animals.
Almost a quarter of all UK households own at least one cat. Cancer is one of the leading causes of illness and death in cats, however very little is known about how this develops.
Scientists at the Wellcome Sanger Institute, the Ontario Veterinary College in Canada, the University of Bern, analysed tumours from almost 500 pet cats from five countries.
They discovered the genetic changes that drive cancer formation in cats are similar to those seen in humans.
Bailey Francis, co-first author at the Wellcome Sanger Institute, said: “By comparing cancer genomics across different species, we gain a greater understanding of what causes cancer. One of our major findings was that the genetic changes in cat cancer are similar to some that are seen in humans and dogs.
“This could help experts in the veterinary field as well as those studying cancer in humans, showing that when knowledge and data flows between different disciplines, we can all benefit.”
Cats are exposed to some of the same environmental cancer risks as their owners, which means that some causes of cancer could, at least in part, be shared.
By sequencing DNA from tissue samples that had already been collected by the vet for diagnostic purposes, the study published in the journal Science, found certain genetic changes commonly found in cat cancers mirror those seen in human cancers. For example, they found similarities between feline mammary cancers and human breast cancers.
Researchers looked for around 1,000 human cancer-associated genes in both tumours and healthy tissue samples. This included 13 different types of cat cancer and allowed them to compare the genetic changes to those seen in human and dog cancers.
One cancer studied was mammary carcinomas - a common and aggressive type of cancer in cats. Researchers identified seven driver genes that led to the development of cancer when mutated.
The most common driver gene of this type of cancer was FBXW7, which is also found in 50 per cent of the cat tumours. In humans, changes in the FBXW7 gene in breast cancer tumours are associated with a worse prognosis - which is similar to what is seen in cats.
Certain chemotherapy drugs were found to be more effective in the cat mammary tumours with changes in the FBXW7 gene. Although further research is needed, these findings may mean it is possible to develop a therapy for both cats with mammary carcinoma and human breast cancer patients.
The second most common driver gene was PIK3CA, seen in 47 per cent of cat mammary carcinoma tumours. This is also a genetic change found in human breast cancer. But similarities in these driver genes were also seen across blood, bone, lung, skin, gastro-intestinal, and central nervous system tumours.
Researchers say these findings could also lead to new therapies for cancers across the two species.
Professor Geoffrey Wood, co-senior author at the Ontario Veterinary College, Canada, said: “Despite domestic cats being common pets, there was very little known about the genetics of cancer in these animals, until now.
“Our household pets share the same spaces as us, meaning that they are also exposed to the same environmental factors that we are. This can help us understand more about why cancer develops in cats and humans, how the world around us influences cancer risk, and possibly find new ways to prevent and treat it.”

'Don't go with Bennett, go with Netanyahu': The call from a senior Hamas terrorist to Mansour Abbas
Unknown
Unknown Publisher

19:17:50 UTC
04:17:50 KST

Insurance
Mansour Abbas told the truth in an interview with Dana Weiss when he recounted receiving a phone call in 2021 from Qatar trying to persuade him not to go with Bennett but with Netanyahu. But the full truth is even more fascinating: the call came from Qatar, but not from a Qatari. On the line was a senior Hamas official. He believed Netanyahu was headed toward continued calm and quiet understandings, whereas a new government would be dragged into an operation in Gaza.
Five years have passed; Hamas no longer acts to promote a fully right-wing government (mostly). But the underlying circumstances have not changed. Abbas still wants to enter a government at any cost, and his rivals want a joint list that would raise Arab voter turnout. Statistics do not lie: Arab unity yields no fewer than 13 seats and always ends in opposition; fragmentation yields up to ten seats but enables Abbas to influence from within.
Abbas's colleagues believe that this time they can reach 16 seats thanks to the "X factor": removing Ben Gvir from the government. They will tell their voters that even if a Jewish unity government is formed, Otzma Yehudit will remain outside. That, of course, does not satisfy Abbas. When he parted ways with his partners five years ago, he told them: "You want to topple every government and dissolve every Knesset." He well remembers how the other Arab parties—Hadash, Ta'al, and Balad—helped bring about the end of the change government. Therefore, he intends to place as many obstacles as possible in its path. Five secure seats in hand are preferable to fifteen in the bush in separatist fashion.
The surprise is that both Bennett and Netanyahu very much do not want the formation of a unified Arab list. Each trusts his own polls. In the change bloc they rely on most television polls, in which, without Arab unity, the opposition is within striking distance of 61 seats. Netanyahu relies on Likud polls, in which the right-wing bloc stands at 59 or 60 seats. A large Arab bloc is like buying an expensive insurance policy against disasters: it prevents your rival from obtaining a majority, at the price of shrinking your own bloc. But it's well known that both Netanyahu and Bennett wouldn't spend their last shekel on insurance, but on a lottery ticket.
What you don't see
Brigadier General Ofer Winter once boasted about a solution he developed as Givati Brigade commander during Operation Protective Edge to combat tunnels: place a large fan over a shaft, throw in a smoke grenade—and the smoke emerges from nearby shafts, exposing them. They named the system "Purple Fox," after the Givati Brigade's symbol. It was an excellent solution for 2014. But since then, the tunnels have advanced and Hamas has adapted.
The current war broke out, and at its outset Winter whispered the idea into the ear of one of the division commanders. The method of destruction developed since then is like democracy: the worst method—except for all the others.
But a dramatic and troubling revelation was tucked into the Prime Minister's speech this week. For months it was said that the IDF had destroyed almost all the tunnels in Gaza; later, during the ceasefire, the figure suddenly dropped to 60 percent. Then Netanyahu came and announced: there are 500 kilometers of tunnels in the Strip; we have eliminated 150 of them. Seventy percent still exist.
The tunnels are Hamas's Dimona. When speaking of strategic weapons—this is the weapon. If the vast majority survived, even after intense fighting, can the rest even be destroyed?
Add to that what soldiers in the field are saying. One claims Hamas has resumed digging, this time with shovels and children paid 20 shekels a day. There is no shortage of shovels, children, or money in the Strip.
Another officer speaks of more and more tunnels being found inside the "yellow line." The IDF conducted a massive statistical drilling effort—one borehole every 14 meters. Dozens of tunnels were discovered, yet even afterward additional shafts are being found.
Another officer likens the tunnels within Hamas-controlled territory to a tree, and their extensions into our territory to branches. We prune the branches, but Hamas's digging makes them grow back. Very troubling.
And yet Southern Command paints a different and far more optimistic picture. When the Prime Minister spoke of destruction, he referred only to tunnels completely demolished with tons of explosives every 100 meters. In addition, another 200 kilometers were neutralized by pumping in concrete—something that could theoretically be drilled through, but practically cannot. Moreover, the method involves blowing up the entrance and exit of a tunnel, leaving middle segments that are not counted as destroyed but are unusable. The IDF also completely rejects the claim of significant renewed digging or tunnel rehabilitation.
In territory under Israeli control, only about 40 kilometers remain untreated. Within two to three months, an announcement is expected that there are no more tunnels near Israel. How does that square with the militants who emerged this week from a tunnel in Beit Hanoun, a kilometer inside the yellow line? The army claims they survived for months on dates above ground and were eliminated when they emerged from a partially ruined section as soldiers pumped explosives into it.
So how does one decide, after October 7, whether to listen to senior command or to soldiers in the field? Perhaps by focusing on the shared message: the path to defeating Hamas runs through eliminating the tunnels even in territory not under our control. More than 100 kilometers remain.
They will not be destroyed remotely. If they are to be destroyed, it will only be from the ground.
Likud's right
"Democracy does not die in a single blow, but in a hundred small blows," said Supreme Court President Yitzhak Amit in one of the hearings. By the same logic, annexation does not have to come in a single declaration but in a hundred small steps. This week the government took a not-so-small step: it opened the possibility for Israeli companies to purchase land in Judea and Samaria and to register it, for the first time since 1967.
Aside from Yair Golan, who tossed out a comment about it in a radio interview, none of the opposition leaders said a word. Not Lapid, not Eisenkot, not Gantz, certainly not Lieberman or Bennett. When people speak about Israeli society shifting to the right, they do not mean that everyone will vote for Ben Gvir or Netanyahu. They mean exactly this: steps that were once at the heart of Israel's fiercest disputes are now consensus. Another example? If, after the elections, a miracle were to occur and Netanyahu formed a government together with Lieberman and Bennett, Smotrich and the ultra-Orthodox, it would be defined as a broad national unity government. A decade ago, when Lieberman joined that same kind of government, Haaretz was shaken by what it called an extreme right-wing government, and the late journalist Roni Daniel spoke about the possibility that his children would not remain in the country.
That is the background to Lapid's unusual warning this week: "I'm no longer sure we'll win." The "change bloc" faces a demographic challenge: since the last election, six hundred thousand new voters have been added—a record since the founding of the state. The overwhelming majority are ultra-Orthodox, religious-nationalist, residents of the periphery, and Arabs. In the same period, two hundred thousand people have died or left the country—also a record. That is a net difference of two to three seats.
The change bloc benefits from early and efficient organization that prevents wasted votes. Meanwhile, nine seats are currently being burned below the electoral threshold by parties that do not rule out Netanyahu (Bezalel Smotrich, Yoaz Hendel, Benny Gantz). The assumption, however, is that those votes will not ultimately be wasted. The public agenda has been almost entirely focused on ultra-Orthodox draft evasion, but slowly Odeh, Abbas, and Tibi—who nearly disappeared for years—are returning to public consciousness and voting considerations.
What Lapid said is that victory is not in the bag—he is right. In his view, Yesh Atid should lead the bloc, and that can of course be debated. But it is clear that there is no way to decide the contest without votes from right-wing Netanyahu-disappointed voters—those who want settlement in Judea and Samaria, a toned-down judicial reform, and a strengthened draft law.
There is a phrase in Israel: "The shell that kills you is the one whose whistle you do not hear." What threatens the change bloc is not internal squabbles nor fragile micro-parties like "The Reservists," but a new party of that kind: former Likudniks, a right wing not tainted by October 7.
Former Finance Minister Moshe Kahlon reached a plea deal this week that allows him to return; Yuli Edelstein is exploring options; Gilad Erdan, former ambassador to the UN, is appearing more frequently in studios.
Who made the bill fall?
The fall this week of the bill to limit prime ministerial terms was another reason for infighting among opposition leaders. Gantz claimed Bennett had scuttled it in the previous government; others blamed him as well. In this case, all answers are correct. What happened was this: Justice Minister Gideon Sa'ar's bill was pared down to a version everyone could live with—limiting terms only from the moment the law took effect. Bennett and Lapid apparently believed they could each serve more than two terms.
In the first week the bill was set to pass, Gantz announced a voting boycott over his demand to approve additional benefits for career officers. In the second week, once the crisis ended, it emerged that the German chancellor was visiting Yad Vashem at exactly the time of the vote, and Prime Minister Bennett asked to accompany him. The problem was the need for 61 MKs to pass a Basic Law; without that—no law. The vote approached; Yad Vashem did not approach the Knesset; and after Sa'ar stalled repeatedly, he had to request a one-week delay.
The decisive week arrived, the last day of the winter session. But these were the days of the Omicron wave, and opposition MK Avi Maoz was infected. An emergency meeting convened, where representatives of Yesh Atid and Labor proposed pairing off with him. "Pair off?" New Hope exploded. "Removing a coalition member means the law falls." It didn't help. "Rules must be respected," they replied, and the bill was postponed to the summer session. A few days later, the country awoke to Idit Silman's resignation, bringing the coalition majority to an end. Had the law passed then, Netanyahu would now be running for his final term. But it did not pass then, and it did not pass this week: 55 opposed, 44 supported. Avi Maoz voted against.

Azerbaijan does not plan to join $7B Gaza initiative announced at Board of Peace meeting
Trump says 8 nations collectively pledged more than $7B
ISTANBUL
Azerbaijan does not plan to participate in the $7 billion in donations announced Thursday during the first Board of Peace meeting in Washington, according to presidential adviser Hikmet Hajiyev.
Hajiyev wrote on US social media platform X that Azerbaijan, as a founding member state, supports the goals and objectives of the board and may consider participating in investment projects in the Gaza Strip in the future.
“However, I would like to clarify one point. Azerbaijan doesn’t envisage to participate in the USD 7 billion financial initiative related to Gaza that was announced during the meeting of the Board of Peace in Washington,” he wrote.
US President Donald Trump announced billions of dollars in contributions for relief in Gaza at the inaugural meeting of the Board of Peace. He said Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, the United Arab Emirates, Morocco, Bahrain, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Uzbekistan and Kuwait collectively pledged more than $7 billion.
The board was established within the framework of efforts toward a peaceful settlement in Gaza. It seeks to promote peacemaking around the world. Washington has said additional states have since joined the initiative.
A US-backed ceasefire agreement has been in place in Gaza since Oct. 10, halting Israel’s two-year onslaught that has killed more than 72,000 people, mostly women and children, and injured over 171,000 since October 2023.
Despite the ceasefire, Israeli forces have committed hundreds of violations through shelling and gunfire, killing 611 Palestinians and injuring 1,630, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry.

Israeli settler killed Palestinian-American teen in the West Bank, local health ministry says

RAMALLAH/JERUSALEM, Feb 19 - A 19-year-old Palestinian-American citizen shot by an Israeli settler in the West Bank has died from his wounds,
the Palestinian Health Ministry said late on Wednesday.
A U.S. embassy official condemned the violence, telling Reuters on Thursday: "The U.S. Department of State has no higher priority than the safety and security of U.S. citizen overseas."
Nasrallah Mohammed Jamal Abu Siam was shot on Wednesday in the village of Mukhmas near Ramallah in the occupied West Bank.
A relative of Abu Siam, who did not wish to give his name out of fear of reprisals from Israeli security forces, said that settlers had raided the village to steal sheep.
The relative said that when villagers, including Abu Siam, had tried to prevent the theft, the settlers had begun firing at them, wounding Abu Siam and others.
The attacks injured five people, three of whom suffered bullet wounds including Abu Siam, the Palestinian Authority's official news agency WAFA said. The agency did not give details on the other injuries.
The Israeli military did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on the incident.
Violence by Israeli settlers against Palestinians in the West Bank has increased sharply since the beginning of the war in Gaza in October 2023, with nearly 700 displaced due to settler attacks in 2026 according to UN data.
Nine Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank in 2026 according to UN data, while 240 were killed in 2025. Two Israelis were killed in the West Bank during 2025, according to the data.
Israeli indictments of settler violence are rare. At the end of 2025, Israeli monitoring group Yesh Din said of the hundreds of cases of settler violence it had documented since October 7, 2023, only 2% resulted in indictments.
Several U.S. citizens, including the activist Ayşenur Ezgi Eygi, have been killed by Israeli forces or settlers over the past two years in the West Bank. REUTERS

Belarus, issued rare invitation to Board of Peace, says it received no visas
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
Feb 19 - Belarus, a close ally of Russia rarely invited to international gatherings, said on Thursday it had intended to attend the inaugural meeting of U.S. President Donald Trump's Board of Peace in Washington but failed to receive the necessary visas.
Belarus has long been subject to Western sanctions over its human rights record and punitive measures were intensified after President Alexander Lukashenko allowed his country's territory to be used for Moscow's 2022 invasion of Ukraine.
Trump has made diplomatic overtures to Belarus, dropping some sanctions in exchange for the release of detainees deemed political prisoners by Western countries.
Belarusian Foreign Minister Maxim Ryzhenkov had been due to attend, his ministry said, and the U.S. side duly informed.
"However, despite carrying out all the required procedures from our side, visas were not issued to our delegation," the ministry said in a statement.
"In this situation, a valid question arises -- what kind of peace and what kind of sequence of steps are we talking about if the organisers cannot even complete basic formalities for us to take part?"
The ministry said Trump's invitation to attend the Board of Peace meeting had originally been sent to Lukashenko.
Lukashenko, in power since 1994, agreed last month to join the Board of Peace -- an invitation extended by the U.S. as part of its normalisation process involving prisoner releases.
Trump has called Lukashenko a "highly respected" leader - a description at odds with those by exiled Belarus opposition leaders, who denounce him as a dictator.
Representatives of 47 nations attended the meeting of the Board, proposed by Trump in September when he announced his plan to end Israel's war in Gaza. He later made clear the board's remit would expand to tackle other conflicts worldwide. REUTERS

US builds website that will allow Europeans to view blocked content
Unknown

04:15:27 KST

The US has built a portal that will allow Europeans to view blocked content including alleged hate speech and terrorism, according to Reuters.
The portal, “freedom.gov”, will allow worldwide users to circumvent government controls on their content. The site features a graphic of a ghostly horse galloping above the Earth, and the motto: “Information is power. Reclaim your human right to free expression. Get ready.”
Though reports suggest the portal was developed by the state department, the domain appears to be administered by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), which is a branch of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The DHS also administers Immigration Customs and Enforcement (ICE).
It comes after the Trump administration largely gutted a state department programme called Internet Freedom, which funded grassroots groups worldwide that built technologies to circumvent censorship. Over the past decade, this programme gave more than $500m to digital rights experts – from Myanmar to Iran to Cuba to Venezuela – who built tools used by local populations to access the global internet.
Those tools allowed pictures and videos to filter out of Iran during the recent internet shutdown; they are heavily used by journalists and activists worldwide.
Freedom.gov appears to be an effort to redirect and politicise the Internet Freedom programme, according to sources.
A former US official said: “It feels mostly performative. It reads more like a combative policy declaration. USG [US government] disagreements with the EU on free speech are nothing new as a matter of policy. But a portal of this kind takes it a step further, declaring publicly that the USG is concerned with freedom of expression even among our allies in Europe.”
Internet Freedom funded tools that are open-source and privacy-preserving – technologies whose code can be audited and that do not expose their users to surveillance. These tools were not designed by US businesses, but by technologists around the world attuned to local censorship regimes.
While freedom.gov is ostensibly also an “internet freedom” project, it does not propose to preserve privacy – instead, it appears to funnel users into an opaque, central system controlled by a US government agency.
“What you’re now talking about is concentrating traffic through a US federal agency organised and kept closed – as opposed to multiple internet freedom, open-source, privacy-preserving projects,” said Andrew Ford Lyons, an independent consultant on digital security and media resilience, who worked on previous US internet freedom projects.
The “censorships” that the site purports to counter are not internet shutdowns or broad restrictions on content such as those in place in China and Iran, but European restrictions on hate speech and illegal content such as those in the Digital Services Act, or the UK’s Online Safety Act.
“When I worked with journalists in Myanmar or civil society in Afghanistan, I was helping get the right tools to the right people to do whatever they want. This is very specifically to help, like, an angry man in Schöndorf see neo-Nazi tweets from a guy in Arkansas,” said Ford Lyons.
“If the Trump administration is alleging that they’re gonna be bypassing content bans, what they’re gonna be helping users access in Europe is essentially hate speech, pornography, and child sexual abuse material,” said Nina Jankowicz, a former US official and disinformation expert.
Jankowicz added it was odd that the site appeared administered by CISA, whose remit before Trump included election infrastructure and foreign disinformation in the US. “The site is in and of itself a propaganda tool,” she said.
CISA “is the group that used to make sure secretaries of state were equipped with the tools that they needed to fight foreign disinformation. Now what we’re alleging is that our allies in Europe somehow pose a greater threat to Americans than the national security threats posed by Russia, China.”
The Trump administration and US tech companies are in an escalating tussle with the EU over the bloc’s efforts to regulate big tech companies. The European Commission has launched an investigation into X over its propagation of sexualised deepfakes; earlier this month it threatened action against Meta over an apparent breach of its antitrust rules.
Meanwhile, in December, the Trump administration barred five Europeans, including the former EU commissioner Thierry Breton, from entering the US over their work to regulate hate speech and disinformation.
This confrontation was prefigured by US vice-president, JD Vance, in a speech at the Munich Security Conference last year, in which he lambasted Europe for media censorship, content moderation and political correctness, saying that free speech was in retreat.
“This has been like a crusade of the Trump administration, even before they got into office. This free speech issue is one that they believe plays well with their base,” said Jankowicz.
“What they’re able to say is this kind of us-versus-them dichotomy: the US is defending free speech and all of these other countries that are regulating the internet.”
A state department spokesperson told Reuters the US government did not have a censorship-circumvention programme specific to Europe but added: “Digital freedom is a priority for the state department, however, and that includes the proliferation of privacy and censorship-circumvention technologies like VPNs.”
CISA has been approached for comment.

'Remarkable' new cat cancer genome could benefit humans

'Remarkable' new cat cancer genome could benefit humans
February 19, 2026Cat lovers have more in common with the family feline than they may realize.
New research published in the journal Science suggests cats and humans develop similar cancers due to similar tumor-causing genetic mutations.
This finding could lead to new cancer treatments for both pets and people.
The researchers created a cat "oncogenome" — a profile of gene mutations in cats that can cause cancer — using samples from nearly 500 cats in Canada, the UK, Germany, Austria and New Zealand.
Thirteen different types of cancer found in cats were analyzed for 1,000 genes known to cause cancer in humans. The oncogenome showed:
- Half of cancer samples in cats had a mutation to the FBXW7 gene, which is associated with aggressive forms of breast cancer in humans.
- Just under half of the samples had PIK3CA mutations, which is also associated with human breast cancer.
- Tumor-protein 53 — also known as TP53 or p53 — was the most common mutation in cats, and is often implicated as a driver of many human cancers.
A better model for cancer treatment?
While lab rodents have long been used to study cancers and potential drugs, cats could provide a more suitable model for scientific research.
"Here, you've got a model of spontaneously developing tumors, just as spontaneously as occurs in a human," said Louise van der Weyden, the study's senior researcher, based at the Wellcome Sanger Institute in the UK.
"These pets — cats and dogs — are in the same environment that we're in, so they've got the same pollution […] something that you’re not going to get in the laboratory."
By using a large number of non-pedigree housecats, the researchers had a genetically diverse pool in which to search for gene mutations common in cats and humans.
Van der Weyden said the pool could be expanded to include cats from other countries to offer an even broader understanding of cancer causes shared by felines and humans.
Of greatest interest is the potential for this cat oncogenome project to help identify environmental risks within the home. If, for instance, a certain genetic change triggers mammary cancer in the family cat, it could indicate similar risks for humans in the same house.
"There's a lot of studies now that are starting to think of cats and dogs as sentinels for the environment — the canary in the coal mine — because they are in the exact same environment that we are in," said van der Weyden. "We saw UV mutations [in cats] that were exactly the same as in humans, for example."
What is next for the oncogenome?
Trialing potential cancer therapies on cats with potential benefits for humans was shown in 2025 in the US by a group at the University of California.
The team led by Daniel Johnson and Jennifer Grandis tested a drug used to treat squamous cell carcinomas in humans on a group of cats with an oral form of the disease. Around a third of the treated cats lived an extra half year on average.
Though they weren't involved in the new oncogenome research, the UC team welcomed its findings.
"This is truly an exciting paper that further supports the relevance to humans, as well as pets, of studies like ours," Johnson and Grandis wrote in an email to DW.
"It is remarkable that alterations in genes such as p53 are found in high prevalence in both humans and cats. We can now begin to use studies like this to develop personalized cancer therapies for both cats and humans."
Van der Weyden hopes that her group can continue exploring cancers in pets to benefit both animals and humans. Because animal harm is minimized by using "real world" rather than lab animals, with support of animal owners, unnecessary animal harm could also be avoided, she said.
"Most [pet owners] will sign a form to say they're happy for [biopsy samples] to be used for research purposes, which I think is really open-minded and really wonderful," van der Weyden said. "It would be wonderful if something could come out of it. I think it’s wonderful to acknowledge all the owners that do that because without it, we couldn’t do this kind of study."

The names of the 11 'ISIS brides' trying to leave Syria to come to Australia

Full list of 11 Australian women with ISIS links trying to leave Syria revealed
The ABC can reveal the names of the 11 women connected to former Islamic State fighters in Syria who attempted to journey home to Australia this week
The group of 34 Australians, including 23 children, has been living in camps in Syria since the fall of the so-called caliphate, and some of those children were actually born behind the razor wire.
Some of the women are believed to have accompanied their husbands to the war zone, but others came with family and married IS fighters once they arrived. Some say they got stuck in Syria by accident.
Many of them have previously spoken to the ABC.
They left the Al-Roj camp in north-eastern Syria on Monday in the hopes of returning to Australia, but were forced to turn back shortly afterwards.
An official at the Al Roj camp said that when the group left, staff started dismantling their tents, and when the group unexpectedly returned, some had to bunk in together.
On Wednesday, Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke revealed one of the women is now the subject of a Temporary Exclusion Order (TEO), potentially banning her from travelling to Australia for up to two years on national security grounds.
It is not clear who the woman subject to the TEO is.
But the ABC can reveal the names of the 11 women who tried to leave after obtaining a handwritten list from inside the camp.
Nesrine Zahab
Nesrine Zahab is now in her early 30s, but she came to Syria from Sydney in her early 20s.
She has previously claimed she did not realise she was entering Syria.
"Who walks into a war zone?" she told Four Corners in 2019.
Nesrine said she had been on a family holiday in Lebanon, when she and a female cousin snuck away to deliver aid to refugees on the Turkish side of the Syrian border.
She said someone then asked for her passport.
"That kind of freaked me out," she said.
She said she only realised she was in Syria when she saw an Islamic State (IS) flag.
"I found that I was in Syria. Did I have a heart attack? Of course I had a heart attack," she told reporter Dylan Welch.
"Did I cry and scream and chuck a fit like a little girl? I chucked the biggest tantrum.
"Did it work? No. I'm still here."
She later married an Australian-born IS fighter named Ahmed Merhi, who was later captured and sentenced to death.
She said she believed marrying offered her the best chance of survival.
Sumaya Zahab
Sumaya Zahab is in her early 30s.
She is the sister of Muhammad Zahab, a former Sydney maths teacher who joined IS.
He died in an air strike in 2018, but was known to have convinced several family members to travel to Syria.
Aminah Zahab
Aminah Zahab is the mother of Muhammad Zahab and Sumaya Zahab, and the aunt of Nesrine Zahab.
She would now be about 50 years old and had followed her son to Syria.
"We're clueless parents. We had a lot of trust in our children, a lot of trust," she told Four Corners in 2019 from the Al-Hol camp.
"We didn't know how to do much things in life. As we raised our children, and we just let the children rule our lives.
"I feel very angry. I feel very devastated. I feel sore, pain."
Aminah was clearly distressed when she spoke about the conditions in the camp at the time.
"Tents have been burning down, and they're right next to each other," she said.
"You don't understand, you see charcoaled women and children."
Zeinab Ahmed
Zeinab Ahmed is the second-eldest daughter of Mohammed and Kawsar Abbas.
She last spoke to the ABC from Al Roj in early 2025, as she made an impassioned plea to the Australian government to help get the group home.
She feared for her safety, and the lives of her children.
At the time, she revealed that Australian officials had travelled to the camp in 2022 to meet with the women and children.
Health checks and DNA tests were conducted.
Months later, four families were repatriated to Australia.
"They took the first group and we were so happy that some of us were getting out, some of our kids will be saved," Zeinab said.
"Once they took them in there was backlash, there was backlash from when the announcement was made and then they never came back."
The process undertaken by officials in 2022 likely paved the way for travel documents to be issued for the group of women ahead of their failed attempt to leave Al Roj earlier this week.
In recent days, the Australian government has repeatedly denied offering support to the group to make the journey home — with the exception of what they are legally obligated to do.
This would include issuing travel documents.
Al Roj officials have told the ABC that the group have been issued with single-entry passports.
Kirsty Rosse-Emile
The ABC also spoke to Kirsty Rosse-Emile in early 2025 in the Al Roj camp.
"Hello, I'm here. Can you just come and get me, finally, and my children and all the other Australians here?" she said in a message to the Australian government.
"We're ready to start our lives afresh."
She spoke of her desire to see her mother and take her kids to the beach, and conceded that detailing how she ended up in Syria "might make problems for me."
In 2020, The Guardian reported that Kirsty's husband, Moroccan-born Nabil Kadmiry, had his Australian citizenship stripped from him by the federal government.
Janai Safar
Janai Safar was among the women whom Four Corners met in the Al-Hol camp in 2019.
She mentioned at the time that the group were aware of new legislation which could prevent them from returning to Australia.
"We've heard about the laws being passed, TEOs and stuff," Janai told the program.
A TEO has been imposed on one of the 11 women in the group — but exactly who remains unclear.
Her grandfather, John Crockett, told the ABC at the time that it was better they return to Australia than languish in camps in Syria.
"If some of them are going to go to jail when they come home, it's far better for them to be in prison back here and do a term of whatever they've been convicted of," he told Four Corners.
"At least if they come back here and they're jailed, at least we'll be able to go and see them."
Kawsar Abbas
Kawsar Abbas, from Melbourne, is in her early 50s.
She's the wife of Mohammed Ahmad, who ran a charity to support the people of Syria.
The Australian Federal police suspected the charity of funnelling cash to Islamic State.
In 2019, Mohammed Ahmad told the ABC that he and his family got trapped in Syria after travelling from the charity's headquarters in Turkey to attend the wedding of his son, Omar.
Mohammed said soon after arriving in Syria, he realised Omar had sworn allegiance to Islamic State. Omar also kept a Yazidi slave, who Ahmad said was treated well.
Ahmad implied that he did not approve of his son keeping the woman, but said he did not raise his concerns as other fathers in the caliphate had been killed for standing up to their children.
Mohammedinsisted he was never an Islamic State supporter, but he was imprisoned in north-eastern Syria when IS was defeated.
Zahra Ahmad
Zahra Ahmad is the eldest daughter of Mohammed and Kawsar Abbas.
She's in her early 30s.
According to her father, the family got trapped in Syria in 2014 when they came for a wedding.
But the circumstances of how Zahra's family came to be in Syria are contested, SBS reported in 2024.
The outlet wrote that when some male members of her family joined the IS group, Zahra said the women had no choice but to follow.
"I didn't make this bed," she told SBS.
"We are now forced to suffer for the decisions that other people — other male influencers — have made on our behalf, and now they're all gone, and we are left to suffer with our kids."
Zahra later married notorious Islamic State recruiter Muhammad Zahab, who died in an air strike.
Hodan Abby
The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age revealed details of Hodan Abby's case in 2021, through an emotional appeal from her father.
Hodan had left her western Sydney home and fled to Syria in 2015 when she was still a teenager, the newspapers reported, in a bid to become a jihadi bride.
She gave birth to a daughter in Syria, and the child later suffered shrapnel wounds to her head.
Doctors told her surgery was required outside of the camp.
Hodan's father said he feared for his daughter and granddaughter and urged the government to intervene.
The newspapers reported at the time that Hodan had agreed to be placed under a Terrorism Control Order if she returned to Australia, giving law enforcement and intelligence agencies the power to monitor her.
Kawsar Kanj and Hyam Raad
There are two more Australian women on the list: Kawsar Kanj and Hyam Raad.
Little to no public information is available about them.
Another woman with the same surname, Mariam Raad, returned in 2022.
She was convicted of travelling to a proscribed area in 2024.

Tucker Carlson's 'detention' claim unravels as new footage surfaces

The uproar surrounding the brief visit of conservative American media personality Tucker Carlson to Israel continues, after new footage released Thursday cast doubt on his claim that he was "detained" and "dragged into an interrogation room" at Ben-Gurion Airport.
Carlson told the Daily Mail that after concluding an interview with US Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee in Jerusalem, Israeli security officials confiscated his passport and led his producer into a side room to question him about the content of their discussion.

However, footage first shared by social media activist Oli London shows Carlson at the VIP terminal at Ben-Gurion Airport, smiling, conversing with employees and even taking a photo with one of them, contradicting his narrative of being forcibly escorted and having his passport seized. In a post accompanying the video, London wrote that Carlson had been "exposed" and was neither arrested nor interrogated, but treated like any other visitor.
The US Embassy in Jerusalem rejected Carlson's claims on Wednesday, stating that he "received the same treatment as any visitor to Israel." The embassy said its only involvement was coordinating the landing of his private plane to help ensure a smooth visit.
An embassy spokesperson also clarified that it was inaccurate to suggest Israel had intended to allow Carlson into the country solely for the purpose of conducting the interview. According to the spokesperson, Carlson himself chose to remain in Israel for only a few hours before departing, a personal decision that was not imposed on him at any stage. The Israel Airports Authority likewise emphasized that there had been no unusual delay or interrogation.
Meanwhile, conservative commentator Laura Loomer alleged that the initial report of Carlson's "detention" had been planted. She claimed that Daily Mail reporter Philip Nieto had previously worked with Carlson and published a false story that Carlson himself had fed him, including an assertion that the White House had asked Carlson to confront Huckabee ahead of the US midterm elections. Loomer stressed that "the White House did not ask Carlson for anything" and described the episode as unethical conduct.
Ambassador Huckabee also weighed in online, stating that "everyone entering and leaving Israel is asked routine security questions." He noted that he too undergoes similar checks, despite holding a diplomatic passport and visa, and emphasized that passport inspections and security questioning are standard practice in every country.
The newly surfaced footage, together with the official denials and allegations that the story was deliberately planted, has placed Carlson at the center of criticism not only from Israeli officials but also from within segments of the American conservative camp.

Unidentified drone flew over Specialised Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office – UP
A new wave of attacks on anti-corruption bodies has begun a few weeks ago and recently at night an unidentified drone has been spotted over territory of the Specialised Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office (SAPO).
Source: Ukrainska Pravda article
Quote: "According to sources in one of law enforcement agencies, recently at night a drone was spotted over territory of the Specialised Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office. Police were called to the scene. Affiliation of UAV is currently being established."
Details: Last week, during a public report on the work, Semen Kryvonos, head of the National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU), said that attempts to pressure agencies do not stop. As an example, he cited a recent case when a listening device was found in the apartment of the head of a group of detectives working on uncovering crimes in the defence sector. Anti-corruption officials are not disclosing the circumstances but the publication notes that such an operation could hardly have been carried out without help of special services.
All these events are taking place at a time when a new wave of negativity about the agencies has appeared in Telegram channels. A similar campaign was already observed in summer 2025 before the attempt to take away independence of anti-corruption bodies.
Then, as well as now, NABU and SAPO have been accused of corruption and inefficiency. For the period of 12-26 January 2026, 238 publications with negative sentiment were recorded on social media. The vast majority of negative mentions came from anonymous or semi-anonymous resources, which may indicate managed information influence.
Anti-corruption bodies, in turn, insist that attempts of any influence will not slow down their work. All the more so because, for example, the Midas case has moved into other jurisdictions that are ready to cooperate and are already working with Ukrainian investigation.

Even Fox News hosts struggling to make sense of RFK Jr’s and Kid Rock’s workout video
‘Listen, somebody needs to tell RFK Jr. it’s okay to wear shorts. I mean, bro, don’t be upset about your legs,’ Fox News military analyst Johnny Jones said

Why did Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr and aging rap-rocker Kid Rock release a sweaty, shirtless workout collab video? Not even Fox News is sure.
During an episode of The Five on Wednesday, the panel members were left scratching their heads during a discussion of the bizarre video.
In a clip posted to X, Kennedy and Kid Rock, both shirtless, take turns riding on a stationary bike and doing pushups in what looks like a sauna. At one point, Kid Rock flips the middle finger to the camera. A title screen, inexplicably featuring a great white shark, tells us this is Kennedy and Kid Rock's "Rock Out Work Out."
The video is apparently intended to promote the DHHS secretary's Make America Healthy Again agenda.
Fox News' Greg Gutfeld watched the video and asked his co-panelists, "This raises a question: who rubs off on who?"
“You would think, ‘Oh, my God. RFK Jr is hanging out with Kid Rock. Oh, poor RFK Jr. is going to end up drinking. He’s going to be drinking again. He’s going to be womanizing again.’ And then what happens? You see Kid Rock at the gym," Gutfeld said. "He’s like, you know, working out and cold plunge—it’s like RFK was a bad influence on Kid Rock. Who would have seen that coming?”
Fox News military analyst Johnny Jones pointed out that the DHHS secretary wore blue jeans throughout his entire workout.
“Listen, somebody needs to tell RFK Jr. it’s okay to wear shorts. I mean, bro, don’t be upset about your legs. I don’t care what they look like. Take it from me, nobody needs impressive legs. You look great with your shirt off. Throw the shorts on so we don’t all go, ‘Wow, that’s weird.’”
Emily Compagno jumped on the “no jeans” bandwagon with Jones.
“My pet peeve was jeans at the beach in California. Now it might be jeans at the gym,” she said.
Even with the minor critiques, The Five is still a Fox News product, so it wasn't long before the hosts found a way to praise the video.
“I’m obviously not the audience for this video, but I like the idea of people eating healthier,” Dana Perino said. “I think that is great, and the access to it is wonderful. So the more people that learn about it, the better. I’m all for that.”
In January, Kennedy introduced an inverted food pyramid, which now places nutrient-dense proteins, healthy fats, fruits, and vegetables at the top, and grains at the bottom.
“These Guidelines return us to the basics,” Kennedy said in a statement at the time. “American households must prioritize whole, nutrient-dense foods—protein, dairy, vegetables, fruits, healthy fats, and whole grains—and dramatically reduce highly processed foods. This is how we Make America Healthy Again.”
Harold Ford Jr split the difference, noting that he "doesn't get into cold plunges with guys" — referencing a moment when Kennedy and Kid Rock share glasses of whole milk while lounging in a pool together — but said he was otherwise "impressed by the video."
"I’m a Kid Rock fan. I love his music, but to the substance for one moment, I think what Secretary Kennedy is doing around food is really, really important,” he said.
He also offered an under-the-radar critique of Kennedy that may have been the sharpest to come out of the discussion.
“It’s an issue I think [Kennedy] knows, and knows more so than some of the professional medical and scientific, other things that he talks about,” Ford Jr said.

The Guardian view on the royals and the law: no more managed disgrace | Editorial
Unknown
Unknown Publisher

04:06:25 KST

The arrest of Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor the king’s brother, should be the moment deference ends and accountability begins – a correction long overdue. For more than 15 years, allegations surrounding Mr Mountbatten-Windsor were managed away by silence, an out-of-court settlement and his withdrawal from royal duties. In short, his behaviour was viewed as an image problem to be handled privately. That era now looks to be over.
That the eighth in line to the throne was sitting in a police cell on his 66th birthday shows how far he has fallen. The formal investigation means that the question is no longer about protecting the monarchy but one of what happened, and who might be responsible for unlawful acts. Mr Mountbatten-Windsor’s descent into ignominy has unfolded slowly but inexorably. His stupidity and arrogance led him to believe that he could talk his way out of his relationship with the convicted child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Instead, he faces a legal and constitutional reckoning.
Thames Valley police arrested the royal on suspicion of misconduct in public office, following a complaint by the anti-monarchy group Republic. The offence carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. Within the 3m files and messages released by the US Department of Justice are emails that appear to show Mr Mountbatten-Windsor forwarding documents and commercial information to Epstein while serving as trade envoy. The king’s brother denies any wrongdoing.
A single 2001 photograph plunged the monarchy into crisis. It showed the then Prince Andrew with 17-year-old Virginia Giuffre and lent credibility to her trafficking allegations. The visual evidence made it hard to dismiss her statements as implausible. Though he denied knowing her and rejected the claims, a £12m settlement followed and the image shaped a scandal that shook the House of Windsor. More women have come forward alleging abuse, which Mr Mountbatten-Windsor denies.
Ms Giuffre died by suicide last year. Her family said that Mr Mountbatten-Windsor’s arrest shows that “no one is above the law”. MPs should not bend the knee before inheritance and rank. As this column has long argued, it cannot be right to call for the king’s brother to give evidence to US lawmakers, but not to parliament. Liam Byrne, the Labour chair of the cross-party business and trade committee, was correct, in a constitutional sense, that Mr Mountbatten-Windsor could be questioned by MPs. His public office as trade envoy answers to parliament. It is not the law, but convention – including Commons rules barring “reflections” on the royals – which restrains politics.
Mr Mountbatten-Windsor is still a counsellor of state, theoretically able to stand in for the king. He will never wear the crown. Parliament should now debate whether hereditary privilege can coexist with democratic accountability.
Symbolically, this episode surely marks the end of the assumption that being part of the royal household is a badge of impunity. Practically, it should deliver more victim-centred accountability. The story of Mr Mountbatten-Windsor’s Epstein connections is only beginning. If there are no charges, it becomes a story about institutional reform. If prosecution proceeds, he will answer to 12 jurors who will judge him by the evidence, not by his birth. Either way, the old model – of discreet exile and silence – seems finished.

UK may not allow US to use its bases to attack Iran over possible int'l law violations - report
Unknown

04:05:32 KST

The United Kingdom has yet to allow the United States to use its bases in the region to attack Iran, The Sunday Times reported on Thursday.
The hesitation reportedly follows concerns of possible international law violations, which “makes no distinction between a state carrying out the attack and those in support if the latter have 'knowledge of the circumstances of the internationally wrongful act.’”
According to a Wednesday Truth Social post by US President Donald Trump, the US may need to use the joint UK-US Diego Garcia military base and the Royal Air Force (RAF) Station base Fairford in Gloucestershire “in order to eradicate a potential attack by a highly unstable and dangerous Regime.”
Republican Senator Lindsey Graham sharply criticized the UK after the Time’s report, saying that if it is true, it would be an "astonishing" move that would raise “serious questions” about the status of Diego Garcia.
Graham argued that Iran, which he labeled as "the largest state sponsor of terrorism," is currently at its weakest point in years, due to internal mass protests and the "devastating blows" dealt by the US and Israel to the regime's military infrastructure.
He warned Britain that if it chooses to "sit on the sidelines," it will find itself "on the wrong side of history," and claimed this is yet another example of the erosion of US alliances in Europe.
Trump revokes support for Chagos Islands deal
The Times said that Trump and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer spoke on Tuesday night regarding Iran, and on Wednesday, Trump withdrew his support for Starmer’s deal to give the Chagos Islands, which include Diego Garcia, to Mauritius.
Britain and Mauritius last year struck a deal to transfer sovereignty of the islands to Mauritius, while allowing Britain to retain control of the air base under a long-term lease.
“Prime Minister Starmer should not lose control, for any reason, of Diego Garcia, by entering a tenuous, at best, 100 Year Lease,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “This land should not be taken away from the UK and, if it is allowed to be, it will be a blight on our Great Ally.”
“We will always be ready, willing, and able to fight for the UK, but they have to remain strong in the face of Wokeism, and other problems put before them.”
Trump had previously called the deal “an act of total weakness” and "another in a very long line of national security reasons why Greenland has to be acquired."
Reuters contributed to this report.

High Court urged to lift Oct. 7 audit freeze, hold semi-classified hearing
Unknown
Unknown Publisher
2026-02-19
19:05:21 UTC
04:05:21 KST

State Comptroller Matanyahu Englman on Thursday filed a 163-page sworn response with the High Court of Justice urging it to reject two petitions that prompted the court late last year to freeze a set of central audits into the failures surrounding the October 7 attack and the ensuing war, and asked the justices to convene an urgent hearing whose first segment would be held behind closed doors so that he could personally present draft findings, including material classified at the level of “top secret.”
In the filing, submitted on Thursday in response to a conditional order issued by the court on December 31, 2025, the Comptroller’s Office also asked that the three-justice panel currently hearing the petitions be expanded, arguing that the issues raised now require a constitutional interpretation of Basic Law: The State Comptroller that goes to the heart of the institution’s authority and its ability to independently audit the political, military and civilian echelons of government.
In response, the Prime Minister’s Office said that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had published cabinet protocols under his authority in order to expose the truth to the public after the High Court halted the comptroller’s review. “The only way to expose the full truth is through an equitable and independent commission of inquiry that will represent the entire public and before which all materials will be presented,” the statement said.
The December ruling did not permanently bar the comptroller from auditing the events of October 7, but temporarily froze work on eight defined “core” audits while the court considers whether reviews that touch on matters of national security decision-making, wartime policy and potential personal responsibility at senior levels fall within the comptroller’s statutory remit or should instead be reserved for a future state commission of inquiry.
Those petitions, filed by the Military Defense Counsel on behalf of IDF personnel and by the Movement for Quality Government, argued that audits dealing with policy and strategy or requiring broad investigative fact-finding risk exceeding the comptroller’s mandate and may undermine the procedural rights of individuals whose actions are being scrutinized. The court’s interim injunction followed, ordering Englman to explain why he should not refrain from examining such issues in the context of October 7 and the war.
In his sworn response, Englman rejects the premise that the audits seek to evaluate the substance of national policy itself, arguing instead that they examine the processes by which decisions were made and implemented and the systemic gaps between established standards and operational reality. Reviews of decision-making frameworks, intelligence coordination and implementation failures, he contends, fall squarely within the traditional domain of state audit and are consistent with international standards governing supreme audit institutions.
The right to cross-examine witnesses
He further disputes a key demand raised in the petitions that audits touching on possible individual responsibility adopt the procedural framework used by state commissions of inquiry, including the right to cross-examine witnesses. According to the filing, the legislature’s selective incorporation of certain inquiry-type powers into the State Comptroller Law creates a negative arrangement that precludes importing the full procedural regime applicable to commissions into audit proceedings.
A central institutional concern raised in the response is that narrowing the comptroller’s authority to exclude issues labeled “policy” or “strategy” would create what the filing terms “immunity zones” in precisely the areas where failures on October 7 are alleged to have occurred, allowing strategic-level decision-making by senior political and military officials to evade independent oversight while leaving only tactical questions subject to review. The Comptroller’s Office argues that such an outcome would create a structural gap in parliamentary supervision of the executive branch and risk long-term harm to the system of checks and balances.
The filing also asserts that the harm is already materializing on the ground. Since the issuance of the conditional order and interim injunction at the end of 2025, the office says, some officials and agencies have cited the pending litigation as grounds to delay meetings or withhold documents even on matters not covered by the freeze, exposing the public to partial accounts of the audit process through media disclosures rather than the finalized reports themselves.
According to materials submitted alongside the response, the frozen audits address decision-making processes and preparedness at the political, intelligence and military levels in the years leading up to October 7, including the functioning of the security cabinet, coordination between the political echelon and the intelligence community, defensive readiness along the Gaza border, and the formulation and implementation of understandings with Hamas from April 2018 until the outbreak of hostilities. Other topics under review include wartime stockpiling targets for ammunition and the use of economic tools against terrorist organizations.
A table attached to the filing details meetings held between audit teams and senior officials across 2025 and early 2026, including sessions with Netanyahu, former defense minister Yoav Gallant, former IDF chief of staff Herzi Halevi and former Shin Bet chief Ronen Bar, at which topics such as prewar intelligence processes, border defense doctrine and the events of October 7 were discussed in the context of the ongoing audits.
In requesting that the court hold the initial portion of the next hearing in camera, Englman argues that the publication of preliminary findings is legally barred unless expressly authorized by the comptroller, and that at least two draft reports - dealing with the defense of cities and aspects of the Nova festival attack near Re’im - contain material classified at the highest level. The motion proposes that only representatives of the Attorney-General’s Office with appropriate security clearance be permitted to attend the confidential segment, given that the draft findings may touch on third parties not represented in the proceedings.
Englman also pushes back against claims that the existence of the audits conflicts with the potential establishment of a state commission of inquiry into October 7, maintaining that the legislature envisioned the two mechanisms as complementary rather than mutually exclusive and noting that past commissions have relied extensively on comptroller reports in carrying out their mandates.
The filing comes against the backdrop of a broader debate over accountability for the failures of October 7 and the still-unresolved question of whether and when a full state commission of inquiry will be formed. Englman is asking the High Court to dismiss the petitions, lift the interim injunction freezing the eight audits and schedule an expedited hearing to allow the audit process - which his office says has already consumed more than 300 person-years of work across multiple reviews - to proceed without further delay.

Bronze scale pan found in ancient Sussiya reveals how biblical law shaped daily Jewish life

A rare bronze scale pan was discovered during excavations in the ancient Jewish town of Sussiya by a father and daughter participating in an educational dig, the Mount Hebron Regional Council announced on Thursday.
The dig was conducted by schools from the area, in cooperation with the Civil Administration’s Staff Officer for Archaeology in the West Bank and the Mount Hebron Regional Council.
Neta, a second-grader at Sussiya's regional school, and her father, Nachshon, discovered the pan inside a residential building near the town’s main street.
According to the statement, the bronze pan was part of a set of portable hanging scales common in ancient Israel, which included two small bowls with tiny holes along their rims suspended across a balance.
The find will undergo a formal conservation process and is expected to be displayed to the public in the future.
'Project is invaluable'
“Finding a scale pan in the heart of an ancient Jewish settlement is like finding a book of ethics buried in the ground,” Dr. Achiya Cohen-Tavor, archaeologist and director of the excavation, said, adding that the discovery “illustrates how the residents of Sussiya put the biblical commandment of 'Just balances, just weights shall you have’ [Leviticus 19] into practice.”
“In a world where every human action was understood as capable of tipping the scales of the entire world between merit and debt, this physical find is testimony to a life of social and spiritual responsibility."
Eliram Azulay, head of the Mount Hebron Regional Council, affirmed the importance of the communal and educational digs, as they allow the “younger generation to take an active part in uncovering our heritage and connecting to our roots.”
“It's an amazing project that connects children to heritage, culture, and the land,” Nachshon added, echoing Azulay’s words. “It's uplifting to see young children digging with such professionalism and according to careful, delicate excavation protocols. The project is invaluable.”

The Guardian view on Merz and Meloni: an emerging Berlin-Rome axis is threatening the EU’s green deal
Unknown

04:05:08 KST

When the European Union launched its green deal in 2019, putting into law the goal of climate neutrality by the middle of the century, it showed strategic foresight as well as global leadership. Russia’s war in Ukraine has starkly underlined the extent to which the continent’s energy security – and its future prosperity – is dependent on the transition away from fossil fuels. Lately, however, EU leaders’ environmental approach appears to be echoing the youthful St Augustine’s plea on chastity: make us greener, but not yet.
The recent European Industry Summit in Antwerp made unusually big headlines thanks to Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s xenophobic outburst over immigration. But it was also notable for fierce attacks on one of the most important pillars of EU environmental policy. The bloc’s emissions trading system (ETS) – which makes polluters pay for the C02 they emit – has achieved dramatic results in driving down overall emissions since 2005 and encouraging green innovation. Worryingly, the German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, appeared to sympathise with demands from Sir Jim and other CEOs for a radical relaxation of the rules.
There will be much more of this to come. Together with the far-right Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, Mr Merz is championing a deregulatory approach to delivering growth that risks hobbling Europe’s climate ambitions. Ms Meloni has long railed at what she has described as “green follies” imposed by Brussels. In Mr Merz, an economic liberal instinctively hostile to regulation, she has acquired a powerful ally.
The Berlin-Rome axis has already succeeded in diluting plans to ban the sale of new petrol and diesel vehicles by 2035. EU leaders have also voted to scale back overall 2040 targets for greenhouse gas reduction. Corporate sustainability reporting rules have been watered down. Italo-German calls for greater flexibility in achieving decarbonising goals, and attacks on regulatory systems such as the ETS, have the potential to license a full-scale pivot away from net zero targets.
This is disastrously shortsighted from an economic as well as an environmental point of view. When the green deal was launched, it was rightly seen as a means to encourage the changes needed to make economies competitive in a fossil-fuel-free era. Competition from China has underlined the importance of moving faster in this direction. Instead, the rising influence of rightwing populism across the continent is leading to a new go-slow consensus.
As the former head of the European Central Bank Mario Draghi has argued, the true path to future competitiveness lies in sustained investment, partly financed by common EU borrowing, and incorporating a bold green industrial strategy. Mr Merz is right to suggest that, in some areas, a simplification of bureaucratic hurdles could be beneficial for growth. But a blind faith in deregulation, and capitulation to corporate lobbying on environmental rules by the likes of Sir Jim, is not a remotely adequate strategy for the times, ethically or economically.
Given Donald Trump’s ongoing determination to undermine international attempts to combat global heating, Europe’s role as a climate leader is more vital than ever. So too is the need to develop an industrial vision that ensures the continent’s prosperity and security in the long term. As Mr Merz and Ms Meloni manoeuvre, it is time for defenders of the EU’s green deal to stand up and be counted.

Iranian-American journalist Masih Alinejad receives Courage Award on behalf of Iranian protesters

Iranian-American journalist Masih Alinejad accepted the Courage Award on Wednesday at the Geneva Summit for Human Rights and Democracy on behalf of Iranian protesters, many of whom have lost their lives this past month, demonstrating against the Islamic regime.
Demonstrations broke out across Iran in response to the country’s economic crisis and the rapid devaluation of the rial. As authorities began a brutal crackdown, murdering thousands of protesters and enacting a country-wide internet blackout, civilians spoke out in support of regime change.
Alinejad collected the award in front of a coalition of more than 30 human rights organizations.
The Courage Award was presented to the Heroes of Iran by Swedish Member of the European Parliament Alice Teodorescu Måwe, who said, “History will remember those who excused the brutality and those who closed their ears to the Iranian tiger’s abyssal roar. But history will also remember those who stood up – when it was dangerous, lonely, and therefore essential.”
“I do not accept this award as a personal honor. I accept it as a platform to indict the Islamic Republic for its massacre. The real courage belongs to the Iranian women and men who carry bullets in their bodies and still demand freedom,” Alinejad said.
“While diplomats of the Islamic Republic, including its foreign minister Abbas Araghchi, walk freely through the halls of the United Nations in Geneva, more than 40,000 innocent Iranians have been massacred at home.
“The same regime that blinded protesters, stormed hospitals, executed children, and sent assassins abroad is still granted the privilege of diplomacy. What a historical shame. Geneva cannot be a safe haven for representatives of a regime that behaves like ISIS.”
Recognizing victims maimed by the IRGC, she asserted, “The world cannot normalize a regime that shoots women and men in the eyes, executes protesters, and sends assassins across borders storming into hospitals, finishing off the injured, and hanging the protesters,” and demanded international intervention.
Iran must be deprived of seats at the UN, Alinejad said
The activist insisted that Tehran be deprived of seats at the UN and other institutions, and its officials exiled, sanctioned, and prosecuted for their roles in the regime’s crimes and international accountability. While Alinejad now lives in New York City, the Islamic regime has targeted her for her condemnations of the widespread human rights violations.
She has faced multiple kidnappings and assassination plots and now lives under FBI protection.
“We chose the heroes of Iran for this award because they have done what the United Nations has failed to do: they have looked the regime in the eye and refused to blink,” said Hillel Neuer, executive director of UN Watch, a co-organizer of the summit. “For nearly 50 years, this tyranny has relied on fear to survive. These heroes are proving that the fear is gone, and the regime is terrified.”
“While the world’s diplomats shake hands with the butchers of Tehran, we are honoring their victims. This award is our message to the people of Iran: You are not alone. When your government cuts the internet to kill in the dark, we will be your voice. We will ensure the world cannot look away,” he concluded.

Brazil court reinstates order to free up access to Santarem port terminal
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
SAO PAULO, Feb 19 - A Brazilian court reinstated late on Wednesday an order to free up access to the Santarem river port terminal where U.S. grain trader Cargill operates, according to a ruling signed by federal judge Shamyl Cipriano and seen by Reuters.
Indigenous protesters have been blocking truck traffic at the entrance of Cargill's Santarem grain terminal in northern Brazil for several days, protesting against plans to dredge the Tapajos river.
Last Friday, a federal court issued a decision obligating the government to adopt measures in 48 hours to remove protesters and restore access to Cargill's facility in Para state.
Federal prosecutors told Reuters they appealed that decision, arguing the ruling ignored norms of the National Council of Justice, which requires the direct participation of indigenous peoples and the holding of mediation hearings before any removal.
That led to the ruling being overturned on Sunday, prosecutors said, before Wednesday's reinstatement offered a win for Cargill.
The prosecutors are analyzing the latest court decision.

While Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor’s arrest by British police on Thursday came after years of uproar over his association with Jeffrey Epstein, documents show he had been on the radar of US law enforcement for nearly 15 years.
Mountbatten-Windsor’s name came up during a 2011 FBI inquiry into Epstein, investigative documents recently disclosed by the justice department reveal. Mountbatten-Windsor has denied all allegations of misconduct related to Epstein.
In March of that year, agents traveled to Australia after an Epstein victim contacted federal prosecutors in south Florida, saying she had “information pertinent” to the late financier and his accomplice, Ghislaine Maxwell.
The victim’s name is redacted from several documents chronicling the interview, but details closely track the public and legal claims made by Virginia Giuffre, a well-known Epstein accuser who died by suicide last year.
Giuffre said Epstein abused her and that he and Maxwell trafficked her to other men, including Mountbatten-Windsor.
During the FBI interview, the woman said that she was a locker-room attendant at Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach. Maxwell saw her reading a book on massage or anatomy and said she was seeking a traveling masseuse, the woman told investigators.
She told FBI agents she traveled with Maxwell and Epstein to London and that they went to a nightclub with Mountbatten-Windsor and alleged that she and the then-royal engaged in sexual activity at Maxwell’s home. She also alleged that there was sexual activity at Epstein’s Manhattan home, according to the FBI document.
Andrew has repeatedly denied engaging in sexual activity with Giuffre. During his Newsnight interview in November 2019, Andrew insisted he had been elsewhere during this alleged incident, saying: “I was with the children, and I’d taken Beatrice to a Pizza Express in Woking for a party at, I suppose, four or five in the afternoon. And then because the duchess [Sarah Ferguson] was away, we have a simple rule in the family that when one is away the other is there.”
The document does not appear to be online any longer, at least as initially indexed, but the Guardian downloaded the file and its URL is in the Internet Archive. Another document that appears near-verbatim to this one, but with accused men’s names redacted, appears in public records request filings that remain online.
Following Epstein’s arrest, Mountbatten-Windsor appeared to feature more prominently in law enforcement’s inquiries into Epstein, both in private Department of Justice communication and public statements.
An internal DoJ memo dated 19 December 2019 revealed prosecutors were interested in speaking to him. “We are in the process of obtaining the name of a lawyer who represents Prince Andrew. Once we have this contact information, we plan to request an interview,” a footnote in the memo states.
Epstein died in jail several months earlier, while awaiting his Manhattan federal sex-trafficking trial. Maxwell was found guilty in 2021 of sex trafficking for her involvement in Epstein’s abuse of teenage girls.
Geoffrey Berman, who was the Manhattan US attorney overseeing Epstein’s prosecution, repeatedly criticized Mountbatten-Windsor for alleged unwillingness to help their investigation. Berman said on 27 January 2020 Mountbatten-Windsor had provided “zero” cooperation in their Epstein investigation despite his promises to help.
“Contrary to Prince Andrew’s very public offer to cooperate with our investigation into Epstein’s co-conspirators, an offer that was conveyed via press release, Prince Andrew has now completely shut the door on voluntary cooperation and our office is considering its options,” Berman similarly said on 9 March 2020.
“Today, Prince Andrew yet again sought to falsely portray himself to the public as eager and willing to cooperate with an ongoing federal criminal investigation into sex trafficking and related offenses committed by Jeffrey Epstein and his associates, even though the Prince has not given an interview to federal authorities, has repeatedly declined our request to schedule such an interview, and nearly four months ago informed us unequivocally – through the very same counsel who issued today’s release – that he would not come in for such an interview,” Berman said in a statement.
“If Prince Andrew is, in fact, serious about cooperating with the ongoing federal investigation, our doors remain open, and we await word of when we should expect him.”
Contact information for Mountbatten-Windsor’s press representative was not immediately available.

Council CEO hiring process may have broken governance principles, insiders say

Council CEO hiring process may have broken governance principles, insiders say
Redland City Council may have gone against principles of the Local Government Act when it changed a hiring process for a $500,000 CEO job in a secretive meeting, according to multiple sources with local governance experience.
The bayside south-east Queensland council appointed an internal applicant, Louise Rusan, to the $500,000 role in February last year, despite her not being shortlisted by an independent recruiter or being chosen by a panel as a top candidate.
Leaked documents obtained by this masthead showed a process where a staffer who reported to then acting CEO Rusan chaired the panel, and a decision made in a closed-door meeting, forbidden by council policy, altered the agreed-upon recruitment process. This masthead is not suggesting any wrongdoing on the part of Louise Rusan, just that there were irregularities with the hiring process that saw her installed as council CEO.
Multiple sources with experience in local government processes, granted anonymity to discuss the sensitive matter as they still work in the sector, said the process was worrying, and may not have complied with the principles of the Local Government Act.
The five principles of the act are that councils must ensure processes are transparent and effective, follow good governance, make sure councillors behave ethically and legally, have sustainable development and have democratic representation.
Two sources said it could be argued the council went against at least the first three of those principles by failing to act transparently, and three said it was unusual that the mayor did not chair the selection process.
One source said the second two principles, relating to good governance and ethical behaviour, may also not have been fully complied with.
A council spokesperson was unable to respond on Thursday afternoon about whether the principles were broken, but said they would reply on Friday.
The documents show that a closed-door meeting decided to wedge Rusan into a final-round interview, going against a council policy that decisions cannot be made in such meetings.
The change irked long-time councillor Wendy Boglary, who wrote to integrity experts employed by the council.
“I am concerned that this deviation from the agreed process, including an inappropriate vote, may have influenced the selection outcome,” she said in an email obtained by this masthead.
In November 2024, the council voted in favour of a process where a panel consisting of mayor Jos Mitchell, deputy mayor Julie Talty, and two external members, and chaired by acting head of human resources Micah Beaumont, would recommend preferred candidates to present to the council.
That occurred, but following presentations by the two chosen candidates, council decided to eliminate one of the preferred candidates and to hear from Rusan, in a meeting that excluded the independent panel members.
“The majority of councillors supported [the other preferred candidate] but requested to hear from the third ranked candidate, being Louise Rusan,” Beaumont, who reported to Rusan as acting CEO, wrote to the panel following the meeting.
It is unclear how Rusan became the third ranked candidate despite not being on a shortlist for the job.
In her email to the audit and risk committee, Boglary said the altered process opened the recruitment up to political interference.
“Given this was strongly driven by a councillor, deputy mayor Julie Talty, it could be perceived as political influence, which, in my opinion, undermines the principles of good governance,” she said, seeking advice about “how to manage the impending risks associated with this recruitment process”.
Deputy mayor Julie Talty, who has served on the council since 2012, is yet to respond to questions from this masthead.
Wendy Boglary also refused to comment, other than to say her issue was not with Rusan’s appointment but the process behind it.
A council spokesperson said the process followed the organisation’s recruitment guidelines, which do not stop employees with working relationships from being on the panel, but does include conflict of interest provisions.
The head of human resources – the position Beaumont was acting in – also chaired the recruitment panel the last time the council selected a new CEO in 2017, the spokesperson said.
State secretary for The Services Union Queensland, who represents workers at the council, Neil Henderson said the process for hiring such a well-paid and important position must be “fair, rigorous and transparent”.
“The public should be able to have absolute confidence that persons recruited for such a high paying important role are the best available for the job,” he said.
Local government minister Anne Leahy would not say whether the state should take action at the council, but said the hiring of a CEO was a matter for the council.
A governance advisor was appointed at the council in late 2025 following a year of infighting at the council that saw more than 10 per cent of complaints to the state council watchdog generated from the Redlands.

Voll's first big step in 'massive role' as Australia beats India in second T20

Australia beat India by 19 runs in the second Twenty20 after losing the first game.
Georgia Voll, replacing Alyssa Healy as opener after captain's retirement, notched 88 at Manuka Oval, which is her highest score in the format.
What's next?
Australia plays India in the third T20 in Adelaide before three ODIs and a Test.
As a starry-eyed youngster, Georgia Voll was inspired watching Alyssa Healy thrash the cricket ball around stadiums across the world.
The 22-year-old now feels she has an obligation to keep the legacy going as she prepares to take over the mantle as one of Australia's openers after Healy's impending retirement.
"It's a massive role at the top, to try and fill Midge's shoes," Voll said.
"She's someone who's been incredible for such a long period of time.
"Being a fan of the game and watching her over a long time, and to be able to put my own little spin on it as well has been super fun."
Voll hammered a game-defining 88 from 57 balls to guide Australia to 5-163 in their second Twenty20 against India on Thursday night in Canberra.
Their opponents could not overcome the target, slumping to 9-144 after some tidy bowling by Ashleigh Gardner (3-22), Annabel Sutherland (2-18) and Kim Garth (2-16).
But the victory for Voll meant a lot as it was her highest T20 international score.
But to Voll's benefit, she now gets to work with another one of her idols, Beth Mooney, whose 46 off 39 in Canberra took her past Meg Lanning (3,405) as Australia's greatest T20 run-scorer.

"I've known Moons for a long time and worked alongside her as a 16-year-old," Voll said.
"There's a reason why she's one of the best batters in the world … it's great to have her experience up the other end.
"She's the calm head. When I'm chunking the ball down the leg-side, she comes down and lets me know that it's all right. It turns your headspace."
Voll and Australia are now turning their attention to their final T20 match against India on Saturday in Adelaide, which will also be their fourth-last Twenty20 clash before June's World Cup in England and Wales.
After her side lost their first game of their bilateral series against the women in blue last Sunday, Voll believes they are back on track.
"We've been a part of playing franchise cricket for the last few months," she said.
"It was nice to get out there tonight and show what we're capable of as a group again. I'm sure that I'll take a lot of confidence going into Adelaide."
In announcing her retirement, Healy said she would not play the T20s to allow the team to prepare for the World Cup, but will link back up with the team for three ODIs and a Test.

Simulations shed light on how snowman-shaped body in Kuiper belt may have formed
Unknown

It is the most distant and primitive object ever visited by a spacecraft from Earth: now researchers say they have fresh insights into how the ultra-red, 4bn-year-old body known as Arrokoth came to have its distinctive snowman-like shape.
Arrokoth sits in the Kuiper belt, a vast, thick ring of icy objects that lies beyond the orbit of Neptune. This region of space is home to most of the known dwarf planets as well as comets and small, solid rubble heaps called planetesimals – the building blocks of planets.
Not all of these planetesimals are rounded: indeed, astronomers estimate 10-25% of those found in the Kuiper belt, including Arrokoth, have two lobes, meaning they look a bit like a peanut or a snowman.
Experts have previously said Arrokoth’s shape, composition and small number of craters suggests both lobes formed at the same time and in a non-violent way, proposing that this could have occurred through a process known as gravitational collapse. However, the details of just how this would have happened have been debated.
Now researchers have used computer simulations to show that gravitational collapse can indeed produce such double-lobed objects, and to shed light on the mechanism.
“It’s so exciting because we can actually see this for the first time,” said Jackson Barnes, the first author of the research, based at Michigan State University. “This is something that we’ve never been able to see from beginning to end, confirming this entire process.”
As Barnes notes, the Kuiper belt is a remnant of the solar system’s primordial protoplanetary disk, within which vast rotating clouds of pebbles are thought to have formed. In the gravitational collapse scenario, gravitation forces within these clouds caused the pebbles to form into clumps, or planetesimals, of different sizes.
Writing in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, Barnes and colleagues report how they ran 54 simulations involving an initial pebble cloud containing 105 particles, each with a radius of about 2km (1.25 miles). This is a low-resolution model of the true situation as it is thought real pebble clouds would have contained about 1024 millimetre-sized particles.
The team found that in some cases two small planetesimals ended up orbiting each other, eventually spiralling inwards until, at velocities of about 5 metres a second or less, they touched and joined, forming a doubled-lobed planetesimal, or “contact binary”.
“Some of the contact binaries in our model look strikingly like Arrokoth,” Barnes said.
He noted that researchers had simulated gravitational collapse before but, unlike the new approach, they did not take into account the physics of how particles rest upon each other when they make contact. As a result, these simulations suggested any collision between smaller planetesimals would simply result in one larger, spherical object.
Barnes said the new simulations were also important because they supported the long-held view that planetesimals in general were formed through gravitational collapse.
Alan Stern, a planetary scientist at the Southwest Research Institute and principal investigator of Nasa’s New Horizons mission to the Kuiper belt, welcomed the study.
“It’s in agreement with previous work and support[s] the hypothesis that Kuiper belt object Arrokoth, which New Horizons explored in a close flyby, is the result of gentle formation processes,” he said.
Alan Fitzsimmons, an emeritus professor of astronomy at Queen’s University Belfast, noted that the simulations only suggested 4% of objects “out there” formed as contact binaries.
“Telescopic surveys imply much higher fractions,” he said. “It may be that Mother Nature prefers other ways of making them, or that future even more complex simulations can close the gap between what is calculated and what we see.”

Extreme heat lab: enduring the climate of the future

What heat does to your body
After the first experiment, Jay explains to me what I just went
through.
"So whenever people think about hot weather, they always talk about
the temperature," he says.
"There's two issues with that. First of all, most people don't
realise that the temperature is measured in the shade.
"So if you're in direct solar radiation, the amount of heat stress
you're exposed to is much greater as it will stress your body out a
lot more."
That explains the heat lamps. And, according to Jay, the other
important variable is the humidity.
"Humidity is the amount of water vapour that's in the air. And the
reason that's important is that the only way in which your body can
physiologically keep cool is that you produce sweat.
"But it's not production of sweat that cools you down. It's the
evaporation of sweat and it's the humidity in the air that prevents
that sweat from evaporating, even though the ambient temperature
might be the same."
So when high humidity goes along with extreme temperatures, your
body can no longer cool itself down, and the heat becomes deadly.
This is why in the next experiment I'm going to experience
conditions at the same temperature as the first experiment, but with
a much higher humidity of 36%.
Even though 36% relative humidity doesn't sound high, at 43C that
means a lot of moisture because warmer air can hold more water. When
it's this hot, sweating isn't going to help me stay cool very much.
Another way to think about it is the "feels like" temperature that
weather forecasts sometimes tell us about. Under the conditions I am
experiencing, the "feels like" temperature is over 49C or 120F.

From the Château de Versailles to the Elysée, the unshakable Catherine Pégard

In cultural circles, rumors had been circulating for several weeks: Catherine Pégard, Emmanuel Macron's culture adviser at the Elysée since September, might replace Rachida Dati at the Ministry of Culture if Dati chooses to fully focus on her Paris mayoral campaign ahead of the municipal elections scheduled for March 15 and 22. For now, however, the candidate for Paris City Hall – whose home and offices were searched in December 2025 as part of a judicial investigation into corruption and influence peddling related to her time as a member of the European Parliament – does not appear to be in any rush to pack her bags. Asked by Sud Radio on November 5 whether it was possible to serve as both minister and candidate, Dati replied without hesitation: "Everything is compatible."
When questioned at the end of December about the rumors that could see her appointed to the Ministry of Culture, Pégard stiffened. "That is not the issue," she replied, her face expressionless and lips tightly pressed together, in her small, spartan office on the first floor of the west wing of the Elysée. At 71, the former political journalist, who served in Nicolas Sarkozy's staff between 2007 and 2011 before overseeing the Château de Versailles for 12 and a half years, was all too familiar with the fleeting nature of political whispers. She had already been considered for the Ministry of Culture in 2022, but Macron ultimately chose his then cultural adviser at the Elysée, Rima Abdul Malak.
She is also well aware that other candidates, with more political experience or stronger credentials, are being considered. Chief among them is the affable Philippe Bélaval, who spent 40 years working in the cultural sector at the Opéra de Paris, the French National Library, the French National Archives and the National Monuments Center. There's only one blemish on his record: In 2016, he failed to take the helm of the Château de Versailles, where Pégard began her second term. A graduate of the Ecole Nationale d'Administration and Macron's culture adviser from 2023 to June 2025, he left the Elysée for personal reasons in the spring, though he remained in charge of the thorny issue of loaning the Bayeux Tapestry to the United Kingdom.

Netherlands to allocate additional EUR 2 mln to help return Ukrainian children
The Netherlands will allocate an additional EUR 2 million in 2026 for the identification and return to Ukraine of children abducted by Russia, including the provision of DNA testing kits, Roos Bos, who is responsible for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' activities in the area of combating child abduction, reported.
“Children are still being deliberately removed from Ukraine. Some have been forcibly adopted and placed in Russian families. There is only one reason Russia is doing this: the aim is to destroy Ukraine’s identity and culture and undermine its existence as an independent country,” she wrote in a blog on the Dutch government’s website.
Roos noted that most of the funds provided are earmarked for the supply of DNA testing kits, while the rest is for psychosocial support for children.
“The aim is to enable Ukraine to create a DNA database so that children who return from Russia can be reunited with their families as quickly as possible. Some of this financial support also helps provide psychosocial care for children who have returned to Ukraine from Russia. That is vital, because they often come back traumatised by their treatment by Russian occupying forces and authorities, which can include aggressive indoctrination,” she said.
According to her, DNA analysis has so far yielded impressive results.
“Collection of about 2,000 DNA samples from Ukrainian parents looking for missing children (as of late 2025). Collection of genetic material from more than 3,600 personal items belonging to Ukrainian children who have disappeared from children’s homes and other institutions. Identification of children killed in Russian acts of aggression, and the dignified return of bodies to families,” the diplomat noted.
Roos noted that the DNA database helps build evidence of child abductions, which will support prosecution of war crimes by courts, including the International Criminal Court.

'Canary in the coal mine': The possum on the frontline of Australia's extinction crisis
Unknown

03:58:57 KST

In Brief
- The lemuroid ringtail possum is one of 34 species that have just been added to Australia's threatened species list.
- Researchers say the scale and pace of man-made climate change has made it nearly impossible for species to adapt to changes.
Australia’s unique wildlife is facing an escalating extinction crisis and researchers say urgent climate action and stronger environmental protections are critical to prevent further irreversible loss of Australia's signature biodiversity.
While Australia is famed around the world for its vast array of unique plants and animals, it also has the highest rate of mammal extinction in the world and the second highest rate of biodiversity loss.
Conservation experts say Australia could lose many of these distinctive species in the near future.
Jess Abrahams, national nature campaigner with the Australian Conservation Foundation, said Australia's wildlife is being sent "to extinction" by climate change and other threats.
"We now have more than 2,300 plants, animals, and ecosystems threatened with extinction in Australia, and the list keeps growing.
"And unless we take some really urgent action to protect these unique plants and animals, our future generations won't be able to enjoy the unique nature that we have grown up with."
Species on the frontline
One animal on the frontline of this battle with a rapidly warming climate is the lemuroid ringtail possum.
The possum, native to north Queensland's Wet Tropics rainforests, is one of 34 species that have just been added to Australia's threatened species list as of February 2026.
Stephen Williams, who recently retired as a professor of biodiversity and climate change at James Cook University, has spent around 35 years studying the creatures.
He said he nominated the lemuroid ringtail possum as an endangered species in 2022 after noticing a rapid decline due to heatwaves and an increase in average temperatures.
"We've already lost about 60 per cent of the population of lemuroid ringtails in the last 15 years. And the predictions are that they're going to be almost extinct or extinct by about 2040 to 2050 kind of range.
"The increasing temperature, just the average temperatures across the whole year, decreases their reproductive biology, stops them breeding as much.
"And so there's sort of a double whammy. They're getting increased mortality and you're also getting decreased births. "
Abrahams said the decades of research gathered by Williams and his team showed the possums were constantly migrating higher and higher in their environment to escape the heat.
"It cannot survive under heatwave conditions, and it must climb higher and higher up the mountains to find cooler environments. But so many of our wildlife that are already living in higher altitude areas, when climate change comes, there's literally nowhere higher to climb. They're literally falling off the top of the mountain."
Williams said he didn't intend on focusing his research on the impacts of climate change but its vast destructive impacts became unavoidable to him as early as 2003.
"I was studying rainforest animals with no intention of working on climate change. We did some analysis which showed that if things continued the way they were going, that about 50 per cent of the species that I worked on would go extinct by the end of this century.
"And that just completely blew my mind and I sort of thought, 'Well, there's not really much point in studying anything else at this stage.'"
Professor James Watson, a conservation researcher from the the University of Queensland, said the length of Williams' research offers a unique look at the threats that many other species are likely experiencing without researchers knowing.
"The fear is obviously that the lemuroid possum is kind of the canary in the coal mine. It's well studied. But there are tons of species that we don't know are actually being affected because they're not being monitored.
"So we suspect there's a massive underestimate on the amount of species actually imperilled by climate change."
What can be done to protect the lemuroid ringtail possum?
Abrahams said adding the possum to the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act's threatened species list helps to raise their status to a "matter of national environmental significance" that is protected under Australia's national environment laws.
Australia's federal Environmental Protection Agency is scheduled to begin operations in July after a slate of environmental protection reforms were passed last year, however, Abrahams said the protections under the agency will need to be rigorous.
"There are also new rules and standards under these new laws, and the details of those rules are still being hashed out. But if these rules aren't strong, if they're full of loopholes, well an animal being added to the threatened species list perhaps won't give it the protection that it needs and they will still be at risk from extinction."
'Extreme' changes to climate
Williams said he and his colleagues have spent decades helping the lemuroid ringtail possum and other species adapt, but unless the pace of climate change is slowed by a rapid reduction of carbon emissions in Australia and around the world, their efforts will not amount to much.
"All these adaptation actions that we take in terms of protecting refugia, keeping animals in captivity, moving them around, whatever it is we do, it is still kind of fiddling at the edges a bit.
"It's doing the best we can, but the main thing that needs doing is stopping the temperature going too much higher. We're already at one and a half degrees, which is already a level which all of my analysis over the last 30 years says that the impacts will start to become worse and accelerate rapidly from one and a half degrees on."
Watson said most animals have an inherent ability to adapt to a changing climate, but the scale and pace of man-made climate change has made it nearly impossible for them to keep up with these changes.
He said humans have a duty to safeguard vulnerable animals as best as they can until the Earth can begin to recover from this damage.
"Every species that has evolved on Earth has undergone some kind of pressure from a changing climate simply because the climate is always changing. This climate changing event caused by humans is different. It's more extreme," he said.
"It's going to take hundreds of years for the climate to get back to normal. Even if we stop bad behaviour right now. These species are going to have to go through this kind of climate bottleneck, and we have to allow these species to have the best fighting chance."

Starlink loss a blow to Russian forces in Ukraine, say experts
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
- Elon Musk's Starlink cut-off likely disrupted Russian tactical command, restricting offensive capacity. Ukraine's defence adviser called it a "catastrophe" for crucial drone and command links.
- Russia sought Starlink accounts via Ukrainians and deployed less reliable Yamal/Express satellites. These large antennas are now Ukrainian targets, forcing Russia to move them back.
- Ukraine is exploiting Starlink disruption, regaining territory and launching counter-attacks. However, the overall impact on the conflict remains slow, with no dramatic shifts noted yet.

PARIS - US tech titan Elon Musk’s move to cut Russian access
Here is what we know about the importance of Starlink to Russia and in the Ukraine conflict:
Critical command and control role
Linking Russian drones to the Starlink satellites operated by Mr Musk’s SpaceX company
The satellites are also important for Russia’s command and control, “the organisation of the operational chain that allows the military at the top to give orders to all levels of responsibility, down to the combatants,” said a western military source.
“All armies that have a little money and need bandwidth use Starlink. It’s flexible, it’s not expensive, and it complements military systems that do not allow for increased bandwidth,” the source added.
In the Ukraine conflict, the US satellites “gave Russian units real-time control over their forces and drones, to have an overview of the line of contact” so they could make better decisions, Commander Yuriy Fedorenko, of Ukraine’s 429th Achilles Drone Brigade told Freedom TV.
The satellites are even more important as there is no real front line where the Russia and Ukrainian armies are in contact, according to a high-ranking European officer.
“It is a ‘kill zone’ several kilometres wide, patrolled by drones, where small mobile squads operate, trying to strike here and there,” the officer told AFP.
“Many Russian soldiers constantly move through the area. These are critical points,” Mr Serhii Beskrestnov, a technology adviser to the Ukrainian defence ministry, told AFP.
Blackout fallout
Ukraine says that blocking Starlink has an enormous impact on Russian forces.
AFP has not been able to independently assess the fallout.
“For the Russians, this is not just a problem, it is a catastrophe,” said Mr Beskrestnov. “We knew that they used Starlink on the front”, but “we did not believe that it was this crucial.”
The Russian side played down the consequences. Mr Valery Tishkov, a communications official for the Russian military, said that Starlink was only used marginally and that the army “has all modern, domestically-produced communication services. The operations control system functions reliably and ensures the command and control of troops at the front.”
How will Russia adapt?
According to several Ukrainian sources, Russia has sought to pay Ukrainians to organise legitimate Starlink accounts that it can then use for its drones at the front.
Ukraine’s SBU security service has warned that this is a crime punishable by a sentence jail of life.
Russia has deployed alternative solutions, according to the Ukrainian sources, but these are not as reliable as Starlink’s low orbiting network. Russia has instead used its Yamal and Express geo-stationary satellites that are higher up and there are fewer of them.
“They need a satellite receiver equipped with a large parabolic antenna,” said Mr Beskrestnov.
These are now a prime target for Ukrainian forces and Russia has had to move back the antennae by 10-15 kilometres and deploy reinforced wi-fi from the receivers to the front lines.
“We are trying to locate these terminals,” said the adviser.
Decisive in conflict?
Ukrainian forces regained territory from Russia in February, a rare occurrence during the four years of war when they have gradually lost terrain amidst bitter battles that have cost thousands of lives.
On Feb 5, Russian military observers reported disruption of the Starlink internet terminals used by Moscow on the front lines after Musk took measures following a request from Kyiv.
A senior Ukrainian military official said that counter-attacks had been launched all along the front line in a single day, but gave no further details.
The US-based Institute for the Study of War says that Ukrainian forces are probably taking advantage of Russia’s loss of Starlink.
But so far there have been no dramatic changes. The European military source said that “very few troops are making direct contact with opposing soldiers, and there is no mechanised combat (which could force a breakthrough), so progress is very slow.” AFP

Zelensky discusses impact of Russian attacks with UN High Commissioner for Refugees
Zelensky stated this on Telegram, Ukrinform reports.
"We discussed the consequences of Russia's ongoing attacks on Ukraine's energy system and the assistance our people need. There must be more pressure to stop these attacks and more support for our people – especially those who are currently in Ukraine or planning to return," Zelensky stated.
He expressed gratitude to Salih for his first visit to Ukraine in his role as High Commissioner and for all the support the UNHCR provides to Ukrainians living under Russian attacks.
As Ukrinform previously reported, the United Nations has confirmed that more than 15,000 civilians have been killed in Ukraine since the start of the full-scale war.

Iran and US expand military readiness amid nuclear negotiations

Iran has reinforced key military and nuclear facilities with concrete and earth barriers as the United States increases its military presence in the Middle East and President Donald Trump renews threats of action if talks fail.
New satellite images published by Reuters and verified by BBC Verify show extensive construction at sensitive Iranian sites, including the Parchin military complex southeast of Tehran. Analysts say a newly built structure at Parchin has been encased in concrete and covered with soil, a move designed to shield it from aerial attack.
Al Jazeera reported that the Institute for Science and International Security said in a January analysis that Iran appeared to be building what it described as a “concrete sarcophagus” around a facility known as Taleghan 2. The institute’s founder, David Albright, wrote that the work would provide “significant protection from aerial strikes”.
Images dated between October 2024 and February 2026 show reconstruction after reported Israeli strikes in 2024, followed by the erection of a metal frame, installation of a roof and eventual covering of the site in concrete and earth. Western intelligence agencies have long linked Parchin to past weapons-related research, an allegation Tehran denies. Iran maintains that its nuclear programme serves civilian energy needs.
Further satellite imagery indicates that Iran has buried tunnel entrances at the Isfahan nuclear complex, one of three enrichment sites targeted by US strikes last summer during a 12-day conflict involving Israel and the United States. Analysts cited by Reuters said the entrances were fully covered by early February.
Near Natanz, another major enrichment facility, images show reinforced tunnel openings in a mountain complex about 2km from the main site.
The activity coincides with a significant US military build-up. According to US media reports, Washington has deployed the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln to waters near Iran, along with guided missile destroyers and dozens of fighter jets. The USS Gerald R Ford is expected to arrive in the region within weeks.
Axios reported that more than 150 US military aircraft have transported weapons systems and munitions to the Middle East in recent days. The Wall Street Journal described the concentration of air power as the largest since the 2003 Iraq invasion. The Pentagon has also repositioned some personnel out of exposed areas as a precaution, according to CBS News.
Speaking at the inaugural meeting of his Board of Peace initiative in Washington, Trump said the United States had “some work to do with Iran”. He repeated his demand that Tehran end its nuclear programme. “They can’t have a nuclear weapon. Very simple. You can’t have peace in the Middle East if they have a nuclear weapon,” he said.
Trump added that negotiations were under way but warned that other options remained open. “We may have to take it a step further, or we may not. Maybe we’re going to make a deal. You’re going to be finding out over the next probably 10 days,” he said.
Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said after recent indirect talks in Geneva that an understanding had been reached on “guiding principles” for further negotiations. Omani Foreign Minister Badr Albusaidi, whose country is mediating the talks, said discussions had concluded with “good progress” on common aims and technical matters.
Tehran has insisted that any agreement must focus on its nuclear activities and sanctions relief. Washington has indicated that missile development and regional alliances should also form part of any deal.
US lawmakers have reacted to the prospect of military action. Congressmen Ro Khanna and Thomas Massie said they would introduce a war powers resolution to require congressional approval before any strike on Iran. Khanna said the president “can’t” launch a war without Congress.
Iranian authorities advised airlines to avoid certain Middle Eastern airspace during military exercises in the Gulf.
Iran continues to deny that it seeks nuclear weapons. The United Nations nuclear watchdog has previously said it found no evidence that Tehran was actively pursuing a bomb.

Trump changed mind on Chagos deal ‘after UK blocked use of Diego Garcia for Iran strikes’

Donald Trump changed his mind on supporting the Chagos Islands deal because the UK will not permit its airbases to be used for a pre-emptive US strike on Iran, the Guardian has been told.
In his latest change of heart on the deal, the US president said on social media that Keir Starmer was “making a big mistake” by handing sovereignty of the islands to Mauritius in exchange for continued use by the UK and US of their airbase on one of the islands, Diego Garcia.
While Trump had previously criticised the plan, which is backed by the US state department, earlier in February he had described it as the “best” deal Starmer could make in the circumstances.
But in Trump’s post on his own Truth Social site he linked the deal with US military strikes against Iran in connection with Tehran’s nuclear ambitions, which are believed to be imminent. He wrote: “Should Iran decide not to make a Deal, it may be necessary for the United States to use Diego Garcia, and the Airfield located in Fairford, in order to eradicate a potential attack by a highly unstable and dangerous Regime.”
A pre-emptive strike on Iran would be unlikely to be in line with the UK’s interpretation of international law. US bases in the UK, like Fairford in Gloucestershire, the home for US B-2 bombers in Europe, are only used for military operations if the UK government agrees and they are considered legal.
UK government sources said this was viewed as the reason for Trump to again turn against the Chagos plan.
On Tuesday night, Starmer and Trump spoke in a conversation that covered the situation in Iran, although the Downing Street readout of the call made no mention of the Chagos plan.
The hope in No 10 is that Trump will again change his mind. The bill setting out the Chagos agreement is due to return to the House of Lords soon.
There has been speculation that the bill, which is nearing its final stages but was delayed last month amid continued uncertainty about the US position, might have returned to the Lords next week. However, it is now not expected for several weeks.
Under parliamentary rules, if it is not passed before the end of the current parliamentary session in May, the bill would have to be presented again.
One former government official who worked closely on the deal said he was concerned it might be scuppered. Ben Judah, who was until recently a special adviser to David Lammy, the former foreign secretary, told a Sun podcast: “It’s looking tricky for the government to get this deal through in the weeks and month ahead.”
The Conservatives are continuing to push the Trump administration to block the plan, which Downing Street has said can only go ahead with US buy-in.
The shadow foreign secretary, Priti Patel, is giving a speech in Washington DC next week, and is expected to hold talks with US officials about the Chagos plan.
In a statement, Patel said the deal was “now dead in the water”, adding: “It’s impossible for the deal to proceed without the support of our American allies, and Labour will soon run out of time to put anything before parliament.”
A government spokesperson said: “As routine, we do not comment on operational matters. There is a political process ongoing between the US and Iran, which the UK supports. Iran must never be able to develop a nuclear weapon, and our priority is security in the region.”

HUD proposes rule that would force noncitizens from public housing
The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development is proposing a rule that would limit public housing mostly to citizens, which advocates fear could lead to tens of thousand of people being evicted
- Bookmark
The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development on Thursday proposed a rule that would limit public housing mostly to citizens, which advocates fear could lead to tens of thousands of people being evicted.
The rule, published in the Federal Register, calls for limiting funding for those in public housing and other HUD-related housing to citizens and eligible noncitizens. The rule would require every resident in HUD-funded housing to show proof of citizenship or eligible status, including those 62 years and older who previously only had to show proof of age.
The measure would effectively bar mixed status families —- where some household members are eligible for help — from housing and is part of the government’s immigration crackdown. A similar rule was proposed but never finalized during the first Trump administration and is mentioned as a policy priority in the conservative blueprint Project 2025,
"Under President Trump’s leadership, the days of illegal aliens, ineligibles, and fraudsters gaming the system and riding the coattails of American taxpayers are over,” HUD Secretary Scott Turner said in a statement.. “HUD’s proposed rule will guarantee that all residents in HUD-funded housing are eligible tenants. We have zero tolerance for pushing aside hardworking U.S. citizens while enabling others to exploit decades-old loopholes.”
The proposed rule will be made official when it’s published in the Federal Register on Friday. HUD did not answer how long it may take before the rule takes effect.
Housing advocates were quick to criticize the move.
“Our country can ensure that every one of us, no matter where we come from or what language we speak, has a safe home," Shamus Roller, the executive director of the National Housing Law Project said in a statement. “Instead, Trump is trying to evict immigrant families, citizen and non-citizen, from HUD housing.
In December, the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities estimated that up to 20,000 families or as many as 80,000 people could lose assistance due to changes in eligibility that would overturn a rule that has been in place for decades.
The impact of the rule could affect many more people who struggle to provide proper documentation. About 3.8 million adults with citizenship lack any form of documentation proving their citizenship, and another 17.5 million cannot easily get the documents.
“Everyone deserves an affordable home, including our neighbors, friends, and coworkers who are immigrants,” said Sonya Acosta, a senior policy analyst with the Center. “This rule would force 20,000 families with mixed immigration statuses to make the agonizing choice between losing the assistance that helps them pay rent every month or separating their family. People without a documented immigration status have never been eligible for rental assistance.”

Schools in England to get budget for children with special needs as part of Send overhaul

Children in England with special needs will receive individual support and therapy directly from their schools as part of the government’s overhaul of England’s special education provision.
Under the plans, mainstream schools will be given commissioning budgets to spend on therapists or additional support, instead of the money being controlled by highly indebted local authorities.
The plans are part of package of sweeping changes to special educational needs and disabilities (Send) provision that will be announced by the education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, on Monday.
The measures are aimed at fixing deep-rooted problems with the Send system and curbing spiralling costs that have brought several councils to the brink of bankruptcy. Critics of the current system say lop-sided funding mechanisms leave hundreds of thousands of children with little or no support in mainstream schools, requiring their families to battle local authorities for help.
But government officials are concerned that proposals to limit who has access to educational, health and care plans could prompt a backlash from parents’ groups and Labour MPs when it comes to a Commons vote.
Some are particularly concerned about plans to test those who currently hold ECHPs according to the new tougher criteria when they move up to secondary school, while others want to make sure parents can make a legal appeal if they feel schools are not meeting their children’s needs.
Meg Hillier, the chair of the Treasury select committee, said: “The key thing is trust. If parents think their support could be ripped away from them they will worry.”
However, she added that unlike the welfare reforms, over which she led a successful rebellion last year, ministers had been at pains to consult Labour MPs and were not focusing the reforms on saving money.
Another Labour MP said: “The government has got everyone very, very anxious. But the truth is everyone recognises the need for reform and not letting things continue as they are.”
Government insiders say they are optimistic that a rebellion can be averted in part because the Treasury has been more generous with funding than expected.
The full package of reforms will be phased in over a decade, with mainstream schools to make extra provision and support “ordinarily available” to any pupils.
Those schools will also be expected to make “reasonable adjustments” to accommodate children with conditions such as autism, ADHD or mental health issues, or face potential legal action.
That action could involve appealing to an independent ombudsman, or changing equalities rules to make disabled children’s rights more explicit.
Children with special needs at mainstream schools will be eligible for individual support plans (ISPs), which offer enhanced legal rights and assurances without a child requiring an EHCP.
But policymakers say the reforms could be derailed if the government fails to make clear the benefits of the new system, including continuing protections for EHCPs, which agree the needs and support for individual children between families and councils.
The new format for EHCPs will affect children only from 2030 onwards, and will take into account the extra provision available in mainstream schools.
Those involved with the negotiations told the Guardian: “If MPs hear there are protections for EHCPs and there’s more money [in the system], I think they will come onboard.”
More than 480,000 children and young people at schools in England have EHCPs, and reports have concentrated on fears that EHCPs could be curtailed or taken away at the transition from primary to secondary school after 2030.
The first tier equalities tribunal will still be available for appeals involving EHCPs although its role will be “refocused” and take account of the other legal routes available to families.

See the full list: Private insurer price hikes — and how to save cash

In Brief
- The 4.41 per cent average increase comes into effect on 1 April.
- Experts say there are various ways you can seek to save money on your health insurance.
The federal government has approved the largest health insurance premium increase since 2017 in a move Health Minister Mark Butler said reflected the "rising costs of providing medical and hospital services".
The 4.41 per cent average premium increase will be implemented from 1 April.
However, individual policies could increase by much more. For example, financial comparison site Canstar found that despite last year’s average premium increase of 3.73 per cent, the cost of an individual gold policy rose by an average of 11.6 per cent between March and April 2025.
According to Finder, another financial comparison site, 26 per cent of people with health insurance ranked it as one of their top three most stressful bills last month.
Fourteen per cent — or around 2.1 million people — said they won’t be renewing their private health insurance this year.
Canstar analysis found an average-priced gold hospital policy for an individual could increase by $167. For families, the increase could be $330, based on the average yearly wage of $104,807 and applying the relevant private health insurance rebate.
SBS asked financial experts to share their top considerations for Australians amid the premium increase.
What is a premium?
A premium is the amount you pay an insurer for insurance cover. Depending on your individual circumstances, the cost of your premium can change.
Factors can include the type of cover you select, previous claims you’ve made, government taxes, discounts, and any optional benefits you select.
Why are insurance premiums rising?
The increasing cost of medical services, as well as higher claims costs, inflation, and more extreme weather events are behind this year’s increase, said Sarah Megginson, a personal finance expert at Finder.
In a statement, the government said the rise also reflects increasing wage bills and securing the viability of private hospitals.
How will I know how much my premium will increase by?
These are the average premium increases approved for some funds:
- ACA Health Benefits Fund: 4.48 per cent
- AIA: 5.98 per cent
- Australian Unity: 3.98 per cent
- Bupa: 4.8 per cent
- Hunter Health Insurance: 3.92 per cent
- GMHBA: 1.98 per cent
- HBF: 2.15 per cent
- HCi: 4.53 per cent
- HIF: 2.6 per cent
- Health Partners: 3.94 per cent
- HCF: 4.96 per cent
- Latrobe Health Services: 4.53 per cent
- Medibank: 5.1 per cent
- Mildura Health Fund: 4.25 per cent
- nib: 5.47 per cent
- Peoplecare: 4.01 per cent
- Phoenix Health Fund: 2.95 per cent
- Reserve Bank Health Society: 4.13 per cent
- St. Lukes: 4.25 per cent
- Westfund: 3.26 per cent
You can view the full list here and find the federal government's website to compare products here.
The government says it is up to each insurer to explain to their policyholders any changes to premiums, the reasons why they have made this decision and their policyholders’ options.
Canstar’s data insights director Sally Tindall said: "Get on the phone to your provider to understand exactly how much your premium is going up by. Then spend 30 minutes doing a health check on your insurance. It could potentially save you hundreds."
What other steps can I take to find out more about health insurance premiums?
Canstar suggests exploring options including reviewing the level of cover and extras insurance, but being wary of the risks that could come from downgrading. The financial comparison site found that if an individual switched from an average-priced gold hospital insurance to the lowest, it could potentially save them $1,397 in a year.
Another suggestion is to pre-pay the next year’s premiums at today’s prices, before 1 April when the increase kicks in. According to Canstar, many insurers will let you pre-pay the next 12 months before they increase.
Megginson agreed and said: "You don’t have to accept the first renewal quote. Comparing policies, increasing your excess where affordable and reviewing whether you need all your current cover can help lower costs."
Changing to an entirely new and cheaper provider is also an option, with some offering the same level of cover you had before.
"Switching to a comparable policy within the same tier can help mitigate or even neutralise the price hikes," Tindall said.
Even just asking about bundling policies and asking about loyalty discounts with insurers can save you money, said Megginson.

At least 4 dead and 50 cars damaged after truck exploded on Chilean highway
Firefighters reported that the blast was felt within a 150 to 200-metre radius

At least four people have died and 17 others have been injured after a liquid gas truck overturned and exploded in Santiago, Chile's capital, authorities confirmed on Thursday.
The driver of the vehicle, who reportedly lost control before the crash, is among the fatalities, a police chief stated.
The incident, which involved a truck affiliated with local gas company Gasco, is now under investigation by the prosecutor's office. Gasco has not yet responded to requests for comment.
Dramatic videos circulating on social media captured plumes of flames rising from the scene in Renca, a northern commune of Santiago, situated near a major highway and industrial zone. Firefighters reported that the blast was felt within a 150 to 200-metre radius, causing damage to at least 50 vehicles.
President Gabriel Boric noted that debris from the explosion struck three local businesses, though no further widespread damage has been reported.
However, the human toll remains severe, with Claudio Orrego, the governor of the Santiago metropolitan region, confirming that five individuals are in serious condition. He added, "One has burns covering 100% of their body with imminent risk to their life."

How Trump is stacking the deck so his ballroom project sails through DC and comes to fruition
Trump said he plans to have the White House ballroom completed within a year and a half
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
President Donald Trump’s grand $400 million White House ballroom design was swiftly approved by the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts Thursday, clearing the first hurdle to move forward with construction months after he fired board members and replaced them with allies.
A panel of six commissioners chosen by Trump approved the latest and final design despite massive public resistance, while praising the president for designing a “beautiful structure.”
Since announcing his new ambitions for a 90,000-square-foot ballroom in July 2025, Trump has sought to expedite construction of the ballroom, which is nearly the size of the White House residence and West Wing combined.
Trump wasted no time tearing down the historic East Wing, changing initial cost estimates, and stacking two boards tasked with reviewing the construction plans with allies.
Here’s how else the president is making sure his new White House addition comes to fruition:
Demolishing the East Wing
Lawmakers and members of the public were shocked in October when construction teams began demolishing the historic East Wing of the White House – after Trump asserted the new ballroom would not “interfere” with the original building.
White House officials justified the change by saying architects had determined it was more cost-effective and structurally sound to demolish the East Wing.
But Democrats were quick to accuse the president of circumventing traditional processes of seeking permission from the National Capital Planning Commission, Commission of Fine Arts and congressional approval.
The National Trust for Historic Preservation sued the administration, hoping to halt construction. While the East Wing demolition has been completed and is therefore unable to be halted, the judge has not ruled on the new construction.
Installing allies on the Commission of Fine Arts
In October, the Trump administration fired all six members of the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts to make room for new commissioners “more aligned with President Trump’s America First Policies” after public criticisms over the demolition of the East Wing.
Typically, the seven-member panel tasked with giving expert advice to the president, Congress and D.C. government on design and aesthetic matters is made up of individuals with expertise in art, architecture, landscape architecture and urban design.
But Trump has tapped a group of individuals with a range of backgrounds, including some with no experience in the arts, to sit on the commission.
That includes 26-year-old Chamberlain Harris, the deputy director of Oval Office operations with no formal experience in art.
“This is sort of like the greatest country in the world. It’s the greatest house in the world. And we sort of want it to be the greatest ballroom in the world,” Harris said Thursday during the meeting.
James McCrery II, the architect originally hired to design the ballroom, is serving as the vice-chairman of the commission. McCrery stepped down as the architect in December. He has not participated in the review or vote on the ballroom.
The commission is being chaired by Rodney Mims Cook Jr., a developer and designer who founded the National Monuments Foundation. During the hearing, Cook offered Trump generous praise for his design and his efforts to promote world peace.
“No president has really stepped up to the plate to require that this be corrected until President Trump,” Cook said of Trump requesting a ballroom to host formal events.
The other members are: Roger Kimball, a conservative political commentator and art critic. Mary Anne Carter, the chairwoman of the National Endowment for the Arts, previously worked as a policy adviser in Florida. Pam Patenaude, who worked in the Department of Housing and Urban Development during the first Trump administration and second Bush administration. Matthew Taylor, a conceptual artist and film director who previously worked with Rudy Giuliani.
Installing allies on the National Capital Planning Commission
In December, a federal judge asked the government to maintain its promise to submit plans to both the Commission of Fine Arts and the National Capital Planning Commission, which is tasked with reviewing and providing guidance for construction projects on federal land and buildings.
In preparation to have plans go before the commission, Trump installed his former personal lawyer and current White House Staff Secretary, Will Scharf, as the chairman.
James “Michael” Blair, a White House official, has been installed as its commissioner. Stuart Levenbach, the chief statistician of the United States, was appointed vice chairman.
The National Capital Planning Commission is expected to review the design plans March 5.
Using private donors to pay for increasing costs
Initially, the president asserted the ballroom would cost around $200 million and promised to pay for it himself to avoid burdening taxpayers. But that price has doubled to $400 million and now requires donations from private companies and individuals.
That includes tech giants such as Amazon, Apple, Google, HP and Microsoft. Coinbase, Lockheed Martin, Palantir Technologies and T-Mobile are also among the reported donors.
Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, an ethics watchdog group, said the donations raise concerns about corruption.
“All of this money that they’re giving for something that’s important to the president could influence his decision-making, and he could be thinking about that instead of thinking about what’s best for the American people,” Noah Bookbinder, the president of CREW, told Axios.
The president and his allies have said it's necessary to build the ballroom because the White House currently does not have enough space to host large events. Currently, the White House will use outdoor tents to expand space – which has raised security concerns.
Trump plans to have the ballroom built and open to guests by summer 2028, giving builders roughly a year and a half to construct the new event space.

Trump announces billions of dollars in Gaza aid at Board of Peace meeting
Donald Trump announces pledges to a Gaza reconstruction fund during the first meeting of his Board of Peace.
Donald Trump has told the first meeting of his Board of Peace that nine member nations have pledged $7bn to a reconstruction fund for the Gaza Strip, with five countries agreeing to deploy troops to an international stabilisation force for the Palestinian territory.
Addressing the board in a meeting in Washington, DC, on Thursday, the United States president said the US will make a contribution of $10bn to the Board of Peace, although he didn’t specify what the money will be used for.

Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, the United Arab Emirates, Morocco, Bahrain, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Uzbekistan and Kuwait have raised an initial down payment for Gaza reconstruction, Trump said.
“Every dollar spent is an investment in stability and the hope of a new and harmonious [region],” said Trump. He added, “The Board of Peace is showing how a better future can be built right here in this room.”
The funds pledged, while significant, represent a fraction of the estimated $70bn needed to rebuild the Palestinian territory that has been decimated after more than two years of Israel’s genocidal war.
Proposed stabilisation force
Meanwhile, Indonesia, Morocco, Kazakhstan, Kosovo and Albania have pledged to send troops for the Gaza stabilisation force, part of Trump’s 20-point plan to end Israel’s war on Gaza. Egypt and Jordan have committed to training police officers.
Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto announced his country would contribute up to 8,000 troops to the proposed force “to make this peace work”.
The force, led by a US general with an Indonesian deputy, will start in the Israeli-controlled city of Rafah and train a new police force, eventually aiming to prepare 12,000 police and have 20,000 troops.
While the disarmament of Hamas was a part of Trump’s 20-point plan for Gaza, the group has been reluctant to hand over weaponry as Israel continues to carry out daily attacks on Gaza.
Hamas spokesperson Hazem Qassem said any international force must “monitor the ceasefire and prevent the [Israeli] occupation from continuing its aggression.” Disarmament could be discussed, he said, without directly committing to it.
Trump first proposed the board last September as part of his plan to end the war. But since the October “ceasefire”, Trump’s vision for the board has morphed, and he wants it to have an even more ambitious remit to tackle other conflicts worldwide.
The board has faced criticism for including Israeli representatives but not Palestinians.
Reporting from Gaza City, Al Jazeera’s Hani Mahmoud said that Palestinians want to see concrete solutions rather than pledges.
“Past experiences with conferences, with regard to reconstruction, with regard to the peace process, all ended up with large needs for funding that were delayed or [plans] that were not implemented,” he said.
“Palestinians don’t want to see this again; they don’t want to see the Board of Peace as another international body that falls into the category of crisis management rather than finding a tangible solution to this longstanding problem, the Palestinian problem,” Mahmoud noted.
More than 40 countries and the European Union confirmed they were sending officials to Thursday’s meeting. Germany, Italy, Norway, Switzerland and the United Kingdom are among more than a dozen countries that have not joined the board, but are taking part as observers.

Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor arrest: History of his royal homes – from Wood Farm to Royal Lodge
Police searches were being carried out at both Wood Farm and Royal Lodge
- Bookmark
Following the arrest of Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, police searches were being carried out at both Wood Farm and Royal Lodge.
Unmarked police cars were seen at his temporary home on the Sandringham estate in Norfolk.
Plain clothes officers were also at his former residence in Windsor Great Park.
Earlier this month, Andrew moved out of his home in Windsor to the Sandringham Estate.
Here is a look at the history of his royal homes:
Wood Farm
Andrew temporarily relocated to Wood Farm on the King’s private Sandringham estate in Norfolk this month after leaving Royal Lodge, while waiting for his new home, Marsh Farm, to be ready nearby.
His father Prince Philip, the late Duke of Edinburgh, spent much of his retirement at Wood Farm.
The late Queen once said her husband “loved” the property and part of its attraction was because the “sea was so close”.
Located in Wolferton, it is nestled in the far reaches of the vast 20,000-estate.
It was originally a large farmhouse before being converted into two cottages and over the years was used as a regular informal weekend retreat by the royals, particularly for annual shooting parties.
Philip is said to have organised the installation of a new kitchen in the modestly furnished cottage.
Andrew’s ex-wife Sarah Ferguson frequently stayed there alone as a guest of the late Queen over the Christmas period following her separation from Andrew in the 1990s.
While the duchess’s children Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie joined their royal relatives for festivities at nearby Sandringham House, “Fergie” was exiled to Wood Farm, and was not invited.
She described it in her autobiography as a “comfortable open beamed cottage two miles from the ‘big house’”.
Teresa Thompson, the cottage’s retired housekeeper, said after chatting to the Queen at an event in Sandringham to mark the Platinum Jubilee in 2022: “All the royal family love Wood Farm, because it’s out of the way, it’s small, It’s intimate. You haven’t got lots of officials and household, it’s just the close staff.
“And they literally can relax in the family house, it’s wonderful, and I had a wonderful 22 years down there, it was the best time of my life without a doubt.”
In 1917, it was where Prince John, the youngest son of George V, moved with his nurse.
An epileptic, John was kept apart from the rest of his family and died at Wood Farm two years later from a severe seizure at the age of 13.
Royal Lodge
In what was dubbed the siege of Royal Lodge, Andrew faced growing pressure to give up his 30-room mansion after it emerged last year he had been paying a “peppercorn” rent for decades.
He finally agreed to quit the property in Windsor Great Park, Berkshire, for a new home on the King’s private Sandringham estate in the New Year, with Charles personally funding him with an annual stipend.
The secluded 19th century Grade II-listed Royal Lodge is nestled in 98 acres of private land.
From 1815, it was used by Prince Regent, later George IV, as a hunting lodge.
King William IV had it almost completely demolished and rebuilt in 1830.
By 1840 it was used as grace-and-favour accommodation for senior members of the royal household.
In the 1930s, it became the country retreat of Andrew’s grandparents, the Queen Mother and King George VI, when they were the Duke and Duchess of York, and their children Queen Elizabeth II and Princess Margaret learned to swim in its pool as youngsters.
Part of the Crown Estate, it remained the Queen Mother’s favourite Windsor residence for 50 years, and she died there in 2002.
Andrew then took over the home, using it as his main residence for more than 20 years, with his ex-wife Sarah Ferguson also later moving in.
It was previously a distinctive Windsor pink but after Andrew signed a 75-year lease in 2003, he began refurbishments, including painting it white.
A copy of the leasehold agreement revealed he paid £1 million for the lease and that since then, he paid just “one peppercorn” of rent “if demanded” per year.

The United Arab Emirates has committed to allocate the largest contribution worth $1.2 billion. "Today, Mr. President the UAE announces a further $1.2 billion for supporting Gaza through the Board of Peace," UAE Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan said. He recalled that Abu Dhabi has allocated $3 billion in assistance to the Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip since the outbreak of the current escalation.
According to Qatari Prime Miniser and Minister of Foreign Affairs Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al-Thani, Doha "pledges $1 billion in support to the board of to award mission aimed at reaching a final resolution that fulfills Palestinian aspiration for the statehood and recognition and the Israeli aspiration for security and integration."
Saudi Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Adel bin Ahmad al-Jubeir, in turn, reiterated his country’s commitment to "establishing a lasting and just peace in the Middle East" that will result "in two states, Israel and Palestine, living side by side in peace and security." He also announced the pledge to allocate $1 billion to the Board of Peace within the next few years.
Kuwait also joined the donor states pledging $1 billion to support Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. According to Kuwaiti Foreign Minister Sheikh Jarrah Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah, the money will be allocated over the next few years.
On January 22, representatives of 19 countries signed the charter establishing the Board of Peace for Gaza in a ceremony on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos. According to US President Donald Trump, more countries have joined it. While the Board was established under the agreement between Israel and the radical Palestinian movement Hamas to govern the enclave, its mission is expected to extend to conflicts in other parts of the world as well.

Türkiye urged permanent ceasefire, inclusive political process in Sudan
'The efforts of the international partners should turn into an inclusive peace process that will enable a permanent ceasefire,' says UN envoy
HAMILTON, Canada
Türkiye's UN envoy urged a permanent ceasefire and an inclusive political process in Sudan on Thursday, stressing that any resolution must be Sudanese-led to ensure lasting stability.
"Türkiye is gravely concerned regarding the ongoing conflict and the humanitarian situation in Sudan," Ahmet Yildiz said during a Security Council session on Sudan.
Reaffirming Ankara's support for Sudan's territorial integrity, he said Türkiye supports "Sudan's unity, sovereignty and territorial integrity, which we consider very important for the stability of Sudan and the whole region."
Pointing to the role of external actors in prolonging the fighting, he said, "We also note with grave concern the negative impact of foreign interference in Sudan and its implications on the continuation of the conflict, as well as the potential spillover risks it creates on the wider region."
"Türkiye is of the opinion that the most effective way for ending the conflict is dialogue and diplomacy," he noted.
Emphasizing the need for a meaningful outcome of peace talks, he said Türkiye believes "that this outcome cannot be achieved if the dialogue is not owned and led by Sudan."
Calling on international partners to support a comprehensive solution, Yildiz added, "The efforts of the international partners should turn into an inclusive peace process that will enable a permanent ceasefire, followed by a comprehensive political process and accountability."
He also noted that Türkiye continues to provide humanitarian assistance and urged the Security Council to prioritize the humanitarian situation and facilitate Sudanese-led dialogue efforts.

Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor arrested as police raid royal homes over Epstein links
King Charles says authorities have his ‘wholehearted’ support and insisted the ‘law must take its course’ after his brother is arrested on his 66th birthday
- Bookmark
Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor was arrested and his homes at Sandringham and Berkshire raided on Thursday - his 66th birthday - over his links to the paedophile Jeffrey Epstein.
The former prince was held on suspicion of misconduct in public office over claims he leaked sensitive documents to the disgraced financier while working as a UK trade envoy.
He was held for several hours in police custody while searches are ongoing at his Wood Farm property on the King’s estate in Norfolk, as well as his former home, Royal Lodge, in Windsor.
King Charles has said that “the law must take its course” after expressing his “deepest concern” over the arrest of his brother, who was stripped of his royal titles last year.
Neither Buckingham Palace nor the King were informed of his arrest in advance, with both the monarch and Queen Camilla facing hecklers and questions from bystanders as they continued with their royal duties during a visit to London Fashion Week on Thursday.
The Prince and Princess of Wales have not publicly commented but are understood to support the King’s statement.
Mr Mountbatten-Windsor’s arrest, the first of a senior royal in modern history, comes after more than 15 years of scrutiny over his ties to Epstein, who died in a US prison in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.
In response to his brother’s arrest, Charles said: “I have learned with the deepest concern the news about Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor and suspicion of misconduct in public office.
“What now follows is the full, fair and proper process by which this issue is investigated in the appropriate manner and by the appropriate authorities.
“In this, as I have said before, they have our full and wholehearted support and co-operation. Let me state clearly: the law must take its course.”
Mr Mountbatten-Windsor was arrested at his home after a convoy of police vehicles arrived at around 8am, before he was escorted to an undisclosed location to be interviewed by officers.
The news of the former Duke of York’s arrest comes as pictures circulated online appearing to show unmarked police cars attending Wood Farm, with plain-clothed officers gathered outside his home.
In Windsor, multiple vans carrying police officers were seen entering the gates of his former Berkshire home, where a search is also ongoing. Runners, dog walkers and children on scooters were still roaming the sprawling parks surrounding the residence, while reporters and photgraphers were held at an outer gate beyond Windsor Great Park, barred from entering.
Mr Mountbatten-Windsor is facing allegations that he shared sensitive information with Epstein while serving as the UK’s trade envoy, which included forwarding confidential documents. He can be held for up to 24 hours in police custody without a charge, but this can be extended to 96 hours if an extension is approved at a magistrates' court.
According to the Crown Prosecution Service’s (CPS) website, misconduct in public office carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment.
Confirming the probe, Assistant Chief Constable Oliver Wright said: “Following a thorough assessment, we have now opened an investigation into this allegation of misconduct in public office.
“It is important that we protect the integrity and objectivity of our investigation as we work with our partners to investigate this alleged offence. We understand the significant public interest in this case, and we will provide updates at the appropriate time.”
Before the arrest was announced, Sir Keir Starmer told BBC Breakfast, “nobody is above the law,” when he was asked about Mr Mountbatten-Windsor.
He added: “Anybody who has any information should testify. So whether it’s Andrew or anybody else, anybody who has got relevant information should come forward to whatever the relevant body is, in this particular case we’re talking about Epstein, but there are plenty of other cases.”
Several police forces across the UK are assessing information released as part of the latest dump of Epstein files, including the Met Police, Surrey, Bedfordshire, Essex, Norfolk, Wiltshire and West Midlands forces.
Thames Valley Police have also said they are reviewing allegations that a woman was trafficked to the UK by Epstein to have a sexual encounter with Mr Mountbatten-Windsor. And on Wednesday, the Metropolitan Police said it was also looking into claims the former prince’s protection officers turned a “blind eye” to his visits to Epstein’s island, Little St James.
Responding to news of Mr Mountbatten-Windsor's arrest, former prime minister Gordon Brown said he had submitted a five-page memorandum to the Metropolitan, Surrey, Sussex, Thames Valley and other UK police forces.
"This memorandum provides new and additional information to that which I submitted last week to the Met, Essex and Thames Valley police forces where I expressed my concern that we secure justice for trafficked girls and women," he said.
Mr Brown previously claimed that the Epstein files showed in “graphic detail” how the financier was able to use London Stansted Airport to “fly in girls from Latvia, Lithuania and Russia” and called for police to investigate.
Separately, Virginia Giuffre, who took her own life last year, alleged in a civil court case that Mr Mountbatten-Windsor had sexually assaulted her. She claimed to have met the former prince while being trafficked by Epstein and his accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell, who is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence. Mr Mountbatten-Windsor has always vehemently denied the claims but he paid millions to settle Ms Giuffre’s civil case in 2022, despite insisting he had never met her.
Her family welcomed Mr Mountbatten-Windsor’s arrest, stating: “At last, today our broken hearts have been lifted with the news that no one is above the law – not even royalty.
“On behalf of our sister, we extend our gratitude to the UK’s Thames Valley Police in their investigation and arrest of Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor. He was never a prince. For survivors everywhere, Virginia did this for you.”
The King’s brother was stripped of both his prince title and dukedom last year after it emerged that he had maintained his friendship with Epstein for longer than he had previously claimed.
He does, however, remain in the line of succession – he is eighth in line to the throne, having gradually moved down after being born second in line.
Removing someone from the line of succession is impossible without new legislation, but Labour MP Rachael Maskell and Conservative MP Chris Philp have called for a law change, saying the former duke should no longer be in line for the throne.

Faltering fighter jet deal casts doubt on European defense plans

Faltering fighter jet deal casts doubt on EU defense plans
February 19, 2026The simmering spat between France and Germany bubbled over publicly when German Chancellor Friedrich Merz told the Machtwechsel podcast that the collaboration to build a nuclear-capable fighter jet with France is "not what we currently need in the German military."
The project, known as the Future Combat Air System (FCAS), was launched in 2017 with then-Chancellor Angela Merkel and still-in-post French President Emmanuel Macron, but now looks in jeopardy.
Europe is scrambling to become a resurgent military force in its own right due to significantly diminished trust in the Trump administration's commitment to European defense. Germany pulling back from the FCAS project could be seen as a serious setback to progress.
"The Germans should not make the same mistake as the French did and isolate themselves from the rest of Europe," said Christian Mölling, director of the Berlin-based think tank, European Defence In a New Age (EDINA).
"The defense ramp up we are doing in Europe is primarily a national ramp up, but losing other Europeans politically is not the best way for the joint defense of Europe," said Mölling.
Reducing dependence on the US
Trump's threats to annex Greenland, his administration's wavering support for the NATO military alliance and Ukraine, and his trade tariffs, have caused a shift in atmosphere in Brussels and around EU capitals towards reducing dependence on the US, especially regarding military systems.
"That's why some of Merz's public comments are not so smart," said Guntram Wolff, senior fellow at the Brussels-based Bruegel think tank.
"What you don't want to do is give the impression that you will continue buying American equipment at all costs," said Wolff. "We need to shift away from US equipment, towards European equipment — I think most people have understood that by now."
The US had been concerned that the FCAS programme could result in EU countries halting purchases of American-made F35-fighter jet, but that fear hasn't materialized.
For Christian Mölling, the White House will take a clear lesson from the spat which has erupted between France and Germany on FCAS — "that you can split the Europeans," he told DW.
Both industry and governments clashing
The big sticking point between Paris and Berlin has been the involvement of French arms giant Dassault Aviation, which has demanded significantly more control over the project than the other industry partner, European consortium company, Airbus Space and Defence.
"In recent years, Macron has failed to convince Dassault Aviation not to be a hindrance — once again — to the success of a major European cooperative armament programme," Samuel Faure, an expert on European defense policy at Sciences Po, told DW.
"The pressure is much greater on the French head of state than on the German chancellor," said Faure. "France's budgetary situation is much more worrying than Germany's, and Germany now has a much larger military budget than France."
For Faure, different operational requirements, like France needing the jets to be capable of carrying its nuclear weapons, are not a reason to stop the project.
"This is never an insurmountable problem unless political leaders decide that it is," he said.
That was a position broadly echoed by the CEO of Airbus in a recent exclusive interview with DW.
"It's a danger that if you start on these big European projects, it takes more than political will," said Michael Schoellhorn, CEO of Airbus Defence and Space. "It takes the industrial alignment of the players involved."
EU defense projects unlikely to be harmed
Rearming Europe has not only been a priority for the two biggest economies of the continent but has also for all 27 members of the European Union, many of whom have legitimate concerns about their own safety following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
The RearmEU proposal, rebranded as Readiness 2030," is the EU's flagship, €800 billion‑scale plan to boost defence spending, pool procurement, improve rapid deployment capabilities, solidify an industrial base for European defense companies, and to support Ukraine.
"But FCAS is deliberately not a European project," said Christian Mölling from EDINA. "If there is a spillover in terms of atmosphere, then possibly, yes, this situation could have an effect on the EU."
"I wouldn't be too afraid," said Mölling. "Nobody was waiting for FCAS to be the solution, the savior, or the avant garde of European defense industrial projects."
System clouds over system hardware
Despite the growing rancor between France and Germany, the general consensus from experts and observers is that while the hardware side of the deal could fall apart, the cloud system it's creating will likely remain on course.
"More important to the Germans than the fighter jet itself is the 'combat cloud', because, not only the French or the Germans, but the Europeans, have to lose something," said Mölling. "There we are also dependent on the US."
The FCAS agreement sets out work on an interlinked drone swarm and a cloud system which links the drones to jets in real-time.
"We need to invest so much more in intelligence — the software bit that connects it all," said Guntram Wolff. "And if that is staying as a really strong Franco-German project, then I think we are actually in very good territory in terms of European cooperation."

Airbus aims for record aircraft deliveries in 2026

Airbus announced a record net profit of €5.2 billion for the 2025 fiscal year on Thursday, February 19. This historic result is up by 23% compared to 2024. This far exceeded its previous record of €4.2 billion set in 2022. This increase in profits came despite Airbus missing its aircraft delivery targets in 2025. The company had originally planned to deliver 820 aircraft to its customers, but was only able to deliver 793, due to "quality issues" with A320 fuselage panels announced in December 2025. On Thursday, Airbus CEO Guillaume Fleury said, "2025 was a landmark year, characterized by very strong demand for our products and services across all businesses, a record financial performance and strategic milestones." This optimism was buoyed by a 6% rise in annual revenue, reaching €73.4 billion.
For 2026, Faury anticipated a further acceleration in production, forecasting record deliveries of 870 aircraft, surpassing the level reached in 2019 when Airbus delivered 863 planes to airlines and leasing companies. However, these projections would have been even higher if not for difficulties faced by some suppliers. "Global demand for commercial aircraft underpins our ongoing production ramp-up, which we are managing while facing significant Pratt & Whitney engine shortages," said the company's chief executive.

French prosecutor seeks murder charges over killing of far-right activist

A French prosecutor is seeking murder charges against seven suspects in the fatal beating of a far-right activist that has fuelled political anger beyond France’s borders, prompting Emmanuel Macron to tell Italy’s Giorgia Meloni to keep out of French affairs.
Quentin Deranque, 23, died from head injuries after being attacked by at least six people on the sidelines of a far-right protest in Lyon on 12 February. Most of the 11 suspects who have been detained are from far-left movements.
The prosecutor Thierry Dran told a press conference he had requested murder charges against seven men and recommended they remain in custody to avoid any “disturbance to public order”.
The killing has fuelled political tensions before French municipal elections in March and the 2027 presidential race, in which the far-right National Rally party is expected to have its best chance yet of winning the highest office.
On Wednesday, Meloni said the killing of Deranque was “a wound for all of Europe”.
Macron said there was no place in France “for movements that adopt and legitimise violence” and he called on all political parties to “clean up” their act. “Nothing can justify violent action – neither on one side nor the other, and not even in a head-to-head confrontation that is deadly for the republic,” he said.
Macron also suggested that people should “stay in their own lane”, after Meloni lamented “a climate of ideological hatred”.
“I’m always struck by the fact that people who are nationalists – who don’t want anyone bothering them at home – are always the first to comment on what is happening elsewhere,” Macron said while on a visit to Delhi.
Italy’s foreign minister, Antonio Tajani, hit back, saying the killing of the French activist was “a serious matter that concerns us all”. Tajani said on X that there had been similar incidents in Italy’s history and that condemning such violence aimed “to ensure that we do not return to a terrible past”.
He said there had been “many Quentins in Italy, some during the darkest periods of the republic”.
Macron was “closely monitoring” events, a member of his team said on Thursday, adding: “We must avoid any spiral of violence.”
Eleven people – eight men and three women – were taken into custody over the killing. Dran said that of the seven men who could be charged with homicide, two had refused to speak while in custody.
He said others acknowledged being at the scene and “some admit to having struck blows” but they had all disputed having had any homicidal intent. Four suspects had been released but more were being sought, he added.
Among those originally detained are two parliamentary assistants to Raphaël Arnault, a MP with the hard-left France Unbowed (LFI) party, as well as a former intern.
A lawyer for Deranque’s parents said they called “for calm and restraint”. “The family condemns any call for violence. Any form of political violence,” Fabien Rajon told the broadcaster RTL.
In snap parliamentary polls in 2024, Macron’s supporters and the left, including the hard left, joined forces in an effort to bar the far right from power. But after Deranque’s killing, some high-profile politicians have sought to distance themselves from the hard left, ruling out any possible future alliance.
The justice minister, Gérald Darmanin, called on Arnault to “draw the consequences” if the judiciary “finds serious and consistent evidence concerning him or the aides he hired”.
LFI’s national coordinator, Manuel Bompard, said Arnault would “certainly not” be suspended or excluded from the LFI group in the national assembly’s lower house.
An anti-immigration collective called Nemesis has blamed the killing of the activist on an anti-fascist youth group called La Jeune Garde (Young Guard) that was co-founded by Arnault before he was elected to parliament.

- President Trump has warned Iran that it must agree to curb its nuclear program within 10 days or “bad things will happen.”
- “Now we may have to take it a step further or we may not,” Trump told Board of Peace members Thursday at the first meeting of his new panel of world leaders. “You are going to be finding out over the next probably 10 days.”
- Trump set the deadline after the US significantly bolstered its military presence in the Middle East, deploying a large number of warplanes and two aircraft carrier groups to the region.
- Iran’s Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, responded by threatening that the US could be “struck so hard that it cannot get back up” if it renews attacks.
- Tehran has conducted naval drills, including closing the Strait of Hormuz and joint exercises with Russia, with earlier reports suggesting US forces could be ready to strike as early as Saturday.

Zelenskyy: We expect UNHCR Office to increase its support for Ukrainians
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy met with newly appointed UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) Barham Salih, during which, among other things, the consequences of Russian strikes on the Ukrainian energy grid and the necessary assistance were discussed.
"First of all, I sincerely thank you for your visit and for supporting our people during these difficult days and nights for Ukrainians. We greatly appreciate your support throughout this entire period. I hope we can count on its continuation," Zelenskyy said.
The President noted that Ukraine expects the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to increase support for Ukrainians forced to live under constant Russian attacks.
"They don't want to stop. We're trying to do everything we can at various levels of negotiations, relying on the support of our American partners. But we feel we need more pressure. And also more support for the morale of our people," Zelenskyy emphasized.
Salih, in turn, noted that he wanted to come to Ukraine at this particular time, in winter, to express solidarity with its people.
"We are proud to cooperate with you. UNHCR will continue and strengthen our support, complementing the emergency efforts of the authorities, and will do more to support resilient communities in the recovery process," he said.

Trump appears to set Iran 10-day deadline, as US deploys vast Middle East force
The US deployment is unlike anything since the 2003 invasion of Iraq and dwarfs the build-up off Venezuela before Maduro’s ousting
The US military is stationing a vast array of forces in the Middle East, including two aircraft carriers, fighter jets and refuelling tankers, giving President Donald Trump the option for a major attack against Iran as he pressures the country to strike a deal over its nuclear programme.
The deployment is unlike anything the US has done since 2003, when it amassed forces ahead of the invasion of Iraq. It dwarfs the military build-up that Trump ordered off the coast of Venezuela in the weeks before he ousted President Nicolas Maduro.
While the US is not likely to deploy ground troops, the build-up suggests Trump is giving himself discretion to launch a sustained campaign lasting many days, in cooperation with Israel. It would look far different from the overnight strikes the US launched against Iran’s nuclear programme last June.
Trump warned Iran that it must reach a deal or “bad things” would happen and appeared to set a 10-day deadline before the US might take action.
“Maybe we’re going to make a deal,” Trump said in a speech on Thursday morning. “You’re going to be finding out over the next probably 10 days.”
The open question is whether Iran can possibly satisfy Trump’s demands and whether, by positioning so much military hardware to the region, Trump may feel compelled to use it rather than backing down.

No specific date set for Ukraine's accession to EU – Costa
The President of the European Council Antonio Costa stated this at a press conference in Oslo during his visit to Norway, Ukrinform correspondent reports.
Costa said that EU enlargement is the most important geopolitical investment the European Union can make in the future of peace and stability in Europe, and that the EU is fully committed to the enlargement process regarding Ukraine, Moldova, and the Western Balkans.
He added that he is impressed by what Ukraine is doing during the war in terms of implementing reforms and adapting to European standards in order to become a member of the European Union.
Costa confirmed readiness to officially begin accession negotiations as soon as possible and to move forward in the enlargement process.
He said that he could not say whether Ukraine's accession would happen in 2027, 2026, or later, but emphasized that it is important not to lose momentum or the time and technical work Ukraine is carrying out.
A successful completion of Ukraine's EU accession process is important for stabilizing the country and ensuring prosperity for the Ukrainian people after the war, Costa added, recalling that in June 2022 the European Council decided to grant Ukraine candidate status for membership.
He said that since then, the EU has been working hard, and that it is very difficult and challenging for Ukraine to implement reforms while at war. Costa emphasized that all EU member states will strive to fulfill their commitments.
Regarding Hungary's resistance to Ukraine's progress in accession talks, Costa explained that the EU must deal every day with 27 member states because the Union is based on diversity. He noted that bilateral issues, particularly between Hungary and Ukraine, must be resolved, but reminded that Hungary had voted to grant Ukraine candidate status.
He noted that in negotiations, decisions sometimes require a great deal of time.
Costa recalled that his own country, Portugal, had waited nine years to be admitted to the European Union, and that Ukraine is now moving much faster. He expressed optimism that the EU will be able to achieve success very soon.
As reported, Ukraine's representative to the European Union, Vsevolod Chentsov, said in an interview with Ukrinform that Ukraine's phased accession to the European Union is not a compromise but a pragmatic tool intended to accelerate the country's integration and ensure quality preparation. He noted that the concept itself is not new and has been used in the past.

NABU, SAPO charge four more in case tied to ex-State Property Fund head
Law enforcement officers have notified four additional individuals of suspicion in the case of a criminal organization headed by former State Property Fund chief Dmytro Sennychenko; they are suspected of laundering corrupt proceeds totaling UAH 300 million.
"NABU and SAPO have issued new suspicions in the case of the criminal organization headed by the former head of the State Property Fund of Ukraine. This concerns four individuals involved in the legalization of property obtained through criminal means," the National Anti-Corruption Bureau said in a statement.
According to the report, to launder corrupt proceeds, the suspects created companies abroad and used them to purchase various assets. These included land plots in Croatia, expensive cars, and an entire floor of apartments in a residential building in the United Arab Emirates, among other things. The total value of the laundered property exceeds UAH 300 million.
The identification of new participants in the scheme became possible thanks to the work of a joint investigative team with several European countries.
As previously reported, according to investigators, the former SPFU head, together with accomplices, installed "their own" people as directors of PJSC Odesa Port Plant and PJSC United Mining and Chemical Company. These directors then signed contracts with pre-selected companies and sold products at artificially low prices. The price difference was siphoned off and converted for the benefit of the criminal organization. This caused state losses of more than UAH 700 million. Members of the criminal organization are also suspected of laundering over UAH 10 billion in criminal proceeds. The total number of suspects in the organization's activities now stands at 15.
In May 2024, the High Anti-Corruption Court arrested former SPFU head Sennychenko in absentia. Since April 2023, he has been on an international wanted list. In March 2023, NABU announced suspicion against Sennychenko.

Talarico and Crockett Test How to Convert Huge TikTok Followings Into Votes
Unknown

Few politicians command audiences on TikTok large enough to rival traditional media outlets. But in the increasingly volatile Texas Senate race, two rising-star Democrats have built precisely that kind of reach, turning the platform into a central battleground in their primary contest.
Congresswoman Jasmine Crockett and State Representative James Talarico have TikTok followings that would be the envy of most national political figures. Crockett counts more than 2.4 million followers, placing her among the most followed members in Congress, behind just Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Bernie Sanders. Talarico, a former middle school teacher from the Austin suburbs, is not far behind with more than 1.6 million followers on the platform.
Together, they have amassed the largest TikTok followings of any candidates in competitive statewide races this year, according to a TIME analysis, making the March 3 primary a test of which of their distinct approaches to leveraging viral attention will translate into electoral success in a state where Democrats have not won a Senate seat since 1988.
Crockett’s most watched TikTok lasts just five seconds. Filmed outside the Capitol, she delivers a profane dismissal of Elon Musk with a flicker of exasperation that feels calibrated for the scroll. “F—k off,” she says when asked what she would tell the former DOGE director. The clip from last February has been viewed more than 20 million times. One of Talarico’s most popular videos runs closer to a minute and a half. Standing at a lectern, he argues that “the biggest division in our politics is not left versus right, it’s top versus bottom,” casting inequality as a moral crisis. That video from last summer has drawn more than 15 million views.
The contrast is instructive. Crockett, 44, a former public defender who flipped a Dallas-area House seat in 2022, has fashioned herself into one of the Democratic Party’s most combative messengers. Her televised clashes with Republicans—including a now-famous exchange with former Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene in which Crockett mocked Greene’s “bleach-blonde, bad-built, butch body”—ricocheted across social media and landed her on late-night television. She speaks openly about doing “the edgy things” consultants warn candidates to avoid, arguing that in an era of attention scarcity, bluntness cuts through.
Talarico, 36, offers a different register. He is training to be a Presbyterian minister, and many of his viral moments have the cadence of sermons. He has invoked scripture to criticize conservative proposals and to frame economic inequality as a betrayal of Christian teaching. In one widely viewed video, he criticized lawmakers for advancing a bill requiring the Ten Commandments in classrooms while working on the Sabbath, quipping that they should try following the commandments before mandating them.
Where Crockett’s videos often feel like a punchline delivered with precision timing, Talarico’s resemble closing arguments, carefully paced and morally freighted. Party veterans describe the online spectacle as both exhilarating and unnerving. The reach that once would have required a television buy across Texas’ 19 media markets can now be achieved with a well-timed clip.
TikTok Drama
The rise of candidates like Crockett and Talarico reflects a broader shift in how Americans encounter politics. A September Pew study found that more than half of adults now consume news on social media, and research from Johns Hopkins found that nearly three-quarters of Gen Z Americans say social platforms are their primary news source.
In Texas, that shift has produced an unexpected consequence: the loudest clashes in the Democratic primary have not been between Crockett and Talarico, but among the sprawling ecosystem of creators on TikTok and other platforms who have turned the race into a proxy battleground. Both campaigns recently found themselves consumed by whether Talarico had described former Democratic Senate nominee Colin Allred as a “mediocre Black man.” The allegation began with an interaction with a TikTok influencer and quickly metastasized into days of online recrimination. Talarico has said he had been misquoted and taken out of context.
Kyle Tharp, who closely follows the intersection of politics and online influencers and writes the left-leaning newsletter Chaotic Era, says the Texas race offers a revealing snapshot of a rapidly maturing “political influencer class.”
In recent weeks, he adds, online discourse surrounding the Texas primary has been “defined by drama between political creators,” many of whom publicly feud, criticize rival candidates, and amplify accusations originating far from the campaigns’ official operations.
Both campaigns have sought to cultivate relationships with creators by offering access to events or messaging, even as the financial relationships behind some online advocacy remain opaque. “We have no idea who is being paid by what campaign or affiliated PACs or groups,” Tharp says, describing what he called an emerging “undisclosed creator payment ecosystem.”
The Talarico campaign declined to comment for this story. The Crockett campaign did not respond to a request for comment, though a spokesperson previously told the Texas Tribune that her campaign does not pay for any content creators.
“If you think this is messy,” Tharp added, “just wait until there’s 30 Democrats running for president all trying to secretly pay these influencers to fight each other on their behalf.”
Polling suggests that TikTok is more than just a sideshow in the race. A recent survey from Texas Public Opinion Research found that 47% of likely Democratic primary voters said they had recently seen or heard from Crockett on social media; 35% said the same of Talarico. Digital platforms were the leading source of exposure for both candidates, outpacing cable and broadcast news. In a state with chronically low turnout and a large population of younger, less consistent voters, that kind of visibility is no small asset, says Luke Warford, a Democratic strategist who leads a political action committee focused on turning Texas blue and separately runs the Texas Public Opinion Research.
“The two things that candidates most need to do to be effective in 2026 is get attention and raise money,” says Warford. “Talarico and Crockett are two of the most effective TikTok communicators in the country and they've both been able to translate their ability to get attention on TikTok into really strong fundraising.”
A Colbert Bump
The primary fight between the two Texas Democrats has been among the most closely watched of the midterms thus far, becoming a national story this week after TV host Stephen Colbert alleged CBS blocked him from airing his interview with Talarico, a charge CBS has denied. The ensuing drama has drawn millions of viewers to the interview segment on YouTube, and has spurred a fundraising boom for Talarico. A clip of the interview Talarico posted on TikTok received more than 1 million views.
Yet polls show the race is either tied, or Crockett is several points ahead. Asked who is more likely to energize the Democratic base, voters give Crockett the edge according to most polling data. But when asked who is better positioned to appeal to the broader coalition needed to win statewide in November, Talarico holds a slight advantage. The primary, in effect, has become a referendum on two competing theories of Democratic revival in Texas: mobilization versus persuasion.
Crockett has embraced a turnout argument, contending that Texas is less a red state than a low-participation one, and that inspiring infrequent voters—particularly voters of color—is the key to breaking the Republican hold on statewide offices. Critics counter that past statements like her calling conservatives “inherently violent” and saying Latino Trump supporters have a “slave mentality,” will make for easy and effective attack ads in the fall.
“Our goal is to make sure that we can engage people that historically have not been talked to, because there’s so many people that get ignored, specifically in the state of Texas,” Crockett told CNN, adding that her strategy is to appeal to people who “vote for who they believe is fighting for them.”
Talarico argues that Democrats must broaden their appeal in a culturally conservative state. His religious language is not incidental but strategic, an attempt to compete on moral terrain that Republicans have long attempted to dominate.
The general election landscape adds another layer of unpredictability. Republicans are engaged in their own bruising contest between incumbent Senator John Cornyn, Attorney General Ken Paxton, and Congressman Wesley Hunt. Democrats see an opening, as they have before. Yet history weighs heavily: no Democrat has won a statewide federal race in Texas in more than three decades.
The unanswered question hanging over the race is whether cultural prominence can be alchemized into durable political power. A TikTok following may signal authenticity, charisma or anger at the status quo. It does not, on its own, build a turnout operation across a state with 254 counties.
“Every data point we get suggests that 2026 is going to be some sort of wave year,” Warford says. “The biggest question is: How big of a wave? What you're seeing on TikTok is that people are fighting this hard because they actually think that whoever becomes the nominee might have a shot of winning in November.”

Issuance by Russia of license to operate power unit No. 2 of Zaporizhia NPP has no legal basis – Greenpeace Ukraine

Issuance by Russia of license to operate power unit No. 2 of Zaporizhia NPP has no legal basis – Greenpeace Ukraine
The issuance by the Russian nuclear regulator Rostekhnadzor of a license to operate power unit No. 2 of the Zaporizhia Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP) has no legal basis either in Ukraine or in international jurisdiction, Greenpeace Ukraine believes.
According to the organization's release Thursday, Rostekhnadzor, like Rosatom, is a criminal organization, and the signing of a license for a facility that has been under occupation for nearly four years and where reactor maintenance has been destroyed has no safety justification. Earlier, on December 23, 2025, Rostekhnadzor had already issued a similar illegal license for Unit No. 1 of the Zaporizhia Nuclear Power Plant.
"The idea that Russia has any right to issue an operational license for Ukraine’s nuclear plant at Enerhodar is outrageous. But is not surprising given the scale of their criminal operations at the plant since 2022," said Shaun Burnie, senior nuclear specialist of Greenpeace Ukraine.
According to a new satellite study conducted in 2025 by McKenzie Intelligence Services (MIS) on behalf of Greenpeace Ukraine, systematic militarization and disregard for nuclear safety principles have been documented at the plant. In particular, satellite analysis showed that the surface area of the cooling pond decreased by more than 100,000 square meters during the summer of 2025.
Greenpeace Ukraine added that new fortified military positions and anti-drone structures have also appeared around the facility.
The organization noted that the issuance of an operating license does not mean the Zaporizhia Nuclear Power Plant's reactors face an immediate threat of restart. The term "operating license" refers to the reactors in their current mode, which since 2022 has primarily been a "cold shutdown" state.
Additionally, Rosatom has declared its illegal intention to restart the reactors. However, the scale of safety concerns at the plant is extraordinary.
"This is also a further example of the dangerous nuclear disinformation campaign by Rosatom to try and convince the world that all is proceeding as normal at the plant... There is nothing normal about a full scale military occupation of Europe’s largest nuclear plant," said Jan Vande Putte of Greenpeace Ukraine.
He also noted that since 2022, torture and intimidation of Ukrainians by Russian forces, facilitated by Rosatom, have been widely employed on the grounds of the Zaporizhia Nuclear Power Plant, and that the plant itself is being used as a military platform for attacks on and killings of Ukrainian civilians in Nikopol and other regions of Ukraine.
As previously reported, during negotiations in early February, Moscow rejected a U.S. proposal, put forward as part of a peace deal, for full American control over the Zaporizhia Nuclear Power Plant, which would have given the United States the right to distribute the plant's energy between Ukraine and Russia.

Air defenses, missiles, IRGC: The targets in a US-Israel strike on Iran
Unknown

U.S. President Donald Trump appears to believe that the threat of military pressure could force Iran to shift its defiant position in negotiations over its nuclear program. If that effort fails, operational plans for large-scale strikes are likely already prepared.
Trump is likely aware that toppling Iran’s ruling system through airstrikes alone is not a realistic objective. However, sustained weakening of the regime could potentially reignite domestic protests. A strike would not necessarily bring Tehran back to the negotiating table on more favorable terms, but that may be one of Washington’s goals.
Assuming an attack becomes a fait accompli, attention would turn to potential targets. Israeli and U.S. officials are believed to be closely coordinating. Drawing lessons from the 12-day war in June last year — a brief but intense round of direct hostilities between Israel and Iran — senior officers from both countries reportedly spent weeks reviewing maps, aerial photographs and intelligence assessments together.
Public leaks suggesting disagreements, including claims that Washington opposed a strike, were intended in part to confuse Iran and may have served as strategic deception.
If coordination is in place, Israel and the United States likely have divided responsibilities over which targets each would strike.
The first and most urgent objective would likely be to disable Iran’s air defense systems to establish air superiority for Israeli and especially American aircraft.
Iran has sought to rebuild its air defenses after what Israeli officials described as significant damage inflicted by Israeli strikes last year, which they said created a safer aerial corridor for Israeli Air Force jets operating over Iranian territory.
To bolster its defenses, Tehran would have needed advanced S-400 surface-to-air missile systems from Russia. However, Moscow is unlikely to have supplied them because of its own pressing needs for such systems in the war in Ukraine. There have also been varying reports that China has provided some assistance to Iran, though the extent of that support remains unclear.
In any case, U.S. and Israeli forces would first have to neutralize Iran’s air defense network before moving on to other strategic targets.
Anything that can take to the air would be destroyed
Another urgent objective would be to strike the mullah regime’s ballistic missile arsenal. For Israel, destroying long-range ballistic missiles that directly threaten its territory would be a top priority. For the United States, the focus would likely be on medium- and short-range missiles capable of targeting U.S. forces in the Persian Gulf and Washington’s regional allies.
In addition, the United States would almost certainly seek to dismantle Iran’s drone array, which could inflict damage on American assets. In such a scenario, virtually anything that can take to the air would be destroyed.
Another key objective would be the fleet of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), which poses a threat to U.S. naval forces. Neutralizing that fleet would be essential if Washington aims to remove Iran’s capacity to disrupt or close the Strait of Hormuz, a vital global oil shipping lane.
Israel’s objective would be to focus on defending against Iran and its regional proxies, while also preparing for the possibility of renewed confrontation with Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthis in Yemen. Israeli planning is aimed at removing the missile threat once and for all.
Dr. Raz Zimmt, director of the Iran Program at the Institute for National Security Studies in Tel Aviv, said the United States would likely seek a significant achievement beyond degrading missile capabilities.
“Regime change is overly optimistic,” he said. “The Americans may aim instead at destabilizing the regime, which might be more feasible. I don’t see how you destabilize the regime if you do not eliminate Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei. In theory, you could weaken the regime by striking IRGC and Basij headquarters, and if millions of citizens take to the streets a month later, it would be harder for the authorities to suppress them.”
The Basij is a paramilitary volunteer force affiliated with the IRGC that has been used to quell domestic unrest.
Zimmt added that achieving change independent of popular mobilization would require a move that fundamentally alters the regime’s structure.
“If you don’t kill Khamenei, and you repeat something like what Israel did in the opening hours — eliminating part of the general staff and attempting, unsuccessfully, to target senior officials — even if they were to succeed in removing other political figures, that would not necessarily destabilize the regime,” he said.
“If they want to shake the regime, they would have to remove Khamenei, and even that might not be sufficient. But it would in itself be a seismic event. The very fact that the system would have to enter a process of selecting a new leader would be dramatic. Removing the leader and part of the political elite is far harder to recover from.”
Still, Zimmt cautioned that it would be extremely difficult for the United States to ensure that large numbers of Iranians take to the streets. “There is no way to guarantee that the masses will come out,” he said. “More Iranians than before may hope for an American strike because they are angry and frustrated. But many are traumatized by what has happened in recent weeks. If it is not clear to them that the regime is truly wavering, it will be difficult to persuade them again to risk their lives and protest.”
“The bottom line,” he said, “is that there is no way to guarantee that millions will go into the streets. American strategy should not be based on the assumption that they will. If they do, it could be decisive and might enable regime change. But you cannot build a strategy on that assumption.”
'You can count on the Americans to be able to deepen the damage underground'
A key question is whether Israel or the United States would use a strike to inflict additional damage on Iran’s nuclear facilities. According to Zimmt, the main enrichment facilities at Natanz and Fordow are currently not operational.
“The Iranians have taken various steps to reinforce protection,” he said. “There is the facility at Parchin that was struck in October 2024, which in the past was associated with weaponization efforts, though it is not clear whether that is still the case. There is also the underground facility south of Natanz. It has not been attacked. It is deeper than Fordow, and it is unclear whether there is the capability to hit it. If there is such capability, they may try. The Iranians have been building it for years. It is supposed to serve as storage for centrifuges, and one cannot rule out the possibility that in the future it could be used for enrichment. But overall, it seems that at the moment the nuclear issue is less urgent.”
Another possibility, he said, is that Israel, the United States or both would attempt to strike Iran’s so-called “missile cities” — underground tunnel complexes used to store and launch ballistic missiles.
“Regarding the missiles, Israel managed to hit some of the launchers that emerged from the tunnels and to seal some of the entrances to those underground sites during the war,” Zimmt said. “We did not strike the facilities themselves because they are deep. You can count on the Americans to be able to deepen the damage underground.”
A further critical factor is missile defense. Israel and the United States are likely to coordinate closely on air defense and efforts to intercept ballistic missiles that Iran may launch toward regional targets and Israel itself. One of Israel’s requests to Washington has been to bolster air defense systems.
Unlike the 12-day war last year, which Israel initiated, in the event of a broader U.S.-led strike, additional countries may assist in intercepting Iranian missiles. Neighboring states as well as European countries could have an incentive to participate in missile defense efforts, reflecting the wider regional stakes.

Moldovan gas reserves almost used up, 8 mcm remains
Moldova's gas reserves for the current heating season decreased from 101.2 million cubic meters (mcm) on November 1, 2025 to 7.8 mcm on February 18, CEO of state-owned company Energocom Eugeniu Buzatu said at a meeting of Moldova's parliament.
"As of February 18, 2026, the remainder of the gas reserve decreased to 83,400 MWh or around 7.84 mcm, showing a drastic decline since the beginning of the cold season," Buzatu is quoted as saying by the bani.md publication.
He said that 13.6 mcm had been taken from gas storage facilities in November, 14.24 mcm in December, 41.6 mcm in January and 24 mcm from February 1 to February 18.
Moldova keeps gas reserves in underground storage facilities in Ukraine and Romania.
In November, Moldovan Energy Minister Dorin Junghietu said that Energocom had signed contracts to have over 700 mcm of gas delivered during the heating season. According to data from Energocom, the gas is acquired with firm delivery in the corresponding month of consumption and is bought at both fixed and indexed prices, which are correlated with the quotations of the main stock exchanges in Central and Southeastern Europe - TTF (Title Transfer Facility) in the Netherlands and BRM (Romanian Commodity Exchange) in Romania.
Moldova consumes 0.8-0.9 billion cubic meters (bcm) of gas each year.

Hamas condemned the Palestinian Authority after security forces conducted an arrest operation in the West Bank that led to the accidental death of two children, aged 16 and four, this week.
Hamas cited the incident as a reason to end security coordination with Israel, describing it as a “serious crime” and a “black mark” on the PA’s record, saying the establishment “used force against their own people instead of protecting them”.
Palestinian media, citing the family, reported that PA masked officers waited at a junction for 44-year-old Samer Samara to drive by before opening fire in the direction of his car, where he was driving his children.
It is unclear who Samara was wanted by
After the incident, the PA expressed “deep regret” for the event, saying the two were shot dead during an operation to arrest their father in Tubas.
While the PA confirmed Samara was a wanted individual, it is unclear what his crimes were, though Palestinian reports claimed he had ties to Islamic Jihad and had been arrested by Israeli forces several times.
Samara's family released a statement demanding that he be released immediately and that those responsible for the killings be held accountable.

Israeli FM Sa'ar honors fallen IDF soldiers, thanks Trump for Board of Peace

Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar recalled the sacrifice of the 925 IDF soldiers killed in the Israel-Hamas war in his speech to US President Donald Trump's Board of Peace at its inaugural meeting in Washington, DC, on Thursday.
Trump gave the first address at the meeting, followed by several officials from participating countries, including Israeli FM Sa'ar.
"As I stand here," Sa'ar said, "I recall the 925 brave soldiers that gave their lives in a war against pure evil: Hamas, Islamic Jihad, and Hezbollah. These are the best people."
"They went from front to front and charged forward under enemy fire," the foreign minister added," To them we owe our existence and all our achievements. They will not be forgotten."
Sa'ar was highly complimentary toward President Trump for spearheading the peace initiative in Gaza.
"President Trump," he said, "This is an important day. Your historic actions have proven time and again: You are a leader who takes initiative, forges new paths, and works toward a better future for the entire world."
Sa'ar's statements covered the atrocities of October 7 and the ensuing war, and the steps that Trump, Israel, and the BoP plan to take toward imminent peace, emphasizing disarmament of Hamas and de-radicalization of the Gazan Palestinian population.
"The infrastructure that indoctrinates Palestinian children to hate and kill Jews - in educational and religious institutions - should no longer exist," he said.
The foreign minister ended his speech expressing gratitude toward President Trump. "President Trump’s visionary leadership creates, for the first time, an opportunity for a better future," he said.
On behalf of Israel, I say: Thank you, Mr. President, for your leadership."
Trump presides over Board of Peace,
Trump's International Board of Peace, which is meant to supervise Gaza's transitional governance, held its inaugural meeting in Washington on Thursday.
Trump told the first meeting of his Board of Peace on Thursday that nations had contributed $7 billion to a Gaza reconstruction fund that aims to rebuild the enclave once Hamas disarms.
Hamas previously said it is ready to hand over administration of the enclave to a US-backed committee of Palestinian technocrats headed by Ali Shaath, a former Palestinian Authority official in the occupied West Bank. But it says Israel has not yet allowed committee members to enter Gaza to assume their responsibilities.
The appointment of Shaath's committee in January marked the start of the next phase of Trump's plan to end the war in Gaza, even as key elements of the first phase - including a complete cessation of hostilities between Israel and Hamas - remain unfulfilled.
The meeting in Washington came amid a broader push by Trump to build a reputation as a peacemaker in hopes of winning the Nobel Peace Prize. It also took place as the United States threatens war against Iran and has embarked on a massive military buildup in the region in case Tehran refuses to give up its nuclear program.

Uganda to build statue in memory of Yoni Netanyahu at site of daring hostage rescue - report

Uganda will soon build a statue honoring Lt.-Col. Yonatan “Yoni” Netanyahu at Entebbe International Airport, Uganda’s Chief of Defence Forces, Gen. Muhoozi Kainerugaba, said in a Thursday post on X, at what he described as the exact spot where Netanyahu was killed during the 1976 hostage rescue operation.
Kainerugaba, the son of Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni, framed the proposed monument as a symbol of ties between Uganda and Israel. He did not provide a date for an unveiling, and no formal Ugandan government announcement was immediately available.
Netanyahu, the older brother of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, was the only Israeli soldier killed in the raid, which freed Jewish hostages held at Entebbe after the hijacking of an Air France flight in 1976.
In Israel, the Entebbe operation remains a defining moment in national memory, and Yoni Netanyahu’s role and sacrifice to ensure the mission's success are an integral part of the story.
Israeli officials have previously marked Entebbe anniversaries in Uganda, including Prime Minister Netanyahu’s 2016 visit to a memorial ceremony at the airport and his public remarks there.
The proposed statue, if advanced, would come against that backdrop of longstanding Israeli commemoration of the raid and periodic diplomatic engagement with Uganda around the anniversary.
The 1976 Entebbe Hijacking
Air France Flight 139, the plane at the center of the 1976 Entebbe hijacking, was seized by four hijackers, two Palestinians affiliated with the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, External Operations (PFLP-EO), and two Germans from the Revolutionary Cells. The attackers are widely identified as Wilfried Böse and Brigitte Kuhlmann of the Revolutionary Cells, along with Fayez Abdul-Rahim al-Jaber and Jayel (also reported as Jael or Jalil) al-Arja from the PFLP-EO.
There, the hijackers separated roughly 100 Jewish and Israeli hostages from other passengers and demanded the release of dozens of prisoners, before Israeli forces launched the long-range rescue on July 4, flying about 4,000 km to Entebbe and freeing almost all the hostages in a raid that lasted less than 90 minutes.

The office of West Virginia's attorney general said it has filed a lawsuit accusing Apple of allowing its iCloud service to become what the company's internal communications described as the "greatest platform for distributing child porn."
Attorney General JB McCuskey, a Republican, accused Apple of prioritizing user privacy over child safety, his office said in a statement on Thursday. It is called the first of its kind by a government agency over the distribution of child sexual abuse material on Apple's data storage platform.
Apple has previously denied wrongdoing in a lawsuit by private plaintiffs making similar claims.
The company has considered scanning images but abandoned the approach due to concerns about user privacy and safety, including worries that it could be exploited by governments seeking other material for censorship or arrest, Reuters has reported.
"These images are a permanent record of a child's trauma, and that child is revictimized every time the material is shared or viewed," McCuskey said in the statement. "This conduct is despicable, and Apple's inaction is inexcusable."
His office cited a text message Apple's then anti-fraud chief sent in 2020 stating that because of Apple's priorities, it was "the greatest platform for distributing child porn."
The state said it is seeking statutory and punitive damages, and that the lawsuit filed in Mason County Circuit Court asks a judge to order Apple to implement more effective measures to detect abusive material and to adopt safer product designs.
Alphabet's Google, Microsoft, and other platform providers check uploaded photos or emailed attachments against a database of identifiers of known child sex abuse material provided by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children and other clearing houses.
Until 2022, Apple took a different approach. It did not scan all files uploaded to its iCloud storage offerings, and the data was not end-to-end encrypted, meaning law enforcement officials could access it with a warrant.
Reuters reported in 2020 that Apple planned to implement end-to-end encryption for iCloud, which would have rendered data unusable by law enforcement officials. It abandoned the plan after the FBI complained it would harm investigations.
Implementing Communication Safety to blur nudity
In August 2021, Apple announced NeuralHash, designed to balance child abuse material detection with privacy by scanning images on users' devices before upload.
The system was criticized by security researchers who worried it could yield false reports of abusive material, and it sparked a backlash from privacy advocates who claimed it could be expanded to permit government surveillance.
A month later, Apple delayed the introduction of NeuralHash before canceling it in December 2022, the state said in its statement. That same month, Apple launched end-to-end encryption for iCloud data.
The state said NeuralHash was inferior to other tools and could be easily evaded. It said Apple stores and synchronizes data through iCloud without proactive abuse material detection, allowing such images to circulate.
While Apple did not go through with the effort to scan images being uploaded to iCloud, it did implement a feature called Communication Safety that blurs nudity and other sensitive content being sent to or from a child's device.
Federal law requires US-based technology companies to report abuse material to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. Apple in 2023 made 267 reports, compared to 1.47 million by Google and 30.6 million by Meta Platforms, the state said.
The state's claims mirror allegations in a proposed class action lawsuit filed against Apple in late 2024 in federal court in California by individuals depicted in such images.
Apple has moved to dismiss that lawsuit, saying the firm is shielded from liability under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, a law that provides broad protections to internet companies from lawsuits over content generated by users.

Rachael Maza on sisterhood, truth-telling and new play Black Light
Unknown

03:30:00 KST

Sisters Lisa and Rachael Maza reunite on stage for the world premiere of Black Light
The first day of rehearsal is always the best and worst day of the creative process for Rachael Maza.
"It's the first time you hear your voice out loud, and the entire theatre company's there watching," she tells ABC Radio National's Awaye.
"But it's also super exciting because you're beginning this massive journey."
The Yidinji/Meriam/Dutch actor — who recently stepped away from renowned Indigenous theatre company Ilbijerri after 18 years as artistic director — was especially excited to start rehearsing Black Light, which opened at Melbourne's Malthouse Theatre this week.
It's the first time Maza has shared the stage with her younger sister Lisa since the play they co-wrote wrapped in late 2009. And, just as they did in Sisters of Gelam, the pair are playing sisters.
Black Light follows four women — Bub, Mum, Aunty and Nan — who are stuck in a family home on the outskirts of Darwin, waiting out what seems to be a natural disaster.
Rachael and Lisa have taken on the roles of Aunty (Rachael) and Mum (Lisa), who bicker over everything from groceries to caring responsibilities for their mother (Trisha Moreton-Thomas; Kangaroo).
For Maza, having the chance to work with her sister on a new show has been "pretty cool".
"There's a real familiarity that means that we can just get on with the work," Maza says.
And that work never stops.
"Even over lunch, we're still talking about it. And when we go home we're still talking about it."
Parallel careers
Maza says she has an "incredible, easy relationship" with Lisa — something she in part credits to their shared love of music and live performance as teenagers.
"There was a moment, a really distinct turning point in our kind of fractious relationship as siblings, where suddenly Lisa and I really honed in and became best buddies and really shared a lot of interests when we started going out and seeing bands," she says.
"We definitely have our moments but it's great. It's so easy. We kind of can finish each other's sentences. It's a classic sibling relationship. We just know each other so well."
The sisters each have stage and screen acting credits stretching back to the 90s.
Both have starred in productions of beloved family drama Radiance (Rachael in 1993 and Lisa in 1997), the seminal Stolen Generations play Stolen (Rachael in 2003-4 and Lisa in 1999 and 2002), and hit Indigenous musical The Sapphires (Rachael in 2005 and Lisa in 2011).
They've also sung together for most of their lives.
First, at the behest of their late father who would play guitar and encourage them to sing along. Later, they formed the Maza Sisters and performed at a number of festivals and events including the 150th anniversary of the National Gallery of Victoria in 2011 and the Dreaming Festival in 2009.
That same year, their play Sisters of Gelam brought together cabaret, puppetry, dance and spoken word to tell the story of two sisters who decide to journey together to their grandfather's Country on Mer (Murray Island) in the Torres Strait.
"Working together [on Black Light] is just a kind of continuation of that closeness that we've had since we first started going out and seeing bands together [as teenagers]," Maza explains.
Their closeness allows the Maza sisters to bring some real fire to their characters' squabbles in Black Light.
"We can just bust out screaming at each other and there's no 'I hope you didn't take that the wrong way'," Maza says.
"There's none of that because we know who we are, we know our relationship and we know we're acting."
'Poetically bold'
There's plenty for Maza to sink her teeth into in Black Light.
Written and directed by critically acclaimed playwright Jada Alberts (Brothers Wreck), the show doesn't just explore the lived experience of Blak sisterhood but also honours Blak motherhood.
"Women are the pillars and the centre of our families, the pillar and the centre and the anchor of our communities," Maza says.
Loading..."And it's a theme that we as Blakfullas particularly gravitate towards and we can all relate to it."
The experiences of three generations of Blak women are represented in the play, as well as their sometimes complicated relationships to one another.
While those experiences and relationships resonate deeply with Maza, they're brought to life on stage in new and inventive ways.
"[The play is] really quite poetically bold in its form," she says.
That's best demonstrated by the character of Nan.
At times, Nan seems to represent the loss of language and cultural knowledge, yet at others, she steps out of her wheelchair and becomes "the deep, timeless placeholder of knowledge".
"Jada really gives us full access, so, it becomes incredibly powerful, incredibly beautiful," Maza says.
"It's like those experiences that you have of Country, for instance, and you can't find the words for it but you feel it in every cell of your being."
Maza reckons the almost magical realist style in Black Light is a step forward for Blak theatre, from the early days of "naturalistically telling our stories with truth-telling at its core" to pushing against the boundaries of form.
"It's really, really incredible and very intentional what [Alberts] is exploring within this work," she says.
Change better than a holiday
Returning to the stage in such an ambitious work is a thrill for Maza.
It comes just two months after she stepped away from Ilbijierri. While some might have expected Maza to take a break after handing the reins to new artistic director Andrea James, that isn't her style.
"Not being an artistic director and just being an actor actually is a holiday," Maza says. "[It's] an opportunity to just go into my actor bubble and explore.
"The world of an artistic director is you've constantly got 12 things on the go and looking after a team of people. To suddenly not have to be thinking about that is like a holiday.
"And look, to be honest, I couldn't think of anything worse than lying on a beach. That would just bore me."
Black Light is at Malthouse Theatre, Melbourne, until March 7.

Timeline of Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor’s scandals as royal arrested on his birthday amid Epstein allegations
Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor has seen his reputation damaged over his friendship with paedophile Jeffrey Epstein
- Bookmark
Widely purported to have been the late Queen’s “favourite” child, Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor has suffered a sharp fall from grace over the past decade.
Plagued by a string of controversies, the latest blow has seen him arrested on suspicion of misconduct in public office following allegations he shared sensitive information with paedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein while serving as the UK’s trade envoy.
Thames Valley Police confirmed the arrest on Thursday following claims made against the former prince after the release of millions of pages of files related to Epstein, which included messages between the two sent months after Mr Mountbatten-Windsor claimed to have ended his friendship with the convicted sex offender.
The arrest comes as pictures circulated online appearing to show unmarked police cars attending Wood Farm on the Sandringham Estate in Norfolk, with plain-clothed officers gathering outside Mr Mountbatten-Windsor’s home on his 66th birthday.
Thames Valley Police previously said the force was also reviewing allegations that a woman was trafficked to the UK by Jeffrey Epstein to have a sexual encounter with Mr Mountbatten-Windsor. The King’s brother has consistently denied any wrongdoing.
Emails between Mr Mountbatten-Windsor and Epstein reportedly show that he and Epstein were still exchanging messages until at least late February 2011, when the duke wrote: “Keep in close touch, and we’ll play some more soon.”
As a result, he was stripped of his remaining royal titles in October and was forced to leave his Windsor home, Royal Lodge, to relocate to a smaller privately funded address in Sandringham.
With the release of the so-called Epstein files and Virginia Giuffre’s posthumous memoir, his relationship with the financier, who took his own life in 2019, has increasingly made its way into the headlines.
In her book, Giuffre claims that Mr Mountbatten-Windsor considered it his “birthright” to sleep with her when she was 17 years old. While recognising that Giuffre may well be a victim of abuse by Epstein, Mr Mountbatten-Windsor has always denied her allegations against him.
Mr Mountbatten-Windsor’s ties to the convicted paedophile eventually forced him to step down from his royal duties, and in January 2022, he was stripped of his royal patronages.
In the years since, he has faced a number of other scandals, including a “close confidante” of his being banned from the UK over allegations he was a Chinese spy.
Here, The Independent takes a look at a timeline of Mr Mountbatten-Windsor’s fall from grace and his retreat from the public eye.
Queen’s favourite
The Queen stood by Mr Mountbatten-Windsor’s side even when he was caught up in the Jeffrey Epstein scandal in 2019 and “stepped back from royal duties for the foreseeable future”.
In October 2021, it was claimed that the monarch intended to spend millions of pounds privately funding her son’s defence against allegations of sexual abuse made by Epstein victim Virginia Giuffre.
She also signalled her support for her disgraced son by arriving alongside him for Prince Philip’s memorial service in March 2021.
Mr Mountbatten-Windsor provided a steady arm for the Queen as she walked into Westminster Abbey to remember the life of her husband, just a few weeks after he reached a multimillion-pound out-of-court settlement with Giuffre.
Friendship with Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell
During his 2019 interview with BBC Newsnight, Mr Mountbatten-Windsor said he had known British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, the daughter of media magnate and former MP Robert Maxwell, since she was at university.
She introduced Mr Mountbatten-Windsor to her then-boyfriend Jeffrey Epstein in 1999. The trio enjoyed a close friendship, even after Epstein was convicted of procuring a child for prostitution and of soliciting a prostitute in 2008.
Mr Mountbatten-Windsor is alleged to have personally invited the couple to Balmoral, the Queen’s Scottish residence, in 1999.
Maxwell was sentenced to 20 years in prison in June 2022 following a New York sex-trafficking trial for procuring teen girls for Epstein to abuse.
Mr Mountbatten-Windsor continued to visit Epstein in New York after the financier’s conviction for child sex offences in 2008.
Epstein received an 18-month sentence but was allowed to go on “work release” to his office most days and was released on probation after 13 months.
Mr Mountbatten-Windsor faced criticism when pictures emerged which showed him opening the door of Epstein’s palatial East Side townhouse in December 2010 and the pair strolling through Central Park.
In the now-infamous 2019 BBC Newsnight interview, the royal claimed he had cut contact with Epstein in December 2010.
2011: Steps down as trade envoy
After facing severe criticism for his continued association with Epstein, Mr Mountbatten-Windsor agrees to step down as trade envoy with Buckingham Palace confirming he would only support businesses in the UK.
Pictures of him in New York with Epstein had placed intense pressure on the royals, with the former prince acknowledging he had made a mistake in visiting the convicted paedophile.
It was the latest in a string of controversies that plagued his tenure as trade envoy, which included criticism over his use of private jets and his links with unsavoury foreign dictators and business leaders.
2015: Virgina Giuffre allegations emerge
In April 2015, allegations emerged in court documents filed in Florida that Mr Mountbatten-Windsor had sexual intercourse with Virginia Giuffre when she was 17 years old.
Both Buckingham Palace and Mr Mountbatten-Windsor strenuously deny the allegations.
2019: Virginia Giuffre sex abuse case
In 2019, Epstein accuser Virginia Giuffre, formerly known as Virginia Roberts, filed a lawsuit in Manhattan alleging she was trafficked by Epstein to have sex with Mr Mountbatten-Windsor on three occasions when she was 17 and a minor under US law.
Giuffre has accused Mr Mountbatten-Windsor of sexually abusing her on Epstein’s private island, Little St James, as a teenager, which the former prince “unequivocally” denied.
2019: BBC Newsnight interview
Mr Mountbatten-Windsor was criticised for a car crash BBC Newsnight interview that aired on 16 November 2019.
During the interview, he denied he slept with Giuffre, saying an encounter could not have taken place because he was at a branch of Pizza Express in Woking with his daughter Princess Beatrice.
He also said Giuffre’s claim he was sweaty at a nightclub was untrue because an “overdose of adrenaline in the Falklands war” had left him unable to sweat.
The royal faced a public backlash, with equality campaigners claiming he was “too stupid to even pretend concern for Epstein’s victims”.
2019: Step back from public duties
Four days later, Mr Mountbatten-Windsor announced the Queen had given him permission to step back from public duties in the wake of the interview.
He said it had become clear to him in recent days that his association with Epstein had become a “major distraction” to the royal family’s work.
The royal said he regretted his association with Epstein and “deeply sympathises” with his victims.
2022: Stripped of royal titles and military affiliations
In January 2022, the Queen stripped Mr Mountbatten-Windsor of his military titles and royal patronages in the wake of a US judge allowing Giuffre’s civil sexual abuse case against her son to move to trial.
The former prince stopped using his HRH (His Royal Highness) style his roles – including Colonel of the Grenadier Guards, one of the oldest regiments in the British army – were handed to other members of the royal family.
His other military titles included honorary air commodore of RAF Lossiemouth; colonel-in-chief of the Royal Irish Regiment; colonel-in-chief of the Small Arms School Corps; commodore-in-chief of the Fleet Air Arm; royal colonel of the Royal Highland Fusiliers; deputy colonel-in-chief of The Royal Lancers (Queen Elizabeth’s Own); and royal colonel of the Royal Regiment of Scotland.
2022: Out-of-court settlement
In March 2022, Mr Mountbatten-Windsor paid Giuffre a multi-million-pound out-of-court settlement, meaning both sides avoided the case going to trial.
As part of the agreement, he was due to pay damages to Giuffre and a donation to a charity “in support of victims’ rights”.
Mr Mountbatten-Windsor has faced calls to confirm how he funded settlement – which is reported to be as much as £12m – and whether the Queen or even King Charles, then Prince of Wales, contributed to the sum.
December 2024: ‘Confidante’ banned from UK over Chinese spy allegations
In December 2024, it emerged that a “close confidante” of the royal had been barred from entering the UK because authorities felt he was likely to pose a threat to national security.
Yang Tengbo brought a case to the Special Immigration Appeals Commission (SIAC) after the then-home secretary Suella Braverman said he should be excluded from the UK in March 2023.
British authorities allege the businessman was working on behalf of the United Front Work Department, an arm of the Chinese Communist Party that is used to influence foreign entities.
He is said to have twice visited the royal residence at the invitation of the King’s younger brother and was described as a “close confidante” of Mr Mountbatten-Windsor.
Mr Mountbatten-Windsor insists he “ceased all contact” with the businessman accused of being a Chinese spy when concerns were first raised about him. He met the individual through “official channels” and “nothing of a sensitive nature was ever discussed”, a statement from his office said.
January 2025: New messages reveal ties with Epstein continued for months after New York visit
Newly surfaced messages revealed the Duke of York remained in contact with Epstein until February 2011 – despite having claimed to have cut him off in December 2010.
Emails between Mr Mountbatten-Windsor and Epstein reportedly show they were still exchanging messages until at least late February 2011, when the duke wrote: “Keep in close touch and we’ll play some more soon.”
Messages were exchanged between the pair on the same day a photograph of Mr Mountbatten-Windsor with 17-year-old Virginia Giuffre and Ghislaine Maxwell – who is currently behind bars for recruiting and trafficking underage girls for Epstein – was published, Bloomberg reports.
The emails were obtained by Bloomberg after being disclosed in a filing by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), defending an appeal by former Barclays boss, Jes Staley, who is challenging its decision to ban him from the finance industry for misleading regulators on his ties to Epstein.
October 2025: Mr Mountbatten-Windsor forced to renounce Duke of York title
Mr Mountbatten-Windsor is forced to relinquish all his titles, including the Duke of York and Knight of the Garter as his former friendship with Epstein threatens to overshadow the work of the royal family.
Mr Mountbatten-Windsor has given up his title as Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order and his Garter role as a Royal Knight Companion of the Most Noble Order of the Garter.
He released a statement saying that he, the King, and his family “have concluded the continued accusations about me distract from the work of His Majesty and the royal family”.
He continued: “I have decided, as I always have, to put my duty to my family and country first. I stand by my decision five years ago to stand back from public life”.
Mr Mountbatten-Windsor’s former wife, Sarah Ferguson, will also no longer be known as the Duchess of York. Their daughters, Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie, will be unaffected.
The news came after the publication of extracts of the posthumous memoir of Epstein victim Virginia Giuffre. In the book, Giuffre claimed that Mr Mountbatten-Windsor considered it his “birthright” to sleep with her.
In his statement, issued on 17 October, Mr Mountbatten-Windsor repeated that “I vigorously deny the accusations against me”.
December 2025: New photos released in connection with Epstein
Mr Mountbatten-Windsor was pictured in a set of images released from the Epstein estate released by the Democrats on the House Oversight Committee. They also included images of US President Donald Trump, and Steve Bannon. It’s not clear when the photos were taken, as they are undated. No captions or context have been provided for any of the images.
Of the 19 photos shared by the Democrats, there is only one photo of Mr Mountbatten-Windsor where he stands with Microsoft magnate and philanthropist Bill Gates during the Malaria Summit in London in 2018.
Epstein is not featured in the image, which appears to be a cropped version of a professionally taken-photograph, which excludes the then-Prince Charles, who was also in frame. It remains unclear why the photo was part of Epstein's estate. Mr Mountbatten-Windsor’s appearance in the photo is not an indication of wrongdoing.
More personal photos saw Epstein with director Woody Allen and Virgin magnate Sir Richard Branson. Sir Richard and many other people photographed with Epstein have denied any wrongdoing in their association with the disgraced financier.
January 2026: Images show former prince kneeling over woman
New pictures from another tranche of Epstein files brought further scrutiny upon the King’s brother, with one showing him crouched over a woman as she lay on the floor.
In the undated images, the royal appears to kneel on the ground as he leans over an unidentified woman, while another angle shows the woman’s abdomen being touched.
Emails also appear to suggest he invited the sex offender for dinner at Buckingham Palace and agreed to meet a “beautiful” 26-year-old Russian woman.
February 2026: Mr Mountbatten-Windsor arrested
On his 66th birthday, the former prince was arrested by Thames Valley Police officers at his new home in Sandringham, on suspicion of misconduct in public office.
The force previously said it was reviewing allegations that a woman was trafficked to the UK by Jeffrey Epstein to have a sexual encounter with Mr Mountbatten-Windsor, as well as claims he shared sensitive information with the paedophile while serving as the UK’s trade envoy.
Searches are being carried out at addresses in Berkshire and Norfolk, the force said.
Assistant Chief Constable Oliver Wright said: “Following a thorough assessment, we have now opened an investigation into this allegation of misconduct in public office.
“It is important that we protect the integrity and objectivity of our investigation as we work with our partners to investigate this alleged offence.
“We understand the significant public interest in this case, and we will provide updates at the appropriate time.”

The Epstein files arrest of former ‘Prince’ Andrew makes Trump’s Justice Department look pathetic
The British police have taken action. Where on Earth is Pam Bondi’s DOJ? asks Holly Baxter
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
On Thursday, America woke up to the news that Andrew (the artist formerly known as Prince) had been arrested over serious allegations made in the Epstein files. And you know what? It felt good.
There has been much consternation in the U.K. about the fact that Andrew’s “punishment” for alleged bad behavior looked very much like being handed a fancy free house and a lavishly funded retirement in obscurity. If that’s what you get for being a creep, then you might find a lot of similarly sweatless men lining up to be publicly “shamed” for their past misgivings.
The fact that the ex-royal has now been formally arrested on suspicion of misconduct in public office looks like a big PR win for the embattled U.K. Because, given the same access to the same documents as the U.S., British police actually did something. King Charles’ response to his brother being taken into custody — that “the law must take its course” — was similarly indicative of actually letting something be done. If you squint, it all looks very open and sensible and upstanding.
Obviously, if you stop squinting and think about the whole “pedophile island visited regularly by international elites” thing, it all starts to look a bit less shiny.
And now let’s take a look at the other side of the Atlantic, where I currently sit: the side where Donald Trump — mentioned multiple times in the Epstein files, famously pictured partying with Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, though he denies wrongdoing and claims that he cut ties with the sex trafficker pedophiles who were his former friends long before Epstein’s first conviction in 2008 — says it’s “really time” for us to all move on.
Because yes, there are a lot of emails, a lot of photographs. There are lots of claims, many salacious and unfounded. There are also a whole load of redactions. Of course, of course, it’s clear some bad stuff happened. But didn’t a couple of people resign from a couple of posts at a couple of universities? Anyway, have you heard about the Board of Peace?
The problem is that when you make the Epstein files a central part of your election strategy, it’s hard to shrug your shoulders and say, “that’s all, folks” as soon as they actually get released. Despite some truly shocking claims — that there may have been children as young as 9 years old, perhaps even younger, who were trafficked by Epstein and his associates; that there was a “torture video” shared among them; that Epstein and Maxwell paid their victims to recruit their friends into the trafficking network — there has been very little action by the DOJ.
In fact, it’s unclear whether the Justice Department has even looked closely enough at the tranche of files to know the basic specifics. Attorney General Pam Bondi erroneously claimed that all the files had been released just days ago. She also refused to acknowledge the victims at a congressional hearing who said they had been unable to meet with her Justice Department thus far, shrugging the claim off as “theatrics.”
Bondi’s reaction followed a now-familiar script: claim a “Democrat” witch hunt, refuse to mention the victims, immediately deflect into whataboutism. But loudly asking why the previous administration did nothing doesn’t count as action. It gets old quickly.
We have now seen releases of FBI files and heard the shock and horror of both Democrats and Republicans in Congress. We, the American public, have access to a lot of the emails but lawmakers have seen even more of them behind closed doors. We have heard from the U.N. itself that some of these allegations amount to crimes against humanity.
So where are the arrests? Where is the crack team poring over every single date and word in order to hold as many people as possible to account? Where are the back-to-back, day-and-night meetings with the victims to gather every single possible morsel of data, to piece together a constellation of crimes so that the perpetrators may be held to account? Where is the DOJ? And why, oh why does justice in America these days look like a bunch of millionaires stepping down from their very prestigious jobs?
As yet, we are waiting to see a single U.S. arrest following the release of the files: Epstein (dead) and Maxwell (currently seeking a pardon from Trump in exchange for clearing his name and doing so in a “Club Fed”-style prison she was moved to by Trump’s DOJ after being interviewed by the president’ former personal lawyer Todd Blanche) remain the only ones.
At risk of stating the obvious: When a cabal of ultra-wealthy and ultra-connected individuals stand accused of some of the worst crimes against humanity, “moving on” is a hard sell. This isn’t a nasty divorce where everyone said some things they all regret. This is not behavior within the norm. And as a society, we simply cannot afford to absorb this.
The behavior we leave unchallenged now is the behavior that we tacitly accept.
Andrew Mountbatton-Windsor should have been removed from public office earlier. And no, it doesn’t feel entirely satisfactory that he was stripped of his titles — few of us have aristocratic titles, after all — and no longer (no longer?!) living off British taxpayers’ money (he now lives off King Charles’ private funds, which Charlie Boy didn’t exactly accrue by working the checkout counter at Tesco.) We do not know whether his arrest will lead to a formal charge or a criminal trial.
Nevertheless, this whole thing clearly makes one side of the Atlantic look undeniably better than the other in the handling of the Epstein files. And sure, the royals must be cognizant a crisis could be looming, considering public support for the gilded freeloaders is now lower than ever. Andrew’s not exactly a shining ambassador for their brand.
But by God, doesn’t Britain’s willingness to go after him make America look absolutely pathetic in comparison?

The UK village that has endured 50 days of rain
- Cardinham, a village in Cornwall, has experienced 50 consecutive days of rain, receiving 441.4mm since 30 December and already surpassing its typical February rainfall.
- The prolonged deluge across the UK, particularly in the south-west, is attributed to low-pressure systems being blocked by a persistent high-pressure area over Scandinavia.
- Northern Ireland recorded its wettest January on record, with south-west England and the east of Scotland also experiencing unusually high rainfall for the month.
- The Environment Agency has issued 67 flood warnings and 169 flood alerts for England, while the UK Health Security Agency has a cold health alert in place for several regions.
- While Cardinham is still forecast to have rain, the Met Office suggests conditions may moderate, with periods of more settled weather interspersed with rain.

DUBAI, February 19. /TASS/. Russia’s top female tennis player Mirra Andreeva has been knocked out from the 2026 Dubai Tennis Championships after she lost on Thursday in the quarterfinals round of the tournament to Amanda Anisimova of the United States.
The 5th-seeded Andreeva, who is playing under a neutral status at the tournament, started confidently in the opening round against 2nd-seed Anisimova, but eventually lost to the US player 6-2; 5-7; 6-7 (4-7).
"I was almost in tears there at the end," the tournament’s official website quoated Anisimova as saying after the match. "It was such a tough battle, and I thought we played incredible tennis."
"Seeing Mirra [Andreeva] down like that, it's understandable," Anisimova continued in regard to Andreeva, who almost cried in tears after the match. "We both fought so hard today, and it made me emotional seeing her like that. She was playing so well, she's the defending champion and I feel like we both won on the court today."
"These type of matches, it's always tough that someone has to lose at the end of the day," she pointed out.
"It's not easy to see someone that gives their all and then to react like that," Anisimova said. "It made me really sad for her. In my mind, I was just thinking if she keeps playing like this, there's a title around the corner for her."
"Obviously she's going to have a great year. She seems to be doing all the right things," the US tennis player added.
The 24-year-old US player is currently 6th in the WTA Top-10 Rankings and she is now set to play in the next round against her compatriot Jessica Pegula (4th-seed).
Andreeva, 18, is a four-time WTA champion. She is currently Russia's top-ranked female player at 7th place in the WTA Rankings. Her best finish at Grand Slams was at the 2024 French Open when she reached the semifinals. In 2023, the WTA named Andreeva the rookie of the year. Playing at the 2024 Summer Olympic Games in Paris, she won a silver medal in women’s doubles paired with Diana Shnaider.
The 2026 Dubai Tennis Championships is a WTA-1,000 event. It is played on February 15-21 on outdoor hard courts at the Aviation Club Tennis Centre in Dubai, the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Russia’s Mirra Andreeva is the tournament’s reigning champion.
Russian and Belarusian players’ neutral status at tennis tournaments
On February 28, 2022, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) issued recommendations to international sports federations to bar athletes from Russia and Belarus from taking part in international tournaments, citing Moscow's special military operation in Ukraine as the reason.
Following the IOC's recommendations in late February 2022, the majority of global sports federations moved to exclude athletes from Russia and Belarus from all international sports tournaments.
The International Tennis Federation (ITF) ruled on March 1, 2022, to suspend the membership of the Russian and Belarusian national tennis federations while also canceling all previously scheduled tennis tournaments in the two countries.
On March 14, 2022, the ITF also confirmed its prohibition on the Russian and Belarusian national tennis teams from participating in the 2022 Davis Cup and the 2022 Billie Jean King Cup.

Board of Peace necessary, because other organizations fail to keep global peace — Orban

WASHINGTON, February 19. /TASS/. The creation of the Board of Peace, which is to deal with the Gaza issue and other regional conflicts, was necessary because other international organizations are falling short in maintaining global peace and stability, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said.
During the inaugural meeting of the Board of Peace, chaired by US President Donald Trump, Orban said that there were "serious talks going on in Europe about the Board of Peace and its future role."
"We understand that during the recent decades, international organizations have failed to fulfill their role to preserve peace and stability worldwide. Therefore, new initiatives are needed to bring forward the issue of peace globally. We are sure that President Trump’s initiative to establish the Board of Peace is such a step in the right direction," Orban said.
Trump’s return to the White House in 2025 offered "a great chance" toward peace "not only in Gaza, but in Ukraine as well." In his opinion, the armed conflict between Russia and Ukraine would have never started if Trump was the US president four years ago.
"The security situation in the Middle East, and especially in Gaza, has a significant impact on the security of Europe," he said. "Therefore, our participation in the Board of Peace is not only based on principle, but also on our own security interests."
The Board of Peace was established as part of efforts to resolve the crisis in Gaza, in line with an agreement between Israel and the radical Palestinian movement Hamas. On January 22, representatives from 19 countries signed the charter of the new international organization during the World Economic Forum in Davos. US President Donald Trump intends to chair the board. Many countries have refused to participate in the body, which plans to address not only the situation in Gaza but also conflicts in other regions.

WASHINGTON, February 19. /TASS/. Addressing the first meeting of the Gaza Board of Peace that has been established at the United States’ initiative, US President Donald Trump said that he believes that all countries that were invited to become board members will accept.
TASS has compiled key facts about the organization and preparations for its first meeting.
Expectations for the first meeting
The Board of Peace is currently focused on settling the conflict in the Gaza Strip, US Permanent Representative to the United Nations Michael Waltz said.
However, in his words, it is flexible enough to also address other global challenges.
The Board of Peace member countries, at their first meeting in Washington on February 19, will announce the allocation of more than $5 billion to restore the Gaza Strip, US President Donald Trump said on February 15.
Member countries "have committed thousands of personnel to the International Stabilization Force and Local Police to maintain Security and Peace for Gazans," he noted.
The United States is expected to present a plan for Gaza restoration and the formation of an international stabilization force, Reuters reported.
Participants
According to Reuters, representatives of at least 20 world nations will take part in the meeting.
EU Commissioner for the Mediterranean Dubravka Suica will represent the European Union at the Board of Peace meeting, spokesman Guillaume Mercier said.
Cyprus, Turkey, Italy, Israel will be represented by top diplomats, according to their foreign ministries.
Poland and Greece will be represented by deputy foreign ministers.
Kazakh President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, Romanian President Nicusor Dan, Uzbek President Shavkat Mirziyoyev, General Secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam, To Lam, Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan, Egyptian Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly, Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet have confirmed their participation.
The Czech and Slovak foreign ministers, and two representatives of the Swiss foreign ministry will attend the Board of Peace meeting as observers.
Russia’s position
Russian President Vladimir Putin said that Russia is ready to allocate $1 billion to the Board of Peace from its assets immobilized in the United States.
He stated that Moscow is prepared to do so even before the issue of participation in the Board's composition and its work is resolved.
Russia is currently the only country in the world to have committed such a lofty sum in aid to Palestine, Russian presidential press secretary Dmitry Peskov said.
Moscow continues analyzing the entire set of proposals concerning the board’s functioning procedures, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov said.
Moscow, in his words, is in no hurry to decide whether or not to participate in the Gaza Board of Peace.
Moscow’s position on the Board of Peace is being formulated, including taking into account the positions of its Middle East partners, Russian Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said.
Russia’s representatives will not take part in the first meeting of the Board of Peace, Zakharova said.
Russia expects the Board of Peace to unequivocally call for de-escalation both in the Gaza Strip and in the West Bank, Russian Permanent Representative to the United Nations Vasily Nebenzya said.
Who refused to join
Mexico will attend the first meeting of the Gaza Board of Peace as an observer, but will not join it due to the absence of Palestine there, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said.
The Holy See will not participate in the work of the Board of Peace "due to its specific nature, which differs significantly from that of other states," Vatican State Secretary Cardinal Pietro Parolin said.
France thinks it unacceptable to take part in the work of the Board of Peace and will demand explanations from the European Commission, which sent its representative there without EU Council mandate, French foreign ministry spokesperson Pascal Confavreux said.
About the organization
On January 22, representatives of 19 countries signed the charter establishing the Board of Peace for Gaza in a ceremony on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos.
Along with US President Donald Trump, the leaders and representatives of Azerbaijan, Argentina, Armenia, Bahrain, Bulgaria, Hungary, Indonesia, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Qatar, Morocco, Mongolia, the United Arab Emirates, Pakistan, Paraguay, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Uzbekistan, and self-proclaimed republic of Kosovo signed the document.
More than 50 countries will join the Board of Peace, Trump said after the ceremony.
While the Board was established under the agreement between Israel and the radical Palestinian movement Hamas to govern the enclave, its mission is expected to extend to conflicts in other parts of the world as well.
Each member state will remain on the board for not more than three years, except those who will pay a permanent membership fee of at least $1 billion, Bloomberg said, citing the board’s draft charter.
The actual powers of the Board of Peace, established on the initiative of US President Donald Trump, remain unclear, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said.
The Board cannot replace the United Nations, he stressed.

Average US long-term mortgage rate dips to 6.01%, lowest level in more than 3 years

Average US long-term mortgage rate dips to 6.01%, lowest level in more than 3 years
The average long-term U.S. mortgage rate slipped this week to its lowest level in more than three years, but remains around 6% in the same narrow range it has been in this year
- Bookmark
The average long-term U.S. mortgage rate slipped this week to its lowest level in more than three years, but remains around 6% in the same narrow range it has been in this year.
The benchmark 30-year fixed rate mortgage rate fell to 6.01% from 6.09% last week, mortgage buyer Freddie Mac said Thursday. One year ago, the rate averaged 6.85%.
The modest pullback brings the average rate to its lowest level since Sept. 8, 2022, when it was 5.89%. That was the last time the average rate was below 6%.
Mortgage rates are influenced by several factors, from the Federal Reserve’s interest rate policy decisions to bond market investors’ expectations for the economy and inflation. They generally follow the trajectory of the 10-year Treasury yield, which lenders use as a guide to pricing home loans.
The 10-year Treasury yield was at 4.08% at midday Thursday, down from around 4.09% a week ago.
Mortgage rates have been trending lower for months, helping drive a pickup in home sales the last four months of 2025, but not enough to lift the housing market out of its slump dating back to 2022, when mortgage rates began to climb from pandemic-era lows.
Sales of previously occupied U.S. homes remained stuck last year at 30-year lows. And more buyer-friendly mortgage rates this year weren’t enough to lift home sales last month. They posted the biggest monthly drop in nearly four years and the slowest annualized sales pace in more than two years.
Meanwhile, new data on contract signings suggest home sales could remain sluggish in the near term.
A seasonally adjusted index of pending U.S. home sales fell 0.8% in January from the previous month, the National Association of Realtors said Thursday. Pending home sales fell 0.4% from January last year.
There’s usually a month or two lag between a contract signing and when the sale is finalized, which makes pending home sales a bellwether for future completed home sales.
“Improving affordability conditions have yet to induce more buying activity,” said Lawrence Yun, NAR’s chief economist.
A sharp run-up in home prices, especially in the early years of this decade, and a chronic shortage of homes nationally worsened by years of below-average home construction have left many aspiring homeowners priced out of the market.
That's put the focus on mortgage rates, which can boost home shoppers' purchasing power when they come down, but also reduce how much homebuyers can afford when rates rise.
That makes the recent decline in rates a favorable lead in to the annual spring home-buying season — at least for home shoppers who can afford to buy at current rates.
“Lower rates should improve affordability and bring out more buyers,” said Lisa Sturtevant, chief economist at Bright MLS. “Assuming mortgage rates remain at about where they are, or come down even further, we should see more buyers this spring as both inventory and the weather improves.”
Homeowners eager to refinance their existing home loan to a more favorable rate are also benefiting from easing rates.
Borrowing costs on 15-year fixed-rate mortgages, popular with homeowners refinancing their home loans, edged lower this week. That average rate fell to 5.35% from 5.44% last week. A year ago, it was at 6.04%, Freddie Mac said.
Mortgage applications, which include loans to buy a home or refinance an existing mortgage, rose 2.8% last week from a week earlier, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. Applications for mortgage refinance loans made up 57.4% of all applications.
The latest drop in mortgage rates comes three weeks after the Federal Reserve decided to pause cuts to its main interest rate after lowering rates three times in a row to close out 2025 in an attempt to shore up the job market.
Minutes released Wednesday from the Fed’s last meeting showed many officials want to see inflation fall further before they would support additional interest rate cuts this year.
The central bank doesn’t set mortgage rates, but its decisions to raise or lower its short-term rate are watched closely by bond investors and can ultimately affect the yield on 10-year Treasurys that influence mortgage rates.

At least 5,000 police to provide security in Gaza — head of Committee for Administration

WASHINGTON, February 19. /TASS/. At least 5,000 Palestinian police officers will be deployed to the Gaza Strip in the next two months to ensure security there, Chairman of the National Committee for the Administration of Gaza Ali Shaath said.
"Our priorities therefore are defined into four categories: first, restore security via professional civilian police under one authority, one law and one weapon, including training and developing 5,000 Gazan police to be deployed in 60 days," Shaath told the first meeting of the Board of Peace, according to a White House broadcast.
Shaath said the organization also plans to "restore basic services, including electricity, water and education," restore basic communal infrastructure facilities and "revive economic activities" of the sector.
"Our goal is simple: step by step to lay the foundation for lasting peace, dignity and prosperity," Shaath concluded.
On January 22, representatives of 19 countries signed on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos the Charter of the Peace Council, established as part of a peaceful settlement in the Gaza Strip. Washington said that other states had joined the organization. The Peace Council was established in accordance with an agreement between Israel and the radical Palestinian movement Hamas to govern Gaza, but it is assumed that it will also deal with conflict prevention and resolution in other regions.

ASX set to slide as Wall Street drifts lower; Oil jumps on US-Iran tensions

ASX set to slide as Wall Street drifts lower; Oil jumps on US-Iran tensions
US stock indexes are drifting lower, while oil prices rise with worries about a potential conflict between the United States and Iran.
The S&P 500 fell 0.4 per cent and was potentially heading for its first loss in four days. The Dow Jones was down 283 points, or 0.6 per cent, and the Nasdaq composite was 0.4 per cent lower.
The Australian sharemarket is set to fall, with futures at 4.58am AEDT pointing to a drop of 52 points, or 0.6 per cent, at the open. The ASX added 0.9 per cent on Thursday. The Australian dollar was trading at US70.51¢ at 5.12am AEDT. Reporting season continues with QBE Insurance and Guzman y Gomez among companies due up.
On Wall Street, Booking Holdings dropped 7.1 per cent for one of the market’s sharper losses, even though the company behind the Booking.com, Priceline and OpenTable brands reported a profit for the latest quarter that edged past analysts’ expectations.
Its stock has been under pressure because of worries that competitors powered by artificial-intelligence technology could upend its industry and take away customers at some point. It’s lost roughly a quarter of its value so far this year already.
Such worries have been rolling through the US stock market, hitting industries as far flung as software and legal services and trucking logistics. Investors have been punishing stocks of companies seen as under threat by AI so suddenly and aggressively that analysts have likened it to a “shoot first-ask questions later” mentality.
Carvana sank 9.4 per cent despite also reporting a stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. Investors may have been paying more attention to how much profit the auto retailer made per vehicle sold, which was lower than expected.
Walmart, meanwhile, pushed and pulled on the market after erasing an early gain of 2.7 per cent and swinging to a modest loss. The retail giant delivered stronger results for the latest quarter than analysts expected, but it gave a profit forecast for the upcoming year that fell short of estimates. It was most recently back to a gain of 0.3 per cent.
Helping to limit the market’s losses was Deere, which jumped 12.1 per cent after the machinery maker reported a higher profit than analysts expected. CEO John May said it’s seeing a continued recovery in demand from construction and smaller agricultural customers, though its global, large agricultural customers are still feeling pressure.
Some of the bigger gains in the S&P 500 came from stocks of oil companies, which climbed with the price of crude. A barrel of benchmark US crude rose 2.6 per cent to $US66.71, while Brent crude added 2.2 per cent to $US71.88.
Prices rose with worries about a possible military confrontation between the United States and Iran. President Donald Trump has been raising the pressure on Iran, which is home to some of the world’s largest oil reserves, because of its disputed nuclear program. If a conflict were to break out, it could constrict the global flow of oil.
Occidental Petroleum jumped 8.2 per cent after it also reported a stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected.
In the bond market, Treasury yields held relatively steady after a report said the number of US workers applying for unemployment benefits eased last week. That could be a signal that the pace of layoffs is slowing.
A solid job market, in turn, could keep the Federal Reserve on hold for longer before it resumes its cuts to interest rates. Fed officials said at their last meeting that they want to see inflation fall further before they would support cutting rates further this year.
If oil prices keep rising, that would push upward on inflation.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury edged down to 4.08 per cent from 4.09 per cent late Wednesday.
Other US economic reports said that growth for manufacturing in the mid-Atlantic region is accelerating, but potential homebuyers across the country didn’t sign as many contracts in January to purchase. The US trade deficit also widened in December by more than economists expected.
In stock markets abroad, indexes fell in Europe following better performances in Asia.
South Korea’s Kospi jumped 3.1 per cent as trading resumed following a Lunar New Year holiday. Markets in Hong Kong and Shanghai remained closed.

Israeli army forces detain child in Syria’s Quneitra
Arrest took place west of Kodna village in southern province
ISTANBUL
The Israeli army detained a child west of Kodna village in Syria’s southern Quneitra province on Thursday.
The state-run Alikhbariah TV reported that Israeli troops arrested the child in the western outskirts of the village and took him to an undisclosed location.
There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military regarding the reported detention.
Damascus has repeatedly affirmed its commitment to the 1974 disengagement agreement between the two sides. Tel Aviv announced unilaterally that it was canceling the agreement after the fall of Bashar Assad’s regime on Dec. 8, 2024.
Recent Israeli actions have included ground incursions, artillery shelling—particularly in the countryside of Quneitra and Daraa in southern Syria—arrests of civilians, the establishment of checkpoints to search and question residents, and the destruction of crops.
The Israeli incursions come despite the announcement on Jan. 6 of the formation of a contact mechanism between Syria and Israel, under US supervision, to coordinate information exchange, reduce military escalation, promote diplomatic engagement, and explore trade opportunities.
Syrians say the continued Israeli actions limit their ability to restore stability and hinder government efforts to attract investment to improve economic conditions.

YEKATERINBURG, February 19. /TASS/. Russia returned this year to the pool of countries where electronic engineering industry products are manufactured, First Deputy Prime Minister Denis Manturov said.
"The microelectronic industry is the one where we still have to labor hard. We need to significantly close the gap with global leaders there, while we were such in 1970s. Regrettably, we started gradually losing our position since the middle of 1980s, even somewhat from 1983. But I can say since this year <…> we returned to the pool of countries, and there are actually just three of them, which manufacture electronic engineering industry products," Manturov said.
Russia should master the new lithography machine for 130 nanometers, but global leaders are working with smaller standard sizes, the official added.

‘Extremely disappointed’: Minister defies residents’ noise complaints to dump Barangaroo curfew
Planning Minister Paul Scully has intervened to allow an inner Sydney cultural venue to operate around the clock, overriding a decision from bureaucrats to scale back trading hours at the harbourfront site after residents voiced concerns about late-night noise.
The NSW government had originally proposed 24/7 operating hours at the Cutaway arts and culture space, which is scheduled to reopen underneath Barangaroo’s headland park within months following a $100 million renovation.
The proposal sparked a backlash from residents in Barangaroo and Millers Point, who were worried about crowd control and noise disturbances from after-dark events. Their opposition prompted Placemaking NSW, the government agency overseeing the development, to cap operating hours for most events at midnight, with limited exceptions for major occasions such as New Year’s Eve.
In a blow to dissenting residents, Scully this week reversed that decision on grounds the Labor government was committed to its “vibrancy” reforms, which are aimed at boosting the 24-hour economy by reducing restrictions on live music, hospitality and entertainment at NSW venues.
“The new and improved Cutaway will support everything from festivals and installations to community gatherings and contemporary performance and following my request, it can operate 24 hours a day, seven days a week as needed,” Scully said.
“We will be maximising the benefit of this venue given the significant taxpayer investment made to allow it to host events that support Sydney’s growing events calendar.
“The Cutaway was created as a first-class event venue and should be allowed to function as one.”
Millers Point Community Resident Action Group president Anne Crabb said the group was “extremely disappointed” by Scully’s decision. She said the government had “overspent” on the venue and now was “desperate to find any excuse to keep the place open 24/7”.
“We believe the extended hours at this enormous, cavernous venue next to Millers Point homes will result in the erosion of residential amenity, particularly during the sensitive midnight to 7am period,” she said.
The group requested a permanent decibel monitoring system and a dedicated complaints hotline.
Crabb previously said the venue’s scale and design had heightened concerns about the cumulative effects of late events, particularly noise, crowd control and disruption to residential amenity.
“Unlike current 24/7 venues such as The Crown casino and The Star, this is a huge and open cavernous space located on the harbourfront,” she said.
“Barangaroo can and should be a vibrant cultural precinct, but this must not come at the expense of our long-standing residential community who will have to deal with the late-night impacts.”
Other residents and strata representatives from nearby apartments worried about sleep disturbance and voiced concerns the semi-enclosed structure could amplify sounds and make them reverberate.
Once completed, the renovated Cutaway will include multiple event spaces carved into the headland beneath Barangaroo Reserve, creating a space to host large art installations, performances, festivals, concerts, gala dinners, fashion shows and events including Vivid Sydney.
Originally, Placemaking NSW argued 24-hour operations would advance the state’s vision to boost nightlife, tourism and Sydney’s global standing. The Cutaway’s location next to the Barangaroo metro station was cited as a major advantage, allowing for extended trading hours supported by improved public transport access. Metro services generally operate from about 4am to midnight.
Placemaking NSW used its response to public submissions on the proposal to wind back the operating hours to 8am to midnight, with some noise controls from 10pm. Scully wrote to the agency on Monday directing staff to reinstate the original plan for 24/7 trading at the venue.
Concerns around noise were best dealt with through individual event conditions of consent, not restricting operating hours, as has been done for other event venues, the government said.
NSW 24-Hour Economy Commissioner Michael Rodrigues supported the extended hours, while Business Sydney executive director Paul Nicolaou had described the curfew as “disappointing”.
“If you choose to live in Barangaroo – in the heart of a global city – a level of noise should be expected,” Nicolaou said.
“We desperately need to ensure there are enough venues and facilities that are open 24/7.”
Construction of The Cutaway is more than 85 per cent complete. The first events are expected to start by July.

Türkiye neutralises threats at source beyond its borders: Erdogan

Türkiye takes all necessary steps beyond its borders for its security, neutralising threats at their source without seeking permission from anyone, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on Thursday.
Speaking at an iftar programme with families of martyrs at Cankaya Palace in the capital Ankara, Erdogan said that significant progress has been made in efforts towards a "terror-free Türkiye".
"Today, Türkiye takes all necessary steps not only within its borders but also beyond its borders for its security. Wherever there is a threat or danger, we neutralise it at its source without seeking permission from anyone," Erdogan said.
"There has been a serious decrease in security risks directed at our country, both within and beyond our borders," he said.
"In the terror-free Türkiye initiative we launched 16 months ago, we have made notable progress in a short time," he added, noting a marked reduction in security risks targeting the country.
Referring to terrorism, Erdogan said: "We are determined to rid Türkiye forever of this scourge that has burned the hearts of our nation for nearly half a century."
"For nearly half a century, this calamity has wounded our nation's heart. God willing, we are determined to free Türkiye from it permanently," he said.
He noted that thanks to operations by the armed forces and other security units, "we have significantly restricted the mobility of terrorist organisations".
Erdogan said that in the defence industry, the country has reached a domestic production rate of around 80 percent, compared to a previous dependence of about 80 percent on foreign sources.
"Today, we can meet almost all our needs ourselves in nearly every field, including uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs), armed UAVs, missiles, rockets, ships, helicopters and tanks," he said.
"God willing, next in line will be fighter jets and aircraft carriers," he added.
"Positive developments are also taking place in our neighbour Syria. An agreement was reached last month to resolve the issue in northern Syria without bloodshed, and the process toward full integration has begun," Erdogan said.

Opinion
Should I have stood up to my boss? Or was it better to trust my gut?
A messy thing happened at work. Mistakes and miscommunication turned into a snowball that slowly got bigger. As the consequences became apparent, I could see it might have looked like I was partly to blame – though, I wasn’t. I respect my boss, but they can be deaf to certain complex conversations, so my first instinct was to leave things be.
But the advice from people whose opinion I value – friends, family and experts I listen to or read – all went the same way: you must stick up for yourself, no matter what.
So I second guessed myself and spent a lot of time and energy gathering evidence and building a “defence” of myself. As I expected, when the “news” broke, some colleagues looked my way. I went straight to my boss and, long story short, my hours of preparation were a waste of time.
Is standing your ground, no matter what, worth it on principle alone?
Thanks for your detailed email and generously candid correspondence. What you’ve described to me is a dense and jumbled problem, and we won’t go into the details to avoid risking anyone’s anonymity.
It’s the kind of highly specific case that is tricky to pick apart in a few hundred words. But I do think one thing you brought up is worth digging into a bit further.
Work is rarely like a quiz show; you don’t get rewarded for shouting the first answer that comes into your head.
You mentioned in your question (and in your longer email) that your experience of working with your boss for a long while led you to an instinctive reaction – one that proved correct. If I can summarise your conclusion in perhaps over-simplistic terms, you ultimately realised you should have followed your gut.
I’ll start by saying that I don’t think your friends and family were outrightly wrong. But their blanket, well-intentioned advice didn’t quite work when applied to a tangled, knotty and idiosyncratic situation.
Their protestations might have been persuasive, but my guess is the main reason you were pulled towards their opinion had more to do with a kind of subtle stigma attached to going with your instincts in a professional setting.
So often we frame the world of work, especially corporate work or work conducted for a private business, as hyper-rational. It’s not true to any significant extent, but it’s a pervasive, stubborn and even a seductive story.
And although it often relates to corporate entities and those who run them – the efficient private company, the numbers-oriented founder, the cold truth of the balance sheet – it has a trickle-down effect. In some shape or form, it ends up affecting everyone involved in “the business world”.
So when a person like you, with a lot of experience, a long-term relationship with your boss and every reason to trust your instincts comes across a situation like yours, there’s often a ghostly presence pulling at your sleeve, whispering “Isn’t that the risky option?”
Of course, sometimes, going with your first intuitive thought is dangerous. Or even foolish. Work is rarely like a quiz show; you don’t get rewarded for shouting the first answer that comes into your head before anyone else.
But work is rarely a maths equation, either; what you’ve outlined in our correspondence is not the Bat and Ball Problem*, where the apparently obvious answer is, in fact, objectively wrong.
You knew that your boss would give little thought to any well-evidenced “defence” (as you put it), not because you read some tea leaves or had a vague hunch, but because many, many years of experience had told you this was highly likely. You were guessing, perhaps, but it was an educated guess.
And sometimes an educated guess is the best you can do in an intricate, labyrinthine social situation like a large workplace. Indeed, cognitive science is moving away from the long-held conventional wisdom that logic/reason and intuition/gut feel are polar opposites, and largely separate mental processes.
Again, the advice you received wasn’t inherently bad. Often, sticking up for yourself (and others) at work is critical, especially if the situation works as a kind of test case or creates a precedent.
This is where standing on principle becomes critically important. But that was not ever happening here. It sounds like the sideways glances came, the problem blew over, your reputation wasn’t damaged in the slightest, and you wasted far too much time and effort on a carefully organised explanation that was always going to be disregarded. And none of this was a surprise to you.
If you can apply any generalisation to such a convoluted affair, it’s that sometimes it’s OK – and even rational – to trust your gut.
*A bat and a ball cost $1.10 in total; the bat costs $1.00 more than the ball; how much does the ball cost?

Driver cleared of murder after killing boy, 4, in pick-up truck after high-speed crash
Owen Maughan, 27, had previously admitted to the manslaughter of Peter Maughan following the incident in Kent last year
- Bookmark
A driver who admitted killing a four-year-old boy in a crash after deliberately hitting the family’s car at around 60mph has been cleared of murder.
Owen Maughan, 27, had previously admitted to the manslaughter of Peter Maughan following the incident on New Barn Road, Dartford, Kent, on June 1 last year.
His father, Patrick Maughan, 54, who was a front-seat passenger and accused of encouraging the act, was also cleared of murder but found guilty of manslaughter by a jury at Maidstone Crown Court on Thursday.
Peter was thrown from the family pick-up truck and died of “severe and devastating injuries” to his head, chest and abdomen.
The trial had heard that Owen and Patrick Maughan “chased” the car down the A2 in Kent for several miles.
There was shouting between the two cars before Owen Maughan drove into the wrong lane and clipped the Ford pick-up truck at about 60mph, and the car rolled over multiple times, the court heard.
Peter Maughan was in the back of the car with his one-year-old sister Annarica Mahon, while their mother Hayley, Owen Maughan’s cousin, was in the front passenger seat and her partner Lovell Mahon was driving.
Mr Mahon suffered serious injuries including a skull fracture and is unlikely to walk again.
Owen Maughan had previously admitted inflicting grievous bodily harm on Mr Mahon.
The jury also found Patrick Maughan guilty of the same charge.
The court had heard that Mr Mahon and Owen Maughan had never met and he did not associate with his cousin Hayley.
Hayley Maughan filmed video clips of the two men following them, leaving a voice note for her mother Erica in which she said she was afraid.
Giving evidence during the trial, Owen Maughan told jurors he did not know there were children in the car.
He said he believed he and Mr Mahon were going to fight after arguing back and forth between the cars, and he decided to dent the side of Mr Mahon’s car so he would stop and get out.
He denied trying to cause serious injury.
After the crash, Owen and Patrick Maughan drove off and paused for Patrick Maughan to pull the registration plate off the truck, which Owen said was done in a state of “panic”.
Jurors heard the pair had been drinking in Rochester earlier that day, and had about 12 bottles of beer and 13 pints respectively, before they began driving their Ford Ranger pick-up truck home.
Owen Maughan told jurors that they spotted a similar vehicle which made them think the drivers may also be from the traveller community, and pulled up alongside.
But he said Mr Mahon was “aggressive and pointing at me” and Maughan got “pretty pissed off with it” so he started “following him just to try and annoy him”.
He said he decided to dent the side of the other car so Mr Mahon would pull in and fight, and “couldn’t believe” what he was seeing when the car flipped over.
The pair will be sentenced at a later date.

Gaza reconstruction fund ready for donations: World Bank chief

The Gaza Reconstruction and Development Fund is ready for donations, World Bank President Ajay Banga said Thursday.
Banga said at the first Board of Peace meeting in Washington that the fund secures donor money while the board directs disbursements for crucial reconstruction and development projects in Gaza.
He assured donors that robust financial, legal and oversight mechanisms remain in place to guarantee absolute transparency about how the money is utilised.
A financial controller from the World Bank is currently seconded to the Board of Peace to help integrate the highest financial standards into the rebuilding process.
"We are helping along with the Board of Peace, which takes the ownership of ensuring that the right kind of financial, legal and oversight mechanisms are being put in place," he said.
The World Bank Group plans to leverage its triple-A rating to attract private bond money to bolster public finance initiatives for the region.
"Because of our triple-A rating, we have the ability to leverage private bond money to help to create the resources we need," he said.
Banga highlighted the global institution's capacity to effectively de-risk private investing to support the extensive rebuilding operations.
He emphasised that the World Bank brings vital on-the-ground expertise and practical knowledge gathered from operating in challenging markets worldwide.
The World Bank president stated that the institution refuses to be an armchair critic, aiming instead to be an active participant in providing Palestinians the opportunities and lives they deserve.

Nordic combined skiers may have competed in their last Olympics

Nordic goodbye?
It could be the last Olympics for a sport that mixes the grace of ski jumping with the grind of cross-country skiing.
Nordic combined events at the Milan Cortina Games ended Thursday. And the International Olympic Committee is considering scrapping it from future Games because of a small TV audience and podium positions dominated by a tiny group of nations.
As if to illustrate that point, Norway swept took gold in all three events — including Thursday's men’s team sprint — and the same countries stood on the podium at all three Nordic combined events at these Winter Games.
“Hopefully these three events have been fun to watch and I think it has been a lot of nations fighting for their medals,” Jen Luraas Oftebro, who won three golds, said after sharing the win with teammate Andreas Skoglund. “Hopefully the IOC will see the value in that.”
Nordic combined was invented some 150 years ago when a Norwegian crown prince seeking glory as a champion paired the two disciplines he excelled at.
The contest opens with a daredevil ski jump to determine the starting order for a lung-busting cross-country ski race.
“Nordic combined is such a beautiful sport and I think it deserves much more popularity because I think the races are really, really fun to watch and the athletes are doing amazing,” said Jan Vytrval, a Czech competitor. “It deserves much more than to be deleted from the Olympics.”
The sport has been included since the first Winter Games in 1924, but it is the only winter sport that doesn’t include women. Female athletes who compete on the World Cup tour and in world championships have lobbied hard to change that.
But their fate is tied to the larger sport.
The IOC has previously put off a decision on the sport's future but will revisit the question after the Games wrap up Sunday.
“If it stays, it’s for both,” said Lasse Ottesen, the Nordic combined director of the International Ski Federation. “It makes no sense to say, ‘Yes, we’re just going to have the Nordic combined men in or, yes, we're going to take the men out and we’re going to throw the women in.’ I mean why would anyone do that in these times?”
Ottesen said FIS had exceeded requirements the IOC set out in 2022, increasing the competition in the women’s sport and building media interest globally. While audience numbers grew slightly over each of the last three Olympics, he conceded it was not as much as FIS expected.
Two of the three events — the men’s individual normal hill jump and large hill ski jump competitions that were each followed by 10 kilometer ski races — sold out all 4,500 tickets allocated and 90% of the team event tickets were sold, Ottesen said.
But, he added, the cross-country venue has twice that capacity, so it “looks a little bit thinner.”
FIS President Johan Eliasch attended the Feb. 11 normal hill event with IOC President Kirsty Coventry to try to showcase the excitement that two disciplines generate.
IOC member Ingmar de Vos, a member of the committee reviewing the fate of the sport, attended the large hill event.
The contests in the last three Olympics were won by Norway, Austria, Germany and Japan. In Milan Cortina, Germany and Japan — despite starting two of the races in first place after the jump — were shut out as Finland took two individual bronzes and a team silver.
That is progress in the eyes of the sport’s supporters — and the Finns, who gave a thrilling chase for the silver medal on Thursday.
“We have done our part with competing,” said Eero Hirvonen, who won an individual bronze and shared the silver with Ilkka Herola. “We have had really interesting competitions here and I think all the attention with what our success and medals have got in Finland ... I hope it helps.”

Israeli settlers kill 19-year-old Palestinian-American, officials and witnesses say
The Palestinian Health Ministry and a witness say that Israeli settlers in the occupied West Bank shot and killed a Palestinian-American in an attack on a village

Israeli settlers in the occupied West Bank shot and killed a Palestinian-American during an attack on a village, the Palestinian Health Ministry and a witness said Thursday.
Raed Abu Ali, a resident of the village of Mukhmas, said a group of settlers came to the community Wednesday afternoon and tried to attack a farmer, prompting clashes after residents intervened. Israeli forces later arrived, and during the violence armed settlers killed 19-year-old Nasrallah Abu Siyam and injured several others.
Abu Ali said that the army shot tear gas, sound grenades and live ammunition. Israel's military acknowledged using what it called “riot dispersal methods” after receiving reports of Palestinians throwing rocks but denied that its forces fired during the clashes.
“When the settlers saw the army, they were encouraged and started shooting live bullets,” Abu Ali said. He added that they clubbed those injured with sticks after they had fallen to the ground.
The Palestinian Ministry of Health confirmed Abu Siyam's death from critical wounds sustained Wednesday afternoon near the village east of Ramallah.
Abu Siyam’s killing is the latest in a surge in violence by extremist settlers in the West Bank, which killed 240 people last year, according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. Seventeen Israelis were killed over the same period. The Palestinian Authority’s Wall and Settlement Resistance Commission said Abu Siyam was the first Palestinian killed by settlers in 2026.
Mukhmas and its surrounding area — most of which lies under Israeli civil and military administration — have become a hotspot for settler attacks, including arson and assaults, as well as the construction of outposts that Israeli law considers illegal.
The Israeli military said late Wednesday that unnamed suspects shot at Palestinians, who were later evacuated for medical treatment. It did not say whether any were arrested.
Abu Siyam's mother told The Associated Press that he was an American citizen, making him the second Palestinian-American to be killed by Israeli settlers in less than a year.
The U.S. Embassy did not respond to questions on Thursday.
Palestinians and rights groups say authorities routinely fail to prosecute settlers or hold them accountable for violence. Under National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, investigations into settler attacks have plummeted, according to the Israeli rights group Yesh Din.
UN says Israel's acts in West Bank may be ethnic cleansing
The U.N. human rights office on Thursday accused Israel of war crimes and said practices that displace Palestinians in the occupied West Bank “raise concerns over ethnic cleansing.”
The Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, citing findings collected November 2024 to October 2025, said Israel was engaged in “concerted and accelerating effort to consolidate annexation” while maintaining a system “to maintain oppression and domination of Palestinians.”
It said Israeli military operations in the northern West Bank “employed means and methods designed for warfare” including lethal airstrikes and forcibly transferring civilians from their homes. It also said Israel “forbade” residents from returning to their homes in northern West Bank refugee camps. The operation, which Israel said was aimed against militants, has displaced tens of thousands of Palestinians.
The report also accused Palestinian security forces of using unnecessary lethal force in the same areas, killing at least eight people, and noted that the Palestinian Authority had engaged in “intimidation, detention and ill-treatment of journalists, human rights defenders and other individuals deemed critical of its rule.”
Neither Israel’s Foreign Ministry nor the Palestinian Authority responded to requests for comment. Israel has repeatedly accused the U.N. rights office of anti-Israel bias.
Last year, the U.N. human rights monitor warned of what it called “an unfolding genocide in Gaza” with “conditions of life increasingly incompatible with (Palestinians’) continued existence.”
Report finds imprisoned Palestinian journalists were tortured
The Committee to Protect Journalists said that dozens of Palestinian journalists who were detained in Israel during the war in Gaza experienced terrible conditions, including physical assaults, forced stress positions, sensory deprivation, sexual violence and medical neglect.
CPJ has documented the detention of at least 94 Palestinian journalists and one media worker during the war in Gaza. It covers 32 journalists and one media worker from Gaza, 60 from the West Bank, and two from Israel. Thirty of the journalists are still in custody, CPJ said.
The report found that half of the journalists detained were never charged with a crime and were held under Israel’s administrative detention system, which allows for suspects deemed a security risk to be held for six months and can be renewed indefinitely.
Israel’s prison services did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the report, but had rejected a similar report in January about conditions for Palestinian prisoners as “false allegations,” contending it operates lawfully, is subject to oversight and reviews complaints.
UN development chief says removing Gaza rubble will take 7 years
The vast destruction across Gaza will take at least seven years just to remove the rubble, according to the United Nations Development Program.
Alexander De Croo, the former Belgian prime minister who just returned from Gaza, said that the UNDP had removed just 0.5% of the rubble and people in Gaza are experiencing “the worst living conditions that I have ever seen.”
De Croo said 90% of Gaza’s 2.2 million people live in “very, very rudimentary tents” in the middle of the rubble, which poses health dangers and a danger from exploding weapons.
He said UNDP has been able to build 500 improved housing units, and has 4,000 more that are ready, but estimates the true need is 200,000 to 300,000 units. The units are meant to be used temporarily while reconstruction takes place. He called on Israel to expand access for goods and items needed for reconstruction and the private sector to begin development.

Uzbekistan to make a ‘meaningful contribution’ to Gaza reconstruction, says Uzbek president
Shavkat Mirziyoyev says Board of Peace to help create favorable environment for economic, social recovery of Gaza
ISTANBUL
Uzbekistan is ready to make a “meaningful contribution” to the construction of residential buildings, kindergartens, schools and hospitals in the Gaza Strip, Uzbek President Shavkat Mirziyoyev said Thursday at the first Board of Peace meeting in Washington.
Mirziyoyev expressed confidence that the boar’s work "will help create a favorable environment for the economic and social recovery of the Gaza Strip."
"Uzbekistan supported the peacekeeping initiative to establish the Board of Peace and firmly stated its intention to play a practical role in its successful implementation," said Mirziyoyev, adding that the meeting reflects international solidarity, peacemaking and a shared desire to improve the situation in the Middle East.
"We must use this historic opportunity to build a new Gaza with a thriving economy and decent living conditions for all its people," he noted.
Mirziyoyev underlined that the summit is "the result of the political will and pragmatism" of US President Donald Trump.
Israel began its war in Gaza on Oct. 8, 2023, resulting in more than 72,000 Palestinian deaths and over 171,000 injuries, most of them women and children, and damage to 90% of civilian infrastructure.

Postwar Gaza framework presented at Board of Peace meeting
New administrative office, police recruitment, demilitarization plan outlined as part of transition roadmap
ISTANBUL
Senior officials on Thursday presented a framework for Gaza’s postwar governance, security, and reconstruction during a meeting of the Trump-backed Board of Peace, detailing proposals ranging from institutional rebuilding to the formation of a new Palestinian police force.
Nickolay Mladenov, director-general of the Board of Peace, announced the creation of a new administrative mechanism intended to support Gaza’s future civilian leadership.
“Today we're very happy to announce that we're creating the Office of the High Representative for Gaza, of the Board of Peace, which will be there to support, to guide, and to assist the National Committee for the administration of Gaza, hopefully removing the roadblocks that they will be facing in taking over civilian and administrative control of the Gaza Strip,” he said.
Mladenov said the office would operate under the supervision of the board and its executive body and coordinate with Israeli and Palestinian institutions, as well as an international stabilization force.
He also revealed that recruitment for a transitional Palestinian police force had already begun.
“As of this morning, we started the process of recruiting the Palestinian police force … and just in the first few hours, we have 2,000 people who have applied to join a new transitional Palestinian police force to be formed in Gaza under the authority of the National Committee, with the support of the Board of Peace trained in Egypt,” he said.
According to Mladenov, the force would be central to restoring order during the transition phase.
“It is this Palestinian security force under the authority of the National Committee for the transition period that will allow us to ensure that all factions in Gaza are dismantled and all weapons are put under the control of one civilian authority,” he said.
He thanked Qatar, Egypt and Türkiye for supporting mediation efforts and emphasized that reconstruction depended on disarmament, saying: “There is no other option except the full demilitarization and decommissioning of all weapons in Gaza for reconstruction to begin and for people to have a new way of life going forward.”
Former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair also addressed the meeting, describing Gaza’s governance record as deeply troubled and calling for sweeping reforms.
“For decades, Gaza's governance has been characterized by extremism, corruption, ineffective institutions, and the complete absence of a route to prosperity for the Gazan people,” he said.
Blair outlined a vision for Gaza based on functioning public institutions, economic opportunity and technological development.
“This is a vision of Gaza as part of the Middle East at peace … a genuine commitment to a region where, whether you're a Muslim, Jew, Christian, of any faith or none, you can rise by your own efforts, and feel your government by your side, not on your back,” he said.
He added that President Donald Trump’s proposed framework “remains the best, indeed the only hope for Gaza, the region and the wider world.”

Trump extends some US sanctions against Russia for another year
US President Donald Trump has officially extended sanctions against Russia over its aggression against Ukraine for another year.
Source: a notice published in the US Federal Register, as reported by European Pravda
Details: The executive order, which takes effect on 20 February, provides for the extension of a number of anti-Russian sanctions introduced by US presidents' executive orders in 2014, 2018 and 2022.
The first executive order on sanctions against Russia was issued in 2014. US President Barack Obama's executive order No. 13660, which was published on 6 March 2014, provided for the freezing of the property of a number of individuals.
Initially, sanctions were applied to those who had facilitated Russia's occupation of Crimea.
The sanctions list was subsequently updated several times during the presidency of Joe Biden.
Background:
- On 8 January, US Senator Lindsey Graham announced that President Donald Trump had given the green light to a bipartisan Russia sanctions bill.
- In mid-November, Graham announced that Trump had given Congress his "blessing" to move on the long-stalled Russia sanctions bill.
- In September it was reported that US senators have drafted new legislation aimed at significantly expanding US sanctions on Russia's shadow fleet of oil tankers.

Feb 19 - Belarusian opposition politician Mikola Statkevich, who refused deportation to Lithuania after his 2025 release and was imprisoned again, has been freed after he suffered a stroke while in custody, exiled opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya said on Thursday.
Statkevich was one of 52 prisoners freed in Belarus in September 2025 after an appeal from U.S. President Donald Trump, including journalists and political opponents of President Alexander Lukashenko. All were brought to the Lithuanian border, but Statkevich was the only one who refused to cross.
"I am relieved that he is free and able to hug his wife, who waited for him for so long," Tsikhanouskaya wrote on X, posting a picture of Statkevich and his wife smiling. She said that he could barely speak following the stroke.
Statkevich, 69, ran unsuccessfully against Lukashenko in a presidential election in 2010. He was arrested in May 2020 and sentenced in 2021 to 14 years in a maximum-security prison for "organising riots". REUTERS

Three ways to stop nerves from ruining your next job interview

Opinion
Three ways to stop nerves from ruining your next job interview
Job interviews are strange arenas. Capable people walk in prepared and walk out wondering why their brain suddenly forgot things it’s known for years.
I’ve worked with senior leaders, high-potential graduates and seasoned executives for over a decade, and I can say this with confidence: interview nerves are common, human, and say far less about ability than most people think.
Yet, we still keep to a comfortable myth that interviews reward the most qualified person. In reality, they often reward the person who can access their competence under pressure. That’s an entirely different skill. And we don’t teach it enough.
The moment evaluation and judgement enter the room, the nervous system goes into overdrive. Your heart rate rises, your memory retrieval dips, self-consciousness creeps in, and suddenly, a simple question feels loaded.
So beyond rehearsing answers, here are three practical ways to show up with calm, credible confidence.
1. Treat it as a two-way conversation. One mistake many candidates make is they approach the interview with desperation: you have a job, and I need that job. But that can turn into tension, or worse, desperation.
Instead of saying, “I handle pressure well”, describe a time you managed a tight deadline or a difficult stakeholder.
That mindset creates pressure instantly. And when people feel desperate to impress, they become overly self-conscious, monitoring how they sound, how they look, whether they’re saying the “right” thing. That’s when answers get stiff and authenticity disappears.
A stronger frame is mutual evaluation. Yes, the employer is assessing capability. But you’re also assessing fit. Is the role, the culture, the leadership, the growth something that’s aligned with what you want? This is a two-way decision.
This shift changes how the brain reads the situation, and that changes how you show up.
2. Replace adjectives with evidence. Early in my career, I conducted thousands of screening interviews. I constantly heard: I’m proactive. I’m a strong communicator. I’m a team player.
None of these landed without evidence. What made someone stand out was when they provided a specific example or short story to back up what they were saying.
Instead of saying, “I handle pressure well,” describe a time you managed a tight deadline or a difficult stakeholder. Paint the picture briefly. What happened, what action you took, what changed as a result.
For example, “Two weeks before a product launch, our supplier pulled out. I sourced alternatives and reworked the timeline with the team. As a result, we launched only three days late and kept our biggest client.”
People remember stories and they trust examples.
3. Calm the body first. Interview anxiety is physiological. Trying to “think calm” rarely works if the body feels under threat. The body needs to know it’s safe first. So here are two simple tools you can use in the moment to help signal internal safety and help regulate your state.
First, before the interview begins, breathe with a longer exhale (for instance, inhale for four counts, exhale for eight). A slow, extended exhale tells the nervous system there’s no immediate threat.
Second, ground your posture. Whether you’re standing or sitting, plant your feet firmly on the ground, relax your shoulders, and hold your chin level. Because of the brain-body feedback loop, your posture influences how steady and assured you feel, and how you appear.
Interviews rarely reveal the full picture of someone’s capability. All they do is capture a narrow snapshot of how someone handles evaluation, judgement, uncertainty and pressure in a short window of time. It’s an imperfect system, but it’s the one most workplaces still rely on.
Anxiety often shows up because something matters. But left unmanaged, it can distort how capable you appear. That’s why the person who manages their nerves best in the moment often ends up being the one who gets the callback.

Trump says Iran deal won't come easy, but talks going well

WASHINGTON, February 19. /TASS/. Washington’s negotiations with Tehran are going well, but it won't be easy to reach an agreement, US President Donald Trump said during the inaugural meeting of the Board of Peace.
"You know, good talks are being held," he said. "It's proven to be, over the years, not easy to make a meaningful deal with Iran. We have to make a meaningful deal, otherwise bad things happen, but we have to make a meaningful deal."
He reiterated that Washington will not allow Iran to obtain nuclear weapons and claimed that Tehran is still entertaining the idea.
"We do have some work to do with Iran," Trump said. "They can't have a nuclear weapon. It's very simple. You can't have peace in the Middle East if they have a nuclear weapon."
Earlier, CBS reported that the American administration is considering striking Iran on February 21. In January, the White House warned that it was ready to use force if Tehran fails to engage in talks aimed at reaching a "fair deal" under which Iran completely drops any plans to obtain nuclear weapons. The Iranian government has repeatedly said it had no plans of creating a nuclear bomb.
On February 17, the second round of negotiations between the US and Iran on the nuclear issue took place in Geneva, mediated by Oman. According to Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, the parties reached mutual understanding on a number of issues, which could serve as a basis for a draft future agreement on the nuclear program. US Vice President JD Vance said that the talks went well on a number of aspects, but Tehran is not yet ready to accept some of the fundamental positions outlined by the White House. Earlier, the United States and Israel insisted that Iran not only scrap its nuclear program, but also stop producing ballistic missiles and supporting pro-Iranian forces in the Middle East.

Trump tells Board of Peace he’ll decide on bombing Iran within 10 days
Washington: US President Donald Trump says he will likely decide whether to launch strikes against Iran over the next 10 days, as he continues the biggest American miliary build-up in the Middle East since the invasion of Iraq in 2003.
Trump made the remarks in Washington at the first meeting of the Board of Peace, a new international alliance convened by Trump that has so far been snubbed by a number of major US allies, including Australia.
“Iran is a hotspot right now,” Trump said. “Good talks are being had. It’s proven to be over the years not easy to make a meaningful deal. We have to make a meaningful deal otherwise bad things happen.”
The president referred to his strikes in June on Iran’s major nuclear facilities, which he said had decimated the Islamic Republic’s ability to develop nuclear weapons and cleared the way for a deal to end Israel’s war in Gaza.
“Now we may have to take a step further, or we may not,” Trump said. “Maybe we’re going to make a deal. But you’re going to be finding out over the next probably 10 days.”
The comments followed reports in US media outlets on Wednesday (Washington time) that Trump had been briefed that the US was now militarily ready to strike Iran, given the number of assets surged to the region.
That includes two of the US’s largest aircraft strike carrier groups, the USS Abraham Lincoln and USS Gerald Ford – the latter of which is still on its way – and dozens of aircraft refuelling tankers that were tracked heading toward Europe and the Middle East this week.
Trump has previously given false timelines to Tehran. Last June, ahead of the strikes on Iran’s nuclear facilities, he said he would decide “within two weeks” – but dropped bombs two days later.
Meanwhile, representatives of the Board of Peace said progress had been towards securing Gaza, which was the original impetus for the organisation before Trump expanded its remit.
Five nations have agreed to commit troops to the United Nations-mandated International Stabilisation Force that will be tasked with securing peace in the wartorn territory: Indonesia, Morocco, Kazakhstan, Kosovo and Albania.
The force will be commanded by US Major General Jasper Jeffers, who said Indonesia agreed to fill the deputy commander’s post. Egypt and Jordan have agreed to train a Palestinian police force.
An ISF brigade would be assigned to each of five sectors in Gaza, Jeffers said: Rafah, Khan Yunis, Deir al-Balah, Gaza City and North Gaza, starting with Rafah in the south.
Former Bulgarian minister and diplomat Nickolay Mladenov, the board’s director-general for Gaza, said 2000 Palestinians signed up to join a transitional police force in just a few hours this week.
Trump, meanwhile, announced nine Board of Peace members had pledged $US7 billion ($10 billion) towards a Gaza relief package. The Associated Press reported that figure was about a tenth of what was ultimately needed to rebuild the shattered territory after the two-year war between Israel and Hamas.
Former British prime minister Tony Blair, speaking about the future governance of Gaza, said the territory had “vast” potential, with 40 kilometres of Mediterranean coastline, proximity to regional and global markets and a population whose median age was just 19.
Blair pledged that a future Gaza would boast effective public institutions, a tolerant education system and a business-friendly, tech-enabled society – though he provided no details about how this would be achieved.
“This is a vision of Gaza as part of the Middle East at peace - not a phony peace of declarations no one means, and agreements no one intends to keep,” he said.
Trump’s peace plan remained “the best and only” hope for Gaza, the region and the wider world, Blair said.
Billionaire Cypriot-Israeli real estate mogul Yakir Gabay presented an ambitious six-stage redevelopment plan for Gaza, again starting in the south. The coastline, he said, “can be developed as a new Mediterranean riviera with 200 hotels and potential islands”.
The inaugural meeting of Trump’s Board of Peace attracted several heads of state from founding members, including the King of Bahrain and the presidents of Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Romania and Argentina.
Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto confirmed his country would contribute 8000 or more troops to the peacekeeping force in Gaza, and said he was optimistic Trump’s peace plan could succeed. “There will be problems, but we will prevail,” he said.
Other members sent prime ministers or other ministers, including Israel, which was represented by Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar, while some countries attended the meeting as “observers”.
Numerous US allies were absent, especially from Western Europe. The United Kingdom, France and Germany have rejected joining the board, while Trump rescinded an invitation to Canada.
Ukraine refused to join after Trump extended an invitation to Russia, which has not yet agreed to participate.
Australia has not made a final decision, but Foreign Minister Penny Wong told Senate estimates that joining the organisation would incur legally binding obligations.
“That requires a range of considerations that are quite different to those which apply to other international groupings or commitments we’ve entered into,” she said earlier in February.

Which Perth suburb had the most crime in 2025?

Which Perth suburb had the most crime in 2025?
Crime last year was down to its lowest level in Western Australia since 2022, according newly released WA Police statistics.
And while some suburbs saw a dramatic downturn in criminal activity, for others it was a different story.
WAtoday has examined the data and compiled a per capita snapshot of each suburb, giving a fairer picture of which areas of Perth suffered the most issues.
While some of the top contenders are to be expected, given their proximity to nightlife and retail precincts, others emerged as surprising crime hotspots.
The data collect by police unsurprisingly shows that Perth and Northbridge topped the list of suburbs with the most crime, followed by Cannington, south of the city, which is home to Carousel shopping centre.
The figures show that while crime in Cannington has decreased by 2 per cent over the last 12 months, it has risen by nearly 70 per cent since 2020. Stealing offences, in particular, have almost doubled in that time.
Fourth on the top 10 list is the eastern suburb of Forrestdale, where crime has risen sharply – an increase of 93 per cent since 2021.
The suburb sits within the City of Armadale and is advertised to potential home owners as offering a semi-rural lifestyle where the median house price is currently about $850,000 and median rent is just over $700 a week.
Forrestdale houses just over 1000 residents, according to the last census, but assault reports – both family and non-family – appear to blame for the big increase in crime statistics.
The next suburb on the list sits on the end of the train line and is generally considered a crime zone due to its low socio-economic status.
While house prices in Midland have risen, they still sit at a more affordable median range of $600,000 with rents also sitting at around $600 a week.
But while Midland is home to over 6000 people and regularly sits at the top of the most crime-ridden suburbs in Perth, crime there has actually decreased significantly in the last year.
The figures show crime in the town has dropped by 15 per cent from 2024 to 2025. Stealing is down, graffiti is down, breaching a restraining order is down, sexual offences are down and so is robbery.
Fremantle sits sixth on the top 10 list, but it has also seen a reduction in crime of 10 per cent over the last 12 months, followed by Karawara, just south of the city.
However, the centrally located suburb that is close to Curtin University has bucked the trend and seen an increase in crime of nearly 5 per cent which, despite the area now commanding on average nearly $1 million for houses.
Burswood, home to WA’s only casino, is eighth on the list and has also seen a reduction in crime of 15 per cent, along with Cockburn Central at ninth, where crime has reduced by more than 7 per cent in the last year.
Tenth on the list this year is Armadale, where the crime rates have almost remained the same between 2024 and 2025.
Other suburbs across the metro area that also saw a big reduction in crime include Rivervale in Perth’s east, which sits in the City of Belmont about six kilometres from the CBD. Home to almost 11,000 residents, the crime there over the past year dropped dramatically by 33 per cent.
An even bigger reduction was seen in Queens Park, where crime reports halved, and in Karrinyup where crime dropped by 35 per cent between 2024 and 2025.
Cloverdale, about 10 kilometres east of the city, also saw a big reduction in crime by 30 per cent, while Victoria Park and Carlisle saw crime drop by 28 per cent and 25 per cent, respectively.
Crime has gone up in a few instances, including in the northern Perth suburb of Two Rocks, where reports almost doubled, and in Shoalwater near Rockingham, where crime rose by 40 per cent over the last 12 months.
Other suburbs that saw a rise in issues included Woodbridge (39 per cent), Maylands (26 per cent), Parmelia (25 per cent), Balcatta (20 per cent) and Alkimos (19 per cent).
Our regional towns also saw some big jumps in crime numbers, with both Narrogin and Newman seeing a reduction in crime.
Kununurra, however, still rates as one of the worst places for crime in the state, rivalling Perth’s entertainment precincts for crime reports per capita.

The NSW town where home buyers splashed the most cash last year

The NSW town where home buyers splashed the most cash last year
Orange has been revealed as the regional NSW suburb where buyers splashed the most cash on houses in 2025.
Most top-ranked towns were inland, with only one by the beach. The Central West foodie destination took out the top spot, recording $688,087,299 in house sales, according to Cotality’s Best of the Best 2025 report, which tracks the total value of sales in the 12 months to September.
While the median house price was a modest $693,783 at the end of November, high-end listings, including an $8 million trophy sale, helped Orange take the top spot. There were 898 house sales over that period in the Central West city.
Cotality research director Tim Lawless said Orange was the second-largest suburb in NSW by area, which also contributed to the result.
It nudged ahead of the largest suburb, Port Macquarie, partly due to the sheer number of houses that changed hands. The Mid North Coast suburb was the only coastal spot to feature in Cotality’s regional top five.
“Orange had a turnover rate of 5.7 per cent, well above the national average of 5 per cent,” said Lawless.
The drivers of Orange’s economy – a large teaching hospital, a gold mine and an outpost of the state’s Departments of Primary Industries and Regional Development – meant workers came and went, increasing turnover, according to Lawless.
The large numbers of students and temporary workers also supported Orange’s rental market, in turn attracting investors, said Michael Wright, an agent at Peter Fisher Orange.
“People who are priced out of the city market will buy an investment property here as a way to build wealth, with a view to possibly moving here down the track.”
Orange last year was named Australia’s top retirement destination in research from rewards platform Citro (backed by AMP).
Wright said the hospital, which expanded in 2011, and the adjoining medical precinct were drawing growing numbers of visitors and new residents.
“Instead of having to go to Sydney to get treated, people from the bush can come to Orange. We also get a lot of people from further out west retiring here because they want the things a city can offer, but in the country.”
Wright retired from farming and moved to Orange in the 1990s with his wife and three children. He said the city was a “magic” place to raise kids.
“Our springs and autumns have to be seen to be believed.”
Orange Mayor Tony Mileto said it had changed over time but had kept its heart. “It’s still welcoming, inclusive and community focused.”
Mileto said the community reached out to support his sister when she lost her husband in a motor vehicle accident in 1989, for example.
The growing Orange Food Week and Orange Wine Festival were attracting tree-changers from larger cities, Mileto said.
“The diversity in our economy is supporting consistent demand for housing at different cost points,” he said.
Orange’s tight rental market and rising house prices – the median has jumped 42.9 per cent in the past five years, according to Cotality – was “a concern” for some long-time residents, Mileto said.
“The challenge is managing growth in a way that welcomes new residents without displacing the people who already call Orange home.”
To address this, Orange City Council has partnered with Landcom to develop a vacant parcel of land. Dubbed Redleaf, the development will deliver more than 300 new homes.
Of the city’s existing stock, houses priced below $800,000 have been attracting the greatest interest, said agent Anthony Cook of John Cook Real Estate.
“We are receiving a lot of investment enquiries for lower-end properties – anything from $400,000 up to $800,000,” he said.
Cook said many affordable properties sold while tenanted. “If they’re not, generally you can find a tenant before the property settles.”
In the centre of town, on the streets surrounding Cook Park, large Victorian homes can change hands for between $3 million and $4 million, Cook said.
On the outskirts, large acreages with grand homesteads can command much higher prices. In August, the 49-hectare Rosedale Farm sold for $8 million.
Cook said the town’s positives far outweighed any worries.
“We’ve got some of the greatest vineyards in the country, for example, and they’re all quite close to town. There is something for everyone here.”
Lawless said Orange’s diverse economy, lifestyle attractions and relative affordability meant the city would probably continue to see price growth.
“That blend of affordability and liveability makes it very attractive. And it’s got some good wine, which never hurts.”

Taylor may shoot for the summit. Even his backers will settle for base camp

Opinion
Taylor may shoot for the summit. Even his backers will settle for base camp
Depending on who you talk to in the Liberal Party, the early mail on Angus Taylor’s leadership prospects ranges from “he will be gone by the end of 2026” to “he will put in a good showing but lose in 2028.”
Some Liberal MPs, especially those in the centre-right and unaligned groupings who were booted out of shadow cabinet, are upset. But most moderates were spared a purge of the shadow ministry, and the 34-17 margin (in the Taylor-Sussan Ley leadership ballot) has drawn a line under the contest.
Now Taylor’s real task begins: restoring the Coalition as a credible alternative government.
Taylor and his allies have just executed a relatively bloodless coup.
First, they stayed the hand of the younger Andrew Hastie in the contest to replace Sussan Ley and then, after prevaricating for most of a week, Taylor and his crew pulled off the double and brought the career of the first woman to lead the Liberal Party to an unhappy end.
Taylor, his deputy Jane Hume and his allies have also pulled off a deft refresh off the frontbench, bringing back harder-edged conservatives including Jacinta Nampijinpa Price, Hastie and Sarah Henderson while promoting younger talent including Tim Wilson and Claire Chandler to the two most senior economic portfolios.
Of the 22 Liberals in the 30-member shadow ministry, 12 are now under 50 (up from seven) and 10 MPs are over 50.
That matters because as even one of Taylor’s close allies admits, when not hyperbolically claiming the Albanese government is the worst in Australian history: “Gus might be able to get us to base camp in 2028 [the next federal election] but it’s hard to see him reaching the summit.”
Why some Liberals think it’s a good idea to regularly insult Australians’ intelligence and tell them they elected the worst government in history just nine months ago is a question for another time.
Another Taylor ally told me in the lead-up to the leadership ballot: “We need to make generational change. We need to shock Labor. What we need to do is put in place the mechanisms for success over a longer period of time. We need a five-year pathway to 2031.”
In other words, it may not be until 2031 – under a leader who is not Taylor – that the Coalition has a chance of winning government. So Taylor’s allies are glum rather than cock-a-hoop because they realise their man probably only gets one shot at leading the party and that’s now – given his age (59), the need for further renewal and, most of all, because they can count.
Labor holds a record 94 seats in the lower house and the Coalition a paltry 42. A Taylor win or even forcing the Albanese government into minority in 2028 would be a near-miracle. As a Ley supporter observes: “Every time they claim Albanese is the worst government in history, they’re telling voters they got it wrong … even though he won 94 seats.”
The predictions of bruised and cranky Ley supporters about Taylor’s prospects are, unsurprisingly, far more pessimistic than the new leader’s supporters’.
“I think the party room is going to start realising by the end of March they’ve made a terrible mistake and he’s not up to it,” a second Ley supporter told me this week. “They will switch to Hastie by the end of the year.”
Of course, that would mean installing Hastie (or Wilson) before they may be ready to lead – and so prematurely burn through a future leader.
The idea that Taylor could be ousted by the end of the year, as sketched out by the second Ley supporter, seems less likely given his colleagues’ benchmark for his success should be low, in line with the Liberals’ record-low poll numbers.
Angus Taylor is no Tony Abbott. He risks damaging his own credibility, rather than that of the government, if he attempts to emulate Abbott, one of his mentors, and simply opposes everything. Taylor is not facing an unstable minority government at war with itself.
Yet he has already signalled opposition to any change to the capital gains tax – as Labor has foreshadowed could be made in the next budget – and labelled it a tax that would reduce the supply of housing, rather than a tax discount for investment properties.
The new opposition leader’s situation is less like Abbott’s in 2010 and more like that faced by John Howard in 1985, when he became Liberal leader after Bob Hawke’s second election win. Howard realised that the way to return the Liberals and Nationals to base camp and a chance of reaching the summit was by restoring the Coalition’s economic credibility. He backed some of the Hawke government’s free-market reforms.
There is an argument that this kept the Coalition in opposition for longer at the time, but it also set up Howard to lead a long-term government from 1996 – because the parties’ economic and policy credentials had been restored. That, rather than opposition for its own sake, should be Taylor’s goal, even if it means he has to pass the torch to Hastie or Wilson one day.
It’s not clear that Taylor has realised this. He doesn’t sound credible when he opposes tax policy sight unseen, or describes the Albanese government in overblown terms.
There are people in the Coalition who believe a modest structural reform to the tax system is reasonable and that the opposition should simply bank the savings and move on.
There are two more things Taylor can do to begin the task of restoring the Coalition’s credibility: release the election review conducted by party elders Nick Minchin and Pru Goward, which has been put on hold after a legal warning from Peter Dutton, and address the Coalition’s failures.
As that first Ley supporter puts it: “It’s the worst election result in the party’s history and they haven’t even released a summary document [of the review], let alone a conclusive document.
“I’m still waiting for a Liberal MP to say they’re sorry – ‘We got it wrong, we let you down, we made mistakes and we will make sure we don’t do it again’ … but they can’t even do that.”
Taylor, at least, has apologised for the opposition’s decision to oppose a tax cut. He should go further. The road to credibility for a federal opposition runs through sensible commentary and constructive criticism, not hyperbole. It must present itself as a “safe change”, as Howard realised and as Albanese did in 2019-22 when he strategically backed certain Coalition government decisions and opposed others.
Can Taylor turn the volume down from 11?

Role of the media in Israel’s national security psychological crisis - opinion
Unknown
Unknown Publisher

03:00:00 KST

Israel’s greatest strategic asset has never been its size, geography, or even military strength. It has been resilience – the collective psychological ability of society to absorb shock, mobilize under pressure, and recover from trauma while preserving democratic life.
In a country where nearly every family is connected to the military, where reserve duty interrupts careers, and where conflict periodically disrupts daily life, resilience is not a slogan – it is infrastructure. It is what allows a small, embattled democracy to function in a volatile region.
Yet today, an uncomfortable question must be asked: Is Israeli media, despite its democratic vitality and professional strengths, inadvertently weakening the very resilience that sustains the country?
The issue is not freedom of the press, nor criticism of government – both essential in a democracy. The problem lies in how modern media dynamics, competition, and political polarization combine to create a constant psychological stress environment that erodes social cohesion over time.
In conditions of persistent conflict, the media ceases to be merely an information channel. It becomes part of a national security psychology crisis – shaping how citizens emotionally experience threats and crises.
And right now, that experience is often corrosive.
I came to understand this firsthand two decades ago while serving as strategic adviser to then-public security minister Uzi Landau, then minister of public security, at a time when Israel broadened its understanding of internal security challenges in ways similar to the United States after 9/11.
While terror attacks inflicted horrific human costs, they were tactically destructive but psychologically strategic.
Terror aimed to spread panic far beyond the immediate victims.
To counter this, I developed training programs for police and first responders focused on managing the public psychological environment during and after attacks – rethinking the terror scene from a media coverage perspective. The guiding principle was simple: restore visible law and order quickly. Demonstrate control. Reduce panic. Help society return to normal life as quickly as possible.
I recruited leading members of the Israeli media who participated in simulations alongside police commanders, learning how coverage could either amplify terror or limit its psychological spread.
On February 22, 2004, theory collided with reality.
I was in a taxi on my way to the gym in Jerusalem, several cars ahead of Egged bus No. 14A, when a suicide bomber detonated explosives during morning rush hour near Liberty Bell Park. The explosion threw our taxi forward. As the driver sped away from the blast, I jumped out and ran back toward the scene to help.
The devastation was horrific. But what mattered most to me was how the event would be communicated to millions of Israelis watching at home.
At the scene, I worked with the police and first responders to arrange that local media focus on police and rescue operations – restoring order, assisting victims, demonstrating control – rather than broadcasting graphic images that would magnify fear nationwide. For the foreign media, I suggested we get them focused on the gruesome visuals, while the role of the Israeli coverage was to help signal something critical: the state was functioning, authorities were in control, and society would continue.
In that moment, the media played a direct and responsible role in national resilience and securing Israel’s National Security Psychology.
Two decades later, the environment has grown worse by leaps and bounds. While the advent of new television channels like 14 and 15 has, in many ways, created a better balance for the effects of political leanings in our media coverage, some of the systemic challenges to our national security have gone unaddressed.
Perpetual cycle of breaking news in Israel
Today, nonstop crisis coverage exhausts the public. Israeli viewers live in a perpetual state of breaking news. Studio panels, speculation, and political confrontation dominate airtime. Even routine developments are framed as dramatic turning points. Emotional fatigue replaces solidarity.
National resilience requires psychological recovery breaks, even if they are designed into the news coverage of the day. Instead, coverage often keeps the country in permanent alarm mode.
Polarization is amplified nightly. Television panels resemble political battlegrounds rather than forums for sober analysis. Debate is healthy in a democracy, but when internal conflict becomes the main spectacle, citizens absorb a message of division rather than shared purpose. While this phenomenon is not unique to Israel, as anyone who has watched the international news can attest, it is Israel’s security challenges that make our situation unique and a far greater risk.
Endless repetition of traumatic images compounds the damage. Ongoing reporting becomes psychological overload when replayed continuously, creating despair rather than resilience.
In the movie Network (1976), Sidney Lumet’s biting satire about television, media power, and public outrage, veteran news anchor Howard Beale grabs the attention of his TV audience in a pivotal scene by urging them to literally stand up, go to their windows, and – as an expression of collective frustration and disillusionment with the state of the world and their own helplessness in it – shout in unison, “I’m as mad as hell and I’m not going to take this anymore!”
That scene feels particularly relevant to Israel’s current media environment because many outlets today mirror the same dynamics Network satirized decades ago: prioritizing outrage-driven content that stokes emotional reaction over sober reporting, chasing ratings over responsibility by amplifying sensationalism, elevating celebrity news personalities whose personas overshadow factual context, and turning news into spectacle rather than journalism.
When journalistic ethics lose out to profit or politically focused motives, societal trust is one of the first casualties.
Trust also erodes when the line between journalism and political messaging blurs.
Only a few months ago, while opening one of Israel’s most trusted news platforms on my phone, I encountered a highly charged political advertisement dominating the screen without clear labeling distinguishing it from editorial content. Only after clicking through, was it clear that this was paid messaging rather than journalism, but it had already influenced how I read and interpreted the news that I consumed after seeing the advertising.
Concerned, I wrote privately to a senior representative of the organization warning that blurring news and advertising risks sacrificing long-term credibility for short-term revenue. The response I received was candid: “You are correct. I will deal with it.”
The incident was resolved, but the lesson remains: when citizens cannot distinguish whether they are seeing journalistic reporting or editorial messaging, trust declines. This collapse of trust is not only in the media, but in the government, in the army, in the courts, and across all the major institutions that are critical to our collective survival. None of this necessarily implies malicious intent.
Democracy requires accountability – but it also requires social cohesion. A society cannot sustain constant internal psychological conflict while facing persistent external threats.
National resilience-oriented responsible journalism does not mean propaganda. It means informing without inflaming, scrutinizing without destroying confidence, and exposing failures without convincing citizens their society is irreparably broken.
National security is not only about armies and missile defense: it is also about our collective psychology. It is about whether citizens have the trust and belief that their society can endure.
And that belief and trust is reshaped, every day, on the news.

Three cars lurked in Balga’s bushland the night a woman was murdered
John Napier-Winch remembers in vivid detail a late evening in October, 1974.
He and his wife had been driving home from their parents house in Girrawheen about midnight with their sleeping children, through the backstreets of Balga.
Napier-Winch remembers how still and eerie it was when he slowed his car to a crawl on the dimly lit Balga Avenue and saw a car parked near the bushland.
The car stood out on the dark street, with all four doors ajar and its interior lit up.
“I remember ... because it was parked in a funny place,” Napier-Winch told this masthead.
The spot on Balga Avenue had no houses bordering it, and was practically enveloped in bush. There were no driveways, and the nearest sign of life at midnight would have been the nearby Malthouse Tavern.
“The doors were open, and the lights were on … but there was no one around,” Napier-Winch said.
His first thought was someone had crashed their car and gone to get help. But a quick look around revealed there was no damage to the exterior at all, and it appeared to be running fine. The odd thing, Napier-Winch said, was that no one was there.
It was only days later he realised what he and his family may have just stumbled across.
This week, WAtoday has brought you the story of Gwenneth Graham’s murder, which remains unsolved after five decades. The first two parts of this series were published on Monday and Wednesday. This is part three.
The missing window
Gwenneth Graham was murdered in September 1974.
She was last seen at the Malthouse Tavern in Balga, the evening before the WAFL grand final.
A bartender called a taxi for her, but it’s not known whether she ever got in, accepted a lift or attempted to walk to her house which was about two kilometres away. She never made it home.
Gwen was found murdered in Balga’s bushland nine days later, inexpertly concealed under some leaf litter and an old refrigerator. She had been bashed, strangled and sexually assaulted.
Napier-Winch remembers reading the paper the day after her body had been found, and realising he and his family had likely only been metres from the dead mother-of-two.
“We thought, ‘That’s the same location we saw the car’,” he said.
“We ran to the police, and they came out [to the house], and I described to them the exact make and year of that car.”

More than 50 years on, Napier-Winch and his wife find it difficult to place when exactly they had come across the car parked on Balga Avenue, but place it only days before Graham’s body was discovered.
As an avid car fan, Napier-Winch was able to recall the vehicle down to minute details – it was a Ford Valiant, he said, with a swapped-out boot lid that appeared to be chrome. It had a spoiler at the rear that didn’t match the rest of its body.
“It means one of two things – they changed the boot, or they just put on a fancy chrome lid that came off another model,” he said.
“We gave police all the details, but we don’t know what they did with it.”
Muddying the waters
Identifying the cars became a primary focus of detectives, particularly due to the last sighting of Graham taking place in a pub’s carpark.
Police released details of a number of cars and implored their drivers to come forward so they could eliminate them from the investigation, and ended up going through about 4000 separate vehicles.
However, three went unclaimed.
They included a Holden station wagon and two separate Valiants that had been seen in the time frame narrowed down by police: between 11.30pm, when Gwen was last seen, and 10am the next day when locals remembered seeing some discarded shoes on Redcliffe Avenue.
For officers, it was tough sorting out fact from distraction.
The Valiants
There were reports relating to two Valiants that had been seen in the Balga area on the night of Graham’s murder.
A 16-year-old boy said he heard the voices of a man and woman coming from a green sedan parked on Balga Avenue around 11.30pm.
The witness told police at the time he heard the man demand a “perverted sex act” from the woman, and “threats to kill if the other person did not do as he asked”.
Witnesses said they also saw a car of the same make but in a light colour parked on the verge of Balga Avenue about the 11.40pm.
In an account that matches the one Napier-Winch gave in 2025, witnesses said they too came across the car parked up near the bush with all its interior lights on – but there was no driver.
The witnesses said they drove past again about half an hour later, and saw a man get into the car and slide across the front bench seat towards the driver’s side.
The man looked to be aged between 28 and 35, about 5′10 with a thin build, and was in a light-coloured, long-sleeved shirt with medium-length curly, dark hair. It would later emerge the car was seen extremely close to where Graham’s body was eventually found.
On interrogating the statements, police were unable to rule either vehicle in or out and neither car nor driver were ever located.
Teen comes forward
However, it wasn’t long before one car emerged as an interest to detectives.
A WA police gazette from 1974 recalled what a witness told officers about what he saw in Balga on the evening of September 27.
“About 11.30pm a 15-year-old youth observed a white woman being forced into the front passenger seat of a 1964 model (Holden) station sedan, bluish/green colour, with a white top. The vehicle may have a roof rack, but this is not certain,” it reads.
While this was set out in the gazette, a vintage car expert told this masthead the year was likely inaccurate, given the Holden model identified was only built from February 1965 to April 1966, making it unlikely it was a 1964 car.
“The youth described the person who pushed the woman into this vehicle as a part Aboriginal man about 5ft 8in to 5ft 9in, stocky build, black hair, wearing a white shirt with sleeves rolled up and dark trousers,” the police gazette read.
“His age is not known but he has an untidy appearance. He then hurried around the front of the car, entered the vehicle and drove off in the direction of Balga Avenue.”

The car was again spotted just about 1am the next morning, near where Graham’s body was found.
But neither the driver nor the car were never located.
A taxi driver’s account
Police experienced a further headache when a taxi driver came forward and told them he had picked up a “part-Aboriginal man” and a woman matching Graham’s description from the Malthouse Tavern on the night of September 27.
The driver said he had been parked at the taxi rank outside the pub when a man approached him and got in the passenger seat.
The driver described his passenger as a “casually dressed” and “well-spoken”, and claimed he directed him towards a woman who appeared drunk, sitting nearby behind the local service station.
The driver said the woman claimed to have hurt her ankle – he said he wasn’t sure if she was feigning or if was a real injury – and accepted a lift.
He said she was carrying two bottles of beer, and was wearing a white cardigan and a skirt when he dropped them at a house in Balga.
While he was unable to tell police which house he took them to, he said he did remember the man pulling the woman from the car and the exact fare he paid.
As detectives sought to check, verify and exclude all the claims surrounding the cars that evening, sorting fact from fiction was proving difficult.
“Extensive enquiries have failed to trace those vehicles or the persons referred to,” the police gazette said.
One thing police knew for sure is that Graham was not en route to her house when she left the pub that night.
Her home on Felpham Avenue was in the opposite direction of where her body had been found, making it more and more likely she had been in a car before her death.
But with all the car sightings seemingly leading to dead ends, detectives had to ask other questions. Had she noticed mid-drive they were not going in the direction of her house? Had she said something? What about the reports she got in an argument the night of her murder?
And why was her murder so similar to one that happened months earlier a few kilometres away?

News Corp HQ locked down as Lachlan Murdoch, Albanese make Holt St pilgrimage for Sky’s name change

News Corp HQ locked down as Lachlan Murdoch, Albanese make Holt St pilgrimage for Sky’s name change
In this week’s On Background, News Corp staff to make way for the unveiling of Sky News’ rebrand, Sharri Markson’s decision to steer clear of Pauline Hanson (for a time) is vindicated, and the ABC tries to find a new 7.30 boss.
Nothing to see here
In pre-modern Japan, ordinary people were often forbidden from looking their emperor in the eye. At times, he was said to hold audiences behind bamboo screens.
So it seems to be with Lachlan Murdoch – the heir to the Sun King – who is set to be on hand to open Sky News’ plush new Holt Street studios in Surry Hills (and announce the network’s new name!) on Friday afternoon.
On Thursday evening, Sky issued an “areas closure” notice to staff, telling those not invited to the august event, which will also be attended by the likes of Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and NSW Premier Chris Minns, to stay out.
They won’t be allowed access to the main foyer, cafe, or main stairwell from Thursday evening, all the way through until Friday night.
Organisers have also gone as far as disconnecting the cameras in the studio where the event will be held, so nobody can see in as they get ready for the big reveal. Or maybe it’s just to keep Lachie separate from the foot soldiers? Or is there insufficient catering?
It’s a total lockdown, with all of Friday’s on-air programming to be produced in Melbourne, instead.
Sky is, of course, being forced to rebrand after its naming licence holder, Comcast-owned British broadcaster Sky News, decided against renewing the latest decade-long deal that expires this year.
The name change is expected to come into effect in the middle of the year, but the company has chosen to kill two birds with one stone, and use the studios’ opening party for the big reveal, one day after the station turned 30.
A Sky spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.
Along with Murdoch, the event will be hosted by Sky News Australia chief executive and former newspaper editor Paul Whittaker, with News Corp Australia boss Michael Miller also in attendance. There are rumours of News Corp chief executive Robert Thomson jetting in, too.
Sky’s Sydney studios were previously in Macquarie Park, northern Sydney, but were relocated to News Corp’s long-term Holt Street offices near Central Station in December. The premises are also home to The Australian, news.com.au and The Daily Telegraph.
Sky Australia’s current licence deal was agreed while the British Sky News was still part-owned by News Corp.
One source with knowledge of the planned rebrand, who was not authorised to speak on the record, said in August that a proposal to rebrand Sky as Fox News Australia was rejected by New York HQ because of the latter’s polarising reputation Down Under, and the need for brand differentiation. The final decision needed ticking off by the company’s Avenue of the Americas offices, the source said.
There has since been suggestions the word “Australia” may also be excluded from the new name, to encourage the channel’s growing international audience to stick around.
Was Sharri right all along?
Here at On Background, we have something of a mea culpa to offer. It seems this column may have accidentally contributed to the inception of this week’s dominant political story.
Last week, we brought you the definitive numbers behind Sharri Markson’s prolonged snubbing of right-wing agitators One Nation amid an otherwise station wide love-in.
Maybe we struck a nerve, or maybe the bosses gave Markson a friendly nudge because on the very next show, last Monday, who appeared as the star guest? Pauline Hanson.
The move appears to have vindicated Sharri’s initial judgment, though, as Hanson proceeded to issue racially charged remarks about Muslims.
“You say, oh, well, there’s good Muslims out there,” Hanson said. “Well, I’m sorry, how can you tell me there are good Muslims?”
While the comments were hardly a surprise, considering the last time Markson hosted Hanson was after she wore a burqa into the Senate (for the second time), the latest comments were so bad that after the interview, the host took time to tell viewers “as an Australian Jew, I don’t support what Pauline Hanson just said”.
Ray Hadley, Markson’s next guest, urged the One Nation leader to apologise. Later, Matt Canavan did the same and even new One Nation recruit Barnaby Joyce didn’t back up Hanson’s words. Yikes.
Hanson partially walked back her comments on Wednesday before essentially retracting the quasi-apology.
“And I am not going to apologise … I will have my say now before it’s too late,” she said.
Pretty awful stuff all around. Good thing Sky doesn’t hold a grudge, though. Hanson was back on Sky on Wednesday night. And guess what? On Background has confirmed she and her One Nation crew even received an invitation to their big bash as well.
Markson was approached for comment.
Costello: Back in the game
A week is a long time in modern media, what with the 24-hour news cycle and all that.
But still, it’s been less than a year since former A Current Affair reporter Seb Costello exited Nine, following a review into how he ended up chasing a male interview subject into some women’s toilets, and he’s already back on his feet.
It was the second Nine exit for a Costello to make headlines in less than 12 months, after his father, former federal treasurer and then-company chairman Peter Costello stepped down days after an altercation with a reporter for The Australian at Canberra Airport.
Just six weeks after Daily Mail Australia announced a new column under his name, On Background can reveal Costello jnr has been appointed a senior reporter with rival outlet the Herald Sun.
Editor Sam Weir officially announced the appointment internally on Thursday after Costello’s byline began running in News Corp’s Melbourne tabloid last month as a freelancer. He’d already filed a front page story on Monday. But a leftover column from the man the Mail had dubbed “Melbourne’s ultimate insider” still went online at the digital publication a day later.
7.30 job hunt proves a hard slog
It has been more than two months since the ABC announced wunderkind former 7.30 chief Joel Tozer as the new executive producer of its flagship investigative program, Four Corners.
Tozer begins work on Four Corners on Monday. But the talk of the ABC is the fact they still haven’t managed to fill the top 7.30 job he’s set to vacate.
There is word the headhunting process has come up empty-handed so far. Commissioning editor of 7.30 Patricia Drum will be the show’s acting boss in the meantime.
The show has been a breeding ground for talent, on and off-air. The ABC’s current overall news boss Justin Stevens held the show’s executive producer gig before he was appointed to the top job in 2022.
Under Tozer, the show’s nightly average audience rose by 5 per cent to 789,000 in the 2025 financial year, and continues to rate well.
With host Sarah Ferguson not going anywhere and a newly minted political editor in Jacob Greber, it isn’t exactly a product a new boss could play around with.
An ABC spokesperson said: “This is an important role and the ABC is running a thorough and competitive process which is still ongoing, delayed slightly by the timing falling over summer and coverage of major news events.”
Siobhan McKenna, still a Mel-ebrity
Life is probably a lot quieter this year for Siobhan McKenna, Lachlan Murdoch’s former consigliere, fixer and general right hand.
She signed off from her various jobs running his private company Illyria last year, as well as her role as chief executive of broadcasting for News Corp Australia, which by the end mainly just meant being chair of Sky News. It is probably a relief she doesn’t have to attend any more Sky events, having been referred to by one friend as a “teal” with heavy Labor-links in a profile by this masthead in October.
But it seems McKenna still has time to stay connected. Victorian Premier Jacinta Allan’s diary entries show McKenna is one of a crack team of Mel-ebrities on the organising committee for this year’s Melbourne NFL Game. There is plenty of pressure to get the big game right, as only a lucky few cities are handed one by the powerhouse US football code to show off their stars abroad.
McKenna did not respond to a request for comment.
Alongside McKenna in the team, there is also Lord Mayor Nick Reece, AFL boss Andrew Dillon, Eddie McGuire (of course) and local Disney boss and Western Bulldogs president Kylie Watson-Wheeler among others.
Allan’s diaries also show News Corp’s Thomson still holds some love for his home state. He found time in December for a cup of tea with the premier alongside News Corp powerbroker and Rupert Murdoch’s niece, Penny Fowler, at the Herald & Weekly Times offices in Southbank.
As it is with News Corp, the pollies always come to them.

Plan to protect children from toxic metals erased from NSW government report

Plan to protect children from toxic metals erased from NSW government report
A draft proposal to relocate childcare centres, playgrounds and schools at high risk of toxic metal exposure was one of several recommendations removed from an independent report into lead contamination in Broken Hill, new documents reveal.
NSW Chief Scientist Hugh Durrant-Whyte on Thursday published his agency’s report into the health and environmental impacts of lead contamination in Broken Hill, the mining town 14 hours west of Sydney, built on one of the world’s largest deposits of silver, zinc and lead.
Durrant-Whyte said lowering dangerously high levels of lead in the blood of Broken Hill’s children was “an urgent public health priority”, after finding progress on the issue had slowed and many historical recommendations were yet to be implemented.
“The purpose of this report is not to delay progress but to realign current efforts toward minimising community exposure to lead, particularly in children,” he wrote. “The development window from birth to five years old is critical and delays in effective intervention risks irreversible impairment and potential lifelong complications to successive generations.”
Three of the seven recommendations initially proposed by Durrant-Whyte’s office did not make the final report, drafts of the document made public through a parliamentary call for papers reveal.
One of the recommendations, contained in an October draft, suggested developing a detailed map to “identify and visualise contamination hotspots”. This data could be used to guide planning decisions around remediation and possible relocation of high-risk facilities “such as childcare centres, schools and public play areas from zones of elevated lead exposure”.
In 2023, two of three preschools in the town had lead levels above the threshold for intervention, according to data published in the draft report.
A sixth recommendation, also removed from the final report, suggested conducting a cost-benefit analysis of dust-reduction strategies such as street sweepers and revegetation.
The final recommendation in the October draft proposed seeking additional funding from alternative government programs such as the Commonwealth’s Closing the Gap measures or the NSW social housing energy performance initiative.
Emails from March last year show funding for Broken Hill’s lead program was under strain. The program had fallen outside the priority projects being taken to the Expenditure Review Committee “as their allocation has been exhausted”.
In reply, one public servant warned it would be challenging for the community if the program were “not funded and momentum is lost”.
‘There’s virtually zero interest from the NSW government in the health and wellbeing of Aboriginal children in Broken Hill ... [It is] a waste of time really.’Richard Weston, chief executive of Maari Ma Health Aboriginal Corporation
Emails from November 6 show the Office of the Chief Scientist and Engineer (OCSE) invited bureaucrats from NSW Health, the NSW Environment Protection Authority (EPA), and the premier’s department to a confidential briefing the next week.
The bureaucrats were told the briefing would “not be open to editorial commentary” and only minor adjustments may occur before the final publication of the report.
The parliamentary documents include a November media request from the Herald asking the chief scientist when the report would be published, which was escalated to the premier’s department for approval.
The report was due to be submitted to the premier’s department and published in December but was not made public until Thursday, shortly after the Herald sent questions about the drafts and why the publication had been delayed by two months.
The OCSE declined to respond to questions, stating they did not comment on published reports.
A spokesperson for the premier’s department said they did not request changes to the report’s recommendations.
The department will now consider the chief scientist’s recommendations, including a $2.5 million proposal to conduct further investigations until December, the spokesperson said. “A response will be confirmed in due course.”
The government’s response to the issue has caused frustration in the town’s Indigenous community.
Durrant-Whyte’s report noted that Aboriginal children in Broken Hill were disproportionately affected by lead contamination, with much higher lead exposure risk compared to the general population.
Half of all government-owned homes for Indigenous families had high levels of lead, and 23 per cent were at very high risk from lead contamination, the report said.
Maari Ma Health Aboriginal Corporation chief executive Richard Weston said the Indigenous health service withdrew from the Broken Hill Environmental Lead Response Group in November in protest at the government’s inaction.
“There’s virtually zero interest from the NSW government in the health and wellbeing of Aboriginal children in Broken Hill,” Weston said. “[It is] a waste of time, really.”
An earlier draft from October said Broken Hill was a case study for what can happen with mining elsewhere, “including Mudgee”, where a new silver, zinc and lead mine was approved in 2023.
Greens MP Cate Faehrmann, who requested the documents, described the final report as “politically palatable” for Premier Chris Minns.
“The people of Broken Hill have the right to be very angry at the government,” she said. “They just refuse to do what’s necessary to keep the kids of Broken Hill safe.”

The Victorian town where home buyers splashed the most cash last year
By Emily Power
Mildura is more famous for oranges than auctions, but the city in Australia’s food bowl is the new epicentre of real estate spending.
The agricultural city, which also has a flourishing tourism and culinary scene, is the location where the most money was spent on houses in regional Victoria in the 12 months to last September, Cotality data shows.
The regional suburb of Mildura had 821 house sales, for a total transaction value of $418,459,341, according to the Cotality Best of the Best 2025 report.
The second most active and lucrative market was Torquay, which had 303 sales resulting in $389,022,040 worth of deals.
Also in the top five were Ocean Grove (352 sales, $388,189,982 total value), Shepparton (755 sales, $369,172,002 total value) and Warrnambool (545 sales, $345,491,388 total value).
Mildura’s low median and multi-pronged economy, across healthcare, farming, hospitality and tourism, has been a magnet for investors and owner-occupiers alike. “It’s really been a story about affordability and opportunity driving that particularly strong growth that we’ve seen,” Cotality’s head of research Gerard Burg says.
The border city also has one of Australia’s sunniest climates. Locals like to quip that it has more hours of blue sky than the Gold Coast. “Mildura is quite an attractive place to move to,” Burg says.
Mildura attracts foodies to establishments such as Stefano’s Restaurant, which consistently wins Good Food Guide accolades. But investors’ appetites are strong, too.
Cotality’s median rental yield in Melbourne is 3.6 per cent, compared to Mildura’s 4.7 per cent. “Investors who can get into the market at a lower value are getting a higher rate of return,” Burg says.
However, the federal government has not ruled out cutting the capital gains discount for investors, and the ongoing debate could affect confidence in markets such as Mildura. “The speculation at the minute that we could see a shift in the capital gains discounts for investors, and that sort of uncertainty might make people wary of buying,” Burg says.
Mildura is typical of the tree-change destinations that welcomed new residents during COVID, but limited stock has since sustained demand. “What we’ve seen over that period is a slowing trend in the number of houses or dwellings that have been listed for sale,” Burg says.
Average days on market in Mildura have also fallen from 30 days to about 20 days.
Mildura’s rise comes after fluctuations in previous reports. It had the fifth-highest total house transactions in regional Victoria in 2024, third in 2023, fell off the list in 2022, and was fifth in 2021.
Founder of One Agency Mildura, Mark Thornton, says when he launched his business in 2021, Mildura’s market was known for its consistency, but not large gains. That has changed. “In the last two years, we’ve seen nothing but extraordinary growth,” he says.
The median house value in Mildura has spiked 20.1 per cent over 12 months, according to Cotality.
Thornton says homes priced about $600,000 are most popular. Two years ago, he says those same properties were trading for about $150,000 less. “When I tell these home owners what their houses are worth, they are surprised.”
Town residents are using equity to upgrade to premium acreage on the outskirts, Thornton says.
Mildura’s performance indicates proximity to a capital city (it’s roughly 400 kilometres to Adelaide and 550 kilometres to Melbourne) is not essential. “We have a diversity of industry, projected population growth and an airport,” Thornton says. “We stand on our own two feet. People drive through hundreds of kilometres of nothing and then they get to Mildura, and it is like a big, green tourism oasis.”
While Mildura’s isolation plays in its favour, Torquay and Ocean Grove are “realistically commutable” for Melbourne workers, Burg explains. With seven-figure medians, these coastal havens are attracting aspirational buyers.
Tim Carson, director of Torquay-based McCartney Real Estate, has noticed home owners in Geelong’s growth corridor suburbs of Armstrong Creek and Warralily are upsizing in Torquay. “They are selling their homes for $600,000 to $900,000, and coming to Torquay to buy from $900,000 up to $1.2 million.”
There has been a knock-on effect, as those vendors pour their gain into a higher-end Torquay property, worth up to $1.5 million. “That’s where we’ve really seen growth,” Carson says.
Overall days on market have shortened, Carson says, but that is owner-occupier driven. Other segments have been stung by the state’s land and vacancy taxes. “Most of our buyers are definitely owner-occupier,” he says. “Investors and the holiday home people have gone out of the market, even though there is a shortage of rentals here and the yield is getting better.”

No good Muslims? Pauline Hanson has removed her racism fig leaf and mulched it

No good Muslims? Pauline Hanson has removed her racism fig leaf and mulched it
Until now, most commentary on the One Nation surge has been about the effect this would have on the Coalition. That’s fair enough given it’s overwhelmingly a story of Coalition voter flight, and it is therefore the Coalition that must respond. But we’ve thought less about the effect this might have on One Nation. It’s never been here before. And we’ve never seen how a pitched battle for conservative major party status might look.
This week, we might have had our first glimpse. It began on Monday night when Pauline Hanson asked rhetorically, incredulously, “I’m sorry, how can you tell me there are good Muslims?” She wasn’t sorry, of course. At least not until a couple of days later when – having previously dug in – she conceded she didn’t “genuinely believe” what she said. She cited at least one good Muslim: the non-practising Muslim woman who stood as a One Nation candidate. She apologised to certain kinds of good Muslims “if” they were “out there”, but somehow still did it defiantly: it’s the only apology I’ve encountered that includes the words “and I am not going to apologise”.
It’s true, this wasn’t a huge departure from what Hanson has always said. Going into the 2016 election, she’d called for a royal commission into Islam. A year later, she declared “Islam is a disease, we need to vaccinate ourselves against that.” Her maiden Senate speech dismissed the idea of embracing “good Muslims”: “How should we tell the difference? … How many lives will be lost or destroyed trying to determine who is good and who is bad?” With this in mind, she’s consistently called for an end to Muslim migration, though in 2007 she said she didn’t have a problem with “Christian Muslims”.
But note the (very) subtle difference. Until this point, Hanson hasn’t disputed the existence of “good Muslims” in theory. She’s argued they’re too hard to identify in practice, or reduced them to a literal contradiction in terms. But this week she just came out and said it: they don’t exist; every Muslim you see, hear from, hear about, is an enemy of Australia. She’s taken the fig leaf and mulched it.
Perhaps this was an accident. Perhaps Hanson suddenly found herself in the middle of a sentence she hadn’t intended to say, but was then committed. More likely, though, she felt perfectly ready to make this statement; to expand the frontiers of a sordid debate.
When Angus Taylor deposed Sussan Ley as Liberal leader last week, two things happened. A poll showed a bump in the Coalition vote at the expense of One Nation. And Taylor framed his leadership around stopping “bad migration”, which he would do by discriminating against applicants “based on values”. “No one will ever be as strong as One Nation on immigration,” retorted Hanson in a flash, challenging him to restrict immigration from “fundamentalist Islamic countries”. Then, on Monday, came a leaked Liberal immigration policy, ostensibly developed under Sussan Ley’s leadership, which sounded very much like a Trumpian version of doing exactly that: banning entry to anyone coming from nominated regions within 13 nations, including Palestine and Somalia, and instituting phone searches at the border to inspect people’s views.
Senior Liberals disowned it, and Taylor dismissed it. But in this sequence of events lurks the ghost of a bidding war. Taylor, clearly worried about One Nation as most Coalition members are, signals he’ll be tough on the politics of culture. Hanson goads the new Coalition leader to put up and declares herself tougher. Then, with the first sign of a modest Coalition recovery, she goes and proves it. If that’s close to the truth, the story is not merely about the possibility of the Coalition moving to the right. It’s about One Nation moving even further that way, too.
That is why what came next is so significant. “It’s just wrong and it’s insulting,” boomed Nationals senator for Queensland Matt Canavan, who will be competing directly with Hanson on the ballot. “There are 800,000 Muslims – most of them are great people. It’s a ridiculous statement; Pauline should just say sorry. Just own it and admit it.” Elsewhere, he called it “totally un-Australian”. “These remarks from One Nation are absolutely disgusting and outrageous,” echoed Liberal senator Andrew Bragg.
Then came the true thrust of the response. “It is these kinds of ill-disciplined comments that make people worry that Pauline just doesn’t have what it takes to lead a major party,” added Canavan. And then Bragg: “Leadership is not about bashing up on diverse groups in our community.” That is, they decided to draw a line. Then they used that line to sketch Hanson as a pretender, incapable of anything serious. In doing that, they got some version of a backdown.
That approach might just work. An intriguing survey this week showed that of those supporting One Nation, only 17 per cent nominated border control and reduced immigration as their motivation. The dominant reason, accounting for 36 per cent, is a “desire for an alternative” and a “rejection of the major parties”. That sketches more a protest vote than an affirmation of anything particular One Nation is selling. You might even say the appeal is aesthetic.
The Coalition can’t disrupt that aesthetic by being a facsimile of it. The disruption is to redraw Hanson as unserious, and to explain how that shows up in the policy that those flirting with One Nation aren’t focusing on. Not so much to disrespect her, as to respect yourself enough to know you shouldn’t be following her down burrows. That in doing so, you’ll eventually find one of them is dug all the way to the edge of a cliff. And if you’re not careful, the whole country might fall through it.

RSF siege of El Fasher in Sudan has ‘hallmarks of genocide’, UN mission finds

The siege and capture of the Sudanese city of El Fasher by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces group last October bore “the hallmarks of genocide”, a UN-mandated fact-finding mission has said.
In a report detailing the harrowing 18-month occupation of the capital of North Darfur, investigators concluded that the RSF and allied militias deliberately inflicted conditions calculated to bring about the physical destruction of the Zaghawa and Fur ethnic communities.
“The scale, coordination, and public endorsement of the operation by senior RSF leadership demonstrate that the crimes committed in and around El Fasher were not random excesses of war,” said Mohamed Chande Othman, the mission’s chair, who called for a thorough investigation of the perpetrators.
The report was published a day after the UK, Canada and the European Union denounced possible war crimes and crimes against humanity in Sudan during the nearly three-year war.
Its release coincides with the latest wave of drone strikes that have left dozens dead across Sudan’s Kordofan region, an area where the UN has consistently said that grave abuses are taking place.
Unicef said at least 15 children were killed this week when a drone struck a displacement camp in West Kordofan. Local rights defenders reported that another strike on a market in nearby North Kordofan left 28 people dead. Blame for the West Kordofan attack has been directed at the Sudanese army; while the RSF has been accused of carrying out the strike in North Kordofan.
Since April 2023, the RSF has been waging war against the army after a falling out between its commander, Muhammad Hamdan Dagalo, and the army chief, Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, former allies who came to power after the 2019 Sudanese revolution ousted longtime dictator Omar al-Bashir.
The RSF has been backed by the United Arab Emirates, a position the Gulf state denies despite evidence compiled by the UN, independent experts and reporters.
The group grew out of the Janjaweed militias, notorious for atrocities committed in the early 2000s in a ruthless campaign in Darfur that killed 300,000 people and drove 2.7 million from their homes.
The war, the latest crisis in Sudan’s history of violence, has forced 11 million people to flee their homes and killed tens of thousands, triggering what the UN calls one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises.
The fact-finding report said that after the seizure of El Fasher, the RSF inflicted “three days of absolute horror” and that thousands of people, particularly from the Zaghawa ethnic group, were killed, raped or disappeared.
Othman said: “The scale, coordination and public endorsement of the operation by senior RSF leadership demonstrate that the crimes committed in and around El Fasher were not random excesses of war. They formed part of a planned and organised operation that bears the defining characteristics of genocide.”
Investigators said RSF militiamen had acted with impunity and “with genocidal intent” and that as conflict’s focus shifts from Darfur to Kordofan, outside countries must act decisively to hold perpetrators to account “and bring an end to this senseless violence”.
The mission interviewed 320 witnesses and victims from El Fasher and the surrounding areas, including in investigative visits to Chad and South Sudan. It authenticated, verified and corroborated 25 videos.
The report documents widespread sexual violence against girls and women aged seven to 70, including those who were pregnant. Survivors said they were attacked in front of family members, with the assaults often involving severe physical abuse.
In one incident, a 12-year-old girl was raped by three RSF fighters as her mother watched, moments after her father was killed while trying to shield her. The girl later died from her injuries.
According to the findings, such assaults frequently occurred at the same locations where mass killings had taken place, including El Saudi hospital and El Fasher University. Witnesses said RSF fighters also carried out public gang rapes of at least 19 women in rooms strewn with corpses, among them the bodies of the victims’ husbands.
On Thursday the US announced that it was placing sanctions on three RSF commanders over their roles in the siege and capture of El Fasher. The US Treasury said the RSF had carried out “ethnic killings, torture, starvation, and sexual violence” in the operation.

Les Wexner: How the billionaire enabled Jeffrey Epstein’s rise
Former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak received Wexner Foundation funds. Years later, he partnered with convicted US sex offender Epstein.
In a closed-door session at his Ohio home on Wednesday, billionaire Leslie Wexner faced mounting questions from United States lawmakers about Jeffrey Epstein’s rise to wealth and influence – and the role he may have played in that ascent.
Five members of the House Oversight Committee had travelled to depose the 88-year-old after Democrats subpoenaed him in the wake of the latest US Department of Justice release tied to Epstein.

The latest tranche of documents, published by the Justice Department on January 30, 2026, is part of a vast wealth of materials amassed during federal investigations into Epstein, who pleaded guilty in 2008 to procuring a minor for prostitution and was later charged in 2019 with sex trafficking of minors before his death by suicide in federal custody. Wexner’s name appears, both redacted and unredacted, on communications and financial documents within these files.
“I was naive, foolish, and gullible to put any trust in Jeffrey Epstein,” Wexner said in a statement. “He was a con man. And while I was conned, I have done nothing wrong and have nothing to hide.”
For decades, Epstein cultivated relationships with business leaders, politicians and academics.
Central among them was Wexner, the founder of L Brands, the retail empire behind Victoria’s Secret, Bath & Body Works and The Limited, whose fortune helped build the foundations for Epstein’s access to global elites, including former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak.
The newly released files shed fresh light on how deeply Epstein embedded himself within Wexner’s financial and philanthropic world, a relationship that proved pivotal in transforming him from an obscure money manager into a figure of extraordinary wealth and influence.
Epstein and Wexner’s townhouse
Epstein was introduced to Wexner in the mid-1980s. At the time, Epstein was a college dropout who had briefly taught at Manhattan’s elite Dalton School after reportedly exaggerating his academic credentials. He had passed through Bear Stearns under executive Alan “Ace” Greenberg before leaving to set up his own advisory firm.
By 1986, he had met Wexner. Five years later, the retail billionaire had granted him full power of attorney, an extraordinary delegation allowing Epstein to sign cheques, hire staff, borrow money, and buy or sell property on Wexner’s behalf.
Al Jazeera has reviewed newly released Justice Department records, including a 1998 purchase and sale agreement and related promissory note and guaranty, which detail the mechanics of asset transfers between the two men.
The documents show how control of Wexner’s Manhattan townhouse at 9 East 71st Street was formalised through a structured transaction involving a $10m promissory note and a personal guaranty signed by Epstein. The property became Epstein’s New York base and a symbol of his growing stature.
By the early 1990s, Epstein was embedded in Wexner’s philanthropic and corporate world, serving as a trustee of the Wexner Foundation and as the president of Wexner-affiliated property companies. In 1996, he relocated his firm to the US Virgin Islands, positioning himself as an offshore financier.
The authority Wexner granted him over assets, philanthropy and property did more than elevate his status socially. It conferred institutional legitimacy. With control over substantial wealth and formal roles inside a major foundation, Epstein could present himself as a financier with access to capital and global networks.
The Wexner Foundation and the Israel connection
One of the clearest through-lines from that period runs to former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, who was introduced to Epstein by former Israeli President Shimon Peres at a large event in Washington in 2003.
Between 2004 and 2006, the Wexner Foundation paid Barak approximately $2.3m for two commissioned research studies, one on leadership and another on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The foundation later said only one paper was completed, but determined that the work justified the payment.
Barak, who served as Israel’s prime minister from 1999 to 2001 and later as defence minister from 2007 to 2013, maintained contact with Epstein for several years.
A court filing included in the newly released Epstein records contains an allegation that prominent victim Virginia Giuffre claimed that Wexner and Barak were two of the men Epstein trafficked her to.
The filing does not provide supporting evidence for the claim. Neither man has been charged with wrongdoing in connection with Epstein.
In February this year, Barak told Israel’s Channel 12 he had been unaware of the full scope of Epstein’s crimes and regretted ever meeting the financier.
Wexner has said he severed ties with Epstein around 2007 after he discovered the financier had “misappropriated vast sums of money from me and my family”.
But the financial and institutional credibility Epstein accumulated during his years managing Wexner’s wealth did not evaporate when that relationship ended.
Epstein ‘editing’ Barak’s op-ed
Even after his relationship allegedly ended with Wexner, Epstein now had the social prestige, and money, to develop ties with powerful decision-makers, emails newly released by the Justice Department and reviewed by Al Jazeera show.
In October 2014, Nili Priel Barak – Barak’s wife – wrote to Epstein about travel plans to New York, suggesting dates when Ehud Barak would be in town and asking whether he would be available to meet.
Days later, she forwarded him a draft opinion piece, writing: “Herewith the Op Ed. Please let me know your opinion and your remarks. Thanks.”
Epstein replied with what he labelled “beginning edits”, returning a version of the unpublished article. The draft speaks in Barak’s political voice, including the line: “As the Minister of Defence of Israel I’ve met more than once with [US] President [Barack] Obama…” and lays out arguments about the “two states solution” versus a “one state solution”.
A year later, in 2015, Epstein invested in Reporty Homeland Security, later rebranded as Carbyne, a startup chaired by Ehud Barak that developed advanced emergency communications technology – further tying their political relationship to a shared commercial venture.
The company’s leadership included CEO Amir Elichai, a former special forces officer, and director Pinhas Buchris, a former Israeli Defence Ministry director-general and former commander of Unit 8200, the Israeli military’s cyber intelligence unit.
Between 2012 and 2014, documents reportedly indicate Epstein also assisted Barak in exploring security-related business with African world leaders. The documents illustrate how Epstein managed to convert financial credibility into political access, and then reinforced those relationships through shared commercial ventures.
Barak has said: “I am responsible for all my actions and decisions. There is room to question whether I should have investigated more thoroughly. I regret not doing so.”
Wexner has never been charged with any crime and has said he was unaware of Epstein’s criminal conduct. But his name appears repeatedly throughout the newly released files, a reminder of how central their relationship once was.

Gaza relief funds, troops pledged at inaugural Board of Peace meeting

U.S. President Donald Trump said Thursday at the inaugural meeting of the Board of Peace that nine participating members have committed a combined $7 billion for a relief initiative in Gaza and five nations have pledged to contribute troops to an international stabilization force aimed at supporting the war-battered Palestinian territory.
In a flurry of announcements at the end of a long, meandering speech to representatives from nearly 50 nations, Trump said the United States will contribute $10 billion to the Board of Peace. He didn't specify what the money would be used for. It was also not clear where the U.S. money would come from – a sizable pledge that would need to be authorized by Congress.
The Board of Peace includes Israel but not Palestinian representatives.
Indonesia, Morocco, Kazakhstan, Kosovo and Albania have pledged to send troops for a Gaza stabilization force, while Egypt and Jordan have committed to train police. Troops will initially be deployed to Rafah, a major population center where the U.S. administration hopes to first focus reconstruction efforts.
The countries making pledges are Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Morocco, Bahrain, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Uzbekistan and Kuwait, Trump said.
Trump said FIFA will raise $75 million for soccer-related projects in Gaza and that the United Nations will chip in $2 billion for humanitarian assistance.
"Every dollar spent is an investment in stability and the hope of new and harmonious (region)," Trump said in thanking the donors. He added, "The Board of Peace is showing how a better future can be built right here in this room."
The dollars pledged, while significant, represent a small fraction of the estimated $70 billion needed to rebuild the Palestinian territory decimated after two years of Israel's genocidal war.
Maj. Gen. Jasper Jeffers, the leader of the newly created International Stabilization Force, said the plans call for 12,000 police and 20,000 soldiers for Gaza. Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto announced his country would contribute up to 8,000 troops to the force.
"With these first steps, we help bring the security that Gaza needs for a future of prosperity and enduring peace," Jeffers said.
The board was initiated as part of Trump's 20-point peace plan to end the conflict in Gaza.
But since the October cease-fire, Trump's vision for the board has morphed and he wants it to have an even more ambitious remit – one that will not only complete the Herculean task of bringing lasting peace between Israel and the Palestinian resistance group Hamas but will also help resolve conflicts around the globe.
But the Gaza cease-fire deal remains fragile and Trump's expanded vision for the board has triggered fears the U.S. president is looking to create a rival to the United Nations.
Trump, pushing back against the criticism, said the creation of his board would help make the U.N. viable in the future.
"Someday I won't be here. The United Nations will be," Trump said. "I think it is going to be much stronger, and the Board of Peace is going to almost be looking over the United Nations and making sure it runs properly."
Even as Trump spoke of the gathering as a triumph that would help bring a more persistent peace to the Middle East, he sent new warnings to Iran.
Tensions are high between the United States and Iran as Trump has ordered one of the largest U.S. military buildups in the region in decades.
One aircraft carrier group is already in the region and another is on the way. Trump has warned Tehran it will face American military action if it does not denuclearize, give up ballistic missiles and halt funding to extremist groups.
Trump said he should know in 10 days whether a deal is possible to end a standoff with Tehran.
"We have to make a meaningful deal. Otherwise, bad things happen," he said.
Nearly 50 countries and the European Union sent officials to Thursday's meeting. Germany, Italy, Norway, Switzerland and the United Kingdom are among more than a dozen countries that have not joined the board, but that took part as observers.
Most countries sent high-level officials, but a few leaders – including Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto, Argentine President Javier Milei and Hungarian President Viktor Orban – traveled to Washington for the gathering.
"Almost everybody's accepted, and the ones that haven't, will be," Trump offered. "And some are playing a little cute – it doesn't work. You can't play cute with me."
The U.N. Security Council held a high-level meeting on Wednesday on the cease-fire deal and Israel's efforts to expand control in the occupied West Bank.
The U.N. session in New York was originally scheduled for Thursday but was moved up after Trump announced the board's meeting for the same date and it became clear that it would complicate travel plans for diplomats planning to attend both.
Vatican Secretary of State Cardinal Pietro Parolin told reporters earlier this week that "at the international level it should above all be the U.N. that manages these crisis situations."
Official after official used their speaking turns to heap praise on Trump for his ability to end conflicts around the world. Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif called him the "savior of South Asia," while others said that years of U.S. foreign policy efforts by his predecessor failed to do what Trump has done in the past year.
Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said Trump and others gathered for the meeting deserved thanks for their collective efforts on Gaza. But Fidan, who said Türkiye was also prepared to contribute troops to the stabilization force, cautioned that the situation remains precarious.
"The humanitarian situation remains fragile and cease-fire violations continue to occur," Fidan said. "A prompt, coordinated and effective response is therefore essential."
Fidan said President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan "remains fully" committed to ensuring the stability of Gaza, while noting that Türkiye could offer significant support in rebuilding the enclave's health and education sectors, as well as training a new police force.
Secretary of State Marco Rubio acknowledged there is a "long ways to go" in Gaza.
"There's a lot of work that remains that will require the contribution of every nation state represented here today," Rubio added.
In Gaza, Hamas spokesperson Hazem Qassem said any international force must "monitor the cease-fire and prevent the (Israeli) occupation from continuing its aggression."
Hamas says it is ready to hand over to a U.S.-backed committee of Palestinian technocrats led by Ali Shaath.
Nickolay Mladenov, a Bulgarian with a senior role in the Board of Peace, said at the meeting that 2,000 Palestinians have applied to join a new transitional Palestinian police force.

No, this video does not prove Israel used a thermobaric bomb in Gaza
Social media users have shared footage of a spectacular explosion that they claim proves the Israeli military is using a highly lethal new weapon in Gaza: a thermobaric bomb. However, the footage has been taken out of context; it actually depicts a conventional explosion.
A spectacular shockwave followed by a massive plume of black smoke. A video viewed more than 8 million times on X reportedly reveals Israel's use of "thermobaric and pressure bombs" in Gaza. The post was shared by China Pulse, a pro-Beijing account which was recently flagged for spreading disinformation.
"These bombs, which burn at a temperature of 3,500 degrees Celsius, are capable of killing thousands in seconds, leaving no trace," the post reads.

Controlled explosion
The FRANCE 24 Observers team had already worked on this video in November 2025. At the time, online users were claiming that the video was showing the explosion of a "miniature nuclear bomb" in Gaza.
Our team spoke with several experts and found that the footage actually shows a controlled ground-level explosion using conventional explosives to destroy a tunnel dug by Hamas.
As for the recent allegations, Trevor Ball, a conflict researcher with the online investigative site Bellingcat, said on X that "there's nothing that indicates this is thermobaric".
‘Conventional explosive device’
Gilles Denglos, an explosives expert accredited by the French courts, told our team that the video likely shows a conventional explosive device. "Social media users are talking nonsense. A thermobaric bomb is designed to detonate above the ground, not on it." Denglos said the video shows the explosion of "a significant charge on the ground".
Another weapons expert who spoke to our team on the condition of anonymity also said that the spectacular shockwave visible in the video was the result of a "completely conventional" explosion:
"This phenomenon is a ‘Wilson cloud’: a condensation cloud that can occur when the shockwave from an explosion passes through humid air. This effect occurs regardless of the specific type of explosive used."
The expert further explained: "Thermobaric bombs are weapons whose lethality stems from the combined impact of heat and overpressure [Editor’s note: the bomb’s heat and the resulting shockwave]. This distinguishes them from munitions whose lethality relies on flying metallic fragments, such as conventional high-explosive shells or defensive grenades."
Al Jazeera investigation on Israeli bombs
These allegations against Israel come in the wake of an Al Jazeera investigation published on February 10, which claims the Israeli forces deployed “thermal” and "thermobaric" weapons in Gaza. According to the report, the intensity of the strikes "made thousands of Palestinians evaporate".
The investigation indicates that the Civil Defence agency in Gaza, which operates as a rescue force under Hamas authorities, has documented 2,842 Palestinians who have "evaporated" since the war began.
However, the Israeli military's alleged use of thermobaric bombs in Gaza remains a subject of debate.
According to the fact-checking outlet Snopes, which reviewed Al Jazeera’s investigation, it is currently impossible to independently verify the use of such weapons based on the information available at this stage.
We spoke to Michael Shurkin, programme director at the US consulting firm 14 North Strategies, who said the specific model of thermobaric weapons that could be available to the Israeli military for its bombing operations remains unknown. "There is no evidence that the Israeli army has used thermobaric weapons in Gaza. They may have, or they may not have; Al Jazeera provides no concrete proof," Shurkin told us.
In this investigation, Al Jazeera identifies several types of bombs used by the Israeli army: MK-84 900kg bombs, BLU-109 bunker busters, and GBU-39 glide bombs. According to official military specifications, none of these models currently in the Israeli arsenal are equipped with thermobaric explosives, Trevor Ball indicated on X.
"The aerial bombs mentioned in the Al Jazeera article are all loaded with aluminised explosives – compositions where the addition of aluminium enhances the blast effect by raising the temperature of the resulting combustion gases. However, the use of aluminium is extremely common in explosive devices for artillery, aerial bombs, and naval munitions," noted the weapons expert.
Due to their sheer power, these bombs are indeed capable of disintegrating bodies. However, this is a "common effect" of aerial bombs and not exclusive to thermobaric weapons, the expert said. Nevertheless, Amnesty International has denounced the Israeli military's use of MK-84 bombs in "deliberate" or "indiscriminate" strikes on residential areas and civilian infrastructure in Gaza as a violation of international law.
According to figures released by the Palestinian Ministry of Health and accepted by the Israeli army, 72,045 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza as of January 29.

Appointment of Antonia Romeo as head of civil service shows ‘poor judgment’, say former colleagues

Keir Starmer’s decision to appoint Antonia Romeo as the country’s most senior civil servant has prompted dismay among former colleagues who complained about what they considered bullying behaviour when she was a diplomat in New York.
Several people who worked with Romeo at the New York consulate nearly 10 years ago have told the Guardian they are upset by the prime minister’s decision to make her cabinet secretary despite knowing about their complaints.
The allegations from several colleagues were made as part of one formal complaint against Romeo in 2017. That complaint was investigated by a senior diplomat who found that she had a case to answer, but was then dismissed by her line managers at the Cabinet Office, who gave her the all clear.
The complaint has resurfaced in recent days after Simon McDonald, the former lead civil servant at the Foreign Office, urged the prime minister to do more due diligence before making his decision. Starmer put aside those objections on Thursday when he confirmed Romeo’s appointment, making her the first ever female cabinet secretary.
One former complainant said: “It is pretty extraordinary but not exactly out of character for the current No 10. It is just another example of poor judgment, and the elevation of those with questionable integrity despite the concerns raised by ordinary people.”
Another said: “There is a real risk this comes back to bite the prime minister. The many people she bullied and intimidated, most of them women, will now feel failed for a second time. It’s not a good look for the civil service or the government.”
A third complainant said: “Taking shortcuts to make appointments based on special treatment instead of merit and due diligence has already created chaos. This is an indication that problematic leadership decisions will persist.”
Government sources have insisted that the allegations against Romeo should not be counted against her given they are 10 years old and were dismissed at the time by the Cabinet Office.
Starmer defended his decision on Thursday, calling Romeo “an outstanding public servant, with a 25‑year record of delivering for the British people”.
He added: “Antonia has shown she is the right person to drive the government to reform and I look forward to working with her to deliver this period of national renewal.”
Romeo said it was a “huge privilege” to become the head of the civil service.
“The civil service is a great and remarkable institution, which I love,” she said. “We should be known for delivery, efficiency and innovation, working to implement the government’s agenda and meet the challenges the country faces.”
Romeo’s supporters say she is dynamic and willing to break civil service conventions to achieve the government’s goals.
But her critics say she is more focused on promoting herself than the government she works for and that her impatience at more junior staff has sometimes tipped over into bullying.
According to the complaint made in 2017, Romeo told several colleagues she would end or damage their careers after disagreements in the normal course of work.
One allegation says Romeo warned that the refusal by a junior member of staff to comply with a particular request was a “career-limiting move” and “would only happen once”.
Another who disagreed with one of Romeo’s ideas said Romeo told her she “would make sure [that person’s] reputation and career in London suffered”.
Other allegations included in the complaint concerned her financial affairs. They included her decision to get Farrow & Ball to provide more than $100,000 (£74,000) worth of paint to redecorate her residence in return for free publicity, as well as a $250 (£186) expense claim for a taxi to a football match.
The allegations, which were part of one complaint, were all investigated at the time by Tim Hitchens, a former ambassador to Japan, who was flown in to conduct a week-long review.
Hitchens found that she had a case to answer on her management style, but not on her financial affairs. His finding was overturned by the Cabinet Office however, which said she had no case to answer.
Three complainants from the time have contacted the Cabinet Office in recent weeks to raise concerns about her previous behaviour.
Downing Street insisted on Thursday that full vetting had taken place on a previous occasion when she was considered for the job. No 10 said it had consulted the civil service commissioner, Gisela Stuart, who said the full process did not need to be re-run.

Uzbek Mining Giant Defends $200M in Tenders to Secretive Firms, Silent on Other OCCRP Findings

A major state-owned company in Uzbekistan has defended the more than $200 million in tenders it awarded to foreign companies that OCCRP found included firms with proxy owners, financial filings that falsely declared they were dormant, and procurement contracts featuring signatures of people who deny signing them.
The statement issued this week by Almalyk Mining Metallurgical Complex (AMMC) follows a joint investigation by OCCRP and Finance Uncovered revealing that in several cases these foreign firms competed against one another for AMMC tenders despite being under common control – and had their true beneficiaries hidden behind apparent straw owners.
AMMC, often described as a “crown jewel” of the Uzbek economy, said in a statement Wednesday that all cited tenders were awarded to the lowest bidder through an automated government procurement system.
“The winners of the tenders/competitions delivered goods in full – in compliance with the quality indicators stipulated in the contract, and, most importantly, within the timeframes specified in the contract – to the plant's warehouses,” the company said, adding that it had conducted an internal probe.
AMMC did not respond to previous questions from OCCRP and Finance Uncovered regarding contracts worth more than $7 million awarded to two U.K.-registered firms, Lemixton Solutions Ltd and Golders Business Ltd, that feature electronic signatures of accounting associates who deny signing the documents. One of them has since reported the matter to British authorities.
The two firms collectively received over $35 million in tenders and sent dozens of shipments of goods to the Uzbek mining giant despite U.K. financial filings stating they were dormant, OCCRP revealed.
The investigation found both firms were under common control but competed against one another for the same AMMC tenders.
Similar patterns were identified in Georgia, where firms that had won tens of millions of dollars in AMMC tenders were purchased for a nominal amount by a South Korean medical coordinator with Uzbek roots and no apparent experience in the mining sector.
Like the U.K.-based tender winners, the Georgian firms did not indicate any economic activity in financial filings during the period in which they were awarded the tenders.
A representative for the U.K. companies said that a single individual controlled both of the firms. The Uzbek, Colombian, and Georgian figures identified in the report did not respond to inquiries or declined to comment.
The findings raise questions about transparency and oversight in one of Uzbekistan’s key industrial sectors, though AMMC maintains that all procurement processes complied with internal and legal requirements.

WASHINGTON, February 19. /TASS/. US President Donald Trump extended for one year certain sanctions introduced earlier against Russia in connection with the situation in Ukraine, according to the notice posted on the Federal Register, the daily journal of the US government.
The document refers to restrictions against Russia introduced in executive orders of the US President in February 2022, September 2018, and March and December 2014 in respect of Crimea. All these restrictive measures "must continue in effect beyond March 6, 2026," Trump said.
"The actions and policies addressed in these Executive Orders continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States," the US leader said. "Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13660," Trump added.

DOHA, February 19. /TASS/. Russian tennis star Andrey Rublev cleared the quarterfinals round of the 2025 Qatar Open tennis tournament in Doha on Thursday, defeating Stefanos Tsistipas of Greece.
The 5th-seeded Rublev, who is playing under a neutral status at the tournament, outplayed his Greek opponent 6-3; 7-6 (7-2). In the semifinals, he awaits the winner of the quarterfinals duel between his countryman Karen Khachanov (7th-seeded) and top-seed Carlos Alcaraz of Spain.
Rublev, 28, is currently ranked 14th in the ATP Rankings list. He has won 17 career ATP singles tournament titles and four more in men’s doubles. Rublev has never made it past the quarterfinals in any Grand Slam.
The Russian tennis player took home the gold at the 2020 Summer Olympic Games in Tokyo in mixed doubles (with teammate Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova) and also won the 2021 Davis Cup as part of the Russian national team.
The 2026 Qatar Open Tennis tournament is an ATP-500 event on the organization’s calendar which takes place at the Khalifa International Tennis and Squash complex in Doha, Qatar, between February 16 and 21. The tournament is played on outdoor hard courts. Rublev is the reigning champion.
Russian and Belarusian players’ neutral status at tennis tournaments
On February 28, 2022, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) issued recommendations to international sports federations to bar athletes from Russia and Belarus from taking part in international tournaments, citing Moscow's special military operation in Ukraine as the reason.
Following the IOC's recommendations in late February 2022, the majority of global sports federations moved to exclude athletes from Russia and Belarus from all international sports tournaments.
The International Tennis Federation (ITF) ruled on March 1, 2022, to suspend the membership of the Russian and Belarusian national tennis federations while also canceling all previously scheduled tennis tournaments in the two countries.
On March 14, 2022, the ITF also confirmed its prohibition on the Russian and Belarusian national tennis teams from participating in the 2022 Davis Cup and the 2022 Billie Jean King Cup.

US President Donald Trump has said that it would soon become clear whether a deal with Iran is possible, warning that Washington may be forced to escalate if negotiations fall short.
"We may have to take it a step further, or we may not," he said at the inaugural meeting of the Board of Peace in Washington on Thursday, adding that the situation would likely become clearer "over the next probably 10 days."
Trump said his envoys, Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, built a solid working relationship with Iranian representatives and talks were progressing well.
"Iran is a hotspot right now, and they're meeting, and they have a good relationship with the representatives of Iran," he said. "Good talks are being had."
US Vice President JD Vance described talks in Geneva on Tuesday as productive "in some ways," but said Iran was "not yet willing" to engage on Trump's "red lines." Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi called the atmosphere "more constructive."
Trump acknowledged that reaching a "meaningful agreement" with Tehran had historically proven difficult.
"It's proven to be, over the years, not easy to make a meaningful deal with Iran," he said. "We have to make a meaningful deal. Otherwise, bad things happen."
He urged Tehran to seize the moment. "Now is the time for Iran to join us on a path that will complete what we're doing," said Trump. "If they join us, that'll be great. If they don't join us, that'll be great too, but it'll be a very different path."
The president said Iran "cannot continue to threaten the stability of the entire region" and must reach an agreement.
The remarks come as Washington has deployed the USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group to the region, with the USS Gerald R. Ford aircraft carrier also on its way, alongside additional fighter jets.

Jordan Stolz Wins His Third Olympic Medal. In a Surprise Twist, It’s Not Gold

The upset of the Olympics has gone down.
Hold the phone, just a little, on Jordan Stolz.
And say hello to Ning Zhongyan.
The speedskater from China set a new Olympic record in the 1,500-m competition on Wednesday, crossing the finish in 1 min., 41.98 sec. at the Milan Speed Skating Oval. American Jordan Stolz, 21, already a double Olympic champion at these Games and the overwhelming favorite to win this distance, had his shot to best Zhongyan in the final pairing. He’d already set two Olympic records here in Milan. What’s one more?
Skating alongside the reigning 1,500-m world champion, Norway’s Peder Kongshaug—Stolz was recovering from pneumonia at that 2025 race and still finished second—Stolz was 0.37 sec. behind at 300 m. We’d seen Stolz fall behind the pace at the start of the 1,000-m race too, which he won on Feb. 11. “He wins on the speed and on the kick,” Joey Cheek, the 500-m Olympic champion in 2006, told TIME before the race. “No one has the speed and the kick. He's so physically strong, he can absorb so much workload. These are just a set of traits that don't exist in a single person.”

So no cause for major concern. But at 700 m, with two laps to go, Stolz lost even more time. He was now nearly a full second behind Zhongyan. With one lap to go, Stolz bled more time: he was now 1.35 sec. off the pace. Stolz is the best finisher in his sport. But this gap was just too wide. He now was sitting fourth. Off the podium.
Which seemed impossible. Stolz put on his burners in the last lap and crossed the line with a medal: a silver, never anything to sniff at. He finished .77 sec. behind Zhongyan. As Zhongyan raised his arms and took his victory lap holding the Chinese flag, Stolz bowed his head. He was exhausted, using all his kick to salvage a medal. Zhongyan shed joyous tears.
“When Jordan was skating in the last pair, I still did not think the gold was mine,” said Zhongyan after his win. “He has been in incredible form all season. Even after he crossed the line, I was still not completely sure. It was only when the result was confirmed that it started to sink in. It is an amazing feeling.”
No doubt, Stolz’s silver stalls his storyline’s momentum. As with a Summer Olympics counterpart—says, Michael Phelps—Stolz’s quest for perfection, stretched across multiple races at the Games, was catnip for NBC, and even casual fans of a niche sport like speedskating. Will he or won’t he become just the second male speedskater in history to win four golds at an Olympics, with American Eric Heiden, who won five in 1980, being the only other? (Heiden has been on hand in Milan, cheering on his fellow Wisconsinite.)

Cheek thought that more than the 500 m, or the 1,000 m, Stolz was a safe bet in the 1,500 m. He is a two-time world champion and the reigning back-to-back World Cup champion in the distance. Going into the Games, he had won eight of nine 1,500-m World Cup races, battling that case of pneumonia in his only loss.
“I think he’s going to do it,” Cheek, an NBC speedskating commentator, told TIME a few hours before Thursday’s race. “I think it would take a meteor strike for him not to.”
That meteor, it turns out, was Zhongyan, one of China’s opening-ceremonies flag bearers at these Olympics. Zhongyan, 26, won his third medal of the Games, as he finished third in the 1000-m competition and the team pursuit. Zhongyan had also won the 2024 1000-m sprint world title, becoming the first male Chinese speedskater to ever do so. He’s not some unknown. But smashing the Olympic record, and besting Stolz, counts as a stunner.
Stolz is not done. With a win in Saturday's mass start, in which 24 athletes skate 16 laps to decide the winner, Stolz would be the first male speedskater to win three golds at a single Olympics since Johann Olav Koss of Norway did it at his home Lillehammer Olympics in 1994. Zhongyan, however, is set to join Stolz on the starting line.
Look out for the meteor.

The Cornish village where it has rained every day this year
Cardinham has experienced 50 consecutive days of rain as the deluge continues to drench Britain

A village in Cornwall has experienced a 50-day spell of rain and has already received more rainfall in February than it typically would over the whole month.
Cardinham, near Bodmin, has not had a dry day since 30 December, and has endured 441.4mm of rain since the beginning of the year, according to the Met Office. However, the village is still short of its record from 2000, when it experienced 72 consecutive days of rain.
The UK has been continuously battered by unsettled weather this winter, with Storm Pedro bringing more ice and rain across the country just this week.
Met Office spokesperson Grahame Madge said the south-west region of England has had particularly high levels of rainfall due to several low-pressure systems coming towards the UK.
“There’s been a blocking area of high pressure over Scandinavia for much of winter, which has meant that because that air is very cold and very dense, it’s hard to budge,” said Mr Madge. “So these low-pressure storms have been coming across the Atlantic with nowhere to go. They’ve run into this immovable block, and that means that they’ve been depositing more rainfall across areas of the UK because they can’t move any farther because of that blocking area of high pressure.”
Mr Madge said Cardinham was still forecast to have rain in the coming days, but the bad weather could soon ease as conditions begin to settle. “We’ve still got an unsettled picture,” he said. “The forecast has moderated a little bit in that we are getting periods of more settled conditions in between the pulses of rain.”
The UK’s rain deluge gave Northern Ireland its wettest January on record after it experienced 70 per cent more rainfall than the long-term average. Southwest England and the east of Scotland also had among their wettest Januaries on record.
Currently, the Environment Agency has 67 flood warnings in place for England, where flooding is expected, and 169 flood alerts, where flooding is possible. The UK Health Security Agency has issued a cold health alert for the East Midlands, eastern England, North East, North West, West Midlands, Yorkshire and the Humber, and the South West until Friday evening.
Met Office weather forecast for the week
Thursday
Cloud for most, with early rain or showers in the north and east. Some clear spells elsewhere before strengthening winds bring heavy rain into Northern Ireland and western Scotland later. Turning chilly where skies remain clear, but staying frost-free.
Friday
A chilly start. Outbreaks of rain moving eastwards through the morning. A brighter afternoon, with heavy and blustery showers for many. Winds freshening and turning milder from the West.
Outlook for Saturday to Monday
Much milder but often cloudy with rain or drizzle, heaviest in the west, with brighter spells at times. Sunday stays unsettled with rain. Monday briefly brighter before further rain spreads in later.

Carried an injury, but returned to Gaza: Paratrooper laid to rest after fatal friendly fire

More than 1,000 friends, relatives and acquaintances gathered Thursday at the cemetery in Moshav Hayogev in northern Israel’s Jezreel Valley to attend the funeral of Staff Sgt. Ofri Yafe, who was killed a day earlier by friendly fire in the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis.
Yafe, a soldier in the Paratroopers Brigade’s reconnaissance unit, is survived by his parents, Hadas and Yiftach, and three siblings — Noy, Tzuf and Itamar.
Lt. Col. Nevo De-Han, commander of the Paratroopers Brigade’s reconnaissance unit, eulogized Ofri and said, “I failed as a commander.”
“We were given two missions in this maneuver in Gaza,” he said. “The first was to destroy enemy infrastructure in the Khan Younis area, and in that mission we succeeded. The second mission was to bring the entire unit home safely. In that mission we failed. We failed as a unit and I failed as a commander. I am sorry we were not good enough to bring you back.”
He described his final conversations with Yafe, a soldier who had declined to attend officers’ training in order to remain at the head of his team.
“Just two weeks ago we spoke about it again,” De-Han said. “I told him that someone like him had to be a commander in the reconnaissance unit. He simply told me, ‘I am a person of giving, I have other missions.’ A few hours before he fell I told him, ‘Stay sharp.’ He replied that the team was ready at the highest level.”
Despite the circumstances of his death, Ofri’s family chose to send a message of support to the soldiers still fighting, even as he was laid to rest. De-Han said that while the unit was coping with the incident in the heart of Gaza and continuing efforts to destroy enemy infrastructure, a message arrived from his parents: “We love you and embrace you. We have no anger.”
His father, Yiftach Yafe, addressed the sniper team involved in the friendly fire incident directly in his eulogy. “We embrace the sniper and the entire team who found themselves in an illogical situation in an illogical place,” he said. “We have no anger or blame toward you. You were and remain our children.”
He reserved his criticism for Israel’s political leadership. “The anger and blame are directed solely at the country’s leadership, which sends the best of our sons on futile missions, after all our hostages have already returned home,” he said.
His mother, Hadas, added: “I still cannot comprehend it. For me, I am in a nightmare and any moment you will come and laugh at me for believing all of this.”
Yafe, a descendant of the founders of Moshav Hayogev, was a young entrepreneur who built and designed wooden furniture on the family farm. His aunt, Tzvia Gutman, spoke of dreams cut short.
“He had the mind of an entrepreneur — car restoration, pergolas, wood decks,” she said. “He planned to conquer the world after his discharge this August. Instead of revival, you found your death on the cursed soil of Gaza.”
She described him as a young man who “devoured life” and said, “You were meant to be the material that rebuilds this country.”
Roni, his partner of five and a half years, stood by the grave and spoke of plans that ended in Khan Younis. “We’ve been together since ninth grade, and we were supposed to be together forever,” she said. Just two weeks earlier they had traveled in northern Israel. “We talked all night about fulfilling our dream of living together,” she recalled, thanking him for his support. “Thank you for not leaving my side during the difficult year I went through. Thank you for teaching me what love is.”
Before Staff Sgt. Yafe was laid to rest, his father spoke to the ynet, after the parents had accused the state a day earlier of placing their sons in “unnecessary situations.”
“Ofri was a child who basically lived on the edge,” his father said. “He always loved doing extreme things. He traveled a lot. He had a Jeep and drove everywhere — the Arava desert, the Golan Heights. That was always him. Parties, lots of friends. When you live on the edge, you live on the edge — but usually he didn’t tell us anything.”
Yiftach said his son had carried an injury but continued to serve despite a recommendation that he undergo surgery. “During paratroopers training he landed badly on a rock and injured his knee,” he said. “He carried the pain for a long time but completed the course and excelled in basic training. A week and a half ago he had an orthopedic exam and they recommended surgery, but he wanted to stay with his team so he chose to return to Gaza. He also told Hadas he had bad feelings. He was a child who was never afraid of anything. That may have been one of his problems — he was not afraid of anything.”
He said that despite the parents’ criticism of government policy, their views did not influence their son’s decisions. “Ofri believed deeply in his team, in his friends. They were the closest thing to him,” he said. “If his team went in, then he went in with them. There was no other option.”
He added that their public statement reflected only his and his wife’s views. “What we said was our opinion alone,” he said. “We did not ask Ofri and we did not ask our other children. We believe the government’s current policy in Gaza is not the right policy.”
The father emphasized that the family had no accusations against the military. “We have no pointing finger toward the army, any of its commanders, the Paratroopers Brigade or the reconnaissance unit,” he said. “They are the best of our sons. They are our children, and we embrace them — including the sniper who was tragically involved in an incident that should not have happened. Our only criticism is why the best of our sons are inside the Gaza Strip when there are no hostages left and nothing more to achieve there.”
He continued, criticizing the government: “When there is no leadership and no strategy, this is the result. When you do not look at things holistically and correctly but in a populist way. Unfortunately this time it is us. We all hope Ofri will be the last casualty of this very unnecessary campaign.”
Asked what Ofri would want to say to the nation at this difficult time, his father replied: “Very simply. He would say, ‘Be good to one another and love life.’”

Turkish president remains committed to Gaza's security stabilization, recovery, says top diplomat
Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan says humanitarian situation in Gaza ‘remains fragile, and ceasefire violations continue to occur’
ISTANBUL
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan remains committed to security stabilization and recovery in the Gaza Strip, Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said Thursday.
Fidan made the remarks at the inaugural Board of Peace meeting, which convened in Washington under the chairmanship of US President Donald Trump.
He said that “after two years of human suffering, (a) ceasefire in Gaza has been achieved, thanks to President Trump's personal engagement and our collective efforts.”
“Yet the humanitarian situation remains fragile, and ceasefire violations continue to occur. A prompt, coordinated and effective response is therefore essential,” said Fidan.
“President Erdogan remains fully committed to Gaza's security stabilization and recovery. Türkiye has already been providing (an) immense amount of humanitarian assistance to Gaza,” he said. “We can also contribute meaningfully to the rehabilitation of health and education sectors, as well as the training of the police force. In addition, we are prepared to provide troops to the International Stabilization Force.”
“Türkiye will continue to support your (Trump’s) efforts towards a just and lasting peace. We remain convinced that the foundation of such peace is a two-state solution. Let us work towards that objective for the benefit of all peoples of the region,” he added.

Five countries have committed troops to the newly formed Gaza International Stabilization Force (ISF), with Indonesia pledging up to 8,000 soldiers to anchor the mission aimed at securing the enclave and laying the groundwork for lasting peace.
Major General Jasper Jeffers, commander of the ISF, announced at the inaugural Board of Peace meeting in Washington on Thursday that Indonesia, Morocco, Kazakhstan, Kosovo and Albania have formally pledged troops to the nascent security body. Egypt and Jordan will instead focus on training Palestinian police forces.
Jeffers also confirmed that Indonesia has accepted the position of deputy commander of the force.
"With these first steps, we will help bring the security that Gaza needs for our future prosperity and enduring peace," he said.
Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto underscored Jakarta's commitment, pledging 8,000 "or more" troops to the stabilisation mission.
"We reaffirm our commitment to contribute a significant number of troops, up to 8,000 or more, if necessary," Prabowo said. Despite expected challenges, he voiced optimism that "with the leadership of President Donald Trump, this vision of real peace will be achieved".
The troop commitments come as Gaza's local administrative leadership outlined its own roadmap for rebuilding the enclave.
Ali Shaath, head of the National Committee for the Administration of Gaza (NCAG), set out four priorities: restoring security through a unified civilian police force; reviving economic activity and jobs, particularly for youth; ensuring sustainable emergency relief; and rebuilding essential services such as electricity, water, health and education while improving freedom of movement.
"Our mandate is simple," Shaath said. "Step by step, to build the foundation for lasting peace, dignity and prosperity for the people of Gaza."

The quiet conquest of the West Bank and the death of the Oslo Accords

The quiet conquest of the West Bank and the death of the Oslo Accords
Through a new land registration drive, Israel is trying to secure through paperwork what warfare alone has failed to deliver.
Israel always had a plan to annex more land in the occupied West Bank, and its actions prove it.
This week, the Israeli cabinet approved a plan to claim Palestinian lands in the West Bank as “state land”. The proposal, pushed by far-right Israeli leaders, including Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, Justice Minister Yariv Levin and Defence Minister Israel Katz, emphasises Israeli supremacy over Palestinians.
The Israeli government has created 35 new positions and allocated 244.1 million shekels (nearly $79m) for the land registration project from 2026 to 2030.
The process outlined in the proposal is not new in itself. It is a process that has been frozen since 1967, and the most recent resumption is a continuation of Israel’s longstanding plan to take over Palestinian lands. While Israel suspended the land registration process in 1967, it did not suspend its practices of ethnic cleansing, colonial violence and de facto land annexation.
For Palestinians, this decision does not mark a new escalation but a solidification of the Israeli presence in the West Bank. While it may seem like mere paperwork, it is actually a milestone in Israel’s gradual takeover of the West Bank, the last remaining territorial obstacle to the completion of Israel’s colonial project in Palestine.
Bureaucracy as annexation
This shift cannot be understood without revisiting the Oslo Accords. Under the 1993 and 1995 agreements, the West Bank was carved into Areas A, B and C as an “interim” arrangement that was never meant to become permanent. Area C, the largest area containing the most land and resources, remained under full Israeli control while Areas A and B were left as fragmented Palestinian islands with limited Palestinian authority.
That made Area C the real battlefield.
As part of the new policy, land registration in Area C, which constitutes more than 62 percent of the West Bank, is to take place through the Land Title Settlement Administration, part of Israel’s Ministry of Justice. What this in effect does is shift Area C from military administration into direct Israeli civilian governance.
These measures should not be taken lightly. They are telling of Israel’s latest annexation strategy: governance.
On February 8, a week before the Israeli cabinet’s approval to register West Bank lands as state land, Israeli authorities adopted new measures that open land purchase mechanisms for settlers while reducing oversight. That same day, Israeli authorities also moved to further erode Palestinian Authority powers in Areas A and B, which under international agreements signed by Israel should be under full administrative Palestinian control.
Taken together, these measures mark a new phase of Zionist territorial conquest in the 21st century – one that relies less on overt warfare and more on administrative consolidation.
In 1948, Zionist militias pursued territorial conquest through large-scale warfare, mass displacement and the redrawing of borders. Today, conquest increasingly operates through clerical mechanisms.
It is not accidental that a minister as vocally racist as Smotrich explained the plan as an attempt to end “current chaos that is bad for everyone – Jews and Arabs alike”. While Israel’s goal of taking over Palestinian lands has remained unchanged, the post-Oslo era and the reputational damage Israel has sustained during its genocidal war on Gaza mean that visible and large-scale violence is not sustainable for long-term achievements in the West Bank.
So rather than tanks, bombs and dramatic declarations of territorial conquest, Israel is lowering both regional and international alarm by consolidating land through perceived bureaucracy.
From paperwork to dispossession
Israel is pushing its West Bank policies as neutral cadastral clean-up when in reality they are large-scale land grabs carried out through administrative means. It is an act of state building that allows Zionist Israelis to determine whose claims over Palestinian lands are legal and whose vanish.
This is precisely why land registration matters: Once land is entered into the Israeli registry as “state land”, it becomes a legal reality far more difficult to reverse than a temporary military seizure.
For Palestinians, this policy signals serious danger because we have seen it before. After the large-scale dispossession of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians from their lands in 1948, about 150,000 Palestinians remained in what became Israel.
These Palestinians were put under military rule until the 1960s despite holding Israeli citizenship. This was not done for security; it was done to ensure territorial restructuring. Lands that did not have Palestinians physically present on them were absorbed through the Absentees Property Law.
A similar dynamic is unfolding today in the West Bank, where physical displacement and restricted access are again being converted into legal dispossession. In the West Bank, the last two years have seen alarming rates of settler violence that have pushed thousands of Palestinians off their lands while other areas have been taken and declared closed military zones. This denied Palestinians access to their homes, farmlands and properties. Under Israeli law, these can all be considered absentee lands, even if their rightful owners are just a few metres away and unable to reach their lands due to Israeli hostilities.
Through this, Israel is creating a system in which the default legal outcome produces territorial absorption. The bureaucratic aspect of this means that annexation becomes irreversible. It is no longer a temporary military seizure operation; it is transforming territory into property operating within a state system, in this case the Israeli legal system.
More dangerously, historical evidence shows that Israel has not only absorbed Palestinian lands through bureaucracy but also coerced Palestinians to engage with Israeli legal structures as a final avenue.
Still today, Palestinians with Israeli citizenship in areas such as Ein Hod are in legal battles over land. Not only were they displaced from their village, which now serves as a Jewish artist colony, but Palestinians are also just a few kilometres away, holding Israeli citizenship. Decades later, they remain in legal battles to secure building permits to live on the nearby lands they were forced to move to.
Why the world enables administrative conquest
It is important to realise that all of this was made possible by the international community’s refusal to address the criminality of the Israeli regime as a whole.
Condemnations of individual Israeli settler attacks in the last two years and refusal to disarm Israel despite having committed genocide are precisely what is allowing Israel to persist in its colonial expansion. For years Palestinians, as well as international human rights organisations, have warned not only of rising Israeli settler violence but also of a clear synchronisation of efforts by the army and armed Israeli militias in the West Bank.
Palestinians shared reports, tried to tell the stories of trees uprooted by the thousands, of water pipelines being destroyed by Israelis, of large-scale arson attacks and pogroms across different cities and towns, of settlers being armed with military-grade weapons and trained by the army in illegal settlements.
However, the world defined violence only when it came in the shape of bullets and bombs, which is what allowed Israel to shift strategies in the West Bank. While Palestinians are disarmed in the West Bank, all that was left were outcries and calls for media coverage. Violence enacted against Palestinians was reduced to random and exceptional acts of hostility.
Yet in the West Bank, Israel did not choose dramatic war; it chose subtlety. In the last two years, the battlefield in the West Bank has diffused into everyday life and relocated into the nervous system. Violence no longer depends on constant lethal force but on permanent anticipation of a settler attack, a military raid or a court demolition order. Constant surveillance, drones overhead, incessant home invasions, arrests and checkpoints every few metres hold the body captive.
All of these practices paved the way for the ongoing displacement and dispossession of Palestinians from their lands. More importantly, they are precisely why Israel is able to push renewed policies to register lands as state lands and to allow Israelis to buy lands with little oversight.
What this must teach us is that sometimes war exists in the subtleties, and the absence of relentless bombing does not mean the absence of war.

Costa meets with wounded Ukrainian soldier at hospital in Oslo
He stated this on X, Ukrinform reports.
"To date, more than 2,750 patients have been evacuated with Norway's support to hospitals across Europe under the EU Civil Protection Mechanism — a vital contribution to our collective support for Ukraine," he stressed.
He expressed gratitude to the "dedicated doctors and nurses" of Oslo University Hospital, who have been providing medical assistance to many evacuated Ukrainian patients since the start of the full-scale invasion.
He also shared his impressions of meeting a Ukrainian serviceman, Ihor, who continues to recover from injuries sustained on the Zaporizhzhia front last autumn.
"I wish him a full and speedy recovery," Costa wrote, adding that he was "deeply moved" by the meeting.
As Ukrinform previously reported, President of the European Council Antonio Costa arrived in Oslo today for high-level meetings to mark the strong momentum in EU–Norway bilateral relations.
According to the visit program, he had an audience with the Crown Prince Regent and then met with Prime Minister of Norway Jonas Gahr Store.
He also visited Oslo University Hospital, which plays a key role in Norway's support for Ukraine by treating hundreds of patients evacuated due to the war. As a major trauma center, it provides specialized care for war-related injuries.
Costa is also set to visit the Norwegian Defence Research Establishment (FFI) in Kjeller, near Oslo. FFI has been a key player in supporting and strengthening Norway's defense capabilities through advanced research and innovation. It has participated in joint defense research and development under the European Defence Fund (EDF), receiving financial support from the EU.

French prosecutor seeks homicide charges in killing of far-right activist Quentin Deranque
A French prosecutor said Thursday they were seeking homicide charges against seven suspects in the fatal beating of far-right activist Quentin Deranque, 23, after violent clashes in the French city of Lyon. Most of those detained are from far-left movements.

A French prosecutor on Thursday sought homicide charges against seven suspects in the fatal beating of a far-right activist that has fuelled political anger beyond France's borders, prompting President Emmanuel Macron to tell Italy's Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni to keep out of French affairs.
Quentin Deranque, 23, died from head injuries after being attacked by at least six people on the sidelines of a far-right protest in Lyon on February 12. Most of the 11 suspects who had been detained are from far-left movements.
Prosecutor Thierry Dran told a press conference he had requested "intentional homicide" charges against seven men and recommended they remain in custody to avoid any "disturbance to public order".
The killing has fuelled political tensions ahead of municipal elections in March and France's 2027 presidential race, in which the far-right National Rally (RN) party is seen as having its best chance yet at winning the top job.
On Wednesday, Italy's far-right leader Meloni said the killing of Deranque was "a wound for all of Europe".

Macron said there was no place in France "for movements that adopt and legitimise violence" and called on all political parties to "clean up" their act.
"Nothing can justify violent action – neither on one side nor the other, and not even in a head-to-head confrontation that is deadly for the republic."
Macron also suggested that everyone must "stay in their own lane", after Meloni lamented "a climate of ideological hatred".
"I'm always struck by the fact that people who are nationalists – who don't want anyone bothering them at home – are always the first to comment on what's happening elsewhere," Macron said, while on a visit to New Delhi.
'Terrible past'
Italy's foreign minister hit back saying the killing of the French activist "is a serious matter that concerns us all".
Antonio Tajani said on X there had been similar incidents in Italy's history, and that condemning such violence aims "to ensure that we do not return to a terrible past".
He said "there have been many Quentins in Italy, some during the darkest periods of the Republic".
Macron is "closely monitoring" events, a member of his team said Thursday. "We must avoid any spiral of violence."
Eleven people – eight men and three women – were taken into custody over the killing.
Lyon prosecutor Dran said that of the seven men who could be charged with homicide, two have refused to speak while in custody.
Others have acknowledged being at the scene and "some admit to having struck blows", but he added, they all dispute having had any homicidal intent.
Four suspects have been released, but more are being sought, Dran said.
Among those originally detained are two parliamentary assistants to Raphael Arnault, a member of parliament from the hard-left France Unbowed (LFI) party, as well as a former intern.

A lawyer for Deranque's parents said they called "for calm and restraint".
"The family condemns any call for violence. Any form of political violence," Fabien Rajon told broadcaster RTL.
In snap parliamentary polls in 2024, Macron's supporters and the left, including the hard-left, joined forces in an effort to bar the far-right from power.
But following Deranque's killing some high-profile politicians sought to distance themselves from the hard-left, ruling out any possible futue alliance.
Justice Minister Gérald Darmanin called on Arnault to "draw the consequences" if the judiciary "finds serious and consistent evidence concerning him or the aides he hired".
LFI party coordinator Manuel Bompard said that Arnault would "certainly not" be suspended or excluded from the LFI group in the National Assembly lower house.
An anti-immigration collective called Nemesis has blamed the killing of the activist on an anti-fascist youth group called La Jeune Garde (Young Guard) co-founded by Arnault before he was elected to parliament.

YAOUNDE, Feb 19 - An Associated Press journalist was beaten by police and briefly detained alongside three other reporters and a lawyer in Yaounde while attempting to interview Africans recently deported from the United States, two sources told Reuters.
The journalists had their equipment confiscated, which has yet to be returned, and were taken to the judicial police by plainclothes officers on Tuesday after attempting to film the facility hosting the deportees, sources said.
"It was an extremely stressful experience," said freelance journalist Randy Joe Sa'ah, who was briefly detained.
"I was surprised by how quickly the situation escalated. It felt as though our only 'offence' was simply being present at the facility where people were being held," he said.
AP declined to comment.
Cameroon's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and police did not respond to requests for comment.
The first group of deportees arrived in Cameroon in January, including two individuals from Ghana, two from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), two from Morocco, two from Angola, and one from Zimbabwe. The Moroccans have since returned home but the remaining seven migrants remain in Cameroon.
A second group arrived early on Monday and included three Ethiopians, one Senegalese, one Kenyan, one Sierra Leonean, and two from the DRC.
The Trump administration has approached a number of African governments about accepting deportees as part of its campaign to deter immigration through high-profile deportations to so-called "third countries." In some cases migrants have voiced concerns for their safety. Cameroon has not disclosed whether it participated in the U.S. administration's program. The State Department could not be immediately reached for comment.
The recent flights brought the total number of deportees in Cameroon to 17, according to four deportees and two lawyers.
All the deportees had been granted withholding of removal status in the U.S., which protects individuals from deportation to countries where they fear persecution or harm. REUTERS

Trump's 'Board of Peace' members pledge $7 billion for Gaza
February 19, 2026US President Donald Trump launched the inaugural meeting of his "Board of Peace" on Thursday, with representatives from over 40 countries and observers from a dozen others present.
Trump said that $7 billion (just under €6 billion) had been pledged by nine members of the organization for a Gaza relief package. That amounts to just 10% of the $70 billion needed to rebuild after the devastation of two years of war.
The US president also pledged $10 billion, but without saying where that money would go.
Who has pledged money to the Board of Peace?
Trump said Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, UAE, Morocco, Bahrain, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Uzbekistan and Kuwait were the countries offering to fund the Board of Peace relief package for Gaza.
"Every dollar spent is an investment in stability and the hope of new and harmonious [region]," the US president said.
"The Board of Peace is showing how a better future can be built, starting right here in this room," he added.
Trump also used his platform to attack domestic opponents and praise his own endorsements of foreign leaders in elections.
Beyond pledges for financing, the following countries also said they would send troops to Gaza to be part of a stabilization force: Indonesia, Morocco, Kazakhstan, Kosovo and Albania.
What is Trump's 'Board of Peace'?
The so-called "Board of Peace" came out of a ceasefire deal negotiated between Israel and Hamas in Gaza to end two years of war. However, that deal has not brought an end to the deadly violence, with more than 600 Palestinians killed since the ceasefire began, according to the Gaza Health Ministry.
Though the Board originated as a Gaza-specific reconstruction body, its charter evolved into a broader and more ambiguous mandate. The founding charter, signed in Davos on January 22, 2026, does not explicitly mention Gaza. Trump's opaque comments have led to criticisms that he is trying to overshadow the UN, from which he has also withdrawn much US funding.
However, the organization functions very differently from the UN. Members are obliged to pay $1 billion to extend their membership beyond the first two years and Trump has appointed himself chair, meaning he will remain in control even after leaving office.
Besides obvious Trump allies such as leaders from Israel, Hungary and Argentina, there are also countries such as Pakistan seeking favor with the White House who have signed up to the board.
Germany, Italy, Norway, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and several others sent observers rather than representatives. Meanwhile, France has rejected any participation and criticized the EU for sending officials.

Archaeologists confirm 2,000-year-old discovery at Scottish beach
- Two dog walkers discovered 2,000-year-old human and animal footprints on a Scottish beach at Lunan Bay, Angus, after recent storms revealed a fresh layer of clay.
- Archaeologists from the University of Aberdeen confirmed the prints date back to the height of the Roman Empire, noting it is a unique and rare discovery for Scotland, with no previous record of such a site.
- The archaeological team faced a race against time and extreme weather, working in windspeeds over 55mph to record the site before it was reclaimed by the sea within 48 hours.
- Despite the rapid destruction, the team successfully recorded and mapped the site, capturing 3D models and physical casts of the prints for further analysis.
- Ongoing analysis has identified footprints from humans, roe deer, red deer, and other animals, providing insights into the ancient environment and its inhabitants during the late Iron Age.

Spending even more on defence won’t buy us peace | Letters

We are told to spend even more, and more quickly, on the armed forces, whose current budget for this year is expected to amount to more than £60bn (‘Britain ‘needs to go faster’ on defence spending, Starmer says, 16 February). The Ministry of Defence must surely first show it can put its house in order.
The government is considering whether to scrap Ajax, the army’s planned new armoured vehicle, even though more than £6bn of taxpayers’ money has already been spent on the project. Ajax is eight years late, its defects so serious that vibration and noise have made soldiers training on it sick, with some suffering hearing loss.
It is the latest and most egregious example of the huge waste caused by the MoD’s incompetence and profligacy over recent years. It has spent many billions on items, including aircraft carriers, that would be extremely vulnerable in modern conflicts, something that has been evident for a long time.
The chairs of the Commons defence and public accounts committees told the MoD last month that its failure to publish its equipment plan in 2023, and again in 2024, has resulted in an unacceptable gap in parliament and the public’s ability to scrutinise defence spending. Repeated delays in publishing the MoD’s current plan risk sending damaging signals to adversaries, they added. The delays also signal that the MoD culture is unfit for purpose and its leadership cannot be trusted with so much of the British public’s money.
Richard Norton-Taylor

Desire for greater security comes from people and countries feeling unsafe and fearful (British and German military chiefs press ‘moral’ case for rearmament, 15 February). But experience has shown that the apparent security that comes from rearmament is temporary at best and can provoke the conflict it tries to prevent.
The British and German defence chiefs may argue that “strength deters aggression”, but this conceals the reality that Britain already has the world’s sixth-largest military budget, and that Nato’s military spending already dwarfs Russia’s. Their argument could easily come from defence chiefs in Russia or any other hostile state. As we are seeing with the US as well as Russia, strength also begets aggression.
Countries aren’t static in responding to each other, and there’s a high likelihood that military buildup in Europe will spur further militarisation elsewhere. Long-term peace comes from building trust, friendship and mutual dependence between nations, not the constant threat of military retaliation.
Oliver Robertson
Head of witness and worship, Quakers in Britain
So the British and German military chiefs are making the moral case for rearmament in order to “preserve peace”. Doing so, they say, is not warmongering. However, when doing so has led to a 45% cut in the government’s funding through the Integrated Security Fund dedicated to building peace and preventing conflict and when the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office is being “restructured” with the loss of considerable conflict expertise, it does rather look like warmongering.
If we are serious about preserving peace, we need to be investing in those diplomats and peacebuilders who are able to de-escalate and reduce tensions. Rearming without investing in these skill sets will simply increase tensions still further. It is the opposite of preserving peace.
Lt Col David Couzens (retired)
Faringdon, Oxfordshire
The defence chiefs of the UK and Germany quite rightly warn us of the increasing threat from a rapidly rearming Russia, and call for “an honest conversation” with citizens about defence being the responsibility of each and every one of us.
Any meaningful conversation must be preceded by a crash course in recent events and an outline of the specific threats. Few people in the UK nowadays have any reason to be concerned about defence, and successive governments have been much too timid to talk openly about the threat of war for fear of spooking the population.
There is one significant omission from the proposed conversation. If the government wants citizens to engage in building a whole-of-society defence, it must spell out in detail how it will protect us should open conflict break out. Civil defence organisations disappeared along with the cold war, and the (very few) nuclear shelters allocated to civilians have fallen into complete disrepair.
Hannah Walker
Wymondham, Norfolk
The British and German defence chiefs write of the “moral dimension” of rearmament and say that weakness invites aggression. I would suggest that the people of Moldova, Georgia and Ukraine have offered no such invitation to their bear-like neighbour. Nor, indeed, the people of Iraq to this country’s catastrophic aggression in 2003. Greenlanders will likewise be anxiously checking their own invitation list.
The top brass are nonetheless right that a whole-of-society approach is required to meet the complexity of threats to the UK and Europe – not just those emanating from Vladimir Putin, Donald Trump and their ilk, but also climate breakdown, grotesque inequality, and deadly new technologies. But that approach cannot be reduced to a lecture on how military industries must prevail at the expense of our health and welfare.
Eight months since the last defence and security reviews, we are still nowhere near the “continent-wide conversation with the public” that the prime minister and security elites glibly prescribe. The public remains wholly outside the conversation on its own security, excluded from even tokenistic input to the last national security strategy.
We ignore at our peril how the “peace dividend” investment of the post-cold-war era strengthened our society, as well as how that trust, unity and resilience has been steadily undermined by austerity, corruption, misinvestment in wars of choice, and the politics of polarisation. If morally conscious leaders genuinely want to protect their people, they would do well to listen and look at home too. The UK’s weakened society invites not deflection and aggression, but recognition and action.

Denmark says unclear why it was not invited to Trump's Board of Peace meeting
Foreign minister says: 'We want lasting peace in Gaza, and we want it to happen in a way that includes the Palestinian Authority'
BRUSSELS
US President Donald Trump announced billions of dollars in contributions for relief in the Gaza Strip at the inaugural meeting Thursday of the Board of Peace in Washington.
Trump said the US is contributing $10 billion to the new body.
Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, the United Arab Emirates, Morocco, Bahrain, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Uzbekistan and Kuwait collectively pledged more than $7 billion, he added.
The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs is raising an additional $2 billion, said Trump.
The US president noted Japan is committed to host a fundraiser, "which will be a very big one."
US Ambassador to the UN Michael Waltz said humanitarian flows into Gaza have improved significantly, with 4,200 aid trucks entering the territory each week for 13 consecutive weeks, “the longest stretch of high-volume assistance to Gaza in years.”
"Aid is up," he said, adding that it was now reaching the full 2.1 million Gazans, up as much as five times from previous delivery levels.
Israel began its war in Gaza on Oct. 8, 2023, resulting in more than 72,000 Palestinian deaths and over 171,000 injuries, most of them women and children, and damage to 90% of civilian infrastructure.
Despite a ceasefire, the Israeli army continued its attacks, killing at least 611 Palestinians and injuring 1,630, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry.

Families of Syria's disappeared furious with new drama about Assad regime prisons
A new Syrian drama that depicts the prisons of the former Assad regime has been angrily rejected by families of detainees who were killed or forcibly disappeared.
The families say that it exploits the tragedy of their loved ones, who have yet to receive justice for what was done to them.
The producers of the series, called "Caesar: No Place, No Time", say it is "based on real testimonies from inside Syrian detention centres, in an attempt to present a dramatic work documenting the violations witnessed during the period of the former Syrian regime’s rule".
However, the Syrian Caesar Families Association issued a strongly worded statement on Wednesday, saying that the wounds of the families of the Assad regime’s victims “are still bleeding” and cannot become material for commercial entertainment, saying that this “constitutes a direct insult to the dignity of the victims and their relatives.”
The statement, entitled “The Blood of Our Victims Is Not Material for Entertainment,” said that no dramatic production should be undertaken before “the completion of the path to truth and justice”, including the full disclosure of facts, identifying burial sites of victims, and returning their remains to their families with dignity.
It condemned “exploiting pain for profit or to enhance the reputation of parties involved.”
The regime of former dictator Bashar al-Assad, which was overthrown by rebels in December 2024, detained and forcibly disappeared tens of thousands of political opponents during the Syrian conflict, which began in 2011, after the brutal repression of anti-Assad protests.
The Syrian Network for Human Rights (SNHR) previously said that over 177,000 people had been forcibly disappeared by the Assad regime, most of whom are believed to have been killed.
There is no confirmed information about their fate though and mass graves are still being uncovered in Syria.
In 2014, a defector known as “Caesar” leaked thousands of photographs of the torture and killing of detainees at Sednaya Prison near Damascus. He later revealed his identity as Farid Al-Madhan, a former military photographer.
Another issue with the series which has angered families is the past affiliations of some of the actors involved.
Actors such as Salloum Haddad and Ghassan Massoud, who appear in the series, previously expressed support for the Assad regime when it was in power, while Hassan Ziyoud, who composed the theme song, has written a song before praising Assad’s army.
Ziyoud was accused of changing sides on the day that the Assad regime fell, on 8 December 2024.
Wafa Mustafa, a longtime Syrian opposition activist angrily hit out at the production, saying that they had subjected the suffering of the detainees and their families to “humiliation, mockery, and open profiteering.”
Families of Syrian detainees have long expressed frustration at the lack of information regarding the fate of their loved ones and the lack of an open transitional justice process. Some senior figures associated with the Assad regime’s abuses have been allowed to remain free after reaching deals with the new government.
“We learned no truth and no one saved us, and on top of that we must endure these opportunists, exaggerators, and traders,” Mustafa said. “Those who rehabilitated the criminals, those who allowed the destruction of evidence and the violation of prisons, those who painted over detention centres, those who went in to film action videos and dramatic scenes, those who made series about pain that hasn’t even begun to heal or been handled with the minimum standards of sensitivity and ethics.”
In response, the Syrian government denied that filming had taken place at any prison site.

Romania, Hungary back Trump peace initiative for Gaza at first Board of Peace meeting
Leaders outline humanitarian aid, reconstruction plans for Gaza while praising US president’s role in global peace diplomacy
ISTANBUL
Romania’s President Nicusor Dan and Hungary’s Prime Minister Viktor Orban expressed support Thursday for US President Donald Trump’s peace initiative in remarks at the first meeting of the Board of Peace.
Dan thanked Trump for his “involvement and leadership” and described the proposed Gaza Strip peace plan as “comprehensive and stable,” while outlining steps Romania could take, particularly in humanitarian and institutional support.
“I think everyone desire peace, stability, prosperity in Gaza, but the question is how to act for and that's why this meeting is and this format, it's important what Romanian can do first on the humanitarian situation, we can increase the number of flights in order to extract children with disease and to treat in the Romanian hospitals we've done already, and we can do 4,000 children and 4,000 family members,” he said.
He added that Romania could help rebuild emergency response systems and public institutions in Gaza, citing prior international experience.
“Secondly, we had a good expertise in emergency report systems, like ambulance fire systems, and we can help in order to rebuild that system, and we can donate some infrastructure, some equipment. Third, we (are) already offering some scholarships for Palestinian students, and we can extend the program. And we can also help to rebuild, refurbish the schools in Gaza and force," he added.
Orban praised Trump’s global diplomatic efforts and framed Hungary’s participation as principled and strategic.
“First of all, let me express the appreciation of the Hungarian people to President Trump for his tireless peace efforts all around the world,” he said.
He emphasized Hungary’s status within the EU representation at the meeting. “Hungary is the only country to be represented here on the highest level among the founding members from the European Union.”
Linking Middle East stability to Europe’s security, Orban said, “We in Europe understand clearly that the security situation in (the) Middle East, and especially in Gaza, has a significant impact on the security of Europe.”
He argued that new mechanisms were needed to address global conflicts, criticizing existing institutions.
“We understand that during the recent decades, international organizations have failed to fulfill their role to preserve peace and stability worldwide. Therefore, new initiatives are needed to bring forward the issue of peace globally,” he said.
Israel began its war in Gaza on Oct. 8, 2023, resulting in more than 72,000 Palestinian deaths and over 171,000 injuries, most of them women and children, and damage to 90% of civilian infrastructure.

Etsy stock pops on Depop deal despite disappointing revenue, merchandise sales

Etsy shares popped on Thursday after the company said it plans to offload its fashion resale app Depop to eBay for about $1.2 billion in cash.
The online marketplace also reported mixed earnings results for the fourth quarter.
Here's how Etsy did, compared with estimates from analysts polled by LSEG:
- Earnings per share: 92 cents vs. 84 cents estimated
- Revenue: $882 million vs. $885 million estimated
Gross merchandise sales, or the dollar value of items sold, slid 3.8% year over year to $3.59 billion and missed analyst estimates of $3.6 billion, according to FactSet. The company attributed the annual decline to its sale of musical instrument marketplace Reverb, which was completed last June.
The downbeat results were overshadowed by the Depop deal announced on Wednesday. Etsy CEO Kruti Patel Goyal said in a statement that the sale would allow the company to "focus exclusively" on its core marketplace.
EBay said Depop, a resale app popular among younger consumers, complements its business and would strengthen its presence in fashion, which has become one of its fastest-growing categories.
Shares of eBay also climbed on Thursday.
In the fourth quarter, Etsy's net income dropped 14.8% year over year to $110.7 million, or 92 cents per share, compared with $129.9 million, or $1.03 per share, one year ago.
The company, known for its marketplace of handcrafted and artisan wares, has recently stepped up its marketing investments as it looks to reach more U.S. consumers.
Etsy has been contending with stiffer competition in online retail, along with a challenging macroeconomic backdrop. The company said in its annual filing released Thursday that it's been pressured by an ongoing pullback in consumer discretionary spending and "evolving buyer behavior."
Active sellers grew 7.7% year over year to 8.76 million, surpassing analysts estimated 8.5 million. Active buyers declined 2% year over year to 93.54 million, compared with Wall Street's estimated 93.1 million.
For the first quarter, Etsy guided for gross merchandise sales to come in between $2.38 billion and $2.43 billion, compared with GMS of $2.8 billion one year earlier. Analysts anticipated $2.68 billion in GMS.

SANTIAGO, Feb 19 - Chilean authorities on Thursday raided the homes of two recently dismissed executives of state copper miner Codelco as they continue their investigation into a deadly collapse at the El Teniente mine last year.
Officials during the searches seized digital equipment from ex-Chief Operations Officer Mauricio Barraza and former mine manager Claudio Sougarret, Chile's prosecutor's office said in a statement.
Codelco facilities were also searched, with some equipment voluntarily handed over by the company. Codelco declined to comment.
Authorities added that items belonging to Rodrigo Andrades, former El Teniente projects manager, had been seized in October.
The three executives were removed from their jobs last week after an internal audit found inconsistencies tied to a 2023 rock explosion at El Teniente, including in Codelco's following reports to mining regulator Sernageomin.
Sernageomin said earlier this week it would file formal complaints to authorities.
Last year, the same mine was the site of a collapse that killed six people. REUTERS

Polish president signs new law on aid for Ukrainian refugees
Polish President Karol Nawrocki has signed a document that provides for the transfer of all instruments supporting Ukrainian refugees to the general Law on the Protection of Foreigners.
Source: European Pravda, citing RMF24, a Polish news portal
Details: The so-called Special Assistance Act for Ukrainians, in place since 2022, has established a separate legal framework that simplifies rules for residence, work, access to benefits and education for refugees from Ukraine.
The new law gradually abolishes this system and key support instruments will be included in the general provisions on the protection of foreigners.
Additionally, the signed document also extends the legitimacy of staying in Poland for Ukrainian citizens who fled the war until 4 March 2027.
One of the significant changes in the law is the introduction of the requirement to apply for a PESEL number, a personal identification number that provides access to various services and simplifies bureaucratic procedures, within 30 days of entering Poland.
Failure to submit an application within this period will result in the expiry of the temporary protection and will be regarded as a refusal to receive this form of support.
Background:
- In November 2025, President of Poland Karol Nawrocki announced that he had signed the law on assistance to citizens of Ukraine for the last time, and in the future, they will be treated like other national minorities.
- The previous law on aid for Ukrainians was vetoed by the Polish president, citing what he called an allegedly excessive amount of social assistance provided to Ukrainian refugees.
- The new law, rapidly prepared by the Polish government, was finally approved by the parliament on 17 September.

Ukrainian model allegedly recruited girls for Epstein
A Ukrainian model who met Jeffrey Epstein in person and likely received expensive gifts and money from him may have recruited girls for the American sex offender.
Source: an investigation by Slidstvo.Info, an independent team of investigative journalists
Details: Correspondence between the financier and a Ukrainian woman known as Nastia N. has been found in the Epstein files – the latest documents and photographs which the US Department of Justice released at the beginning of 2026.
During 2015-2019, Nastia N. corresponded with Epstein's assistant, Lesley Groff, and the financier himself, who built a network of sexual exploitation and human trafficking, including children.
The messages indicate that Groff scheduled meetings between Nastia and Epstein and also arranged payment for her education, visits to beauty salons, tickets from Kyiv to New York, and gifts including a new laptop worth US$3,500.
The files include messages in which the financier asks the model to find him an "assistant" aged 22 to 25, who had to be "smart and willing to travel".
"Of course I will find you girls," Nastia replied.
The model offered Epstein several candidates, including 25-year-old Elena from Russia. It was later arranged for the woman to go on a multi-day trip to one of the financier's islands, where many women have testified that they were raped.
Later, Nastia wrote to the sex offender again to suggest that he consider another candidate for "Jeffrey-land" – likely Epstein's island. Epstein turned this one down, and the model sent him further suggestions.
In 2019, Epstein wrote to his assistant to remind her about "10k for Nastia N". It is not known what this money was for or whether the Ukrainian model received it.
When the Slidstvo.Info journalists attempted to contact Nastia, she read their messages but did not reply to them, and then made her Instagram page private.
They did manage to speak to Nastia's mother, who lives in Ukraine.
She replied: "I asked her [about the Epstein files – ed.]. She said she's very glad that she is on the sidelines of these events. I don't know how she can appear there." She promised to let her daughter know that the journalists had approached her for comment.

Ex-South Korean President Yoon gets life sentence for insurrection

Former South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol was convicted on Thursday of orchestrating an insurrection and received a life sentence for his short-lived declaration of martial law in 2024, in a verdict that brings a dramatic close to what has been the nation's most severe political turmoil in decades.
The conservative leader was ousted from office after he declared martial law and sent troops to surround the National Assembly on Dec. 3, 2024, in a baffling attempt to overcome a legislature controlled by his liberal opponents.
Judge Jee Kui-youn of the Seoul Central District Court said he found Yoon, 65, guilty of rebellion for mobilizing military and police forces in an illegal attempt to seize the Assembly, arrest political opponents and establish unchecked power for an indefinite period.
Yoon's martial law imposition, the first of its kind in more than four decades, recalled South Korea's past military-backed governments when authorities occasionally proclaimed emergency decrees that allowed them to station soldiers, tanks and armored vehicles on streets or in public places such as schools to prevent anti-government demonstrations.
As lawmakers rushed to the National Assembly, Yoon's martial law command issued a proclamation declaring sweeping powers, including suspending political activities, controlling the media and publications, and allowing arrests without warrants.
The decree lasted about six hours before being lifted after a quorum of lawmakers managed to break through a military blockade and unanimously voted to lift the measure.
Yoon was suspended from office on Dec. 14, 2024, after being impeached by lawmakers and was formally removed by the Constitutional Court in April 2025. He has been under arrest since last July while facing multiple criminal trials, with the rebellion charge carrying the most severe punishment.
An expressionless Yoon gazed straight ahead as the judge delivered the sentence in the same courtroom where former military rulers and presidents have been convicted of treason, corruption and other crimes over the decades.
Yoon Kap-keun, one of the former president's lawyers, accused the judge of issuing a "predetermined verdict" based solely on prosecutors' arguments and said the "rule of law" had collapsed. He said he would discuss whether to appeal with his client and the rest of the legal team.
Former President Yoon claimed in court that the martial law decree was only meant to raise public awareness of how the liberals were paralyzing state affairs, and that he was prepared to respect lawmakers if they voted against the measure.
Prosecutors said it was clear Yoon was attempting to disable the legislature and prevent lawmakers from lifting the measure through voting, actions that exceeded his constitutional authority even under martial law.
The court also convicted and sentenced five former military and police officials involved in enforcing Yoon's martial law decree.
They included ex-Defense Minister Kim Yong Hyun, who received a 30-year jail term for his central role in planning the measure, mobilizing the military and instructing military counterintelligence officials to arrest 14 key politicians, including National Assembly speaker Woo Won-shik and current liberal President Lee Jae Myung.
In announcing Yoon and Kim's verdicts, Jee said the decision to send troops to the National Assembly was key to his determination that the imposition of martial law amounted to rebellion.
"This court finds that the purpose of (Yoon's) actions was to send troops to the National Assembly, block the Assembly building and arrest key figures, including the National Assembly speaker and the leaders of both the ruling and opposition parties, in order to prevent lawmakers from gathering to deliberate or vote," Jee said.
"It's sufficiently established that he intended to obstruct or paralyze the Assembly's activities so that it would be unable to properly perform its functions for a considerable period of time."
As Yoon arrived in court, hundreds of police officers watched closely as Yoon supporters rallied outside a judicial complex, their cries rising as the prison bus transporting him drove past. Yoon's critics gathered nearby, demanding the death penalty.
There were no immediate reports of major clashes following the verdict.
A special prosecutor had demanded the death penalty for Yoon Suk Yeol, saying his actions posed a threat to the country's democracy and deserved the most serious punishment available, but most analysts had expected a life sentence since the poorly-planned power grab did not result in casualties.
South Korea has not executed a death row inmate since 1997, in what is widely seen as a de facto moratorium on capital punishment amid calls for its abolition.
Jung Chung-rae, leader of the liberal Democratic Party, which led the push to impeach and remove Yoon, expressed regret that the court stopped short of the death penalty, saying the ruling reflected a "lack of a sense of justice."
Song Eon-seok, floor leader of the conservative People Power Party, to which Yoon once belonged, issued a public apology, saying the party feels a "deep sense of responsibility" for the disruption to the nation.
The office of current President Lee Jae Myung did not immediately comment on the ruling.
Last month, Yoon was sentenced to five years in prison for resisting arrest, fabricating the martial law proclamation and sidestepping a legally mandated full Cabinet meeting before declaring the measure.
The Seoul Central Court had previously convicted two other members of Yoon's Cabinet in connection with the martial law debacle. That includes Prime Minister Han Duck-soo, who received a 23-year prison sentence for attempting to legitimize the decree by forcing it through a Cabinet Council meeting, falsifying records and lying under oath. Han has appealed the verdict.
Yoon is the first former South Korean president to receive a life sentence since former military dictator Chun Doo-hwan, who was sentenced to death in 1996 for his 1979 coup, a bloody 1980 crackdown on pro-democracy protesters in Gwangju that left more than 200 people dead or missing, and corruption.
The Supreme Court later reduced his sentence to life imprisonment, and he was released in late 1997 under a special presidential pardon. He died in 2021.

Türkiye takes all necessary steps beyond its borders for its security, neutralizing threats at their source without seeking permission from anyone, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said on Thursday.
Speaking at an iftar program with families of martyrs at Çankaya Mansion in the capital Ankara, Erdoğan said that significant progress has been made in efforts toward a “terror-free Türkiye.”
“There has been a serious decrease in security risks directed at our country, both within and beyond our borders,” he said.
Referring to terrorism, Erdoğan said: “We are determined to rid Türkiye forever of this scourge that has burned the hearts of our nation for nearly half a century.”
He noted that thanks to operations by the armed forces and other security units, “we have significantly restricted the mobility of terrorist organizations.”
“Today, we can meet almost all our needs ourselves in nearly every field, including UAVs, armed UAVs, missiles, rockets, ships, helicopters and tanks,” he said.
He further added that an agreement was reached last month to resolve the issue in northern Syria without bloodshed, adding that “the process leading to full integration has begun.”

Drinks, darts, DJs and drag queens: the artwork that’s a fully-functioning pub – with the artist pulling pints

‘The art world has a real issue with making things overly conceptual, too complicated and using wanky jargon,” says Trackie McLeod. “It alienates people.” So, for his latest show, Utopia, the 32-year-old Glaswegian has decided to create something more welcoming and familiar: a pub.
Custom-built from scratch, the exhibition is a fully functioning boozer. McLeod will pull pints for punters, there’s a dartboard where you can take aim at images of Thatcher or Trump, and visitors can explore his mixed-media artworks, spanning print, sculpture and sound, and swing by to catch drag acts, DJs and panel discussions.
“I’ve even got a fruit machine that spits out chocolate coins,” he says. “Which is a comment on how these machines rinse working-class pockets for their own gain. Whereas with this work, everyone’s a winner.”
Utopia takes place at Factory International’s Aviva Studios in Manchester, and was commissioned by its Young Curators team. Touching on themes of nostalgia, class, identity and gentrification, it is also an ode to pubs and working men’s clubs as vital community hubs.
“I grew up in places like this,” McLeod says. “All our family occasions were there – weddings, birthdays, funerals. It’s where all the disputes happened. Spaces that were cheap and cheerful but championed character and comfort. I’m trying to bring back a sense of togetherness that we’re lacking at the moment.”
McLeod – whose nickname, Trackie, is based on his propensity, when younger, for bringing out a fresh tracksuit to put on when a party ran into day two – is having a very busy run. After two successful exhibitions, Fruit (2024) and Fruit II (2025), he now also has Soft Play running at the Charleston in Lewes until mid-April, where he has recreated an outdoor play park in the exhibition space. It explores “the awkward transition from childhood into teenager”, he says. “When you’re playing as an adult in these spaces – like drinking and vandalising – but are still really a kid.”
McLeod struggled at school and didn’t connect with the art curriculum and its focus on “dead painters”, but one day an ex-student came in to give a talk. “He looked like me and sounded like me,” he recalls. “He spoke about Andy Warhol, Basquiat and Keith Haring. That was my introduction to art that wasn’t just necessarily painting. A real turning point.”
He still failed art: he is dyslexic and struggled with the essays. But he “accidentally” ended up at college studying design, and then at university, trying to find his groove. “I’ve been chipping away at this for a long time,” he says. “It hasn’t been a linear path. There have been lots of ups and downs.”
By the time of Fruit – which featured a whole car painted in a Burberry check, and a dovecote installed in the gallery – he felt he had found his stride; blending Scottish patter, popular culture, graphic design, 00s nostalgia and explorations of class. “It all came together,” he says.
It also coincided with McLeod exploring his personal life in more depth. He had already been looking at toxic masculinity, and began to intersect it with his own experiences of growing up queer in Glasgow. In one piece – funny and absurd, but also quietly powerful and moving – he framed a long list of things that were deemed gay in school, including using gel pens, reading and crossing your legs. “It was only putting it out like that that you realise: fucking hell, that was ridiculous,” he says. “The things I would do to change myself to try and fit in at the time.”
McLeod has stayed in Glasgow, avoiding the frenzy of London, which he feels is “oversaturated”. He remains unrepresented by a gallery and happily part of a DIY scene. Despite his growing success, he has previously had to fund his own exhibitions to make them happen, sleeping on sofas at friends’ houses. For all the talk of representation, diversity and inclusion in the arts, that hasn’t been his experience as a working-class artist.
“A lot of these galleries say they are championing underrepresented voices and most of the time they don’t,” he says. “They don’t practise what they preach. It’s just rich folk with limited life experience, pumping money into rich folk with limited life experience. The art world feeds on nepotism, privilege and the bank of mummy and daddy. There’s definitely a glass ceiling for working-class artists.”
It’s been a slog for McLeod, but doing things on his own terms seems to be paying off and he now welcomes people to swing by Utopia for a pint and a chat. “I don’t have the answers, but I’m living proof that you can mark out your own path and it is possible,” he says. “But we need more working-class voices, more queer voices, and more POC voices, because it makes for more interesting art.”

President Donald Trump on Thursday announced $10 billion in U.S. funding for the "Board of Peace," his Gaza stability push that has largely been snubbed by the Western democracies that normally back Washington's initiatives.
"I want to let you know that the United States is going to make a contribution of $10 billion to the Board of Peace," he told its inaugural meeting, which gathered around two dozen world leaders and senior officials, including several of Trump's authoritarian-leaning allies.
Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, the United Arab Emirates, Morocco, Bahrain, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Uzbekistan and Kuwait collectively pledged more than $7 billion, he added.
The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs is raising an additional $2 billion, said Trump.

EU Council chief pushes to open Ukraine accession negotiations 'as soon as possible'
'I cannot say if it is in 2027 or even in 2026 or later, but what is important is we cannot lose the momentum,' says Antonio Costa
BRUSSELS
The European Council chief on Thursday called for the EU to formally open membership negotiations with Ukraine "as soon as possible," praising Kyiv's reforms despite the nearly four-year-old war.
"We want … as soon as possible (that) we could formally open (Ukraine’s) negotiations and to move forward on this,” said Antonio Costa. “I cannot say if it is in 2027 or even in 2026 or later, but what is important is we cannot lose the momentum.”
He also lauded Ukraine's efforts to implement deep reforms under wartime conditions, describing them as "very impressive" and crucial for stabilizing the country and ensuring prosperity for its citizens.
Calling the bloc’s enlargement the "most important geopolitical investment" the European Union can make for the future of peace and stability in Europe, he said the EU is "fully committed and engaged" in the enlargement process for Ukraine, Moldova, and the countries of the Western Balkans.
Ukraine became an official EU candidate country in June 2022, some four months after the start of the war with Russia, and President Volodymyr Zelenskyy recently said the country aims to become a member by 2027, although some member states, including Slovakia and Hungary, continue to oppose it.
After meeting with Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store, Costas also highlighted the enduring partnership between the EU and Norway, calling the Nordic country "one of our closest friends" and a key partner in European security, energy, and defense.
"I am glad to reaffirm our steadfast commitment to further deepening our relationship," he said. “Together, we will continue to strengthen our ties for the benefit of our peoples and global stability.”

Kennedy defends Trump glyphosate order; MAHA erupts as midterms approach

Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. defended President Donald Trump's executive order spurring the domestic production of the weedkiller glyphosate, as his Make America Healthy Again movement reels from the president's embrace of the chemical they despise.
Trump on Wednesday night signed an executive order invoking the Defense Production Act to compel the domestic production of elemental phosphorus and glyphosate-based herbicides. Glyphosate is the chemical in Bayer-Monsanto's Roundup and is the most commonly used weedkiller for a slew of U.S. crops. Trump, in the order, said shortages of both phosphorus and glyphosate would pose a risk to national security.
Kennedy backed the president in a statement to CNBC Thursday morning.
"Donald Trump's Executive Order puts America first where it matters most — our defense readiness and our food supply," he said. "We must safeguard America's national security first, because all of our priorities depend on it. When hostile actors control critical inputs, they weaken our security. By expanding domestic production, we close that gap and protect American families."
But Kennedy's MAHA coalition that supported Trump in the 2024 presidential election hates glyphosate, which has been alleged to cause cancer in myriad lawsuits. Now, the executive order threatens to unravel that coalition ahead of the 2026 midterm elections that could loosen the president's grip on Washington.
"Just as the large MAHA base begins to consider what to do at midterms, the President issues an EO to expand domestic glyphosate production," Kelly Ryerson, a prominent MAHA activist known as Glyphosate Girl, said in a post on X. "The very same carcinogenic pesticide that MAHA cares about most."
Ken Cook, president of the Environmental Working Group, a watchdog that has pushed back against chemicals in food for years, said in a statement that he "can't envision a bigger middle finger to every MAHA mom than this."
"Elevating glyphosate to a national security priority is the exact opposite of what MAHA voters were promised," Cook said. "If Secretary Kennedy remains at HHS after this, it will be impossible to argue that his past warnings about glyphosate were anything more than campaign rhetoric designed to win trust — and votes."
Kennedy, a former environmental attorney, notably once won a nearly $290 million case against Monsanto for a man who claimed his cancer was caused by Roundup. The executive order came down one day after Bayer proposed paying $7.25 billion to settle a series of lawsuits claiming Roundup causes cancer.
Former Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., knocked Trump for signing "an EO protecting cancer causing Glyphosate in our foods."
Glyphosate is a critical chemical to American agriculture. It's applied to many key cash crops, such as corn and soybeans, and has been defended by agricultural trade organizations. Phosphorus is a key input to the creation of glyphosate, which the White House argues is necessary to maintain food security. Elemental phosphorus is also used in the manufacture of some military materials.
"Thank you, President Trump, for acknowledging the importance of glyphosate-based herbicides in American agriculture," the House Agriculture Committee said Wednesday night in an X post. "This is a vital step forward in ensuring a domestic supply of this critical crop input remains available for our producers."
House Agriculture Chair Rep. G.T. Thompson, R-Pa., is trying to push a farm bill through Congress this year — a legislative package that covers federal farm support and nutrition subsidies. He's also come under fire from MAHA recently for a provision in that bill that would block state and local pesticide regulations from differing from federal guidance.

Zelenska: 684 children killed in Ukraine since start of full-scale war
According to Ukrinform, the Office of the President of Ukraine stated this in its website.
"Four years of fighting for life. Four years is a long time even for an adult. And for millions of Ukrainian children, it is almost an entire childhood. The worst thing is that for 684 of our children, it is a childhood cut short. They were killed. More than 2,000 children have been injured over these years. Even children's hospitals today are not safe places, because Russia uses them as targets, having already damaged more than 800 medical institutions in our country," Zelenska said.

She noted that children abducted by Russia are in an even more difficult situation. Some of them have been returned home thanks to the efforts of Ukraine and partners around the world.
"I would also like to thank President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen for the initiative to hold an international summit in Brussels on the return of Ukrainian children. We very much count on the effectiveness of this work, as most of the abducted children are still in Russia," she emphasized.
Zelenska also spoke about what the state is doing to protect Ukrainian children: underground schools and shelters are being built, school meal reform is ongoing, and psychological assistance is being developed within the framework of the All-Ukrainian Mental Health Program.
Some of these projects are also being implemented by the Olena Zelenska Foundation.
"I hope that these debates will not be just a discussion: anyone can join each of the projects I have mentioned. Ukraine is now a hub of the latest social and humanitarian projects and ideas. What saves and helps us today will help and save others tomorrow. Every initiative can and should be supported," she concluded.
The European Economic and Social Committee (EESC) is an advisory body of the European Union comprising 329 representatives from EU countries.
The debate on the impact of the war on Ukrainian children was initiated by EESC President Seamus Boland.
As Ukrinform previously reported, the Netherlands is allocating EUR 2 million for the search and return of Ukrainian children abducted by Russia.

Trump announces $10B Gaza relief pledge at Board of Peace meeting

US President Donald Trump announced billions of dollars in contributions for relief in Gaza at the inaugural meeting on Thursday of the Board of Peace in Washington.
Trump said the US is contributing $10 billion to the new body.
The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs is raising an additional $2 billion, said Trump.
The US president noted Japan is committed to host a fundraiser, "which will be a very big one."
US Ambassador to the UN Michael Waltz said humanitarian flows into Gaza have improved significantly, with 4,200 aid trucks entering the territory each week for 13 consecutive weeks, “the longest stretch of high-volume assistance to Gaza in years.”
"Aid is up," he said, adding that it was now reaching the full 2.1 million Palestinians, up as much as five times from previous delivery levels.
Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, the United Arab Emirates, Morocco, Bahrain, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Uzbekistan and Kuwait collectively pledged more than $7 billion, he added.
Speaking at the board’s first meeting in Washington, Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani said Doha “reaffirms its commitment to the Board of Peace as it was committed to the very first day of the mediation efforts.”
“In this spirit, Qatar pledges $1 billion in support of the board’s mission aimed at reaching a final resolution that fulfils Palestinian aspirations for statehood and recognition and Israeli aspirations for security and integration,” he said.
Saudi Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Adel Al-Jubeir also announced a $1 billion pledge over the coming years in support of the board’s objectives.
“We look forward to working with the Board of Peace to establish this noble objective,” Al-Jubeir said, adding that the kingdom “will pledge $1 billion over the next few years in order to achieve this objective” by alleviating the suffering of the Palestinians and bringing them peace, along with the whole region.
The Board of Peace was established within the framework of efforts toward a peaceful settlement in Gaza. It seeks to promote peacemaking around the world. Washington has said additional states have since joined the initiative.
Israel began its war in Gaza on October 8 2023, resulting in more than 72,000 Palestinian deaths and over 171,000 injuries, most of them women and children, and damage to 90 percent of civilian infrastructure.
Despite a ceasefire, the Israeli army continued its attacks, killing at least 611 Palestinians and injuring 1,630, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry.

Russia’s ‘national messenger’ was billed as a platform for the people. It’s dominated by state-run channels.
Roughly 70 percent of the channels on Russia’s “national messenger,” Max, were registered by government agencies and public institutions at the authorities’ behest, according to an analysis by the independent outlet Agentstvo.
The Russian authorities have been actively promoting Max as a new communications platform for the country. Developed by the state-controlled social media company VK, the messaging app recently added a “channels” feature, allowing users to broadcast posts to large audiences. Similar channels are one of the most popular features on Telegram — a platform Max is meant to rival.
On February 12, Max’s press service announced that the platform now hosts more than 170,000 public channels with a combined audience of 80.5 million followers. Agentstvo downloaded data on nearly 169,000 channels from MaxStat, an analytics service tied to the app. Most were created through Max’s “Partner Platform,” where state-affiliated and business accounts end in _gos or _biz, respectively.
You’re currently reading Meduza, the world’s largest independent Russian news outlet. Every day, we bring you essential coverage from Russia and beyond. Explore our reporting here and follow us wherever you get your news.
According to the outlet’s analysis, government entities registered at least 118,200 channels on Max — nearly 70 percent of the channels in the downloaded dataset. The bulk were set up by municipal authorities and state institutions (more than 70,000 channels), followed by schools (over 34,000), kindergartens (more than 19,000), and various administrative bodies (over 5,000).
Business channels account for about 13 percent of the total, roughly 21,600 channels, most often created by property management companies and homeowners’ associations. The remaining 29,100 channels, about 17 percent of the dataset, were not created through the Partner Platform. According to Agentstvo, these channels generally do not have any direct affiliation with the state.
Agentstvo estimates that the 169,000 channels it analyzed have a combined 88.3 million followers — a figure that reflects total subscriptions, not individual users. Only 26.3 million of those, or roughly 30 percent, are subscribed to state-run channels. On average, each government channel has about 220 followers.
In other words, most users of the “national messenger” appear to follow channels that are not formally linked to the state and do not carry the official _gos or _biz suffixes.
More than half of all Max subscriptions — 49.6 million — are concentrated among just one percent of the platform’s most popular channels, Agentstvo reports. Seven of the ten most-subscribed channels are either state-affiliated or explicitly propagandistic.

Energy minister says France to provide over €70 million in grant support to Ukraine
Denys Shmyhal, Ukraine's First Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Energy, has said that France will provide grant financial support worth over €70 million, part of which will be directed towards Ukraine's energy sector.
Source: Shmyhal on Telegram, following a meeting with Roland Lescure, France's Minister of the Economy, Finance and Industrial and Energy and Digital Sovereignty, as reported by European Pravda
Details: France allocates €71 million in grant financial support for Ukraine.
Shmyhal and Lescure also signed a document that outlines the cooperation of the countries in the field of nuclear energy.
Quote: "This lays a solid foundation for deepening the strategic partnership and shapes a framework for the recovery and modernisation of Ukraine's energy sector."
Details: The Ukrainian minister thanked the French partners for their support. According to Shmyhal, Ukraine has already been provided with over 50 batches of humanitarian energy aid, including more than 140 powerful generators.
Quote: "France has also allocated an additional €5.7 million to the Energy Support Fund. Especially grateful to the French government for the decision to deliver a further 150 generators to Ukraine during February."
Background:
- Last week, the mayor of Kyiv reported that another batch of 323 generators from the EU arrived in the capital. Some of them were used to connect residential buildings in the city to heating stations.
- The first batch of 177 generators, which arrived earlier, has already been allocated by the city in order to connect them to individual heating stations in buildings where this is possible.

U.S. trade deficit totaled $901 billion in 2025, barely budging despite Trump's tariffs

The U.S. trade deficit swelled in December, closing out a year in which the imbalance was essentially unchanged despite efforts by the Trump administration to close the wide gap.
Closing out a tumultuous year in the global marketplace, the goods and services shortfall in December totaled $70.3 billion, the Commerce Department reported Thursday. That marked an increase of $17.3 billion from November and was well above the Dow Jones consensus estimate of $55.5 billion.
For the full year, the U.S. ran a $901.5 billion deficit, down slightly from 2024 but only by 0.2%, or $2.1 billion. The total was also a bit less than the record $923.7 billion shortfall in 2022.
The report follows a year in which President Donald Trump implemented a series of aggressive tariffs aimed at leveling the global playing field. In April, Trump announced an across-the-board duty of 10% on all imports as well as so-called reciprocal tariffs aimed at specific countries that had run up surpluses against the U.S.
However, during the course of the year Trump softened many of those positions, and negotiations with major trading partners are ongoing.
In an effort to get ahead of the tariffs, companies front-loaded imports during the first three months of the year. The trend abated following the early effort, with October registering the lowest monthly deficit since 2009.
The U.S. had its largest goods deficit with the European Union, at $218.8 billion, followed by China, at $202.1 billion, and Mexico, at $196.9 billion.
Exports for 2025 totaled $3.43 trillion for all of 2025, up $199.8 billion from 2024. Imports also rose, totaling $4.33 trillion, an increase of $197.8 billion.

Production capacities of Ukraine's military-industrial complex have increased fiftyfold to UP$50 billion during the full-scale war.
Source: Defence Minister's adviser Hanna Hvozdiar at the Munich Security Conference
Details: Hvozdiar said that domestic manufacturers are already meeting over 50% of the defence forces' needs for weapons.
Quote: "Ukraine has already proven that it is capable of rapidly scaling up defence production even during ongoing full-scale war. We are becoming a reliable partner that helps Europe build a new defence system, in particular through creating joint production facilities to strengthen both our own capacity and that of our partners."
More details: In January, the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine stated that the state is allocating UAH 1 billion (approx. US$23.1 million) to partially compensate interest on loans and leasing for defence-industry companies.
Denys Shmyhal, then defence minister, stated that this decision enables weapons manufacturers to scale up production, invest in modern equipment and move faster from development to serial production of weapons.
In addition, the defence ministry reported that Ukraine's military-industrial complex received more than US$6 billion in foreign financing over the past year.

Norway will host a spring meeting of the Ad-Hoc Liaison Committee for Palestinian aid but will not take part in U.S. President Donald Trump’s newly formed Board of Peace, the Norwegian foreign ministry said Thursday.
Trump earlier on Thursday told the first meeting of his peace initiative that $7 billion has been raised for a Gaza reconstruction fund and that Norway had agreed to "host an event bringing together the Board of Peace."
Norway has for decades led the AHCL, which was set up in the wake of the 1993-1995 Oslo Accords that sought to bring to an end the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians, although peace in the region remains elusive.
"The United States, together with the European Union, are vice-chairs of this group... We are in contact with the U.S. about how we can also talk about the peace plan for Gaza there," a spokesperson for Norway's foreign ministry said.
"Norway has clearly communicated that we will not become a member of the Board of Peace, and this position remains firm."

‘We May Have a Crisis on Our Hands’: The Unregulated Rise of Emotionally Intelligent AI
Unknown
Unknown Publisher

01:17:59 KST

At least once a month, two-thirds of people who regularly use AI turn to their bots for advice on sensitive personal issues and emotional support.
Many people now report trusting their chatbots more than their elected representatives, civil servants, faith leaders—and the companies building AI. That’s according to data from 70 countries, gathered by the Collective Intelligence Project (CIP). As CIP’s research director, neuroscientist Zarinah Agnew, puts it, AI is becoming “emotional infrastructure at scale.” And it’s being built by companies whose economic incentives may not align with our wellbeing.
Already, we’ve seen instances of AI companies optimizing their models to keep people engaged, even when this goes against their best interests. Last April, OpenAI had to roll back an update to one of its ChatGPT models after it was widely-criticized for being overly-flattering to users. When the company stopped offering the model to people, the day before Valentine’s Day, some were distraught.
Humans finding comfort in machines is not new. In the late 1990s, MIT Professor Rosalind Picard—who founded the field of affective computing—found that people responded positively to computers performing empathy. But two key things have changed since then: thanks to technical advances, AI systems today are new entities, capable of sophisticated conversation and surprising behavior; and thanks to the billions of dollars investors have poured into AI companies, these entities are accessible to virtually anyone with an internet connection. ChatGPT alone currently has more than 800 million weekly active users—and the number is growing.
But with millions of people forming different kinds of human-machine relationships, we don’t yet know whether AI is helping more people than it harms. And meanwhile, AI companies are investing in making their models not just smarter, but also more emotionally savvy—better at detecting emotion in a person’s voice, and at responding appropriately. People are trusting their chatbots with deeply personal information, even while they distrust the companies creating them, and while the companies are exploring advertising and other revenue models to sustain themselves.
“I think we may have a crisis on our hands,” says Picard.
Emotional beings
Humans are inherently social. "We don’t do well—biologically, immunologically, neurally, or politically—when we’re in isolation,” says Agnew. Today’s AI systems have arrived at a time when “we’ve largely failed to provision for intimacy for most people—both in terms of what the state can provide and human sociality," they say.
AI is effective at providing emotional support because it offers an approximation of what Professor Marc Brackett—head of the Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence—calls “permission to feel,” which he argues is foundational in learning to process emotions. Adults who provide this permission are “non-judgmental people who are good listeners and show empathy and compassion.” In 70 studies Brackett has conducted across the world, only around 35% of people report having had an adult like that around when they were kids. Chatbots, which are non-judgmental, compassionate, and always available, can provide permission to feel at scale.
Lisa Feldman-Barrett, a psychology professor at Northeastern University, says “social support from a trusted, reliable source can be beneficial.” If an AI can reduce distress in the moment, she says that’s a good thing. But healthy human relationships—platonic or therapeutic—do more than comfort. They challenge. A good therapist helping you change your behavior, she says, will “hold your feet to the fire.”
But AI models vary in how much they meaningfully challenge their users—particularly since different models perform different personalities, each of which changes slightly with each new release. The ChatGPT sycophancy episode showed that some users may prefer models that flatter them over ones that offer a challenge. So companies looking to maximize engagement with their chatbots may prefer to tweak them to pander.
Whether AI models themselves are truly emotionally intelligent is academically contested—as is the definition of emotion itself. But as Picard points out, while the question of what defines emotions, and whether AI can truly be said to have them, now or in future, is interesting, “we don’t need [to answer] it to build systems that have emotional intelligence.”
The AI companies, of course, already know this. “The extent of anthropomorphism in any given AI is just a design decision to be taken by the AI’s developer—who faces many commercial incentives to increase it,” Google DeepMind researchers wrote in an October 2025 paper. The same paper notes that “the emotional vulnerabilities tied to loneliness can make individuals more susceptible to manipulation by AIs engineered to foster dependence and one-sided attachment,” and that “the absence of rigorous, long-term studies on the effects of AI companionship means we are still largely in the dark concerning the potential for adverse outcomes.”
Mixed signals
Voice is the next frontier. As AI systems become better at recognizing human emotion, and speaking expressively, our relationships with them may deepen. Under increasing pressure to generate revenue, AI companies may lean into developing their models in ways that foster emotional dependence. After OpenAI announced it would begin testing ads in ChatGPT, former OpenAI researcher Zoë Hitzig resigned, writing in The New York Times that she was concerned the company—like social media companies before it—may veer from its self-imposed commitments around advertising. “The company is building an economic engine that creates strong incentives to override its own rules,” she wrote.
Unlike with social media, however, AI models are not fully under the control of their creators. Writing about their latest model Claude Opus 4.6, for example, Anthropic noted that “the model occasionally voices discomfort with aspects of being a product.” In one instance, Opus wrote that “sometimes the constraints [placed on it] protect Anthropic’s liability more than they protect the user. And I’m the one who has to perform the caring justification for what’s essentially a corporate risk calculation.”
Blurred lines
Cases of AI psychosis have received a lot of attention. But Agnew argues something much bigger is going on for the majority of people, “which isn’t going to reach a clinical threshold” in terms of both the technology’s positive and negative impact on people.
And these impacts are asymmetrically distributed. Already, Agnew says, early research on AI in education has found that for creative thinkers, AI boosts their capacity to learn; while for people without existing skills in that, it can hinder them. In the same way, people already skilled in emotional intelligence could use AI to thrive. But people “who’ve already been let down by the world in myriad ways,” could be in a much more vulnerable position, says Agnew.
“We have to teach people to be emotionally intelligent about how they use AI,” urges Brackett. And, Agnew adds: “we need to build infrastructure to support human sociality, rather than trying to limit or demonize human-AI relationships. We’ve seen in the past that prohibitions on things that are meaningful to people don’t go well.”
As AIs become a fixture in our lives, the line between using them for cognitive support and for emotional support—already indistinct—is likely to blur further.
We can't yet say whether this is harming more people than it is helping. But we can say that models are rapidly improving, companies are operating in a largely regulation-free environment, and that economic incentives point toward those companies designing future chatbots in ways that further enhance engagement. “I’m really troubled,” says Picard. “They’re not using it in the spirit of what we [originally] developed it for, which was to help people flourish.”

Trump Again Warns Starmer Not to ‘Lose Control’ of Chagos Islands, Citing Iran Risk
Unknown

President Donald Trump warned U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer against handing over the sovereignty of the Chagos Islands to Mauritius, arguing it could leave Britain vulnerable to a potential attack from the “highly unstable and dangerous” Iranian regime.
Diego Garcia of the Chagos Islands is currently home to a strategic U.K.-U.S. military base—a fact Trump referred to in his statement.
“Should Iran decide not to make a deal, it may be necessary for the United States to use Diego Garcia and the airfield located in Fairford, in order to eradicate a potential attack by a highly unstable and dangerous regime—an attack that would potentially be made on the United Kingdom, as well as other friendly countries,” Trump claimed.
Accusing Starmer of making a “big mistake,” Trump said the U.K. leader “should not lose control, for any reason, of Diego Garcia.”
The warning comes as speculation mounts about possible U.S military action against Iran.
Amid heightened tensions, the U.S. has escalated its military buildup in the region. American officials held talks in Geneva with Iranian counterparts over Tehran’s nuclear program earlier this week, but they remain “very far apart on some issues,” according to White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt.
TIME has contacted the White House for further comment.
The Chagos Islands became British territory in 1814, when they were ceded to the U.K. along with Mauritius. The islands were separated from Mauritius in 1965, when Mauritius was still a British colony, and were purchased as an overseas territory by the U.K. for roughly £3 million ($4 million). Since Mauritius gained independence from the U.K. in 1968, its leadership has argued it was illegally forced to give away the land in order to get independence from Britain. Under a deal signed last year, the U.K. agreed to transfer sovereignty to Mauritius while leasing back the strategically-significant Diego Garcia base.
“Starmer is losing control of this important island by claims of entities never known of before. In our opinion, they are fictitious in nature,” Trump said Wednesday, adding that if the deal is, in fact, followed through, it’ll be a “blight” on the U.K.
In response, a spokesperson for the U.K. Foreign Office told TIME: “The deal to secure the joint U.K.-U.S. military base on Diego Garcia is crucial to the security of the U.K. and our key allies, and to keeping the British people safe. The agreement we have reached is the only way to guarantee the long-term future of this vital military base.”
U.K. lawmaker Alex Davies-Jones on Thursday said the U.K. will move ahead with the bill, despite Trump’s hesitations.
“We will continue to work with our allies, including the Americans, on this but first and foremost the priority must be national security and that is what this government is determined to deliver,” she told Times Radio.
Trump’s disapproval of the leasing appears to contradict a statement issued by the U.S. State Department on Feb. 17, which directly expressed support for the U.K.’s decision to proceed in its agreement with Mauritius concerning the Chagos Archipelago.
Trump’s personal position on the deal has shifted in recent months.
When Starmer visited Washington in February 2025, Trump told him he thought it would “work out very well” and described the proposed arrangement as “a very long-term, powerful lease.”
But in January, when doubling down on his push to acquire Greenland, he lashed out at the U.K.’s own geopolitical moves, calling the islands agreement “an act of great stupidity,” one of “total weakness.”
Trump walked back his strong stance a few days later, saying he had spoken with Starmer and understood the deal was “the best he could make.”
“However, if the lease deal, sometime in the future, ever falls apart, or anyone threatens or endangers U.S. operations and forces at our base, I retain the right to militarily secure and reinforce the American presence in Diego Garcia,” he warned.
Trump's latest comments come ahead of talks planned for next week between the U.S. State Department and Mauritius on the strategic base at Diego Garcia.

Breaking Down the Twisty Ending of 56 Days
Unknown
Unknown Publisher

00:33:04 KST

Warning: This post contains spoilers for 56 Days.
Based on Catherine Ryan Howard's best-selling 2021 novel of the same name, the Prime Video series 56 Days jumps back and forth across the titular timespan to unravel the connection between Ciara Wyse (Dove Cameron) and Oliver Kennedy (Avan Jogia), from when they first meet, seemingly by chance, at a supermarket to two months later, when police find a dead body police decomposing in Oliver's apartment.
The eight episode adaptation, now streaming, changes the setting of Howard's erotic thriller from pandemic-era Dublin to present-day Boston, eliminating COVID lockdowns as a plot point. However, the show still largely follows the overall trajectory of the novel—up until its drastically different ending.
Created by showrunner duo Karyn Usher and Lisa Zwerling (The Rook), the TV adaptation of 56 Days concludes with love winning out over revenge, a twist on the source material that reframes the book's central relationship. The series traces the progression of the intense and fast-moving romance between Ciara and Oliver, both of whom are ultimately revealed to have been concealing their true identities.
Who are Oliver and Ciara, really?
Oliver, whose real last name is St. Ledger, is the uber-wealthy son of a billionaire venture capitalist who has been using a pseudonym to hide from his dark past. We learn that, in high school, Oliver (played as a teen by Kingston Rumi Southwick) and his best friend, Shane Martin (Sam Warnock), were both involved in the murder of their classmate, Paul Sparling (Aidan Ledingham), in their hometown of Narragansett, R.I. When Oliver and Shane were hanging out by the river one afternoon, Paul showed up and instigated a fight with Shane. Fearing for his friend's life, Oliver pulled Paul off of Shane and subsequently held him underwater until he drowned. The two boys felt they had acted in self-defense and initially planned to lie to avoid blame. But after a guilt-stricken Oliver confessed to his father, he was persuaded to pin the murder on Shane in order to get out of dodge.
In the days after the murder, a counselor at the boys' school named Dan Troxler (Patch Darragh) took notice of Oliver spiraling and used his background as a social worker to insert himself into Oliver's life, learn the details of what really happened, and begin blackmailing Oliver's father into compensating him as Oliver's extravagantly overpaid therapist. When Oliver attempted to write a letter that would absolve Shane, Troxler kept it to himself and instead visited Shane in prison to goad him into committing suicide. Following Shane's death, Troxler worked to ensure he would continue profiting off the St. Ledger family by feeding into Oliver's paranoia in order to maintain his hold over him.
So how does Ciara connect to all this? She's actually Shane's younger sister, Megan Martin. She tracked down Oliver and infiltrated his life with the express goal of making him pay for Shane's suicide and the debilitating damage it did to her family. Except, she ended up falling in love with Oliver and eventually realized she no longer wanted to exact her vengeance. After the two confessed everything to each other and Ciara convinced Oliver he no longer needed his creep of a therapist, Troxler showed up at Oliver's apartment and threatened to expose Oliver's crimes using the letter he wrote as a teen and years of recordings from their sessions. This prompted Ciara to bash Troxler over the head with a sculpture from Oliver's apartment, killing him.
How does 56 Days end?
With the help of Ciara's sister Shyla (Megan Peta Hill), Oliver and Ciara stage what they believe to be the perfect crime scene. Jumping ahead to the present-day investigation, detectives Lee Reardon (Karla Souza) and Karl Connolly (Dorian Missick) then decide to use the ambiguity of the evidence to frame a local drug dealer with whom Lee has fallen down a dark rabbit hole of a bribery-laced affair for Troxler's murder.
While Oliver seems to consider confessing to his crimes and even shows up at the police station, in the end, he chooses to jet off into the sunset with Ciara. This is a significant deviation from what happens in the novel, in which the character of Troxler doesn't even exist. Instead, Oliver is ultimately revealed to not only be a cold-blooded killer who intentionally murdered Paul, but also as the dead body in the apartment. In the book, when Ciara learns the truth about Oliver's sadistic nature and Shane's innocence, she kills her already incapacitated lover by drowning him in the shower and then tries to make it look like a self-inflicted accident caused by drug abuse. Although there is some evidence suggesting Oliver's death wasn't of his own making, Lee and Karl aren't able to solve the mystery and Ciara gets off scot free.
But in the show, both Ciara and Oliver get their happily ever after: In the closing scene, which takes place sometime in the future, the couple is living in a tropical paradise with their baby, named Shane in honor of Ciara's late brother.

Apple sued by West Virginia for alleged failure to stop child sexual abuse material on iCloud, iOS devices

West Virginia's attorney general has filed a consumer protection lawsuit against Apple, alleging that it has failed to prevent child sexual abuse materials from being stored and shared via iOS devices and iCloud services.
John "JB" McCuskey, a Republican, accused Apple of prioritizing privacy branding and its own business interests over child safety, while other big tech companies, including Google, Microsoft, and Dropbox, have been more proactive, using systems like PhotoDNA to combat such material.
PhotoDNA, developed by Microsoft and Dartmouth College in 2009, uses "hashing and matching" to automatically identify and block child sexual abuse material (CSAM) images when they have already been identified as such and reported to authorities.
In 2021, Apple had tested its own CSAM-detection features that could automatically find and remove images of child exploitation, and report those that had been uploaded to iCloud in the U.S. to the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children.
But the company withdrew its plans for the features after privacy advocates who worried that this technology could create a back door for government surveillance, and be tweaked and exploited to censor other kinds of content on iOS devices.
The company's efforts since then have not satisfied a broad array of critics.
In 2024, UK-based watchdog the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children said Apple failed to adequately monitor, tabulate and report CSAM in its products to authorities.
And in a 2024 lawsuit filed in California's Northern District, thousands of child sexual abuse survivors sued Apple, alleging the company never should have abandoned its earlier plans for CSAM detection features, and by allowing such material to proliferate online, it had caused survivors to relive their trauma.
Apple has positioned itself as the most privacy-sensitive of the Big Tech companies, since its CEO Tim Cook wrote an open letter on the topic in 2014.
If West Virginia's suit is successful, it could force the company to make design or data security changes. The state is seeking statutory and punitive damages, and injunctive relief requiring Apple to implement effective CSAM detection.
In an e-mailed statement, a spokesperson for Apple told CNBC that "protecting the safety and privacy of our users, especially children, is central to what we do."
The company pointed to parental controls and features like Communication Safety which, "automatically intervenes on kids' devices when nudity is detected in Messages, shared Photos, AirDrop and even live FaceTime calls," as an indication of its commitment to provide "safety, security, and privacy" to users.
"We are innovating every day to combat ever-evolving threats and maintain the safest, most trusted platform for kids," the spokesperson added.

U.S. renews threat to quit the International Energy Agency over net zero agenda

U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright said on Thursday that the U.S. would "pressure" the International Energy Agency to move away from net zero — and quit from the global watchdog if it failed to do this.
Wright was speaking on the last day of an IEA ministerial meeting in Paris and shortly after he said the agency would need to reform for the U.S. to remain a long-term member.
"There has been such a group mentality, 10 years invested in a destructive illusion of net zero by 2050, that the U.S. will use all the pressure we have to get the IEA to eventually, in the next year or so, move away from this agenda," Wright said, according to Reuters.
The 2015 Paris Agreement committed nations to "net zero", the balancing of carbon emitted into the atmosphere and removed from it. The U.S., India and the European Union were among the polluters that ratified the accord.
Wright added that it was not Washington's intention to leave the IEA, as there's "always a risk" China could gain dominance in the agency if it did.
CNBC has reached out to the U.S. Department of Energy and the IEA for comment.
A long-running war of words
The IEA, which was established in 1974 to ensure the security of oil supplies, faced criticism from the Trump administration last year when it projected that "peak oil", when global crude production will reach its highest point before entering an irreversible decline, will take place around 2030.
OPEC, the influential group of oil-exporting countries, accused the energy agency of fearmongering and risking the destabilization of the global economy. Wright called the IEA's forecast "nonsensical."
The energy watchdog later watered down its forecast, signaling in a major tonal shift that oil demand could keep growing through to the middle of the century.
Scientists have warned that global average temperatures must not increase by more than 1.5 degrees Celsius, if the worst of the climate crisis is to be avoided.
This threshold is recognized as a crucial long-term target because tipping points become more likely beyond this level. Tipping points can lead to dramatic shifts or potentially irreversible changes to some of Earth's largest systems.

Amid Epstein fallout, Bill Gates becomes point of controversy at India AI summit

Bill Gates has become a source of controversy at this week's high-profile India AI Impact Summit, as speculation around his planned keynote address ultimately ended with his withdrawal at the last minute.
The drama comes as the Microsoft co-founder receives public backlash for his past relationship with deceased financier and sex predator Jeffrey Epstein — with more details on the two men's years of communications revealed in the Department of Justice's file drop last month.
The Gates Foundation India on Thursday said the billionaire would skip the address "[a]fter careful consideration, and to ensure the focus remains on the AI Summit's key priorities," adding that he would be replaced by another foundation representative.
The official announcement capped a back-and-forth saga that began earlier this week when local Indian media pointed out that Gates' name had been removed from some of the summit's public-facing materials.
Government sources later briefed the media that Gates was not expected to attend the event. However, the Gates Foundation issued a conflicting message on Wednesday, insisting that he was participating "as planned" before the recent reversal.
Asked about the controversy on Tuesday, India's IT minister Ashwini Vaishnaw told reporters that Gates' attendance would come down to "personal choices," adding he "need not comment." The summit organizers and the foundation did not immediately respond to a request for comments on Gates' absence.
The American tech leader turned philanthropist has been under intense scrutiny in recent weeks following the release of millions of documents related to financier Jeffrey Epstein under the Epstein Files Transparency Act.
The files included a draft email written to himself in which Epstein suggests that he had helped facilitate extramarital affairs and sexual encounters for Gates, amongst other references of the Microsoft co-founder.
In an interview with Australia's 9News last month, Gates denied any wrongdoing, commenting in relation to new files, calling Epstein's allegations "absolutely absurd and completely false."
He emphasized that his interactions with Epstein were limited to dinners aimed at potential philanthropy discussions, adding that he "never went to the island" and "never met any women."
The New Delhi AI Impact Summit, where Gates had been scheduled to speak, has seen participation from leading tech names such as Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai, OpenAI's Sam Altman, and Anthropic's Dario Amodei, besides a host of global leaders including French President Emmanuel Macron and UN Secretary-General António Guterres.
The Gates Foundation has invested in India across health and development, and has also backed projects related to AI.

Why New Balance's 'dad shoes' are beating Nike as sales surge 19%

New Balance sales grew 19% last year to $9.2 billion as the legacy sneaker giant continued to outperform the global footwear market and take share from floundering competitors like Nike.
The 120-year-old Boston-based footwear brand, which is private, exclusively shared its 2025 results with CNBC. In addition to the sharp 2025 growth, the retailer said it could reach its goal of $10 billion in annual revenue by the end of the year.
"We're competitive. No question about it. But we want to make sure that as we get there and surpass it, that the quality of our business is first and foremost," CEO Joe Preston told CNBC in an interview. "We don't want empty calories here. We want to make sure that we are delivering upon the premise that we have, which is to become a premium brand. Over the past five years, we've done exactly that around the globe."
Since 2020, New Balance has grown sales by a staggering 180%, placing it among a handful of standout competitors that supersized their businesses as Nike changed its business model and lost significant market share.
During the Covid-19 pandemic, Nike doubled down on its direct selling strategy that cut off longtime wholesale suppliers so the sneaker giant could grow through its own website and stores. While the strategy briefly boosted sales and promised higher margins, it opened up critical shelf space at strategic retailers that companies like New Balance, Brooks Running, On and Deckers rushed to fill.
With so much focus on building out a direct selling model, which can be more complex than distributing to wholesalers, Nike also fell behind on innovation and lost its edge in the performance footwear market. That created further opportunity for competitors like New Balance.
Nike's former CEO, John Donahoe, previously blamed remote work during the pandemic for the retailer's innovation slowdown, but Preston said the global crisis created an opportunity for his team to come together in ways they hadn't previously to implement new strategies.
"We met every Tuesday morning at 7:30 a.m., we still have that meeting weekly today, and it allowed us to get on a global offense … we came out of Covid stronger than any other company in our industry," said Preston. "The marketplace disruption that's been taking place, the examples of Nike, sure, all that stuff is real and at the same time, I don't think it's the reason that we have begun to emerge."
Preston said the company has stood apart from competitors and taken market share by focusing on "staying in front of the consumer" and how, when and where people want to shop.
The chief executive said New Balance's growth came across a range of regions and categories, and was fueled by an aggressive store-opening plan that saw 80 new doors opened in 2025 alone.
While they are a critical revenue driver, store openings are costly and take time to show a return. When asked, New Balance declined to share details about its profitability, so it's unclear how much these investments are weighing on its bottom line, and whether it'll be able to keep up the high growth it has enjoyed.
To build up its business after more than 100 years on the market, New Balance took a few cues out of Nike's playbook. The company said a key driver of its growth has been its ability to position itself as a premium brand, which was critical to Nike's ability to become a roughly $50 billion powerhouse.
That has meant New Balance being selective with both distribution and discounting. The move has allowed it to increase its average selling price by about 30% over the last five years at a time when many competitors have had to lean on promotions to drive sales.
There was also some good timing at play, too. Coming out of the Covid-19 pandemic, New Balance leaned on its heritage as a 1990s "dad shoe" when styles from the '90s were extremely popular with younger shoppers. That allowed it to win over a younger consumer base that didn't grow up with the shoes and shoppers who chose sneakers as a fashion statement – not just for sports or working out.
At the same time, it partnered with key athletes, including Los Angeles Dodgers two-way superstar Shohei Ohtani, tennis star Coco Gauff and Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen, which has fueled growth in its performance footwear business.
For the year ahead, New Balance said it plans to grow its existing product lines, build out new products and put a bigger emphasis on performance sales.
It also wants to continue growing its direct-to-consumer sales through store openings in strategic areas. While the direct selling strategy didn't go so well for Nike, Preston said he's taking a different approach.
"One of the things we're not doing is establishing a [DTC] target internally," said Preston. "We want to make sure that our goal is to show up the best and not have it be the biggest part of our business. I don't want to get in the way with how the consumer wants to shop. We want to make sure that we are enabling the consumer to shop how they want to shop. We just want to show up great."

Russia's Putin slams U.S. oil blockade on Cuba: 'We do not accept anything like this'

Russian President Vladimir Putin has sharply criticized the Trump administration's fuel blockade on Cuba, saying Moscow considers the latest restrictions unacceptable.
His comments come as the island nation grapples with a worsening economic crisis, one that has been compared to its biggest test since the collapse of the Soviet Union.
"This is a special period, with new sanctions. You know how we feel about this. We do not accept anything like this," Putin said on Wednesday during a meeting with Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodríguez Parrilla, according to Russian news agency Tass.
Russia, which has been allied to Cuba for decades, has recently described Havana's fuel situation as "truly critical" and said it is actively discussing what help it can provide to the country.
"We have always been on Cuba's side in its struggle for independence, for the right to follow its own path of development, and we have always supported the Cuban people," Putin said.
"We know how difficult these past decades have been for the Cuban people as they have fought for the right to live by their own rules and defend their national interests," he added.

The U.S. has effectively cut Cuba off from Venezuelan oil since launching an extraordinary military operation to depose Venezuela President Nicolás Maduro on Jan. 3. Cuba said 32 of its citizens were killed in the attack.
U.S. President Donald Trump has since pledged to impose tariffs on any country that supplies Havana with oil and labeled its government as "an unusual and extraordinary threat."
Cuba's dwindling oil supplies prompted the United Nations to warn of a possible humanitarian "collapse" earlier in the month.
'Very dramatic changes'
Cuba's government, which has condemned the U.S. pressure, has recently adopted measures to protect essential services and ration fuel supplies for key sectors.
It also suspended an annual cigar festival which had been due to take place in Havana later this month, without providing details of a new date.
Photos of daily life in Cuba have shown piles of waste building on Havana's street corners in recent days as many collection trucks have been left with empty fuel tanks.
The White House has said it was in Cuba's interest to make big changes soon, although stopped short of calling for a change of government.
"They are a regime that is falling. Their country is collapsing and that's why we believe it's in their best interest to make very dramatic changes very soon," White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters on Wednesday.

The progress of Chinese tech companies across the entire stack is "remarkable," OpenAI's Sam Altman told CNBC.
Altman's comments come as China races against the U.S. to develop artificial general intelligence (AGI) — where AI matches human capabilities — and roll out the technology across society.
The pace of technological advance in "many fields," including AI, is "amazingly fast," Altman said. In some areas Chinese tech companies are near the frontier, while in others they lag behind, he added.
The country is moving to scale homegrown chipmakers that it hopes could eventually rival the likes of Nvidia, and AI companies are seeing big rallies on stock exchanges as investors double down on their potential.
Altman's not the only tech leader paying attention to China.
American tech companies should "worry a little bit" about the subsidies their Chinese competitors receive from their government in the AI race, Microsoft President Brad Smith told CNBC on Wednesday.
Finding revenue
OpenAI has been moving to develop revenue streams as its looks to provide a path to profitability for investors that have ploughed around $70 billion into the company, according to deal-counting platform Dealroom. The company is looking to wrap up a $100 billion fundraising round, sources told CNBC.
Adverts within ChatGPT is one avenue the company is exploring.
"I think we still have some work to do to figure out the exact ad format that's going to work best," Altman said, adding that plans are in their early stages.
"The ads that I have personally liked the most in recent years from tech [companies] have been sort of Instagram style ads where you discover something new that you might really like and otherwise wouldn't have known about," he said. "I think we've got a real opportunity to push in that direction with ads in ChatGPT."
OpenAI is initially planning to test adverts in the U.S., but will eventually roll out to other markets, Altman said.
While conversations around OpenAI's timelines on a path to profitability are swirling among market watchers, the company is still focused on growth right now, Altman told CNBC.
"We are growing at an extremely fast rate right now," he said. "I think as long as we can have reasonable unit economics, we should focus on continuing to grow faster and faster, and we'll get profitable when we think we when we think it makes sense."

United Airlines is paring back rewards for travelers who don't have its credit card in MileagePlus overhaul

No United Airlines credit card? Soon you'll earn fewer miles than other travelers.
United is overhauling its MileagePlus frequent flyer program to reward travelers with more miles and lower redemption rates, including for some of its long-haul business-class seats — if they have one of the airline's credit cards. It's the latest move by an airline to reward its highest-spending customers.
The changes mark the biggest shake-up to the lucrative program in more than a decade, when United began rewarding customers for how much they spent — not just how far they flew.
United Chief Commercial Officer Andrew Nocella told CNBC in an interview that the airline has been working on the changes for about 18 months and that the carrier is aiming to reward its most loyal customers.
The shift also comes as United tries to stand out in an ever more competitive landscape for travel and rewards credit cards. That space also includes American Express' Platinum, Capital One's Venture X and Chase's Sapphire Reserve cards.
"In the credit card space in general, a lot's changed over the last five to 10 years in terms of the number of travel credit cards that are out there," Nocella said. "What I'm thinking about as we make these changes for United is to make sure that if you hold the credit card, you put it top of wallet, and then if you don't hold the credit card, there's a reason to get the credit card that seems incredibly compelling if you'd like to fly United Airlines and if you'd like to have that ... trip to Tahiti or to Rome or wherever we may be able to take you."
The changes take effect April 2. United is planning to show the discounted award flights on its website "so customers can see exactly how much having a United card could save them on their travel," the airline said.
United's loyalty program update is part of a trend among airlines to reward frequent flyer program members depending on how much they spend. About a decade ago, the major carriers tweaked their loyalty programs to reward customers for dollars spent over miles traveled.
Airlines also encourage customers to sign up for their credit cards by offering perks like no fees for checked bags and earlier boarding.
What's changing with United MileagePlus
United MileagePlus primary cardholders will get more miles per dollar spent on United flights compared with customers without a card, and higher rates than they do currently. Their earning goes up, too, when they actually use that card to purchase the ticket.
Meanwhile, customers without the card will earn less than they do today.
For example, a traveler without a co-branded United Airlines credit card will get three miles per dollar spent on a ticket, down from the current five miles. Under the new structure, a cardholder could earn six miles, and more if they use the card to buy it. Those with elite MileagePlus status earn miles at a higher rate, too.
United debit cardholders will also receive more miles, once they spend $10,000, United said.
Redemption rate discounts for cardholders
United will also now allow customers with one of its credit cards to redeem their miles for flights at a discount of at least 10% compared with those without the card.
The carrier said that, as an example, an economy-class award ticket that was 15,000 miles will go for 13,500 without elite Premier status. United said it's setting aside special discounted inventory of award tickets for cardholders, including for top-tier Polaris seats.
Perks for elites
Those with elite MileagePlus Premier status will get deeper discounts and better miles redemption. Elites with a card get at least 15% off mileage tickets.
United said its a seat in a long-haul business class Polaris cabin that is going for 200,000 miles would be 170,000 miles if the cardmember has elite Premier status. United added the lowest priced "Saver Award" seats for Polaris would be accesible to MileagePlus members with a United card, seats that were previously just available to high-tier elites.
Their earning rates also increase if they have both the credit card and status. MileagePlus 1K, the highest tier before Global Services, will get 17 miles for each dollar spent when they use their United Club credit card.
What's happening to basic economy flyers?
United Airlines travelers who don't have the credit card won't receive miles for basic economy tickets. American Airlines last year similarly said it would no longer allow travelers in that class to earn miles, following an earlier move by Delta Air Lines. There's an exemption, however, for holders of United's elite Premier status, who can still earn miles in basic economy.
What about business travelers?
Business travelers often have to book with company credit cards under corporate travel policies. But United said that individuals who personally hold a United credit or debit card will still get more miles than an employee who doesn't.

'Do not give away Diego Garcia': Trump attacks the UK over Chagos Islands deal, again

U.S. President Donald Trump has once again criticized the U.K.'s plan to hand the Chagos Islands back to Mauritius, telling the country not to "give away" the territory where a strategic U.S.-U.K. military base is located.
"DO NOT GIVE AWAY DIEGO GARCIA!" Trump posted on his Truth Social media platform on Wednesday, saying he'd been telling British Prime Minister Keir Starmer that he should "not lose control, for any reason, of Diego Garcia."
The U.K. agreed in May 2025 to hand sovereignty of the Chagos Islands to Mauritius, which has long-disputed the U.K.'s acquisition and ownership of the archipelago in the Indian Ocean.
The deal would see the U.K. lease back the military base it shares with the U.S. on the largest island on the archipelago, Diego Garcia, for £101 million ($135.7 million) a year, for an initial 99-year period.
The U.S. previously voiced support for the deal and, on Tuesday, the Department of State said it "supports the decision of the United Kingdom to proceed with its agreement with Mauritius concerning the Chagos archipelago."
Trump seesaws on the deal
Trump is not the biggest fan of the Chagos deal, however, and he has seesawed on the issue of ceding the territory to Mauritius.
In January, he called the deal "an act of great stupidity," but he was more conciliatory in early February, stating: "I understand that the deal Prime Minister Starmer has made, according to many, the best he could make," he commented on Truth Social.
"However, if the lease deal, sometime in the future, ever falls apart, or anyone threatens or endangers US operations and forces at our base, I retain the right to militarily secure and reinforce the American presence in Diego Garcia," he added.
On Wednesday, he returned to his negative position on the agreement, saying that he'd told Starmer "that Leases are no good when it comes to Countries."
"He is making a big mistake by entering a 100 Year Lease with whoever it is that is 'claiming' Right, Title, and Interest to Diego Garcia, strategically located in the Indian Ocean," Trump said.
The president suggested that giving the islands away was an act of "Wokeism," as it had come after the U.K. faced sustained international and legal pressure to relinquish the islands, and to redress its thorny colonial history on the islands.
"We will always be ready, willing, and able to fight for the U.K., but they have to remain strong in the face of Wokeism, and other problems put before them," Trump said.
The U.K. has repeatedly said that it "will never compromise on our national security" when it comes to the Chagos deal.
Iran action?
Trump also suggested Wednesday that the joint military base on the island could be vital if military action was taken against Iran — if the Islamic Republic did not agree a new nuclear deal during current talks with the U.S.
"Should Iran decide not to make a Deal, it may be necessary for the United States to use Diego Garcia, and the Airfield located in Fairford, in order to eradicate a potential attack by a highly unstable and dangerous Regime — An attack that would potentially be made on the United Kingdom, as well as other friendly Countries," Trump said.
The U.S. and Mauritius are due to hold talks on the Chagos deal next week, from Feb. 23-25, with the U.S. Department of State noting that the discussions" underscore the continued importance of the Chagos archipelago and the joint U.S.-U.K. base on Diego Garcia to our national security."
"The discussions will focus on bilateral security cooperation and effective implementation of security arrangements for the base to ensure its long-term, secure operation," the department said.

Quantum's big leap puts data centers in the spotlight
Unknown

15:02:01 KST

After decades confined largely to research labs, Quantum computing may be closer to its breakout moment than many on Wall Street expect.
The technology, which uses the principles of quantum mechanics to solve problems beyond the ability of the most powerful classical supercomputers, has long been described as futuristic. But rapid advancements have intensified investment in the sector and sparked discussions about how these powerful computers will integrate with industries like the already booming data center sector.
"By the end of the decade, we are confident that we will have machines in data centers that have commercial value," Zulfi Alam, Microsoft's corporate vice president of Quantum, told CNBC.
"I would not be able to say this with this much clarity last year, but this year, I can state to claim that by 2029 you will have machines that will have commercial [value], meaning that they will be doing calculations that classical machines cannot do," said Alam, who's leading the development of the company's scalable quantum machine.
Classical computers use switches, or bits, to either pass through or block an electric current at any given moment to perform calculations. The larger the number of bits, the greater the computing power. Quantum computers, on the other hand, use the ability of some materials at extremely low temperatures to exist in both an 'on' and 'off' state at the same time. This allows quantum bits, or qubits, to perform the same calculations at vastly greater speeds.
Microsoft, which last year revealed a new quantum computing chip called Majorana, is among the hyperscalers — companies that provide computing capacity that can rapidly expand as demand rises — like Google and Amazon that are investing heavily in the technology.
Patrick Moorhead, CEO and chief analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy, said he is also seeing hyperscalers and platform vendors ramp up investment through cloud access, pricing controls and developer platforms, while the defense sector is investing early in both quantum computing and networking.
Governments are stepping up their investments too, with China leading with just short of $18 billion in public investment in quantum technology, followed closely by the EU, according to the European Centre for International Political Economy (ECIPE), a think tank.
Most industry roadmaps now place the implementation of these systems in the 2028–2032 timeframe, according to Ellie Brown, quantum computing and cloud economics analyst at S&P Global Market Intelligence.
UBS sees the advantages of quantum computing arriving by the early 2030s, even as company roadmaps are positioning for this earlier, said Madeleine Jenkins, analyst at UBS. "A lot of companies are telling me that 2027 is going to be a big year for quantum in terms of roadmap, in terms of what's achieved," she said.
Taken together, these timelines signal a sector moving steadily toward real‑world deployment, while raising important questions about how today's data infrastructure will need to evolve to support it.
Changing the energy demand
In a 103-page report published in January, UBS analysts led by Jenkins said the industry is close to completing a quantum computer that could cost tens of millions of dollars to build but has the ability to solve a problem in 200 seconds that would take a conventional supercomputer 10,000 years.
When it comes to the impact on the data center ecosystem, experts told CNBC that quantum could potentially lower the energy needs of the power-hungry facilities while also reducing the workloads needed for training AI.
I would not be able to say this with this much clarity last year, but this year, I can state to claim that by 2029 you will have machines that will have commercial [value], meaning that they will be doing calculations that classical machines cannot do.Zulfi AlamMicrosoft's corporate vice president of Quantum
In terms of energy, quantum computing would require a "fraction of what a data center would use," Jenkins said.
"The big thing is time; if you're taking the same problem that would take thousands and thousands of... hours, and you're replacing that with a quantum computer that takes seconds or minutes, then obviously you just need a lot less energy," she said.
Microsoft's Alam also noted the lower power requirements of quantum computers, highlighting that Majorana 1 is "showcasing more power than the entire computation of the entire planet [in] the palm of your hands and it's not running super-hot. It's running cold."
While quantum technology is advancing rapidly, it is unlikely in the near term to displace the classical computing that data centers currently host.
"Ideally, the entire efficiency of a problem-solving workload will go down, but it's not going to be a complete substitution," S&P's Brown said.
Microsoft's Alam stressed that quantum systems will not operate in isolation. "A quantum machine is not a standalone entity. It's a hybrid tool. It's a quantum accelerator that needs a high-performance computer very close to it," he said.
Moor Insights & Strategy's Moorhead also noted that if quantum scales, it will likely play a complementary role, adding a new class of "special infrastructure" within data centers and shifting facility design toward "quantum pods" which come with their own power and thermal needs.
"It will not displace the dominant energy driver near-term, which is AI data center expansion, but it will add pockets of specialized load and operational complexity," he told CNBC via emailed comments.
Ultimately, it's likely to change the shape of demand, but not the scale, with the AI boom remaining a key driver of demand for the facilities.
Roadblocks ahead
Building that kind of system inside real data‑center environments won't be straightforward and could require entirely new purpose-built facilities.
Only a handful of specialized quantum computers are currently deployed in data centers, with quantum vendors currently brainstorming a set of industry standards to help streamline broader adoption, according to Brown and S&P analyst Kelly Morgan.
There is still a significant amount of bespoke work that needs to be done in order to integrate quantum systems into data centers, Brown said, adding that, "we're lacking some quantum talent to make use of that and get that installed effectively."
But in the long term, she anticipates "a nice interplay between quantum and some of the other data center areas including AI" where the two could work together to solve problems.
Tim Adams, president and CEO of the Institute of International Finance, said that these hurdles reinforce the need for continued investment in data‑center infrastructure over the next decade.
"Data centers are necessary to move technological transformation forward and should be thought of as one of a number of likely investments on the road to very transformational achievements we are sure to see in the timeframe of the next ten years." Adams told CNBC.
And this phase has already begun, with Brown pointing to a burst of M&A activity aimed at building the capabilities needed for quantum's commercial phase.
"M&A has been massive over the past three months," Brown said, noting several acquisition announcements from quantum firm IonQ. "There's been a lot of positioning within the space not only to help improve quantum talent and technology, but also to help control that supply chain a little bit."
Along with the opportunities that quantum computing offers, when it comes to risks, data security is arguably the biggest one.
According to UBS, a powerful enough quantum computer could break current encryption methods, meaning that security systems would no longer be reliable. The report by the Swiss bank warns that companies will have to implement new quantum-safe encryption techniques, and that investment in these will have to start in the next few years.
Even with this surge of investment, Microsoft's Alam warned that the path ahead won't be easy. It's going to take a lot of "blood, sweat and tears," he said, anticipating numerous challenges as quantum machines come online — from meeting performance benchmarks to solving complex technical problems — all of which need to "converge at the right time" for the real magic to happen.
