Macron visits India to deepen defence ties and AI cooperation
French President Emmanuel Macron arrives in India on Tuesday for a three-day visit focused on artificial intelligence cooperation, defence deals and strengthening strategic ties, with discussions expected on a potential multibillion-dollar Rafale fighter jet agreement.
French President Emmanuel Macron begins a three-day visit to India on Tuesday, with talks focused on artificial intelligence cooperation and a potential multibillion-dollar Dassault Rafale fighter jet deal.
France is seeking to expand its military partnership with New Delhi, with discussions expected on a potential contract for 114 additional French fighter jets.
Macron and his wife Brigitte arrived around midnight on Monday in Mumbai, India’s financial capital, for his fourth visit to India since taking office in 2017.
He is scheduled to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi later on Tuesday.
Macron will then travel to New Delhi for an artificial intelligence summit on Wednesday and Thursday.
The visit follows New Delhi’s confirmation last week that it intends to place a major order for Rafale jets, as well as the signing of a landmark free trade agreement between India and the European Union in January.

‘Contract of the century’
New Delhi has sought over the past decade to reduce its dependence on Russia, its traditional main supplier of military equipment, turning to other countries while also pushing for more domestic production.
An Indian defence ministry statement last week said the proposed purchase of Rafale jets had been cleared – with “the majority” of them to be manufactured in India.
The statement did not specify the exact number of jets New Delhi would purchase, but a New Delhi defence ministry source said that 114 was likely.
Christophe Jaffrelot, an India specialist at Sciences Po Center for International Studies in Paris, described the potential EUR30 billion ($35 billion) deal for 114 Rafales as the “contract of the century” and a potential “crowning achievement” for bilateral ties.
If finalised, the jets would add to the 36 Rafales India purchased for its air force in 2016 and 26 it has ordered for its navy.
Negotiations over the additional aircraft still need to be concluded with manufacturer Dassault Aviation, but the French presidency has voiced optimism that what it calls a “historic” agreement could be reached.

‘Good chemistry’
Modi and Macron will also inaugurate on Tuesday India’s first helicopter final assembly line via videoconference from Mumbai, a joint venture between India’s Tata Group and Airbus.
The facility in Vemagal, in the southern state of Karnataka near the tech hub of Bengaluru, will manufacture the Airbus H125, the company’s best-selling single-engine helicopter.
France has emerged as one of India’s most important defence and economic partners in the last decade.
“Through this visit, we seek to further strengthen cooperation” with India, and to “diversify” France’s economic and trade partnerships, Macron’s office said.
India, the world’s most populous country with 1.4 billion people, is on track to become the fourth-largest economy globally.
This week’s talks are also expected to address global economic uncertainty triggered by tariff policies under US President Donald Trump, as well as China’s influence in the region.
Modi’s office said discussions would focus on “cementing the strategic partnership and further diversifying it into new and emerging areas”.
Bilateral trade between France and India, driven largely by defence and aerospace – India’s commercial fleet includes a substantial number of Airbus aircraft – stands at around EUR15 billion ($18 billion) annually.
French foreign direct investment in India totals nearly €13 billion ($15 billion).
The two leaders will also be keen to nurture close personal ties.
“There is apparently a good chemistry, a good personal rapport,” Jaffrelot said.
One sensitive issue remains Ukraine: India has not condemned Russia’s 2022 invasion and has continued buying oil from Moscow.
US President Donald Trump has said India had committed to halting the purchases, though that has not been formally confirmed by New Delhi.
“If the Indians stop buying Russian oil, they won’t be blamed for abstaining at the UN,” Jaffrelot added.

Naomi Campbell’s name features almost 300 times in Epstein files
- British supermodel Naomi Campbell had more extensive contacts with sex offender Jeffrey Epstein than previously known, according to documents released by the Trump administration.
- Campbell's name appears almost 300 times in the released documents, indicating continued association with Epstein even after his 2008 conviction for soliciting prostitution from a minor.
- Her lawyer stated Campbell was unaware of Epstein's criminal conduct and only met him for a few business meetings, denying any social events or knowledge of his alleged use of her name to lure victims.
- Documents show Campbell's name on a list for Epstein's prison address and Epstein arranging a business meeting involving Campbell for a potential lingerie line.
- Despite her lawyer's claims, multiple Epstein victims alleged seeing Campbell at gatherings at his New York mansion and on his private island, though her lawyer explained the island visit as a transfer stop.

Nigerien president thanks Algeria for rejecting military intervention after 2023 coup
Algerian authorities showed solidarity with Niger, ‘despite futile attempts by certain powers with neo-colonial undertones,’ says Gen. Abdourahamane Tiani
ISTANBUL
Nigerien President Gen. Abdourahamane Tiani expressed gratitude Monday to Algeria for its support in the wake of the July 2023 coup, commending the country for rejecting calls for military intervention.
Algerian authorities showed solidarity with the Nigerien people, “despite futile attempts by certain powers with neo-colonial undertones, as well as international and sub-regional organizations that have been ordered and manipulated,” Tiani told a joint news conference with his Algerian counterpart Abdelmadjid Tebboune in the capital Algiers.
He said Algiers’ stance, which respected Niger’s sovereignty and “internal political choices,” honors Algeria, its government and people.
“In any case, no Algerian, no African could comprehend that Algeria would allow its territory to be used to attack an African country, especially when it concerns the same power that, for more than a century, inflicted unbearable suffering on the valiant Algerian people,” Tiani said.
He lauded Algeria’s position, comparing it with “some African countries, or their manipulated leaders,” who missed their “historical rendezvous” by responding to “French calls to wage war against the Nigerien people.”
“The peace and security that we want for Niger, we want them for our neighbors and friends as well,” Tiani said.
Following the July 26, 2023 coup in Niger that ousted President Mohamed Bazoum, the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) issued an ultimatum to the coup leaders, threatening military intervention to restore constitutional order and activating its standby force. France also expressed support for ECOWAS’s potential use of force.
Break in months of diplomatic strain
Tiani arrived in the Algerian capital on Sunday for talks with Tebboune, in a move seen as signaling an end to more than 10 months of diplomatic tension between the two countries.
On Thursday, Algeria announced the immediate return of Ahmed Saadi, its ambassador to Niger, after a reciprocal downgrade of diplomatic ties since last April. The move followed the resumption of duties by Niger’s ambassador to Algeria, Aminou Malam Manzo.
The diplomatic rift began last April when Niger, Burkina Faso and Mali, the sole members of the Alliance of Sahel States (AES), recalled their ambassadors from Algeria after Mali accused Algiers of shooting down one of its drones.
Algeria said at the time that the aircraft had violated its airspace on an offensive trajectory, marking the third such breach.
It responded by recalling its ambassadors from the three countries under the principle of reciprocity. It later said Niger’s decision stemmed from solidarity within the Sahel alliance rather than a bilateral dispute.
Ties began to thaw late last year. In November, the Nigerien president sent Tebboune a message marking Algeria’s Revolution Day. In January, Algerian Energy Minister Mohamed Arkab visited Niger to review joint oil projects, marking the first senior-level Algerian visit since the diplomatic downgrade.

Multiple companies linked to Sarah Ferguson wound down after Epstein file release
- Six companies linked to Sarah Ferguson, the ex-wife of Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, are being wound down following new revelations from the Epstein files.
- Ferguson was the sole director of these companies, which include S Phoenix Events and Fergie’s Farm, none of which had a significant public profile or appeared very active.
- Applications to strike off each company were filed after US authorities published documents detailing Sarah's contact with paedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein.
- The released documents include email exchanges from 2011 where Ferguson appears to tell Epstein, 'I am at your service. Just marry me,' and other messages sent after his 2008 conviction.
- In related developments, Sarah's Trust, a charity she founded, also announced its closure, and she officially changed her name on company documents from 'Sarah Duchess of York' to 'Sarah Margaret Ferguson'.

29% compliance in Rafah crossing reopening amid Israeli restrictions: Gaza media office
Only 811 travelers able to cross Rafah crossing in both directions out of 2,800 people expected to travel, says office
GAZA CITY, Palestine
The Gaza media office said Monday that only 29% compliance was recorded in the reopening of the Rafah border crossing between Egypt and Gaza amid strict Israeli restrictions.
In a statement, the office said that between Feb. 2 and Feb. 15, only 811 travelers were able to cross the Rafah crossing in both directions out of a total of 2,800 people expected to travel.
It said 455 travelers were allowed to depart Gaza, 356 arrived, and 26 others were turned back during the period.
According to the statement, Israel reopened the Palestinian side of the crossing on Feb. 2 in a very limited manner after controlling it since May 2024.
The media office said it was not informed of the criteria used to determine the total number of travelers scheduled to cross.
Egyptian and Israeli media had previously reported that about 50 Palestinians were expected to cross daily into Gaza and a similar number into Egypt, including patients and their companions, but the office said this was not fully implemented.
Palestinian estimates in Gaza indicate that around 22,000 wounded and sick people require travel outside the enclave for medical treatment amid the collapse of the health sector.
Semi-official figures also show that about 80,000 Palestinians have registered to return to Gaza, reflecting continued rejection of displacement despite widespread destruction.
A US-backed ceasefire agreement has been in place in Gaza since Oct. 10, halting Israel’s two-year war that has killed more than 72,000 people, mostly women and children, and injured over 171,000 others since October 2023.
Since the agreement took effect on Oct. 10, 2025, Israeli forces have committed hundreds of violations through shelling and gunfire, killing 603 Palestinians and injuring 1,618 others, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry.

Nobody should be surprised by the violent rioting that erupted throughout Bnei Brak this week over the fact that two women soldiers entered the city. Among other things, the rioters overturned a police patrol car, torched a police motorcycle, blocked roads and threw stones. In a democracy, holding demonstrations – even if they sometimes disturb the peace – is an act of legitimate protest intended to influence government policy. But the actions of the ultra-Orthodox mob don't appear to be intended as an effort to participate in decision-making processes or a display of civic involvement. Rather, the ultra-Orthodox are seeking to evade their obligations and deny that the state's laws and authority apply to them.

One can hazard a guess as to why the prime minister assigned the foreign minister, Gideon Sa'ar, to represent Israel at the Board of Peace meeting this Thursday in Washington. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will enjoy watching his political rival-turned-servant squirm as he tries to avoid a photo with his counterparts from Qatar and Turkey. Netanyahu understands that if he were to go himself, a picture of him next to Hamas' patrons would be devastating to his election campaign. He prefers that Sa'ar embarrass himself on the eve of the Likud primary.

Six indicted for posing as soldiers in West Bank jewelry store heist

Six residents of the Bedouin town of Hura in the Negev were indicted on Monday on charges stemming from the armed robbery of a jewelry store in the Palestinian town of Dhahiriya near Hebron in the West Bank.
The Southern District Attorney’s Office said the suspects planned the robbery together and decided to pose as IDF soldiers. In a request to detain them until the end of legal proceedings, prosecutors wrote that the men armed themselves with weapons, airsoft rifles, ceramic vests, uniforms resembling those of the IDF, a GMC Savana-type vehicle, face coverings, gloves and other equipment.
“They robbed the jewelry store with brutality and by instilling fear, while threatening the victims and passersby with weapons,” the request said.
The indictment, filed in the Be'er Sheva District Court, charges Yusri Abu Qa’an, Mohammed al-Qi’an, Moayed, Odeh, Hamam and Yasser Abu al-Qi’an with aggravated robbery, illegal possession and transportation of weapons, aggravated assault, kidnapping, firing a firearm and impersonating a soldier.
According to the indictment, the six organized to carry out the robbery and equipped themselves with weapons, including an M-16 rifle and five airsoft rifles resembling M-16s, along with additional military-style gear. On Jan. 13, they entered Palestinian Authority-controlled territory through the Meitar crossing and, at about 10:30 a.m., arrived outside the jewelry store, disembarking from the vehicle dressed in what appeared to be Israeli military uniforms.
The GMC Savana vehicle they used is commonly associated in Israel with undercover security units.
Several members of the group entered the store while others remained outside to secure the vehicle, with one suspect staying in the driver’s seat. Upon entering, one of the men aimed a weapon at a store employee and handcuffed him.
During the robbery, one of the suspects shouted at a Palestinian man and struck him. The robbers ordered those inside to raise their hands and claimed the jewelry belonged to Hamas and therefore had to be confiscated, according to the indictment.
After about 10 minutes, the suspects left the store, abducting one Palestinian man and forcing him into their vehicle.
Prosecutors said the six fled with about 4 kilograms (8.8 pounds) of gold jewelry, 100,000 shekels (about $32,000), 10,000 Jordanian dinars and $1,000 in cash.
Two Palestinians began chasing the vehicle, and the suspects opened fire in their direction, the indictment said. The abducted man was later released from the vehicle, and the suspects fled.
Two of the defendants were arrested later by police officers. Another was detained minutes later by a passerby. Two additional suspects were arrested by Palestinian security forces and transferred to Israeli police two days later, prosecutors said.

Why thousands of students are seeking compensation from universities
- Thousands of students are seeking financial compensation from dozens of universities across England and Wales for studies impacted by Covid-19.
- At least 36 universities, including Exeter, Imperial College London, Leeds, Bath, and Bristol, have received pre-action claim letters.
- This action follows a confidential settlement reached between University College London (UCL) and Student Group Claim, which sought compensation for periods of online teaching and closed facilities during the pandemic.
- Student Group Claim argues that universities breached contractual agreements with students by failing to provide promised in-person tuition and access to facilities.
- Following the successful settlement with UCL, Student Group Claim and its legal representatives plan to pursue similar claims against other universities.

Gold for Elana! Meyers Taylor, 41, wins Olympic monobob title at Milan Cortina Games
Elana Meyers Taylor has won her first Olympic gold in women’s monobob, and she made history as the oldest American woman to do it at the Winter Games
- Bookmark
Elana Meyers Taylor's two young sons watched her leap into the air, throw her fists skyward, wave the American flag, then fall to her knees and start to cry.
In time, they'll understand what they saw.
They saw history.
The 41-year-old U.S. bobsledder — a mother of two special-needs children, an athlete whose career was jeopardized by concussions, someone who dealt with plenty of doubt in recent years — is, finally, an Olympic champion. Meyers Taylor won the gold medal in monobob at the Milan Cortina Games on Monday night, her sixth career medal and first Olympic title.
“I thought it was impossible,” Meyers Taylor said.
She was never happier to be wrong.
She became the oldest American woman to hear “The Star-Spangled Banner” played in her honor at the Winter Games. Rallying in the fourth and final heat, Meyers Taylor prevailed with a four-run, two-day time of 3 minutes, 57.93 seconds.
Meyers Taylor had medaled five times before — three silver, two bronze. She was the most decorated Black athlete at a Winter Olympics even before this win, and her place in history got a whole lot more dazzling on a frosty night in the Italian mountains. And this medal, her sixth, tied Bonnie Blair for the most by a U.S. woman in the Winter Olympics.
“To have my name up there with Bonnie Blair, it doesn't even make sense to me,” Meyers Taylor said.
Germany’s Laura Nolte — the leader after the first, second and third runs — was second and Kaillie Humphries Armbruster of the U.S. was third.
“I’m a bit sad because now at the moment it feels like I lost gold — and not that I won silver. In a few hours I think I can celebrate it, because it’s still a great result,” Nolte said. “Elana also deserves it. She’s a super kind human and she has won silver for many times now and the gold was missing.”
It was the fifth career medal for Humphries Armbruster. She's 40 and about 18 months removed from becoming a mom — and she technically became the first woman 40 or older to clinch an Olympic bobsled medal, since she finished her competition exactly 2 minutes, 29 seconds before Meyers Taylor crossed the line to join the 40-something medal club.
“You get a lot of people that like to write you off as soon as you reach 40, it’s all downhill from there, is what you hear. I think Elana and I are both proof that that’s not true,” Humphries Armbruster said. “As soon as you become a mom, your body’s not the same, and you can never get that high performance back, and I think we were able to show that that’s not true again.”
Nolte led by 0.15 seconds going into the final run, with Meyers Taylor second and Humphries Armbruster third — 0.24 seconds off the lead. Barring big mistakes, gold, silver and bronze would be theirs in some order; nobody else was within 0.6 seconds of Humphries Armbruster, nor within about a full second of Nolte’s lead going into the final heat.
They go in reverse order in sliding. That meant Humphries Armbruster went first among the final three, then Meyers Taylor, then Nolte.
Humphries Armbruster finished in 3:58.05, knowing she was assured of her fifth career medal when she crossed the line. As the sled skidded to a stop, she was already on her feet — throwing her arms into the air, knowing at least bronze was coming her way.
U.S. coach Brian Shimer, often stoic, started punching the air in celebration. And then the scene was set for Meyers Taylor, who held on to no worse than the silver spot and wrapped herself in an American flag after hopping out of the sled.
Nolte had the lead going into the last run. She just couldn’t hold it.
Kaysha Love, the world monobob champion for the U.S. last year, had big trouble in her second and fourth runs and finished seventh with a final time of 3:59.27.
“Seeing Elana, that was iconic,” Love said.
Humphries Armbruster won the gold medal in the inaugural running of monobob at the 2022 Beijing Games, with Meyers Taylor winning silver.
This is the fifth time that Meyers Taylor and Humphries Armbruster have competed in the Olympics. Each has medaled in each of their previous four appearances; Humphries Armbruster was also on the Canadian Olympic team in 2006, but did not race in those Turin Games.
They’re now 5-for-5. And Meyers Taylor, finally, has the golden moment.
“I didn't need it,” Meyers Taylor said. “But I wanted it.”

IRGC Navy chief says Strait of Hormuz under 24-hour surveillance amid tensions with US
Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps launch massive military drill in Hormuz Strait and Persian Gulf
TEHRAN, Iran
Iran’s top naval commander said Monday that the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) maintain “full 24-hour intelligence dominance” over the Strait of Hormuz.
IRGC Navy Chief Rear Admiral Alireza Tangsiri made the remarks hours after the launch of a military drill in the strait, one of the world’s most strategically important choke points located between the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman.
The IRGC Navy’s public relations wing described the exercise as “combined, live and purpose-driven” drills.
Iran’s state media quoted Tangsiri as saying that the IRGC Navy’s surveillance in the Strait of Hormuz is “comprehensive at surface, aerial and even sub-surface levels.”
This intelligence, he said, ensures the “safe passage of vessels” through the strait, adding that more than 80 oil tankers and container ships pass through it daily, accounting for a significant portion of maritime trade.
He said the drills are being conducted in both the Persian Gulf and the Strait of Hormuz, describing the islands in the two waterways as “impregnable fortresses.”
Tangsiri said the defense of these islands and the entire Persian Gulf and Strait of Hormuz “is the responsibility of the IRGC Navy,” which conducts “routine annual exercises to ensure security” in the strategic region.
He stressed that the drills are part of the IRGC Navy’s annual program, with its uniqueness lying in the “tactical maneuvers and equipment being employed,” noting that some of them have not been officially unveiled yet.
Tangsiri said the “rapid and decisive response” of IRGC operational units to maritime security threats is at the “core of the drills.”
He further said that the IRGC Navy’s rapid-response units regularly train to intervene, inspect or seize “unauthorized vessels” in the Strait of Hormuz and Persian Gulf.
Earlier Monday, the IRGC said an exercise titled “Smart Control of the Strait of Hormuz” is being conducted under the field supervision of IRGC Commander-in-Chief Major General Mohammad Pakpour.
Among its key objectives, the statement noted, are assessing the operational readiness of IRGC Navy units, testing security plans and scenarios for reciprocal military action in response to potential security and military threats in the Strait of Hormuz region, and evaluating the geopolitical advantages of the Islamic Republic in the Persian Gulf and the Sea of Oman.
The drills come amid heightened tensions between Iran and the US following the deployment of US aircraft carriers and bombers to the Persian Gulf region.
On Friday, US President Donald Trump announced that a second US aircraft carrier would be deployed to the Middle East. The USS Abraham Lincoln and a fleet of destroyers are already stationed in the region amid simmering tensions between the two countries.
Despite rising tensions, Tehran and Washington are set to hold the next round of nuclear negotiations in Geneva on Tuesday under Omani mediation.
Indirect nuclear diplomacy resumed in Muscat earlier this month, nearly eight months after talks were suspended following an Israeli attack on Iran that sparked a 12-day war.

Even if you’re not planning to fill a car with your own kids, there is little doubt that you will be constantly asked to ferry your offspring and a gaggle of their friends to concerts, football matches and all-night raves (depending on their ages, obviously). You’ll want a car that can handle the load.
Storage
For the modern Australian family, there’s no such thing as “too much space”, especially in a competitive SUV market where generous boot capacity is a primary consideration for buyers.
Safety
This one’s easy. Modern safety is no longer about the frame of the car; it’s about the smart technology watching over your precious cargo. When choosing a family SUV in 2026, look for advanced features that protect every row of your vehicle, such as comprehensive airbag coverage that extends to the very back. It’s also worth considering smart systems like Child Presence Detection (CPD), which uses millimetre-wave radar to detect movement inside the cabin, ensuring no child gets accidentally left behind.
Fuel and other ownership costs
The planet, and your bank account, will thank you for filling up at the bowser as little as possible. As well as comparing manufacturers’ fuel-consumption figures (you can also use the government’s Green Vehicle Guide), take a dive into other ownership costs, such as insurance and servicing, to see how they stack up, too. If you’re buying a new car, you might also want to compare warranties.
Driveability
It’s all well and good buying a big, safe, green, efficient car for the family, but let’s not be martyrs. Pick something that’s exciting to drive, too. Even mums and dads deserve to have a bit of fun now and then.
The complete package?
What car could possibly tick all these boxes? It’s a tough ask, but the latest super hybrids are giving it a good go.
Super hybrids are essentially plug-in hybrids (PHEVs) with higher performance capabilities. They can run on electric batteries — which you charge just as you would in a fully electric car — but also include a petrol engine. This is ideal for families that want the best of both worlds: silent, spacious EV commuting for the daily school run, along with petrol-backed security for the great Australian road trip.
Super hybrids can be more fuel-efficient than older-generation PHEVs (because their bigger batteries offer longer electric range), and they can be a lot more fun, too, thanks to big motors offering that electric wow factor.
Chinese carmakers are leading the way in the super-hybrid bracket, and it should come as no surprise that super-disruptor BYD is right in the mix. The Sealion 8 super hybrid is BYD’s first seven-seat SUV, and it hopes to offer families the complete package.
Ticking boxes
This super hybrid stacks up well against our checklist. First of all, it’s big, with seven seats offering plenty of legroom, even in the back row. It also offers plenty of storage: even with all seven seats in play, you get 270 litres of volume in the rear, which ramps up to 960L with the third row folded down.
The vehicle also delivers with an impressive family-first safety range that prioritises the protection of all seven passengers. It features nine airbags including full-length side curtains that offer peace of mind for those in the rear, while for discerning parents, the inclusion of third-row ISOFIX anchor points is a game-changer, allowing child seats to be securely fastened in the back. This is also paired with the millimetre-wave radar CPD system to monitor the cabin, front and rear cross-traffic alerts with automatic braking and constant driver fatigue and distraction monitoring.
As for fuel, the vehicle comes equipped with a 1.5-litre turbo-petrol four-cylinder engine, plus a 19kWh battery on the Dynamic FWD version of the car, and a 35.6kWh battery on the Dynamic AWD and Premium AWD versions.
This translates to a claimed 103 kilometres of electric range on the smaller battery, and 152 kilometres on the bigger battery. That’s enough to cover most trips, and BYD claims fuel-consumption figures of a paltry 1 litre per 100 kilometres when the battery is over 25 per cent full.
Performance is another factor. The electric motors (one on the FWD, and two on the AWD versions) offer serious power, with the AWDs going from 0-100km/h in a rapid 4.9 seconds – perfect for when you’ve got a weekend off with your partner and you just can’t get away quick enough.
It seems the ultimate family checklist finally has an answer that doesn’t require a single compromise.
The BYD Sealion 8 is rewriting the checklist for the modern Australian family. As BYD’s first seven-seat SUV, it balances high-end tech with genuine value, starting from just $56,990*. Whether you choose the efficient Dynamic FWD or the powerhouse Premium AWD, you’ll enjoy up to 152km of pure-electric range for the daily commute and a massive 1040km total range for the weekend getaway. With a focus on safety and a 2000kg towing capacity, it’s the complete package for 2026.

Students launch legal action against universities over Covid-hit studies
Following a successful settlement with UCL, Student Group Claim will turn its attention to other universities
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
Dozens of universities could face legal action as thousands of students seek financial compensation after their studies were impacted by Covid-19.
At least 36 universities across England and Wales have been sent pre-action claim letters, including Exeter, Imperial College London, Leeds, Bath and Bristol, according to The Guardian.
It comes after a settlement was reached between UCL and Student Group Claim, who sought to obtain financial compensation from the university for the periods when teaching was moved online and libraries were closed during the pandemic.
UCL reached a confidential settlement with the Student Group Claim. While admitting no liability the institution agreed to settle so that it could be resolved without further expense.
Shimon Goldwater, partner at Asserson solicitors, which jointly represented the claimants suing UCL, said: “I am very pleased that our clients have been able to achieve a commercial settlement of their claims with UCL. Student Group Claim will now turn its attention to claimants who attended other universities during the pandemic.”
Adam Zoubir, partner at Harcus Parker solicitors, which also represented the claimants, said: “I am delighted that this settlement provides a resolution for our clients who attended UCL during the pandemic and had their classes moved online. This is the end of the claim against UCL, but we continue to represent tens of thousands of students who were at other universities during Covid.”
The Student Group Claim has argued that universities breached contract with students, who pay course fees for in-person tuition, access to facilities and other services as set out in its contractual documents, prospectuses, and promotional materials.
Due to strikes and Covid-19, the group claims that universities breached their contracts with students from 2018 onwards as in-person classes were either cancelled or moved online, and access to libraries was restricted.
A spokesperson from Universities UK said: “The Covid-19 pandemic threw two years of unprecedented challenge at universities and their students. Institutions - like other sectors - followed government guidance to adapt to a fast changing situation.
"During some periods of lockdown, universities were not permitted to offer in-person teaching as usual and instead they adjusted quickly and creatively to allow students to complete their degrees."
The claim comes as chancellor Rachel Reeves faces backlash regarding student loans after she announced that the repayment threshold for Plan 2 loans will be frozen at its April 2026 level (£29,385) for three years, instead of increasing with inflation.
It is set to increase each year in line with RPI from April 2030, with commentators warning that this could mean a greater impact on graduate’s’s monthly earnings as the cost of living gets higher.

Malian army ‘neutralizes’ several terrorists
Malian forces seize weapons, ammunition, communication materials during operation in Segou region
ISTANBUL
Mali “neutralized” scores of terrorists during a large-scale sweeping operation in the central part of the country, the army said Monday.
The operation, conducted Sunday, targeted the villages of Toule and Akoub in the Segou region, it said in a statement.
Malian forces also seized weapons, ammunition and communication materials.
The statement did not identify the terrorist group targeted.
Mali has faced persistent insecurity for more than a decade, particularly in its central and northern regions, where armed groups linked to militant organizations and local conflicts have carried out attacks against security forces and civilians.
The army regularly announces counterterrorism operations as it seeks to reassert control over territories and curb the activities of armed groups, especially in areas near key population centers and along the Niger River corridor.

Eleni Glykatzi-Ahrweiler, prominent Byzantist and first female rector of the Sorbonne, dies at 99
France

Eleni Glykatzi-Ahrweiler, a prominent Greek historian of the Byzantine Empire who became the first woman rector of Paris's Sorbonne University, died on Monday, February 16, aged 99, the Athens News Agency reported.
Greek President Constantinos Tassoulas paid homage to her by saying she "illuminated through her work the timeless dimension of the Greek identity and contributed in a decisive way to international recognition of Byzantium as a fundamental pillar of European civilization".
Born in Athens in 1926 to a family of refugees from what was then Constantinople – now Istanbul – she developed an early passion for history. As a young woman she moved to Paris to continue her studies, earning two doctorates there and meeting her husband, navy officer Jacques Ahrweiler, who died in 2010.
After rising quickly through France's CNRS research body, Glykatzi-Ahrweiler moved to the Sorbonne to become a top professor of Byzantine studies, and in 1976 became the first woman rector of the famed Paris university in its 700-year history.
She was then named head of the Academy of Paris, which oversees the capital's entire education system, and a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador.
She came to know famous cultural figures in France, such as Pablo Picasso and Simone de Beauvoir, and received many honorary doctorates and distinctions, including at Harvard University, and France's Legion of Honor. The wide body of scholarly Byzantine work she established remains influential today.

The 'Blade Angels' are redefining the image of US women's figure skating
The three U.S. women who will be going for Olympic gold when their figure skating competition begins Tuesday night are role models for a whole new generation
- Bookmark
The trio of U.S. women targeting Olympic figure skating gold Tuesday night are not the dainty ice princesses of yesteryear.
There's Amber Glenn, a 26-year-old powerhouse and LGBTQ+ rights activist whose career took off just when most figure skaters are contemplating retirement. The three-time and reigning U.S. champion's unvarnished opinion on everything from politics to the trading card game “Magic: The Gathering” have made her a polarizing figure at the Milan Cortina Games.
Then there's Alysa Liu, the one-time phenom who retired at 16 only to launch a comeback that resulted in the first world title for an American woman in nearly two decades. Liu's blond-and-brunette striped hair, prominent frenulum piercing and nonconformist aura have made the 20-year-old a hero of the alt, punk and emo crowd.
And there's Isabeau Levito, perhaps the closest thing to the innocent image of teen predecessors like Tara Lipinski and Sarah Hughes, right up until you get the 18-year-old away from the cameras, and her searing wit and biting sarcasm shine through.
They've dubbed themselves the “Blade Angels,” an homage to “Charlie's Angels,” after rejecting such suggestions as “Powerpuff Girls” and “Babes of Glory,” which they worried might lead to some trademark issues. (As if they needed more of those in Milan.)
They are a new kind of role model for a new generation of American girls.
They also are the last chance to salvage a disappointing Olympics for American figure skaters.
“I really like that we're all different," Levito said, “and we all have our own strengths and personalities, and our own ways we want to look and appear. I think it’s really great, because while we all have the same passion for the sport, and we have very aligned goals.”
‘I thought I would be done at 18’
Glenn grew up in Plano, Texas. Her father, Richard, is a police sergeant and her mom, Cathlene, a fitness instructor. She's represented the U.S. internationally for nearly 15 years, which happens to be how old Lipinski was when she won Olympic gold.
It's hard to get more unabashedly American. Yet some critics nevertheless questioned her allegiances on the eve of the Milan Cortina Games, when Glenn answered a question about the political climate for the LGBTQ+ community under President Donald Trump.
“I hope I can use my platform and voice throughout these Games to help people stay strong during these hard times,” she said. “A lot of people will say, ‘You’re just an athlete. Stick to your job. Shut up about politics.' But politics affect us all.”
Glenn probably wouldn't have taken such a bold stance a decade ago, when she nearly quit the sport.
But over the course of her career, she's tackled head-on an eating disorder, which is all-too common in the sport. She spent time in a mental health facility to get a handle on her depression. She learned to cope with ADHD. And she came to understand her sexuality; Glenn identifies as pansexual, meaning she is attracted to people regardless of sex or gender.
“I've been through a lot,” Glenn told The Associated Press. “It's taken many, many years to get to this point.”
Now, she has an Olympic gold medal from her Winter Games debut after helping the U.S. defend its title in the team event.
“I stepped away from the sport. I’ve come back. At one point, I hated it. Whenever people would ask me, ‘Oh, should my kids get into it?’ I would be like, ‘No, never,’" Glenn said. "But I’ve seen the people around me grow, and how the environment of figure skating has changed, and how we’re trying to change it. And in doing so, we've created an environment I like to be in every day.”
‘I hated skating when I quit’
Liu is the only member of the U.S. women's team with any previous Olympics experience. But much like Glenn, she had come to loathe the sport by the time she finished sixth at the Beijing Games, so much so that she quit entirely. She was 16 at the time.
“I really hated skating when I quit. Like, I really didn't like it,” Liu told the AP. “I didn’t care about competitions. I didn’t care about places. I didn’t care about skaters. I didn’t care about my programs. I just wanted to, like, get away. I want nothing to do with that. I hated fame. I hated social media. I didn’t like interviews. Like, I hated all of it.”
It took walking away for Liu to finally find herself.
The same kid who'd get dropped off at the rink by her father in the morning and picked up at night, and who thirsted for friends her age while living and training alone in Colorado, began to explore: Liu climbed to the base camp of Mt. Everest, ticked off items on her ever-growing bucket list, and enrolled at UCLA to study, perhaps fittingly, psychology.
“I learned so much. Met so many new people,” Liu said. “I had to exercise my free will and push myself in different ways.”
She began contemplating a comeback two years ago, after she went skiing and experienced an adrenaline rush unlike anything she'd felt since hanging up the skates. Liu didn't know where it would lead — certainly not the first world title for an American since Kimmie Meissner in 2006, and definitely not another Winter Games — but she knew that she loved the feeling of skating again.
Everything in Liu's life has meaning now, including the striking horizontal stripes in her hair. They're meant to represent the growth rings of a tree. There are three of them at present, and like a tree, Liu plans to add another ring each year.
“I used to feel like a puppet or a canvas that other people were using,” she said. “Now I do things for myself.”
‘They have no idea what you’re actually like'
Levito has always admired Russian skater Evgenia Medvedeva, perhaps the most dominant women's skater of the mid-2000s, who was heavily favored to win gold at the 2018 Pyeongchang Games but wound up with the silver medal instead.
“She was just so pretty. I just wanted to have that angelic energy that I feel like she has," Levito told the AP. “Amber and Alysa have their distinct style, and she was more like me. My style is, I don't know, put together. I don't know how to word it.
“The ice princess image,” Levito said, after a long pause, “which is silly to say.”
Mostly because it is just that — an image.
Yes, there is a sense of purity surrounding Levito, whose mother, Chiara, immigrated to the U.S. from Milan three decades ago, and whose grandmother still lives in the host city of the Winter Games. But pull her away from the TV cameras, photographers and the prying eyes of the world, and her sarcastic-bordering-on-vulgar sense of humor bubbles to the surface.
At last month's U.S. Figure Skating Championships, Levito was asked her favorite quality in Liu, who was sitting beside her. “I want to say something but I won't,” Levito said, before succumbing to a little prodding: “She keeps the hoes on their toes,” she said.
“I think it's so funny,” Levito said later, reflecting on that day. “The internet is like, ‘Our Isabeau is not a baby anymore,’ when they have no idea what you're actually like. I just don't want to say the wrong things in front of the media."
So, Levito plays it safe. She wears a sort of mask for the public, projecting the image she thinks people want to see.
Much like Glenn and Liu have people who can relate to them, there are a whole lot of people who can relate to that.

US Homeland Security Department’s funding negotiations stall
Democrats have called for a ban on immigration agents wearing masks and are pushing for increased oversight of their operations.
The United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS) ran out of funding over the weekend, leading to the third partial government shutdown of President Donald Trump’s second term, as negotiations between Republicans and Democrats remain stalled while Congress is in recess until February 23.
Democrats are calling for changes to the DHS’s immigration operations after two fatal shootings of US citizens in the city of Minneapolis last month. Alex Pretti and Renee Good were shot dead by federal officers from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Border Patrol during such operations.

On Monday, state officials in Minnesota said that the FBI has refused to share evidence with state law enforcement following Pretti’s killing on January 24.
“This lack of cooperation is concerning and unprecedented,” Minnesota’s Bureau of Criminal Apprehension superintendent, Drew Evans, said in a statement.
DHS entered a shutdown on Saturday, but will continue operations deemed essential. Cuts affect agencies under the DHS, including the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), Customs and Border Protection (CBP) – which runs Border Patrol – ICE, and the US coastguard.
At US airports, 2,933 of the TSA’s 64,130 employees have been furloughed for the duration of the shutdown. The remaining 95 percent of staff will remain on duty but will work without pay until the DHS is funded.
Earlier this month, Democrats sent Republicans a list of 10 demands to rein in immigration enforcement. In a letter, authored by House of Representatives Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, the politicians called for increased oversight of the DHS.
The letter called for DHS officers not to enter private property without a judicial warrant and to require verification that someone is not a US citizen before placing them in immigration detention. It also called for DHS to mandate that its officers do not wear masks, have visible identification, and wear clear uniforms.
Democrats are also seeking to prohibit immigration enforcement actions near courts, medical facilities, houses of worship, schools, and polling places.
They further called for increased coordination with local and state agencies after the federal government blocked state and local law enforcement from participating in investigations related to the deaths in Minneapolis.
“Federal immigration agents cannot continue to cause chaos in our cities while using taxpayer money that should be used to make life more affordable for working families,” Jeffries said in the letter.
“The American people rightfully expect their elected representatives to take action to rein in ICE and ensure no more lives are lost. It is critical that we come together to impose common sense reforms and accountability measures that the American people are demanding.”
Tom Homan, Trump’s border chief, dismissed the calls from Democrats on CBS’s Face the Nation, referring to the requests as “unreasonable”.
Republican Senator Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma, meanwhile, echoed Homan’s stance. On CNN’s current affairs programme, State of the Union, he claimed that Democrats are engaging in “political theatre”.

Six of Sarah Ferguson’s companies wound down after Epstein links revealed
According to Companies House, an application to strike off each company was filed after new revelations about Sarah’s contact with the paedophile financier came to light

Six companies linked to Sarah Ferguson are being wound down following the release of the Epstein files, Companies House documents show.
Ferguson, the ex-wife of Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, was the sole director of all six companies, none of which have much public profile.
An application to strike off each company was filed after new revelations about Sarah’s contact with the paedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein came to light with the publication of millions of documents by US authorities, according to Companies House.
In documents released last month, the former duchess appears to say to Epstein: “I am at your service. Just marry me.”
In an email exchange from September 21 2011, she apparently wrote: “Don’t know if you are still on this bbm but heard from The Duke that you have had a baby boy.
“Even though you never kept in touch, I still am here with love, friendship and congratualtions (sic) on your baby boy. Sarah xx”
The email is then followed up with a message saying: “You have disappeared.
“I did not even know you were having a baby. It was soooo crystal clear to me that you were only friends with me to get to Andrew. And that really hurt me deeeply (sic). More than you will know.”
Many of the exchanges are dated after Epstein was convicted in 2008 for soliciting prostitution from a child.
The companies being wound down by the former duchess of York are: S Phoenix Events, Fergie’s Farm, La Luna Investments, Solamoon Ltd, Philanthrapreneur Ltd and Planet Partners Productions Ltd, none of which appear to have been very active.
According to the Government website, applying to strike a company off the register is also known as “dissolving” a company, and is a way to close down a company that has not traded in three months.
Late last year, after she lost her courtesy royal divorcee title, Sarah submitted an official change to her details for all the firms from Sarah Duchess of York to Sarah Margaret Ferguson.
Days after the new details emerged about the former duchess’s friendship with Epstein, Sarah’s Trust, a charity she had founded, also announced it would close “for the foreseeable future”.
A representative for the former duchess has been contacted for comment.

Trump’s new ambassador to South Africa arrives in country amid strained ties
The US president has accused South Africa of persecuting its white minority, criticised its ties with China and imposed tariffs on exports
Reading Time:2 minutes
Why you can trust SCMP
US President Donald Trump’s pick for ambassador to South Africa has arrived in the country where he will seek to improve fraught ties between the two states.
An embassy official told Reuters on Monday that the envoy, conservative activist and writer Leo Brent Bozell III, had arrived. Bozell is expected to present his credentials to President Cyril Ramaphosa before officially taking up his post.
Relations between Washington and Pretoria have deteriorated in the past year as Trump has accused South Africa of persecuting its white minority, criticised its ties with Russia and China, imposed steep tariffs on its exports and cut all aid.

South Africa has not had an ambassador in Washington since the Trump administration expelled its last one, Ebrahim Rasool, in March.
Bozell said in his Senate confirmation hearing in October that he would approach his ambassadorship “with respect for the South African people”, and that he saw “real opportunity for a lasting partnership” despite areas of disagreement.

Bozell said his priorities would include pressing South Africa to end its genocide case against Israel at the International Court of Justice, advancing Trump’s refugee programme for white South Africans, and promoting business interests.

BHP cashes in on ‘metal of the future’

BHP cashes in on ‘metal of the future’
Worldwide demand for electrification, renewable energy, and the digital infrastructure needed to power AI has made copper, often labelled the “metal of the future,” the biggest earner at global mining giant BHP.
The world’s biggest miner hit the milestone in the half-year to December after a four-year drive to boost copper production saw red metal comprise the largest share of BHP’s underlying earnings, previously dominated by the resource giant’s output of iron ore from its Pilbara operations in Western Australia.
BHP is the world’s largest copper producer. The strong performance of its key mine in Chile, Escondida, and contributions from other mines in Chile and South Australia, resulted in the miner increasing its copper guidance to between 1.9 and 2 megatonnes.
“This is allowing us to maximise increased earnings from the recent run-up in copper prices as well as gold,” chief executive Mike Henry said. “We have achieved around 30 per cent growth in copper production in the last four years, positioning us ahead of the strengthening copper market that we had anticipated.”
BHP said its half-year profit was up 28 per cent to $US5.64 billion ($8 billion) and it reported revenue up 11 per cent to $US27.9 billion.
The mining giant is reaping the benefits of rising commodity prices, particularly copper which jumped about 55 per cent over the past two years.
Henry said BHP expects global economic growth will hit around 3 per cent this year.
“China’s economy is resilient after meeting its around 5 per cent target last year. India continues to outperform. We are optimistic that the economic backdrop is supportive for our key commodities. Against a structurally higher cost environment, these conditions reinforce the importance of productivity and cost discipline and play to the strengths of BHP’s low cost, diversified portfolio,” Henry said.
BHP said it has reached a $US4.3 billion long-term streaming agreement with Wheaton Precious Metals International to take BHP’s share of the silver produced at the Antamina mine in Peru, a joint venture it owns along with Glencore and Teck Resources.
The company said the deal will allow it to realise the value of Antamina’s silver as a byproduct and it will retain all the copper, zinc and lead production from its share of mine.
BHP will pay investors an interim dividend of US73¢ cents fully franked on March 26.

Wuthering Heights sparks emotional reaction as viewers break down in tears
Wuthering Heights prompted a wave of tearful reactions after its release in UK and US cinemas over the Valentine’s Day weekend.
The new adaptation, directed by Emerald Fennell and starring Margot Robbie and Jacob Elordi, opened on 13 February 2026 and quickly sparked an outpouring of emotion online. Viewers posted self-filmed videos weeping as the credits rolled, with one describing the experience as having “literally crushed my soul.”
Although early reviews were mixed, with some critics arguing that the film diverges from Emily Brontë’s original novel, audiences appeared deeply moved by its emotional intensity, many leaving cinemas visibly shaken by the tragic love story.

Cyclist police said was ‘breaching human rights act’ by riding no-handed reveals new twist in case
A cyclist who was fined for riding his bike “no-handed” has had his case dropped by the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS).
Barrister Paul Powlesland said that City of London Police had ticketed him under the Human Rights Act last July. He contested the fine, which he described as “utterly bonkers”, as he felt it was not illegal to ride whilst not touching the handlebars.
Footage taken by Powlesland which quickly went viral shows him confronting an officer about his ticket.
Sharing an update to the case on X on Thursday (12 February), Powlesland, who was due to appear in London South-Central Magistrates' Court on Friday, revealed that the case had been dropped to due insufficient evidence.
He said that whilst he was glad he did not have to go to court, he was annoyed at the force for “wasting my time and taxpayers’ money pursuing something so trivial and which is clearly not illegal”.
The Independent has contacted City of London Police for comment.

Lebanon says next Hezbollah disarmament phase to take four months

Lebanon's government has said that the army would need at least four months to implement the second phase of the military's plan to disarm Hezbollah in the country's south.
Lebanon's government last year committed to disarming Hezbollah and tasked the army with drawing up a plan to do so.
The military said last month that it had completed the first phase of the plan, covering the area between the Litani River and the Israeli border about 30 kilometres (20 miles) farther south.
The second phase concerns the area between the Litani and the Awali rivers, around 40 kilometres south of Beirut.
Information Minister Paul Morcos told a news conference after a cabinet session that the government "took note of the army leadership's presentation" on the second stage of the plan.
"There is a timeframe of four months, extendable depending on available capabilities, Israeli attacks and hindrances on the ground," he said.
Israel has kept up regular strikes on Lebanon despite a November 2024 ceasefire that sought to end Israeli war in Lebanon.
Israel has also kept troops in five south Lebanon areas it deems strategic.

Highly sensitive court data accessed by entity based in India

Highly sensitive Australian court data accessed by foreign entity based in India
Highly sensitive Australian court files have been accessed by foreign actors in breach of the federal law and Commonwealth contractual obligations, an ABC investigation can reveal.
Workers raised concerns with managers at VIQ Solutions — the company responsible for the data breach — months ago and were told they were "not relevant" and were directed to stop spreading "rumours" about the issue.
The transcription of court cases in most jurisdictions in Australia is done by VIQ Solutions, which is based in Canada and employs transcribers in Australia.
An ABC investigation found VIQ Solutions subcontracted work to e24 Technologies — a company based in Chennai, India that specialises in automated voice-to-text technology — in breach of their Commonwealth contract, and without notifying the courts.
Internal VIQ documents, sighted by the ABC, showed thousands of court files were accessed by staff at e24 Technologies with Indian email addresses.
A job advertisement placed by e24 revealed the company was seeking staff to transcribe legal documents and applicants needed to be proficient in "Australian English". The advertisement listed the job location as "remote".
VIQ staff based in Australia told the ABC that e24 staff were accessing court files outside of Australian business hours and completing transcripts at a speed that was not possible for a human. They claimed the transcripts completed by e24 contained significant errors, which then fell to VIQ staff to correct.
Access to state and federal court cases by foreign entities is a "national security risk", according to Greens Senator David Shoebridge.
"Incredibly sensitive evidence from organisations like ASIO, the Australian Federal Police, is given in private court because it could be addressing links to international criminal organisations, potential foreign interference in the country," he said.
He said this information in the wrong hands could do "incredible damage".
"Not just to the national interest but potentially to undercover police officers and members of the public in Australia."
VIQ reviewed its processes after being contacted by the ABC. It is understood compliance issues with e24 were identified as part of that review.
However, a number of concerned VIQ staff and subcontractors based in Australia told the ABC they had raised the issue of offshore transcribers with VIQ management as far back as August 2025.
In a memo to staff seen by the ABC, VIQ management claimed at the time that e24 resources were based in Sydney, not India.
"To avoid further insinuation and rumours, to be clear e24 resources are based in Sydney. Please do not communicate information as facts unless it has been confirmed by senior leadership at VIQ," the memo stated.
During a staff meeting VIQ Vice President of Legal, Compliance and Human Relations, Crystal Oliphant, told staff who raised concerns about offshore typists and poor transcript quality that: "these questions are not relevant … and they don't have impact on the employees daily responsibilities … so we're not going to be addressing any specific questions here."
VIQ produce transcripts for the family and federal courts, the South Australian Employment Tribunal, as well as the courts and tribunals in Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria and Western Australia.
Cases heard in the federal court include critical human rights matters, industrial relations cases, taxation law and matters involving multi-million-dollar corporations.
VIQ also manage transcripts for the Federal Circuit and Family Court which can include migration cases, and matters involving child sexual abuse, domestic violence and property settlements.
'Identities of covert operatives could be sold'
Australian staff who work for VIQ Solutions told the ABC they are required to undergo a national security check and complete a Commonwealth Courts Deed of Confidentiality.
It is unclear what security checks, if any, are required by e24 staff.
A VIQ contractor, who asked to remain anonymous, said the presence of offshore transcribers in shared work portals with foreign email addresses, had caused angst amongst the Australian workforce.
"I began having anxiety attacks about what repercussions might follow for real human lives if highly sensitive matters were accessed by unvetted overseas staff,"they said.
"I was worried about how much the protocols of the Australian Border Force and police and identities of witnesses and covert operatives could be sold for by anonymous overseas individuals."
The ABC understands that since July last year at least a dozen senior VIQ staff were either made redundant or quit, along with staff who belonged to the Quality and Assurance team.
"I was constantly worried we would lose our jobs," the VIQ contractor said.
"Finding out on a public holiday we had been locked out of the system was terrifying. Team leaders were fired if they questioned decisions and no replacements filled their roles … making us scared to ask questions or raise concerns.
"When the quality team were fired we were expected as contractors to do unpaid quality and training. This only worsened when e24 work began returning [with] poor quality and we had to rush through retyping, knowing people spent thousands of dollars on the product and upper management didn't believe trained staff were worth having perform the work."
VIQ CEO Larry Taylor told the ABC, "strict standards" were implemented for contractors "to ensure we protect the privacy, confidentiality and security of sensitive customer data, such as court recordings".
"When VIQ contracts work to companies like e24, they are required to adhere to the same strict privacy guidelines, service delivery standards and confidentiality as all employees," Mr Taylor said in a statement.
"All customer data is stored in Australia in accordance with the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth), for Australian clients."
Last week, Senator Shoebridge raised the issue of offshore contractors accessing court files with the CEO of the Federal Court of Australia, Sia Lagos, during senate estimates.
The federal court manages the contract with VIQ Solutions.
Ms Lagos acknowledged VIQ Solutions were prohibited from offshoring court data as well as the use of AI-based software. She confirmed VIQ had not told the court about e24 Technologies.
"We are not aware of any subcontractors being engaged by VIQ Solutions," Ms Lagos said.
Names of protected persons appearing in transcripts
Another Australian transcriber who works for VIQ told the ABC when they raised concerns over the poor quality of transcripts they were ignored.
"This has been an incredibly stressful situation and the very real worry of losing my job overnight to an offshore entity has both angered me and caused me health problems," they said.
"When the quality department informed [VIQ] management that court work couldn't go offshore they were made redundant, followed by near on all of the Australian management and operations staff."
The transcriber said a group of concerned Australian VIQ contractors had tried to prevent court files being accessed by e24 by "monopolising the work pools", fearing sensitive data was going offshore.
"Our duty is to the departments with which we hold security clearances," they said.
A different VIQ contractor claimed the identities and locations of protected persons had been left in transcripts produced by e24 via the West Australian Department of Justice.
"The transcript is an entitlement of the respondent to a matter. It is a criminal offence to disclose the location — these are slipping through the gaps in [the] 'merging' stage of the hearing and respondents are receiving the present locations of the protected persons," the contractor claimed.
The WA Department of Justice told the ABC it was "aware of and investigating these claims".
VIQ contract should be terminated: Shoebridge
Senator Shoebridge said the revelations that Australian court data had been accessed offshore without the knowledge of the court was grounds for an independent audit and the urgent termination of the contract with VIQ.
"This looks like it's been very much 'set and forget' from the federal court going back over years relying on the blank assurances being given by a private operator and not having the kind of due diligence to double check," he said.
"I have had multiple whistleblowers, not one, not two, multiple whistleblowers contacting my office and each time we raise this in public we get more whistleblowers coming forward and showing very credible evidence.
"Now if that's not grounds to urgently terminate this contract and bring back this important public service into public hands, away from a failed privatisation, I don't know what is."
A spokesperson for the Federal Court of Australia said;
"The Listed Entity that manages the contract on behalf of the Courts takes the matters raised in relation to compliance with the transcript contract extremely seriously and is currently in the process of making enquiries in relation to these issues. As such, the Listed Entity is currently not in a position to comment any further."
The Attorney General's Department said the, "federal courts are responsible for their own operation and management".

Naomi Campbell had way more contact with Epstein than previously believed, files reveal
Supermodel continued to associate with Epstein after his 2008 sex crime conviction
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
British supermodel Naomi Campbell had more contacts with sex criminal Jeffrey Epstein than were previously known, according to documents released by the Trump administration.
Campbell has acknowledged her past associations with Epstein, whom she encountered in elite fashion circles. The British model has worked for Victoria’s Secret, the lingerie brand once owned by billionaire Les Wexner, whose finances Epstein once managed. An ex-boyfriend introduced Campbell to Epstein at her 31st birthday party in 2001, she has said.
Campbell has long maintained she had no awareness of the late financier’s misconduct at the time they knew each other.
In a 2019 video statement, she called his crimes sickening and “indefensible.”
Before this disavowal, however, Campbell appeared to be in regular touch with Epstein, even after his 2008 conviction in Florida for soliciting prostitution from a minor, according to documents analyzed by The New York Times.
Campbell’s name appears nearly 300 times in documents released by the Justice Department, though some files are duplicates, according to the Times.
The Independent has contacted representatives of Campbell for comment.
“Prior to Epstein’s 2019 arrest in New York, my client knew nothing about his appalling criminal conduct,” her attorney, Martin Singer, told theTimes. “If my client had ever encountered any young woman whom she thought was being victimized by Epstein, she would have personally taken immediate action to help her.”
The files include Campbell’s name on a document called “List of People Who Need JE’s Address!” which detailed information for how to correspond with Epstein in prison.
Campbell’s lawyer told the Times that during the late 2000s and early 2010s, when Campbell was living in Russia, she was unaware Epstein was a sex offender and had no idea who made the list or why the model’s name was on it.
In 2010, a document captured Epstein directing his assistant to invite apparel executive Linda Wachner to his house for a meeting with Campbell.
Campbell’s lawyer told the paper the meeting was because the model was “trying to do a lingerie and swimwear line” and Epstein “led her to believe that he could assist with that.” Wachner attended the meeting virtually, according to her lawyer, and no business partnership emerged.
Overall, Campbell’s lawyer said, the model went to Epstein’s home office for “3 or 4 business meetings,” but never for any “social event or gathering.”
Elsewhere that year, Epstein was invited to Campbell’s birthday party in France and a Paris event celebrating the model’s work with fashion house Dolce & Gabbana.
Campbell’s lawyer said she did not make the guest list for the former event, which Epstein did not attend, and that Epstein briefly attended the latter.
Multiple Epstein victims alleged during conversations with investigators that they saw Campbell at gatherings tied to Epstein, including a dinner party at his New York mansion and Campbell being present on Epstein’s island.
Campbell’s lawyer told the Times that the model, alongside “a group of people going to an F1 race,” stopped over on Epstein’s island “on a transfer from a commercial flight.”
A 2016 email exchange, meanwhile, captures a discussion referencing Campbell seeking to use Epstein’s plane.
Campbell’s lawyer said the model had been on Epstein’s plane “on a few occasions but she never observed any inappropriate conduct of any kind.”
The files also captured Epstein allegedly using his proximity to Campbell to burnish his own reputation.
In 2020, an unnamed victim told investigators that she met Epstein when she was 15, and that he promised to get her jobs at Victoria’s Secret and touted his relationship with Campbell and Wexner.
Campbell’s reps say she was unaware Epstein used her name in such conversations and that it was done so “entirely without her knowledge or authorization.”
Ghislaine Maxwell, the disgraced British socialite and Epstein lieutenant serving a federal prison sentence in the U.S., has said the Department of Justice interviewed her last year about Epstein’s ties to a variety of high-profile public figures, including Campbell.
Epstein courted influential friends across politics, media, business, and academia, though his ties to the fashion world may be among the most central ones to his decades of abuse.
The financier used his connections in the fashion world to lure victims into his ring, based on promises that he could connect them with high-profile figures and brands and assist in their careers.
Beyond Epstein’s ties to Wexner and Campbell, Epstein was also friends with Donald Trump during the time he owned the Miss Universe pageant and the Trump Models agency.
Another high-profile Epstein associate was French modeling agent Jean-Luc Brunel, who died by suicide in prison while being investigated for the alleged rape and trafficking of minors.
Brunel was accused of trafficking scores of women and girls to Epstein.

Immediately after the October 7 massacre, we were completely immersed in the disaster that had befallen us. Stunned and dizzied by the images and videos that Hamas took, which recorded every possible form of humiliation, mutilation and desecration of human beings, their homes and their surroundings. In the first week of the war, Israel imposed a hermetic siege on the Gaza Strip in response and gave 1.1 million of Gaza's residents one day to leave their homes. The Israel Air Force dropped nearly 1,000 bombs a day. Among the 2,215 Gazans killed in those first six days were dozens of children. It was the deadliest week of the war; hundreds of hostages in Gaza were also in danger of being killed in the bombings.

Why China is being urged to integrate commercial space tech with military systems
Appeal comes as strategic rivals such as the US are increasingly eyeing military uses for tech developed by private firms such as SpaceX
China has been urged to build dual-use satellite application systems to increase the military use of commercial technology.
The appeal by researchers from a university affiliated with the Central Military Commission – China’s highest command body – comes as space technology developed by private firms is increasingly being used for military purposes.
For example, the US military has stepped up its use of technology from Elon Musk’s Starlink network and other commercial satellite companies, carrying out tests to help it build a more advanced and efficient command system.
Musk’s company SpaceX recently applied to launch one million satellites to power artificial intelligence (AI) data centres, a move that would drastically expand its Starlink network.
The company already has around 10,000 satellites in orbit and the Chinese government recently suggested it was responsible for congestion and an increased risk of collisions.
“As commercial satellites become more deeply involved in modern warfare, the traditional boundaries between military and civilian uses are increasingly blurred. Space is rapidly shifting from a domain of strategic deterrence towards one of tactical operations,” an article by researchers from China’s National University of Defence Technology said.

Sheriff says all family members of Nancy Guthrie cleared over her disappearance: ‘victims plain and simple’

Sheriff says all family members of Nancy Guthrie cleared over her disappearance: ‘victims plain and simple’
Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos said the Guthrie family has been ‘nothing but cooperative and gracious and are victims in this case’
- Bookmark
All members of Nancy Guthrie's family, including NBC News' Savannah Guthrie, her siblings, and their spouses, have been cleared as possible suspects, according to the Pima County Sheriff’s Office.
Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos made the announcement on Monday afternoon.
He said in a statement that the Guthrie family has been "nothing but cooperative and gracious and are victims in this case."
"To suggest otherwise is not only wrong, it is cruel," he said. "The Guthrie family are victims plain and simple."
The sheriff's department said in an earlier statement that there are no scheduled news conferences regarding the case today.
The memo issued by the department does not appear to have been in response to any new evidence or breakthroughs, but rather as a general statement on the status of the Guthrie family.
Nancy Guthrie, 84, was reported missing from her home in Arizona on February 1. Local investigators and the FBI have been searching for her for more than two weeks.
While law enforcement has been busy running down leads, Savannah Guthrie and her siblings have been making emotional pleas on social media asking the supposed kidnapper to reach out and provide proof of life and further instructions for how they can get their mother back.
Earlier on Monday, TMZ founder Harvey Levin announced that his publication had received a fourth letter from an individual claiming to have knowledge of who kidnapped Nancy Guthrie. The individual reportedly is refusing to reveal the information without payment first.
Levin said he had been in contact with the FBI and posted a video telling the tipster to provide the information to him, and that he would work with the FBI to secure a payment. The TMZ founder believes that the individual who sent Monday's letter is the same one who has sent three previous letters demanding payment for information about Nancy Guthrie's whereabouts.
"A fourth letter from the same person who says he knows where Nancy Guthrie is, and he wants money in return for the information,” Levin said. “Essentially, he wants the reward."
During his address, Levin also read a chilling line from the letter.
”‘I know what I saw five days ago south of the border, and I was told to shut up, so I know who he is, and that was definitely Nancy with them,’” he read.
Meanwhile, the Pima County Sheriff's Office is reportedly working with Walmart after it discovered the brand of backpack the suspected kidnapper wore on the night Nancy Guthrie disappeared was sold exclusively at the retailer.
The backpack is a 25-liter “Ozark Trail Hiker Pack." The "Ozark Trail" brand is a private, Walmart-owned outdoor brand that is only sold in its stores and on its website. However, it is possible the individual bought the pack from a private seller or from a second-hand sports retailer.
“This backpack is exclusive to Walmart and we are working with Walmart management to develop further leads,” Nanos said.
The clothing the suspect was wearing the night of the alleged abduction may also have been purchased at Walmart, but investigators noted that the clothing isn't exclusively offered by Walmart.
“This remains a possibility only," the sheriff's office said in a statement on Monday.
Investigators searching near Guthrie's home have collected several gloves and has sent them to a forensics lab for testing, according to the Pima County Sheriff's Office. Deputies noted that many of the gloves found in the area were from volunteers who were searching for Guthrie. It's unclear what kind of gloves were sent for further analysis.
The FBI and the sheriff's office are also still collecting tips about the case. According to the FBI, it has collected mofe than 13,000 calls about Guthrie since February 1, and the sheriff's department said it has taken at least 18,000 calls.
Investigators have not said whether any of those calls have proven helpful to the search.
Guthrie has been missing for more than two weeks, resulting in some criticism of the investigation. Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos told the Daily Mail on Sunday that he doesn't care about the "haters" who say the department released the crime scene too early.
"My officers were there for almost 20 hours, and they processed their scene, got it done, and brought in all the evidence," he told the outlet. "Then the FBI came and did their thing."
He also told the publication that claims he was blocking the FBI from accessing important evidence were wrong.
"Why would I do that?" he said. "It makes no sense."

Zelensky warns of new Russian strikes on Ukraine as Geneva peace talks resume

President Volodymyr Zelensky said Feb. 16 that Russia is preparing new large-scale attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure as Kyiv's negotiating team arrived in Geneva for another round of peace talks with the United States and Russia.
"Intelligence reports that the Russians are preparing new massive strikes on energy, and air defense must be configured properly," Zelensky said in his nightly address.
He urged partners to ensure the timely delivery of air defense support, saying delays could increase the damage from strikes.
"Any delay in supplying air defense missiles, any untimely delivery works for scaling up the damage from the strikes," he said, adding that commitments discussed at the recent Munich Security Conference should be implemented quickly.
Zelensky said his delegation had arrived in Geneva and was preparing for negotiations, but cautioned that continued Russian attacks could make progress harder.
"Russia cannot resist the temptation of the last days of winter cold and wants to inflict painful blows on Ukrainians," he said. "The more of this evil comes from Russia, the harder it will be for everyone to reach any agreements with them."
He said Ukraine has agreed to what he called realistic U.S. proposals, including an unconditional, long-term ceasefire, but said Russia has rejected the idea and continues assaults at the front and attacks on cities and energy facilities.
"We expect partners to act so that coercing the aggressor into peace truly works," he said.

Huckabee says US and Israel 'absolutely aligned' on Iran, warns diplomacy may not avert war

U.S. Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee said Monday that Washington and Jerusalem are “absolutely aligned” on Iran as nuclear talks between the United States and Tehran are set to resume Tuesday in Geneva.
Addressing leaders of Jewish groups from across the United States at the annual gathering of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations in Jerusalem, Huckabee said that he was in Washington last week for meetings President Donald Trump held with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and that “the United States and Israel are absolutely aligned on Iran. Iran cannot continue their nuclear and ballistic program. Iran is not Israel’s problem; it is the world’s problem.
“For 47 years, Iran has said death to America,” he said. “They preface that with death to Israel, but only because Israel is in the way.” He added that Iranian and Hezbollah-linked networks operate in parts of South America.
Huckabee said he did not know whether the upcoming round of talks would succeed in removing the threats posed by Iran’s nuclear program, ballistic missiles and support for regional proxy groups.
“Talks are taking place. But can anything come from the talks this week that will bring peace?” he said. “There is significant doubt as to whether the Iranian nuclear threat, ballistic program, and funding of terror will be removed. But if they were willing to do that, because they realize the consequences of not doing so, I’d be delighted.”
U.S. Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, a close Trump ally, also addressed the negotiations after meeting with Netanyahu and former prime minister Naftali Bennett in Tel Aviv. Graham said he is visiting the country “to reassure the Israeli people there is no light” between the U.S. and Israel on Iran, adding that “we’re in the weeks, not months, in terms of decision-making.”
Graham described Iran’s leadership as being at its weakest point since 1979, citing its struggling economy, weakened military and anti-government protests.
Earlier, Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baghaei was quoted by the IRNA state news agency as saying that “we can cautiously conclude that the American position on Iran’s nuclear issue has become more realistic.”
The U.S. delegation to the talks includes special envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner. It was not immediately clear whether U.S. Central Command chief Adm. Brad Cooper, who attended previous talks in Oman and drew criticism from Iranian officials, would participate.
Iran is represented by Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi and several diplomats from Tehran. Oman’s foreign minister, Badr Albusaidi, is mediating the talks.
In the previous round, Araghchi reportedly left the room before the U.S. delegation entered, though reports said the sides did shake hands. Iranian officials have not ruled out further handshakes in upcoming rounds.
Meanwhile, a small protest was held in Ilam province in western Iran, where demonstrators chanted “Death to Khamenei,” referring to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. On Tuesday, Iran will mark 40 days since the deaths of thousands of people in the regime's crackdown on street protests last month. Authorities are planning ceremonies across the country, with the Iranian armed forces describing them as memorials for “those killed in the American-Zionist rebellion.”
Iranian military drill — and footage of an aircraft carrier
Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps conducted a military exercise Monday in the Strait of Hormuz amid the possibility of a U.S. strike if talks between the sides collapse.
Iranian state television said the naval drill, dubbed “Smart Control of the Strait of Hormuz,” was intended to prepare the Revolutionary Guards for “potential security and military threats.” The semiofficial Mehr news agency, which is affiliated with the regime, reported that the exercise focused on a “decisive and comprehensive response by the operational forces of the Revolutionary Guards to anti-security plots in the maritime arena.”
Iran has repeatedly threatened to close the Strait of Hormuz, a strategic waterway through which about 20% of the world’s oil supply passes.
State television said the first phase of the naval maneuvers included the use of strategic weapons on three islands in the Persian Gulf. According to the report, a drone used in the exercise “exists in very large numbers” and is at the disposal of the Revolutionary Guards’ navy. The name of the drone and further details were not disclosed, but it was said to be capable of striking aerial and maritime targets. Not all aspects of the exercise were broadcast, the report added, citing security considerations.
The commander of the Guards’ navy, Alireza Tangsiri, issued a warning message. “For the sake of these islands and these waters, we will stand against any enemy to the fullest extent,” he said. “We have full control over the Strait of Hormuz — on the surface, in the air and underwater. We maintain full intelligence oversight of the strait around the clock to ensure the security of navigation and transit in this strategic waterway.”
BBC reported that the U.S. aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln was spotted by satellite about 240 kilometers (150 miles) off the coast of Oman. According to the report, the Lincoln had not been seen since January, when it was reported to have arrived in the region, but it had crossed open waters where satellite visibility is limited.
Late Thursday, The New York Times reported that the second U.S. aircraft carrier to be sent to the Middle East would be the USS Gerald R. Ford, along with its strike group. The Ford is arriving after its fighter jets took part in an operation to capture former Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, who was brought to the United States and is standing trial there.
With its arrival, it will mark the first time since March 2025 that two U.S. aircraft carriers are simultaneously operating in the region. At that time, the USS Harry S. Truman and the USS Carl Vinson were deployed during U.S. military strikes against Houthi forces in Yemen.

‘Unprecedented’: FBI refusing to share info from Alex Pretti investigation
- The FBI has refused to share information with Minnesota authorities investigating the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti by federal officers during the Trump administration's surge into Minneapolis.
- The Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA) described the FBI's lack of cooperation as 'concerning and unprecedented' and is pursuing legal avenues to obtain evidence.
- This decision follows a similar refusal in the case of Renee Good, another Minnesota resident fatally shot by a federal officer.
- The Department of Justice has opened a civil rights probe into the case, and a federal judge has criticized administration officials for baselessly labeling Pretti a “domestic terrorist” before an investigation was launched.
- Pretti's family has called for a joint state and federal investigation, while the killings have intensified outrage over the Trump administration's deployment of immigration officers in Minnesota.

Pod Save Australia: Why our obsession with US politics isn't going anywhere

Pod Save America and why Australians remain obssessed with US politics
An hour or so into a Friday night show at one of Melbourne's most stunning performance venues, the night's headliner turned to the hits, or at least the sort of material their legion of fans has come to expect.
"Whenever you are dealing with a budget or government funding shutdown, there's a political win and a substantive win," Pod Save America co-host Dan Pfeiffer said as the clock ticked past 9:00pm.
"So let's talk about the political win first … "
Instead of confusion — or boredom — in the face of such wonky appraisal of shutdown politics, the 2,500 capacity Hamer Hall crowd nodded in keen affirmation.
That so many Australians would give up their Friday night to listen to four American podcasters dig into the minutiae of US politics might by now be unsurprising, though it is no less remarkable.
"Australians are deeply invested in the health and continuity of American democracy," Australia Institute international and security affairs director Emma Shortis said.
"We know that it has huge consequences for us and the world."
Hope in a 'doom spiral'
After almost a decade and more than a billion downloads, Pod Save America has built the sort of reach and influence most traditional media can now only dream of.
The oft-mentioned biographies of the four hosts — Jon Favreau, Jon Lovett, Tommy Vietor and Dan Pfeiffer — as former staffers for Barack Obama remain a key part of their appeal.
Yet their "no-bullshit" conversations, which swing from progressive activism to centre-left pragmatism, have grown such a community as to be their own political force.
The entry point might be the hosts' capacity to open up insider politics to the outside, but the audience for Pod Save America and the associated Crooked Media stable of podcasts isn't just treated as listeners.
'Friends of the Pod' are encouraged to become messengers in their own communities, organisers, door knockers, phone bankers, even to run for office.
"The truth is, I couldn't be prouder of them," said former president Barack Obama, at a recent live show in November.
"They are spreading the word to a new generation about what is possible in politics."
That word has evidently spread to Australia, where Pod Save America has been on a run of packed-out live shows up the east coast.
The cheapest tickets at the Melbourne leg were just shy of $100 — $200+ for a VIP meet and greet.
"My origin story [with the podcast] is really post-Trump's win in 2016 and as many people were, grappling with what that meant for the world, and probably being in a doom spiral," said Jane Thomas, a 53-year-old from Brunswick sporting a VIP lanyard in the venue's foyer.
"I started listening to them and was absolutely hooked from that point. There's a validation of your feelings, there's a sense of insight, but they also bring a sense of hope."
Trump term 'bad' for Australia
The tour comes at a complicated moment for US-Australia relations.
The chaotic and volatile nature of the Trump presidency has sparked calls to rethink the strategic alliance with America.
A recent poll from the United States Studies Centre found a majority of Australians think President Trump's second term has been bad for Australia.
The appetite to travel to the US is waning.
New data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics, cited by the Australian Institute, shows Australian trips to the USA dropped 3.1 per cent in the past year, and 32 per cent since before the pandemic.
The risk of becoming politically or culturally untethered from the US is nonetheless minimal, according to Jared Mondschein from the United States Studies Centre.
"We found that only about 16 per cent of Australians said the second Trump term has been good for Australia ... but the percentage of Australians who want to abandon the US Alliance altogether is 17 per cent," said Mr Mondschein, who is based at the University of Sydney.
"Australians can see the US is moving in a different direction, but at the same time, they can see that Australia only has one America.
"Really, what is the alternative?"
'Australian politics is a bit banal'
The unusual sight of wand security at each stage door delayed the start of the Hamer Hall show.
It was both a requirement of the podcast team and a reminder that they exist in a culture where political podcasters have recently been murdered on stage.
An audible buzz of excitement crackled among the long lines of attendees, carrying popcorn and drinks and wearing 'Friend of the Pod' merchandise.
"It's hard to imagine a similar phenomenon in Australia — like former staffers of Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, I guess, starting their own podcast and creating a cult of celebrity around them," said Dr Shortis.
Self-described 'swing voter' Dan Williams attended the Friday night show with a friend.
"American politics is very worrying, but I think Australian politics is a bit banal," said the 52 year-old.
Earlier in the day, Sussan Ley was toppled as Liberal Party leader.
No one seemed to mind that the leadership spill — or any Australian political news for that matter — failed to rate a mention throughout the nearly two-hour live show.
A beaming audience instead watched as the hosts dissected recent polling on the deployment of ICE agents, laughed at US cable news clips, and picked apart a performance by US Attorney General Pam Bondi at a congressional hearing related to the Epstein files.
"This is the last thing that Trump should want attention being drawn to!" said Dan Pfeiffer.
"It's like robbing a bank and having your getaway driver light herself on fire outside the bank."
No turning away from 'mesmerising' US
Alongside the typically expletive-laden jokes was a particular strain of American earnestness.
"This is an absolute crisis. The presidency is criminalising opposition to the regime," said Jon Favreau at one point, who, US Vice-President JD Vance last year, labelled a "dipshit".
Such earnest appeal tends to jar with Australian sensibilities, but here it was met with rampant applause.
"This moment is so far out of the bounds of normal, that of course it is captivating people's attention," Dr Shortis said.
"When Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said the world was facing a rupture, not a transition, he was right, and I think people feel that intuitively and know that so much of that is driven by the radically changing nature of American power."
Part of the podcast's appeal, she guesses, is its capacity to capture the rise of far-right politics and characterise the media ecosystem that supports and surrounds it.
As One Nation continues its own skyrocketing rise in the polls, that bears more relevance to Australian audiences than ever.
"There is an attempt on the far-right of Australian politics to import Trumpian politics," she said.
"I think the Dutton campaign tried to do that, One Nation is doing that quite successfully on social media and its approach to the internet and meme culture."
Toward the end of the show, the hosts each picked a Democratic official's name out of a hat as part of a game to advocate for why they should be the party's presidential nominee in 2028.
The reactions of the crowd suggested an almost bizarre familiarity with the potential candidates — one that many Australian politicians would dearly covet for themselves.
Jon Lovett, who frequently serves as the podcast's comic relief, found himself spruiking for US Senator Jon Ossoff.
"His mum is Australian!!!" called out several people in the crowd, which appeared to be news to the hosts.
A 2023 piece in US outlet Politico titled 'Why the biggest US politics junkies might be living overseas' once suggested that "some of the Australians [the author] encountered knew more about US politics than most Americans".
Based on the local response to Pod Save America alone, the Australian obsession with US politics is unlikely to disappear anytime soon.
"There is this sense that the America that we thought we knew is gone. It's not coming back, but we don't know what emerges in its place," said Dr Shortis.
"Part of the reason it is mesmerising is because nobody knows how it ends."

US troops arrive in Nigeria on training mission

US troops arrive in Nigeria on training mission
February 16, 2026The United States has sent 100 soldiers to Nigeria, with the hopes of helping the West African country defend itself from the threat of armed groups.
Nigeria's military announced the arrival of the toops, along with equipment, on Monday.
Why is the US sending soldiers to Nigeria?
Nigeria has been plagued by violence, as its army is locked into a protracted fight with dozens of local armed groups, including Islamic extremists such as Boko Haram and its breakaway faction Islamic State West Africa Province.
Among the groups are also the IS-linked Lakurawa, and other "bandit" groups, specializing in kidnapping for ransom and illegal mining.
In a statement, the military said the Nigerian government had made a request to the US for help with training, technical support and intelligence-sharing.
Samaila Uba, spokesperson for Nigeria's Defense Headquarters, said the US troops are there for training purposes and will not engage in combat or have a direct operational role.
Nigerian forces will maintain complete command authority.
The arrival of US forces follows criticism by the Trump administration over Nigeria's security situation. In December, US forces launched airstrikes on Islamic State group-affiliated militants in the country's northwest.
How did Nigeria respond to Trump's accusations?
The troop deployment also comes after tensions between the two nations have eased, following accusations from US President Donald Trump against Nigeria over the protection of Christians.
Trump has claimed that Nigeria has failed to protect Christians in its territory from an alleged genocide against them.
The Nigerian government has maintained that claims of a systemic religious persecution of Christians are "unfounded," saying that US rhetoric had been "disparaging."
The West African nation has said its forces are waging a comprehensive counter-terrorism campaign against groups that target "Nigerians of all faiths."
Nigeria is home to more than 200 ethnic groups that largely practice Christianity or Islam, with some also following traditional religions. While the country has a history of coexistence, it has also experienced sporadic violence driven by ethnic tensions and competition over scarce resources.
Ongoing violence continues to plague central Nigeria, pitting Fulani Muslim herders against predominantly Christian farmers. However, experts say that their conflict is primarily driven by limited land and resources rather than religious differences.

Nigeria announces arrival of 100 US soldiers following Trump's claims of Christian 'persecution'

Some 100 US soldiers are being deployed to Nigeria as part of increased military cooperation to fight insecurity in the West African country, the Nigerian defence ministry announced Monday.
"The Defence Headquarters (DHQ) wishes to announce the arrival of about 100 United States military personnel and associated equipment at Bauchi Airfield," the statement said on Monday.
"The arrival is planned and deliberate following a formal request by the Federal Government of Nigeria to the US government to support a clearly defined military training requirement, technical support and intelligence sharing with the members of the Armed Forces of Nigeria."
The ministry did not specify when the "US military trainers" arrived or were due to arrive.
Nigeria is facing a longstanding militant insurgency in the northeast, a conflict between farmers and herders in north-central regions, separatist violence in the southeast, and kidnappings for ransom in the northwest.
US troops won’t engage in combat
US President Donald Trump has claimed that Christians in Nigeria are being "persecuted" and are victims of "genocide" perpetrated by "terrorists".
But Abuja and most independent experts say the violence in Nigeria indiscriminately affects both Christians and Muslims.
On December 25, the US military conducted air strikes in Nigeria's Sokoto State.
Nigerian authorities subsequently said the action was coordinated with them and it targeted Daesh-linked militants.
For the announced deployment, Nigeria's DHQ said: "The US personnel are technical specialists serving strictly in an advisory and training capacity. They are not combat forces."
Major General Samaila Uba, spokesman for Nigeria’s Defense Headquarters, previously has said that the US troops won’t engage in combat or have a direct operational role, and that Nigerian forces will have complete command authority.

Spain said on Monday it will use UN channels to send humanitarian aid to Cuba, which is suffering an acute economic crisis worsened by a de facto US fuel blockade.
“Spain will provide humanitarian aid … to Cuba through the United Nations system in the form of food and essential health products,” the foreign ministry said in a statement following a meeting between the foreign ministers of the two countries in Madrid.
The announcement follows the dispatch by Mexico of 800 tonnes of humanitarian aid to Cuba, which arrived on two Mexican navy ships late last week.

Cuba’s economic straits have worsened with moves by US President Donald Trump to economically strangle the Caribbean country.
Trump has vowed to cut off oil and fuel deliveries to Cuba, following the US military operation last month to attack Venezuela’s capital, Caracas, and grab leader Nicolas Maduro. Venezuela had been Cuba’s main supplier of oil.

The United Nations said on Friday it was deeply alarmed by the crisis unfolding in Cuba.

English Premier League side Brentford has advanced to the fifth round of the FA Cup, defeating non-league club Macclesfield 1-0.
Macclesfield made history in the tournament, defeating Premier League side and FA Cup holders Crystal Palace in one of the competition's biggest upsets.
What's next?
Text will face West Ham United in the round of the FA Cup.
Non-league English football club Macclesfield's tremendous FA Cup run has come to an end, falling to Premier League side Brentford on Tuesday, AEDT.
An own goal midway through the second half by Macclesfield's Sam Heathcote ended the deadlock, and would lead to the 1-0 win for Brentford.
Sixth-tier Macclesfield, who knocked out holders Crystal Palace in the previous round, frustrated their Premier League opponents in the first half of their fourth-round tie.
Goalkeeper Max Dearnley made some fine saves, denying Brentford's Reiss Nelson from close range.
Macclesfield's James Dawson came closest to scoring for the hosts with a long-range effort that sailed just wide.
After the break, Brentford increased the pressure, forcing Dearnley to react quickly to keep out Kaye Furo's close-range header.
However, the goalkeeper was beaten when Heathcote inadvertently headed Aaron Hickey's cross into his own net while attempting to clear in the 70th minute.
The result secured Brentford a fifth-round tie against West Ham United. Macclesfield bowed out of the competition after a brilliant run and another strong performance against top-flight opposition.
The final match of the FA Cup fourth round will be played on March 4, AEDT, with third-tier side Port Vale hosting second-tier club Bristol City.
The winner of that match will play Sunderland.

A quarter of parents say their children aren’t getting mental health support

A quarter of parents say their children aren’t getting mental health support
The burden was disproportionately felt in households with homeschooled children
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
Nearly a quarter of parents in the United States say at least one of their children is not receiving the mental health care they need, according to Harvard researchers, exposing critical gaps to access around the country.
At least one child needed mental health care in one in five of the 173,000 households included in the new survey.
“Among these parents, 24.8 percent reported an unmet need, 16.6 percent reported difficulty in accessing care and 21.8 percent cited such difficulty as the reason their children did not receive care,” the researchers said in a study analyzing the 2023-2024 data.
The burden was disproportionately felt in households with homeschooled children. More than 30 percent of children in those homes had an unmet need for care.
“Our analysis provides timely evidence that, despite the increasing awareness of youth mental health needs, access to necessary mental health care remains a challenge for a large number of U.S. households,” Hao Yu, an associate professor at Harvard Medical School, said in a statement.
The burden was also greater for households with a single parent and multiple children, and in households that had no health insurance or were on Medicaid benefits.
This suggests that “Medicaid coverage may not adequately address treatment access issues,” the researchers said.
“It is concerning to see larger gaps for single-parent and multi-child households, households with homeschooled children, uninsured households and households with Medicaid,” said Alyssa Burnett, project manager at the Harvard Pilgrim Health Care Institute.
The researchers said the survey’s results provide evidence that action needs to be taken to address these barriers to access.
“Strategies such as child mental health workforce initiatives and integrating mental health care into primary care should be implemented at the state level to remove barriers to this much-needed care,” said Yu.
The findings build on previous research that showed families’ race and ethnicity, health insurance coverage, parental education and various socioeconomic factors are all blame.
“Being a member of non-Hispanic Black or non-Hispanic Asian and other minoritized populations was significantly associated with higher perceived difficulty accessing mental health care services,” researchers in Tennessee and Ohio wrote in 2024.
Mental health care during childhood - as children’s brains grow - is crucial to ensure a child is able to have a happy and healthy life. Treatment may include talk therapy, medication or school-based services.
One in five U.S. kids between the ages of three and 17 years old has a mental, emotional, behavioral or developmental disorder, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, up from one in seven in 2019.
Just 20 percent of those kids will receive treatment, the agency says.

‘ICE-style enforcement’: Nearly 70 groups slam proposed EU migration policy
Nearly 70 groups hit out on Feb 16 at EU reforms to migration currently under consideration by the European Parliament, comparing them to US policy under President Donald Trump and calling on officials to abandon the text.
“This threat is real and immediate,” the wide array of associations, including European and national rights groups, said in a letter expressing concern over police raids of public and private spaces, and racial profiling.
“They want to oblige member states to ‘detect’ undocumented people – turning everyday spaces, public services, and community interactions into tools of ICE-style immigration enforcement,” they warned.
The Trump administration has ramped up efforts to deport millions of undocumented migrants from the United States.
Trump slams energy deal between California and Britain, calls governor Newsom ‘loser’
US President Donald Trump denounced a clean energy agreement between the United Kingdom and California Governor Gavin Newsom hours after it was signed on Feb 16, media outlet Politico reported.
In an interview with the outlet, Mr Trump said it was “inappropriate” for Britain to be dealing with the Democratic governor. Mr Trump, a Republican, also branded Mr Newsom “a loser,” saying “his state has gone to hell, and his environmental work is a disaster.”
Mr Newsom is an outspoken Trump critic and has publicly mulled seeking the Democratic presidential nomination in 2028.
France opens murder probe as killing of far-right activist stokes tensions
French authorities have opened a murder probe into the death of a far-right activist last week, a public prosecutor said on Feb 16, in a killing the government has blamed partly on the hard left.
Mr Quentin Deranque, 23, died after sustaining a severe brain injury when he was attacked on Feb 12 by “at least six” people on the sidelines of a far-right protest against a left-wing politician speaking at a university in Lyon, the western city’s prosecutor Thierry Dran said at a press conference on Feb 16.
No arrests had yet been made and authorities were working to identify the masked and hooded suspects in the killing, which is being investigated as an “intentional homicide” and “aggravated assault”, he added.
Godfather and Apocalypse Now actor Robert Duvall dead at 95
Robert Duvall, who played the smooth mafia lawyer in The Godfather and stole the show with his depiction of a surfing-crazed colonel in Apocalypse Now, has died at the age of 95, his wife said on Feb 16.
His death on Feb 15 was confirmed by his wife Luciana Duvall.
“Yesterday we said goodbye to my beloved husband, cherished friend, and one of the greatest actors of our time. Bob passed away peacefully at home,” she wrote.
S’pore’s Faiz Basha battles tough conditions, places 35th in slalom at Winter Olympics
After enduring a difficult start to his Winter Olympics debut, Singaporean alpine skier Faiz Basha returned to the Bormio slopes with a vengeance on Feb 16.
On Feb 14, the 23-year-old saw his run in the men’s giant slalom ending prematurely with a DNF (did not finish) after he lost his right ski as he attempted to clear a gate.
Two days later, he had to battle through driving snow in his first slalom run at the Stelvio Ski Centre in Bormio, Italy. But he powered through the treacherous conditions to clock a time of 2 minutes and 20.45 seconds across two runs to finish 35th.

Signs are pointing to a ‘blue wave’ in the midterm elections. Here’s why Democrats shouldn’t get too cocky
The map still favors Republicans, Democratic voters see their party leaders as weak and Trump has always found ways to defy political gravity, Eric Garcia writes
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
The mid-presidential-term congressional elections typically have a rhythm: two years after a president begins their term, voters get antsy that progress has not come quick enough, or they find they dislike what the administration does.
Voters then sweep in the opposing party to take control of the legislative branch — or at least prevent it from being a rubber stamp for the White House.
And Donald Trump, now in his second, non-consecutive, term, is facing the dreaded six-year itch, which is actually a 10-year itch given that he stayed on the scene as a power player from 2021 to 2025 despite being out of the White House.
The generic ballot, which determines whether voters would vote for a generic Democrat or Republican for Congress, currently shows Democrats have a significant advantage.
But the Democrats generally do not play well with a lead, to use a sports metaphor.
Polling shows that voters disapprove of Trump’s performance on everything from immigration, the issue where he’s set the tone for the past decade, and the economy. CNN flagged that Trump is now doing worse than Joe Biden did around the same time in his presidency in four polls.
And yes, all of this is a five-alarm fire for Republicans. House Speaker Mike Johnson notably has only 218 seats in the House of Representatives and cannot afford any defections at any time. And Democrats, despite having their own internecine fights between progressives and moderates, remain surprisingly unified.
But Democrats need to be wary of past resting on laurels — or inattention to the concerns of voters beyond the drumbeat of ‘Trump and MAGA is bad’ and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries should not start measuring the drapes in the speaker’s office just yet.
Democrats still have a long way to go when it comes to whether they can take back the House, let alone win the Senate. And there are always exceptions that prove the rule. Let’s start with one uncomfortable truth: The Democratic Party remains unpopular.
Not only that, a Quinnipiac University poll showed that only 42 percent of Democrats approve of the way Democrats in Congress are handling their job. By contrast, 77 percent of Republicans approve of how Republicans are doing their job.
This can be perfectly exemplified by the fact that in New Jersey’s 11th district earlier this month, Analilia Mejia, a progressive activist, won a primary for Gov. Mikie Sherrill’s old seat, beating more establishment candidates. That simultaneously served as a warning shot for party leaders to get on the same page, but more moderate front-liners risk being roped in with the more left-wing insurgents.
Democrats face another hurdle: an unfavorable Senate map.
Last week, Sen. Susan Collins announced she would seek re-election in Maine. Democrats have long hoped to beat the moderate Republican ever since she won a seat in liberal New England. But she has continued to vex them and won despite sharing a ticket with Barack Obama in 2008 and Joe Biden in 2020.
Democrats caught a lucky break in North Carolina when Trump chased away incumbent Sen. Thom Tillis and created an opening for popular former Democratic governor Roy Cooper, who like Collins, wins over split-ticket voters.
Those are the easy ones. After that, they have to hope that Republicans in Texas nominate the embattled attorney general Ken Paxton to beat John Cornyn in the primary next month to have even a remote chance of winning. And it’s still Texas. Democrats caught a lucky break when former congresswoman Mary Peltola jumped into Alaska’s Senate race. But even though Alaska has ranked-choice voting, it’s still a state that Trump won by 13 points.
The other two options for Democrats aren’t that easy either. Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst announced her retirement, but Trump won the state by 13.3 points. Former senator Sherrod Brown, who lost in 2024, is running against Sen. John Husted, whom the governor appointed to finish JD Vance’s term. But Trump turned the state from purple to deep red in the past decade and won it by 11.2 points.
Trump defied the rules of political physics as long as he’s been on the political scene.
Democrats have long wanted Trump to have his comeuppance the way other presidents have had in their midterm elections. But almost every time there has been a vote that served as a referendum on Trump, the blue wave came with a caveat.
In 2018, when Democrats won the House of Representatives, they won 40 seats, far less than the walloping 63 seats Republicans won in 2010 in the Tea Party wave against Obama. On top of that, while Democrats flipped Senate seats in Arizona–beginning its turn to becoming a purple state–and Nevada, they lost seats in Florida, Indiana, Missouri and North Dakota.
The same thing happened in 2020.
That year, as Trump bungled the response to Covid-19, they hoped to grow their majority in the House and flip Senate seats in North Carolina, Iowa, Maine and even Kansas. Instead, they lost 13 seats and Trump actually grew his support among Hispanic and Asian-American voters. Democrats would only win Senate seats in Arizona and Colorado on Election Night and their future hinged on winning two runoff races in Georgia two months later when Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock would win their races.
Then, of course, there is 2024, when Democrats hoped to expel Trump. Instead, due to disapproval over rising costs and the Biden administration losing control of migration across the US-Mexico border, Trump won all swing states and, in fact, blue cities saw a bigger swing to Trump and he further consolidated his support among Hispanic voters.
This time may be different. There will be no impending Trump return and he can no longer be on the ballot. Whereas Joe Biden’s administration said inflation was temporary and the pain would eventually go away, the Trump administration denies Americans are even feeling the pinch from tariffs he imposed.
And midterms rarely require the minority party to craft a message other than to not be the party in power.
That being said, Democrats likely remember these painful near-victories and know they will need to fortify their offensive strategy.

Germany to back Lebanon after UN peacekeepers leave

Germany will keep supporting Lebanon after UN peacekeepers leave, the German president says
Germany moved to assure Lebanon on Monday that it will support the Lebanese government even after pulling out German troops deployed as part of UN peacekeepers along the Lebanon-Israel border when their mission ends later this year.
German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier made the announcement during a news conference at the presidential palace near Beirut.
Germany’s navy, he said, is already training Lebanese troops as they boost their presence in the country’s south following the 14-month war between Israel and the Lebanese Hezbollah group.
The mission of the multinational UN peacekeeping force in southern Lebanon, known as UNIFIL, concludes at the end of 2026, nearly five decades after it was deployed. The force has played a significant role in monitoring the security situation in the region, including during the Israel-Hezbollah war last year.
Over the past months, Beirut has said that Lebanon will need a follow-up force to fill the vacuum in southern Lebanon once the UN peacekeepers leave.
“After the end of UNIFIL’s mission, Germany will stay by the side of your country to boost state authority,” Steinmeier said, without elaborating. It remains unlikely German troops — tasked with preventing arms smuggling by sea and helping the Lebanese army monitor the country’s sea border — would remain in Lebanon.
UNIFIL currently numbers about 7,500 peacekeepers, including 179 Germans.
“The Lebanese armed Forces are, of course, the backbone of stability in Lebanon and this means that after UNIFIL’s mission we have to think how to strengthen” the army, Steinmeier said.
Steinmeier added that the process of disarming Hezbollah — which was part of a November 2024 US-brokered ceasefire that halted the fighting — should move ahead and that Israel should fully withdraw from Lebanese territory.
Lebanese President Joseph Aoun said Lebanon paid a high price for the Hezbollah-Israel war, which Hezbollah started by firing rockets into Israel a day after the Palestinian group Hamas attacked southern Israel on October 7, 2023, triggering the war in Gaza.
Israel expanded its attacks that included bombardment and a ground operation in September 2024, severely weakening Hezbollah.
The Israel-Hezbollah conflict killed more than 4,000 people in Lebanon, including hundreds of civilians, and caused an estimated $11 billion in damage and destruction, according to the World Bank.
In Israel, 127 people died, including 80 soldiers.
“We were forced to live through violent conflicts we did not choose and we bore their burdens. We are no longer able to do so,” Aoun said of the Israel-Hezbollah war.
Aoun also said he had asked Steinmeier to have Germany assume a “main role” after UNIFIL, without elaborating what that would entail, and to also ask Israel to abide by the ceasefire and withdraw from Lebanon. He made no mention of Hezbollah's withdrawal from southern Lebanon.

11-year-old cheerleader and mom found dead in hotel room at dance competition
- A mother and her 11-year-old daughter were discovered dead in a Las Vegas hotel room in an apparent murder-suicide.

Drone attack on busy market in Sudan kills at least 28
Drone-fired missiles have hit a market in central Sudan’s Kordofan region, killing at least 28 people and wounding dozens of others, a rights group says.
Emergency Lawyers, a group tracking violence against civilians, said in a statement on Monday that drones bombed the al-Safiya market in the town of Sodari in North Kordofan state.

The bombing on Sunday occurred when the market was packed with people, “exacerbating the humanitarian tragedy”, it said, adding that the number of casualties is likely to rise.
“The attack occurred when the market was bustling with civilians, including women, children and the elderly,” the group said.
“The repeated use of drones to target populated areas shows a grave disregard for civilian lives and signals an escalation that threatens what remains of daily life in the province. Therefore, we demand an immediate halt to drone attacks by both sides of the conflict,” the statement said.
The area is currently the fiercest front line in the three-year-old war between the Sudanese army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF).
Sodari, a remote town where desert trade routes cross, is 230km (132 miles) northwest of el-Obeid, the capital of North Kordofan, which the RSF has been trying to encircle for months.
The Kordofan region has seen a surge in deadly drone attacks as both sides fight over the country’s vital east-west axis, which links the western RSF-held Darfur region, through el-Obeid, to the army-controlled capital, Khartoum, and the rest of Sudan.
After consolidating its hold on Darfur last year, the RSF has pushed east through the oil- and gold-rich Kordofan in an attempt to seize Sudan’s central corridor.
Emergency Lawyers said on X that the drones targeting the market on Sunday belonged to the army.
Two military officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorised to brief the media, told The Associated Press news agency that the army does not target civilian infrastructure and denied the attack.
A week ago, a drone close to the city of Rahad in North Kordofan hit a vehicle carrying displaced families, killing at least 24 people, including eight children. A day before the attack, a World Food Programme aid convoy was also hit by drones.
Violence ‘shocking in scale and brutality’
Fighting between the RSF and the Sudanese military erupted into a full-blown war across the country in April 2023. So far, at least 40,000 people have been killed and 12 million displaced, according to the World Health Organization.
Aid groups say the true death toll could be many times higher, as the fighting in vast and remote areas impedes access.
The United Nations human rights chief recently said that the Kordofan region remains “volatile and a focus of hostilities” as the warring parties vie for control of strategic areas.
Both sides have been accused of atrocities.
The UN Human Rights Office issued a report on Friday saying that more than 6,000 people were killed over three days when the RSF unleashed “a wave of intense violence… shocking in its scale and brutality” in Darfur in late October.
The RSF’s offensive to capture the city of el-Fasher, which used to be a military stronghold, in late October included widespread atrocities that amounted to war crimes and possible crimes against humanity, according to the UN.
The war has created the world’s largest hunger and displacement crisis. It has also effectively split the country in two, with the army holding the centre, north and east, while the RSF controls the west and, with its allies, parts of the south.

With gold medal win, Elana Meyers Taylor is the most decorated U.S. female bobsledder
Elana Meyers Taylor won the Olympic gold medal for Team USA in women's monobob on Monday, making her the most decorated U.S. female bobsledder out there.
She beat out Germany's Laura Nolte. Fellow American, Kaillie Armbruster Humphries, who's won gold three times, took home the bronze.
Meyers Taylor, a 41-year-old five-time Olympian, previously won silver three times and bronze twice. She also has more medals to her name than any Black athlete in Winter Olympics history, according to Team USA.
With Monday's gold, she's also tied speed skater Bonnie Blair for the most medals by a female U.S. Winter Olympian. Speed skater Apolo Anton Ohno, who earned eight medals across three Winter Olympics, holds the overall top spot for U.S. Winter Olympians.
Meyers Taylor is also now the oldest American woman to ever win gold at the Winter Games.
"I love going fast and I love being able to control this thing that should be out of control, that should be uncontrollable," she told CBS News before the race. "It's just so much fun to me and when you hit the curves right and when you're gliding, it feels like being a superhero."
Meyers Taylor also competes in two-woman bobsled.
Last year, she took home bronze in the world championships. Overall, she's earned 10 medals across her years competing in the world championships.
Meyers Taylor originally had hopes of competing in the Summer Olympics as a football player, but told CBS News she "had a disaster of a tryout." Her parents, who'd seen bobsledding on TV, suggested she give it a shot.
Husband Nic Taylor is a former Olympic bobsledder.
A mom of two, Meyers Taylor is also an advocate for children who have disabilities. Both of her sons, Nico and Noah, are deaf and Nico also has Down Syndrome. In addition to training for the Olympics, she's also juggled normal parenting responsibilities and learning sign language.

Fellow actors, colleagues and others are offering remembrances following the death of Robert Duvall

Remembrances poured in Monday in honor of Robert Duvall, the Oscar-winning actor known for roles in “Apocalypse Now,” “Lonesome Dove,” Tender Mercies" and as the intrepid consigliere of the first two “Godfather” movies.
Duvall died Sunday at age 95 at at his home in Virginia, according to an announcement from his publicist and a statement posted on his Facebook page by his wife, Luciana Duvall.
Viola Davis
“I’ve always been in awe of your towering portrayals of men who were both quiet and dominating in their humanness. You were a giant … an icon … Apocalypse Now, The Godfather, To Kill a Mockingbird, Tender Mercies, The Apostle, Lonesome Dove … etc … Greatness never dies. It stays … as a gift. Rest well, sir. Your name will be spoken.” — the actor, Duvall's co-star in “Widows,” on Instagram.
Adam Sandler
“Funny as hell. Strong as hell. One of the greatest actors we ever had. Such a great man to talk to and laugh with. Loved him so much. We all did. So many movies to choose from that were legendary. Watch them when you can. Sending his wife Luciana and all his family and friends our condolences.” — the actor, who starred with Duvall in “Hustle,” on X.
Michael Keaton
“another friend goes down. acted with and became friends. shared a great afternoon on my front porch talking about horses. he was greatness personified as an actor.” — the actor, Duvall's co-star in “The Paper,” on Instagram.
Robert Patrick
“We talked horses, dogs, Clemson football, dancing the tango and Marlon Brando. At one point he told me to go find the letter Marlon had sent him after they worked together on The Godfather. It was typed and perfectly composed. Bobby was more proud of that letter than his Oscar. Marlon was the actor he looked up to.” — the actor, remembering a recent visit at Duvall's home in Virginia, on Facebook.
Rob Schneider
"Powerful yet gentle as a bird in his unforgettable turn in “The Lonesome Dove,” Bob had the ability to make you forget instantly the conceit that you were watching a performance and gripped us with the sincerity and emotion of a consigliere as Tom in “The Godfather.” Equally hilarious as the surfer loving Army Officer in “Apocalypse Now,” he never gave a moment for the audience to not believe." — the actor, on Facebook.
Jamie Lee Curtis
“The greatest consigliere the screen has ever seen. Bravo, Robert Duvall” — the actor, on Instagram
SAG-AFTRA

Our thoughts are with his wife, Luciana, and all who loved him.” — the union that represents actors and broadcasters, on X.
Mike Huckabee
“One of my best days was spending a full day with Robert Duvall & his lovely wife at his ranch — interviewed him for my then Fox News show. He was gracious, hospitable, & humble. Truly a gentleman & one of the greatest actors of all time. He didn’t ‘play’ a role— he WAS the role.” — the U.S. ambassador to Israel, on X.

Touching moment Ohio high school student who was homeless is gifted a car
Daron Webb hopes to become a licensed electrician
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
An Ohio high school graduate who navigated homelessness, mental health struggles and taking care of his little brother on top of going to class has been gifted a car by his local community.
Video shared by WTVG showed Daron Webb covering his mouth with his hands and exclaiming, “What!” as he was surprised with a red Honda Civic in Rossford, a suburb of Toledo, last Thursday.
While finishing senior year at Waite High School in Toledo, Webb was experiencing homelessness and depression — and was also responsible for the care of his younger brother — when he fell behind in credits and was unable to graduate on time.
“The main thing was getting Daron to graduate. He fell credit-deficient. He fell behind, and then, finally, he kind of divulged that he was living in a not-so-common situation,” Toledo Public Schools Superintendent Dr. Romulus Durant told WTVG.
With Durant’s help, Webb attended summer school and graduated from Waite High School in the fall of 2025. Soon after, he was connected with the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, and the labor union took him on, according to the report.
“He had a vision of wanting to be in IBW, so working with some of the brotherhood and sisterhood of the IBW family, they immediately took him in,” Durant said.
When Durant learned that Webb had been walking over a mile to work every day, regardless of the weather, he knew he had to step in again.
The superintendent reached out to Yark Automotive Group, State Farm and other local organizations to rally behind Webb and get him a 2018 Honda Civic, according to the report.
Emily Yark, of Yark Automotive Group, said her family-owned business was more than happy to help.
“We believe in supporting the success of our community and our neighbors,” Yark said. “We cannot wait to see the look on Daron’s face when he gets the keys to his new car and hope it provides him with the continuing drive toward success.”
Webb, who hopes to become a licensed electrician, was completely surprised by the gift. “Man, I don’t even know what I’m feeling right now…It’s just I don’t even, haven’t had time to process everything ‘cause I did not expect it,” Webb said.
“Don’t get caught up in what other people think. It’s important that you stick to what you truly believe and what you truly think that’s going to benefit you, and it’s going to go from there,” Webb said.

Female troops are under assault, and not just in Bnei Brak

Female troops are under assault, and not just in Bnei Brak
More and more young women, including religious ones, are choosing army service, proving their worth on the battlefield even as conservatives launch a new campaign to push them out
It is impossible to know exactly what motivated the violent mob that converged upon two soldiers in Bnei Brak on Sunday, forcing them to run and hide in fear for their lives before being rescued by police.
Authorities have indicated that the uniformed squad commanders from the Education and Youth Corps were in the ultra-Orthodox stronghold to visit a recruit who was set to enlist in their unit next month, a standard practice.
Their presence, though, set off false rumors that they were there to arrest a draft dodger or forcibly draft a young religious man. Such hearsay has sparked rioting elsewhere in the past.
So the fact that both soldiers were female may not have been a central factor egging their attackers on.
Yet Sunday’s melee was more than just the most recent battle in a war being waged by an ultra-Orthodox community seeking to cut itself off from the rest of society.
With the place of women in the military under fresh assault from some corners of society, as the ranks of female soldiers, including those from religious backgrounds, continue to swell, the riot was also a manifestation of the toxic fraying of the consensus around the Israel Defense Force’s push for gender equality.
More women joining up
Since the establishment of the State of Israel, young women, from the age of 18, have been obligated to enlist in the IDF. Those claiming a religious lifestyle are exempted, though they also have the option of serving the nation’s civilian needs as part of what is known as National Service.
According to data provided by the IDF to the Movement for Freedom of Information, the recruitment rate among female graduates of secular schools has remained stable over the last decade, standing at approximately 92 percent.
However, the last several years have seen young women coming from national-religious backgrounds increasingly joining their secular counterparts, rather than signing up for the civilian corps.
According to the data, between the years 2018 and 2025, the rate of women identified as part of the national-religious community enlisting in the IDF rose from 25% to 31%. This upward trend began even earlier, despite aggressive campaigns by conservative rabbis against women serving – especially in combat roles.
Though there is some overlap in belief and practice, the national-religious community is distinct from the ultra-Orthodox community in several key ways. While both are God-fearing, those who count themselves as national religious are usually more willing to engage with secular society, including in education, employment, and culture. As a whole, the community is ardently Zionist and supports the military.
The ultra-Orthodox, by contrast, generally seek to separate themselves from the rest of society to protect their religious mores, including strict adherence to gender roles. Many parts of the community reject Zionism, prize the study of Jewish texts over gainful employment, and refuse military service, including when that means, for men, ignoring the requirement to serve.
According to official data, only 0.3% of women who graduated from the Haredi educational system serve. Among men, the number is only slightly higher.
Woman warriors
The Bnei Brak skirmish followed a wave of media attacks against female combat service in recent weeks. For the detractors, the problem is not merely the draft itself, but the fact that more and more young women are staffing combat units.
The question of combat service has been at the heart of public discourse since the landmark 1995 High Court ruling in the case of Alice Miller, which stated that the IDF must allow women equal rights in applying for pilot training in the Israeli Air Force.
Miller, an aerospace engineer with a civilian pilot’s license, did not pass the screening for the pilot’s course following her legal victory, but she opened the door for dozens of women who have since marched into prestigious pilot and naval officer courses. Simultaneously, women began integrating into combat roles in the Border Police and the Ground Forces.
Data provided by the IDF to The Times of Israel shows that in 2015, 7.2% of combat soldiers were female. By 2025, that had skyrocketed to 21.2%.
It was not until October 7, 2023, however, that most Israelis were exposed to instances of female soldiers engaging in combat, as troops from the Border Defense Corps, Artillery Corps, Border Police, and the Home Front Command’s Search and Rescue battalions fought off invading Hamas-led terrorists across southern Israel. Many paid the ultimate price for their heroism.
A total of 32 female soldiers, not all of them on duty, were killed during the October 7 onslaught. They include 16 female surveillance soldiers killed at the IDF’s Nahal Oz base.
For five hours during the onslaught, from 8 a.m. to 1 p.m., the female commander of the Caracal mixed-gender light infantry battalion, Lt. Col. Or Ben Yehuda, was the most senior officer on the ground.
Ben Yehuda, 37, rushed with the fighters under her command early on October 7 to the Sufa military post and helped hold the line against hundreds of terrorists, while repelling infiltrations into the outpost and nearby kibbutz of the same name. Only in the afternoon did commando units link up with her, and together they rescued about 30 Nahal Brigade soldiers who were besieged in the Sufa outpost’s mess.
Elsewhere along the border, Caracal’s all-female tank crew won plaudits as what may have been the first such unit worldwide to engage in active combat.
Many more stories are less well-known:
At the Zikim base, female officers and staff commanders were among those who partook in the fight, saving 90 recruits. Three were killed.
At the Urim base, female soldiers and officers from the Home Front Command and the Combat Intelligence Collection array also engaged terrorists. Six were killed while attempting to fight them off, including the operations room officer.
A female officer, the commander of an Iron Dome battery, helped shoot down hundreds of rockets that morning and was killed alongside two of her soldiers while trying to retrieve more interceptors.
An officer in an elite Artillery Corps drone unit protected unarmed female soldiers in a bomb shelter at the Nahal Oz base, shooting at a terrorist and saving those inside.
And though they have gotten little attention, hundreds of women from various units also filled combat roles inside of Gaza during the ensuing war.
In the tank
Despite this reality, conservative opinion leaders view Ben Yehuda specifically as a symbol of everything they believe is “incorrect” in the modern IDF.
Recently, a number of features against Ben Yehuda were published in media outlets identified with the right-wing, including Channel 14 — a network staunchly aligned with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu — and “Olam Katan,” a religious pamphlet distributed at synagogues on Shabbat. Both are owned by Yitzhak Mirilashvili.
Channel 14 aired a 40-minute “special investigation,” in which Naama Zarviv, chairwoman of Shovrot Shivyon, a female-driven organization that advocates against gender equality, claimed that Ben Yehuda was promoted solely because she is a woman. Zarviv claimed that male company commanders who served under her reported to the organization that the officer “does not meet the operational standard.”
The claim is baseless. When Ben Yehuda was leading the Caracal battalion, only female company commanders served under her, not men. As for her supposed lack of qualification, Ben Yehuda was decorated with a citation from the chief of the Southern Command back in 2014 for her performance under fire on the Egyptian border.
Another figure starring in these publications is Aviad Gadot, a Haredi Zionist rabbi who leads far-right religious nationalist organizations that are working to remove women from combat service and from the IDF entirely. Gadot claims that joint service in tanks pushes religious men away from military service.
Reality tells a different story. The IDF does not operate mixed-gender tanks. Moreover, there is only one all-female tank company in the Border Defense Corps’ Caracal Battalion; it is not in the Armored Corps.
On October 7, 2023, Col. Shemer Raviv, the regional brigade commander and originally a paratrooper, joined the tank commanded by company commander Karni Gez, and was assisted by the female fighters inside. In an interview this reporter conducted with Raviv for a book on women in warfare, he recounted that the female soldiers saved his life while he tried to fight a large group of terrorists south of Route 232.
The false attacks forced IDF Spokesperson Brig. Gen. Effie Defrin to publish an unusual tweet featuring a photo of himself and his daughter, a recently released combat soldier, in which he rebuffed the claims against Ben Yehuda.
הבת שלי, אלה, שירתה כלוחמת בחיל הים. עוד לפני גיוסה לא הייתה לה התלבטות, היא ביקשה שירות קרבי ומשמעותי, ואני ליוויתי את הבחירה הזו בגאווה גדולה. גאווה על הדרך, על המאמץ, על הרצון לתרום למדינה ועל העשייה המבצעית לאורך השירות כולו.

— דובר צה״ל אפי דפרין – Effie Defrin (@IDFSpokesperson) February 2, 2026
The battle over the Armored Corps comes on the heels of a claim, also in Olam Katan, that female fighters have “taken over” the Artillery Corps, where they constitute about 20% of the force, and have “ruined” it for religious men.
But unlike tanks, activity in the Artillery Corps is mostly conducted in open spaces rather than closed confines; therefore, the integration of female fighters in that force is more extensive and poses fewer religious issues.
Those waging war against female troops are not stopping, though. Recently, an AI-generated video was distributed purporting to show that female paramedics serving alongside male soldiers in APCs in Gaza harms “family sanctity” for religious men in fatigues.
These campaigns resurface every few years, but have yet to make much headway: The rate of young women – both secular and religious – seeking combat roles remains on the rise, and they are proving their necessity on the battlefield each and every day.
If so, we have a request.
Every day during the past two years of war and rising global anti-Zionism and antisemitism, our journalists kept you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention. Millions of people rely on ToI for fact-based coverage of Israel and the Jewish world.

Teacher banned after lying about graduating from Cambridge and claiming to be five years younger than he was
Nicolas Martin claimed he was trying to pass himself off as ‘more dynamic and more fun’

A teacher has been banned from the profession indefinitely after he lied about going to the University of Cambridge and told his school he was five years younger than he was.
Nicolas Martin, who was the head of sixth form at St Edwards School in Cheltenham, admitted to lying on his job applications and fabricating documents.
Following an investigation by the school, he was also found to have lied about being a magistrate.
Mr Martin told a disciplinary hearing that he was trying to pass himself off as “more younger, more dynamic and more fun”.
The 43 year old qualified as a teacher in 2006 and started working at St Edmund's in September of that year. In 2024, he successfully applied to be the head of sixth form, and later in 2025, he applied for the deputy head position.
Discrepancies between the applications led to him being investigated and later referred to the teaching regulation agency.
A professional conduct panel heard that Mr Martin said his date of birth was 1987 in his application in 2025, despite previously saying it was 1982.
When asked about the discrepancy, he initially said that someone must have confused his handwriting, but in follow-up emails, he stated that the earlier 1982 date was incorrect and he had been seeking to correct it for several years.
The 1982 birth date was shown on employment records, including his passport and driver's licence, but Mr Martin said that the issue related to an error on an old passport.
The school then made further checks with the Department for Education, which only found records under the 1982 date.
Mr Martin then provided updated passport and driving licence documents, which showed the 1982 birth date.
As part of an investigation, the school also reviewed the job application he made in 2024, in which he said his date of birth was November 2012, which would have made him 12 years old.
He also claimed to have a master's degree in history from the University of Cambridge in his 2025 application, but told the school he had a master's degree in history from Lancaster University in his 2024 application.
When asked to see the Cambridge degree, Mr Martin provided what he said was a copy of the certificate, and claimed the original was at his home, as he “liked to show it off to friends on weekends”.
The University of Cambridge later confirmed the details on the certificate were not true.
Mr Martin had used the post-nominals “MA (Cantab)” and “JP” in his signature, and stated he sat as a magistrate around once a month in both applications.
HM Courts and Tribunals Service confirmed there was no record of him sitting as a magistrate in recent years.
During a disciplinary hearing in March, Mr Martin admitted to acting dishonestly, and accepted he had provided a false date of birth, had fabricated a certificate and had not sat as a magistrate for several years.
The panel report said: “Teachers must have proper and professional regard for the ethos, policies and practices of the school in which they teach, and maintain high standards in their own attendance and punctuality.
“The panel finds that the conduct of Mr Martin fell significantly short of the standards expected of the profession.”
He has been banned indefinitely from the classroom, and must wait two years before he can apply to have his prohibition order set aside.

Guthrie family members not suspects in Arizona kidnapping, sheriff says
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
TUCSON, Arizona, Feb 16 - Nancy Guthrie's family members have been cleared as possible suspects in her abduction, Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos said on Monday, as the case involving the mother of "Today" show co-anchor Savannah Guthrie entered its third week.
Guthrie's family, which includes "all siblings and spouses," has been cooperative and gracious as authorities investigate the kidnapping, Nanos said.
"To suggest otherwise is not only wrong, it is cruel," he said in a statement. "The Guthrie family are victims, plain and simple."
Investigators on Sunday said they had obtained a DNA sample from a glove that was found near 84-year-old Nancy Guthrie's Arizona home and appears to match the pair worn by a masked prowler seen in doorbell camera footage before she was abducted two weeks ago.
Nancy Guthrie was last seen on January 31 when she was dropped off at her home near Tucson by her family after she had dined with them, and was reported missing by relatives the following day, authorities have said.
Nanos has said the elder Guthrie was extremely limited in her physical mobility and could not have left her home unassisted, leading investigators to conclude early on that she had been taken against her will.
NO PROOF OF LIFE HAS SURFACED
At least two purported ransom notes have surfaced since she vanished, both of them delivered initially to news media outlets. There has been no known direct contact between any suspects and Guthrie's family or authorities.
Traces of blood found on her front porch were confirmed by DNA tests to have come from Guthrie, officials said last week. Law enforcement and family members have described her as being in frail health and in need of daily medication to survive. She also has a pacemaker.
Savannah Guthrie, 54, co-anchor of the popular NBC News morning show "Today," has posted several video messages, along with her brother Camron Guthrie and sister Annie Guthrie, pleading for their mother's return and appealing for the public's help in solving the case.
Nanos has told Reuters that no proof of life has surfaced since the abduction, but added that "there's not been any proof of death either," saying his working presumption is that Nancy Guthrie remains alive.
In an interview with the New York Post on Sunday, U.S. President Donald Trump demanded that Guthrie's kidnappers immediately release her unharmed, suggesting he would want the U.S. Justice Department to seek the death penalty if Guthrie is found dead.
Authorities would first need to find and convict a suspect before considering sentencing. REUTERS

MOSCOW, February 17. /TASS/. The situation near the city of Gulyaipole in the Zaporozhye Region is difficult for Kiev’s forces, Alexander Syrsky, the Ukrainian army's commander in chief, said.
"The operational situation in the area remains difficult," he wrote on Telegram after visiting several command posts in the Alexandrovka and Gulyaipole areas.
Russia’s Defense Ministry reported on February 15 that Lancet loitering munition units of Battlegroup East had thwarted the rotation of Ukrainian troops near the city of Gulyaipole. In addition, drone operators had identified Ukrainian drone control points hidden in forests in the Zaporozhye Region, providing their coordinates to howitzer crews. Artillery forces hit the drone control points and enemy troops.

On February 12, Bangladesh held its first official general election since the fall of the Sheikh Hasina government. Compared with previous elections marred by violence and turmoil, this one was relatively calm. Although there were scattered allegations of irregularities, international observers generally praised it as one of the most transparent elections in Bangladesh’s history.
With voter turnout at nearly 60 per cent, the Bangladeshi people showed strong enthusiasm for change through democratic means. The results confirmed a sweeping victory for the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), whose alliance secured a large parliamentary majority. Jamaat-e-Islami leader Shafiqur Rahman accepted the outcome. BNP leader Tarique Rahman is expected to become prime minister.
The BNP’s win reflects the underlying realities of Bangladesh’s socioeconomic structure. The election also ratified major constitutional reforms via a simultaneous referendum, marking a new phase in the country’s democratic transition.

After the formation of the interim government in August 2024, expectations for reform were high, especially among the youth. However, the government only made limited adjustments in the following year without addressing deeper issues. With Bangladesh set to graduate from “least developed country” status this year, the public had hoped for a brighter future.
Yet under interim rule, the country saw political instability, economic decline, and rising youth unemployment and business costs, all of which hindered growth and preparations for the 2026 transition. Some began to view the interim government as lacking legitimacy and the authority to tackle national problems, with only an elected government able to restore stability and confidence.

With Hasina’s Awami League banned from participating, this election contest centred on the BNP and Jamaat-e-Islami. The National Civic Party (NCP), formed by student activists involved in the 2024 anti-Hasina protests, lost popular support amid student leaders’ weak organisation.

New online casinos UK: Updated list for February 2026
- Bookmark
New online casinos entering the UK market face a lot of stiff competition from the brands who have dominated the space for decades.
Yet new casino sites such as Pub Casino, 7Bet and Kachingo are well capable of holding their own when compared with the best casino sites.
Top new casino sites UK
In this article, we rank the best new UK casino sites based on traits that are most sought-after by casino players – slot games, roulette, blackjack, welcome offers and mobile gaming.
Find the best new UK casino for you
Our rankings may chop and change as new online casinos emerge, or if existing new casinos up their game with better welcome offers, promotions, free-to-play games and other key selling points.
Best new UK casino for slots: O’Reels Casino
Launched in UK: 2025
Welcome Offer: Deposit £20, Get 20 Free Spins on Big Bass Splash
Key Features: Several banking options and a large games library, including Megaways and Drops and Wins.
Review
The luck of the Irish is a tried and tested slot game theme, but O’Reels Casino has taken that to a whole new level with an entirely Irish-themed casino.
Launched in the UK last year, they specialise in slots, with over 40 Irish-themed slots alone.
Yet there’s hundreds of alternative slots too, including video slots, Drops and Wins, Megaways and slingo.
The ‘New Games’ section is regularly updated, while customers can get a sense of what other gamers are playing via the ‘Popular’ and ‘Hot Slots’ sections.
Granted, the O’Reels welcome offer isn’t the strongest on the market – see below for the best casino sign up bonus this month – but it’s still worth taking up, and slots fans will find better ongoing offers for existing customers in the promotions section.
Pros
✓ Wide variety of games from all the top providers
✓ Many payment options including Pay By Mobile, PayPal, Google Pay, Trustly
✓ Strong customer support, including 24/7 live chat and email
Cons
✗ Low value welcome offer
✗ Withdrawals of less than £30 are subject to a £1.50 processing fee
Our Verdict:
Slots fans should look beyond the fairly limited welcome offer and focus on the extensive games library, plus the ongoing promos.
Best new UK casino for roulette: 7Bet Casino
Launched in UK: 2024
Welcome Offer: Deposit and Wager £20 and Get 100 Free Spins
Key Features: Integrated casino and sportsbook gaming, with standout live casino options.
Review
We’ve been busy testing out roulette offerings from the newest casinos in the UK and 7Bet stands out thanks to the wide variety of options.
There are now 38 different roulette games in 7Bet’s live dealer casino section alone.
If you navigate to the table games section, you’ll find further variations of roulette, including American First Person Roulette and European Roulette.
In each case, the gameplay was pretty immersive, especially on the mobile version of the site.
All-in-all, I counted 62 different roulette options, with the sports-themed versions our personal favourites – Football Auto Roulette, Horse Racing Auto Roulette and Sport Auto Roulette.
Pros
✓ Secure site with encrypted data for deposits/withdrawals
✓ Games by top providers including Evolution, NetEnt, Pragmatic Play, Big Time Gaming
✓ No fees charged for deposits or withdrawals
Cons
✗ Welcome bonus limited to selected games
✗ Lack of ongoing casino promos
✗ Heavy sports theme may not appeal to everyone
Our Verdict:
A great new option for roulette players, particularly those who are also interested in sports betting.
Best new online casino UK for blackjack: QuinnCasino
Launched in UK: 2025
Welcome Offer: Wager £10, Get 50 Free Spins
Key Features: Dedicated blackjack section with multiple variants and live dealer options from top providers.
Review
QuinnCasino has carved out a niche as the go-to destination for blackjack enthusiasts since launching in the UK market last year.
What sets them apart is their dedicated focus on providing the most comprehensive blackjack experience available at any new UK casino.
The live blackjack section features 15 different tables, including Speed Blackjack, Infinite Blackjack and VIP variants with higher betting limits.
We were particularly impressed by the Free Bet Blackjack and Lightning Blackjack options, which add exciting twists to the traditional game.
Beyond live dealer games, QuinnCasino offers 22 RNG blackjack variants, including Classic Blackjack, Atlantic City Blackjack and European Blackjack.
The side bet options are extensive, with Perfect Pairs and 21+3 available across most tables. Stakes range from 50p to £10,000, catering to all bankroll sizes.
Pros
✓ Largest selection of blackjack variants among new UK casinos
✓ Professional live dealers with multiple camera angles
✓ Comprehensive betting limits from casual to high roller
Cons
✗ Welcome bonus relatively modest compared to bigger brands

Our Verdict
Casino players will struggle to find a better brand new casino for blackjack, making QuinnCasino the clear choice for 21 enthusiasts.
Best new UK casino sign up offer: Kachingo
Launched in UK: 2025
Welcome Offer: 100% up to £188 + 88 Spins
Key Features: Market-leading welcome package with excellent ongoing promotions and cashback offers.
Review
Kachingo has launched with arguably the strongest new player incentive in the UK market right now.
Their welcome package combines substantial bonus money with an impressive free spins allocation that challenges any established competitor.
The 100 per cent match bonus up to £188 doubles your initial deposit, while the 88 free spins are available on the slot game Fire Joker.
With reasonable wagering requirements and a seven-day timeframe to clear, the terms are more player-friendly than most.
What really impressed us was the ongoing promotional calendar. Weekly reload bonuses, cashback offers up to 20 per cent, and their 'Lucky Friday' free spins promo ensures prolonged value beyond the welcome offer.
Pros
✓ Highest value welcome package among new UK casinos
✓ Fair wagering requirements with reasonable time limits
✓ Extensive ongoing promotions and loyalty rewards
Cons
✗ Game selection smaller than some established competitors
✗ Customer support limited to email and live chat only
✗ Some payment methods excluded from bonus eligibility
Our Verdict
For pure welcome bonus value, Kachingo currently leads the new casino market by a decent margin.
Best new casino app: Virgin Bet
Launched in UK: 2024
Welcome Offer: Play £10, Get 100 Free Spins - No Wagering
Key Features: Native mobile apps for iOS and Android, plus seamless mobile browser experience and exclusive mobile promotions.
Review
The Virgin Bet app stands out as a polished and reliable UK casino app with plenty to like, and this is backed up by the overwhelmingly positive reviews in the Apple App Store and Google Play Store.
Players consistently praise the clean design, fast load times and smooth navigation, making it easy to switch between slots, betting and promotions.
Virgin is a fast withdrawal casino and free games are regularly available, while the simplicity of the app is something we appreciated.
That said, you may find occasional technical glitches, particularly in live casino games and certain slots.
Pros
✓ Fastest loading times and smoothest gameplay among new casino apps
✓ Exclusive mobile promotions and tournaments
✓ Intuitive app design with simple navigation
Cons
✗ Welcome offer requires wagering rather than traditional deposit match
✗ Desktop site feels less polished compared to mobile experience
✗ Limited live dealer games available through the app
Our Verdict
Overall, Virgin Bet delivers a new, enjoyable mobile casino experience that comfortably ranks among the top UK casino apps.
How we rate new casino sites UK
Licensing
We will only recommend new online casinos that carry a licence to trade which has been awarded by the UK Gambling Commission (UKGC).
The UKGC exists to enforce the rules set by independent review bodies such as eCOGRA, so any new UK casinos that are not regulated by the UKGC are considered unsafe and should be avoided.
Security
Our recommended new casinos will all use up-to-date security features to protect customer details and data. Examples of such features include SSL encryption and two-factor authentication.
Reputation
We judge casinos by reputation and our impressions after using them. We consider established brands that are new to the UK market, such as Bally Casino and BetMGM, and brand new casinos that have caught our eye.
Game variety
The best new casino sites will provide plenty of variety for their users, whether that be slot games and roulette options or table games such as online poker. These games must be provided by a range of quality operators, such as NetEnt and Playtech.
Customer experience
What is the customer getting out of the casino? Are there enough games, such as slots, table games and live casino? Does it have a reputation as a high payout casino? There should be a variety of options and themes to satisfy all users.
Usability
How easy is the new casino and app to use? We only recommend sites that offer sound usability and functionality across the board, whether you’re using the desktop site, Apple or Android app, or a mobile browser.
Payment methods
Along with standard debit card, users should have access to a variety of payment options to reflect modern transactions. We want to ensure that newer methods are available, such as e-wallets, pay by mobile casinos and Apple Pay.
Welcome bonus
New customers should be rewarded with a quality casino sign up bonus. If we’re not satisfied with the casino bonuses on offer we won’t recommend the new casino.
Promotions
Promotions should not end after the welcome bonus. Users should have options such as free spins, free play games, free bets and prize draws, among others.
Payout rates
When recommending new casino sites, we check that their games have a reasonable volatility and RTP, and chances for users to win fairly.
Why choose a new UK casino?
At first glance, it can seem safer to stick with established names like Grosvenor, MrQ or 888.
However, many new UK casinos now offer clear advantages over long-standing operators.
New casino sites are often quicker to adopt emerging trends, whether that’s hybrid games like slingo, innovative bonus mechanics or modern slot formats.
They also tend to run on newer technology, delivering faster-loading websites, smoother mobile experiences, improved security and more efficient customer support, including AI-assisted help tools.
Crucially, newer casinos are competing hard for players. That competition usually translates into better-value welcome offers, with simpler terms and fewer restrictions than those found at older brands.
In many cases, new operators provide no deposit free spins or no wagering bonuses, allowing players to access winnings more quickly.
If you’re looking for stronger incentives, modern features and a fresher playing experience, new UK casinos are well worth considering.
Please gamble responsibly on new casinos
Remember that gambling is only a form of entertainment, not a way to make money.
Gambling sites can be addictive, so never wager more than you can afford to lose and take steps to remain in control of your budget.
If necessary, you can make use of responsible gambling tools offered by the best casino sites, such as deposit limits, loss limits, self-exclusion and time-outs.
The same applies whether you’re playing online slots, betting sites, bingo sites or any other form of gambling.
Should you wish to seek help for gambling-related issues, there are several charities, organisations and healthcare providers who offer support and information:

3 killed, including suspect, in shooting during Rhode Island youth hockey game
PAWTUCKET, R.I. (AP) — Three people, including the suspect, were fatally shot during a Rhode Island youth hockey game Monday, authorities said.
Pawtucket Police Chief Tina Goncalves told reporters that three other victims are hospitalized in critical condition.
“It appears that this was a targeted event, that it may be a family dispute,” she said. Goncalves did not provide details about the suspect or the ages of those who were killed, though she said it appeared that both victims were adults.
Authorities were continuing to try to piece together what happened and speak with witnesses, she said.
The shooting happened at Dennis M. Lynch Arena in Pawtucket, a few miles outside Providence.
Outside the arena, tearful families and high school hockey players still in uniform could be seen hugging before they boarded a bus to leave the area. Roads surrounding the arena were shut down as a heavy police presence remained and helicopters flew overhead.
Pawtucket is nestled just north of Providence and right under the Massachusetts state border. A town of just under 80,000, Pawtucket had up until recently been known as the home to Hasbro’s headquarters.

Billionaire Trump donor and tariff advocate is moving his Ohio manufacturing plant to China: report
John Paulson, who is worth an estimated $4 billion, previously spoke out against offshoring American manufacturing jobs
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
Cue the sad trombone: Hedge fund billionaire John Paulson — a major Trump donor and advocate of tariffs — is shuttering his Ohio brass instrument plant and offshoring work to China, according to a new report.
Paulson’s company Conn Selmer, the nation's top maker of orchestral and brass instruments, notified employees it will shift most of its East Lake plant operations to Asia by July, triggering about 150 layoffs, The Guardian reported.
Employees were informed of the decision last month, when they expected to negotiate a new union contract, according to United Auto Workers Local 2359, which represents the workers.
The employees said the company unveiled a new plant in China in 2025, and that work has slowly shifted to that location. However, workers in Ohio had previously been told their jobs were not in jeopardy.
Workers there expressed deep dissatisfaction with the decision, with one saying, “It really pisses me off,” while another said they felt “betrayed.”
A representative for Conn Selmer confirmed that, should a “tentative decision” be finalized, the firm will move some production out of the country, according to the outlet.
A company spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Independent.
Paulson — who is worth an estimated $4 billion, according to Forbes — has been a major backer of the Republican president for years.
During Trump’s first presidential campaign, Paulson served as an economic advisor, and he raised $50 million for the president at a 2024 fundraiser in Florida. He was also shortlisted to serve as treasury secretary, a position that was ultimately given to another hedge fund investor: Scott Bessent.
Paulson has also expressed support for Trump’s tariff agenda. Shortly before the 2024 election, he told Semafor that a 10 to 20 percent tariff to boost American manufacturing would be reasonable.
“It would result in higher import prices,” he said. “But on the other hand, it supports domestic manufacturing, so you get more jobs, more investment in the US, more taxes.”
Two months earlier, Paulson told CNBC that Trump’s tariff plans were “well-founded.”
He’s also publicly opposed moving jobs overseas. “We can’t have American producers closing American factories and offshoring,” he told the outlet. “We need to protect American jobs and protect American manufacturing,”
Robert Hines, president of UAW Local 2359 and a worker at the Conn-Selmer plant in Ohio, said Paulson’s latest decision smacks of hypocrisy.
“To go publicly on CNBC to support the Trump administration’s positive views on tariffs and all that stuff, and then you turn around and [say you] want to go send the work right over to China,” Hines told The Guardian. “It’s a slap in our face.”
Overall, U.S. manufacturing jobs have declined since last spring, when he first implemented his aggressive and wide-ranging tariffs — which he promised would lead to a renaissance of blue-collar jobs, according to Reuters.
The industry shed 8,000 jobs in December, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported. And since April employment in the sector has fallen by more than 70,000 to about 12.69 million as of December, marking the worst reading since March 2022.

Gloria Steinem pays tribute to Gisele Pelicot
Pioneering feminist Gloria Steinem has paid tribute to Gisele Pelicot, the woman at the centre of France's largest rape trial.
During a moving Newsnight interview broadcast on Sunday (15 February), Ms Steinem made a video appearance where she explained how “grateful” she was to survivor Ms Pelicot.
In December 2024, her husband Dominique Pelicot was found guilty and imprisoned for drugging and raping her and allowing other men to assault her while she was incapacitated.
Ms Pelicot bravely waived her right to anonymity, with the trial therefore held in public.
Social-political activist Steinem praised: “You have become a symbol of strength, of endurance, of kindness, of honesty, and we will be forever grateful to you”.

UK confirms parachute force to be cut to one battalion
United Kingdom

06:11:32 KST

The Ministry of Defence has confirmed that the UK’s airborne parachute capability will be retained but narrowed in scope, with future capacity focused on specialist forces and a single battalion group.
In a written parliamentary answer published on 16 February 2026, minister Al Carns said the Strategic Defence Review (SDR) “considered all aspects of Defence, including military parachuting capabilities” and concluded that “airborne parachute capability and capacity should remain focused on specialists and a single battalion group.”
The response was issued after Conservative MP Ben Obese-Jecty asked what assessment had been made of the potential negative impact of removing parachute infantry deployment as a capability. Carns said the government had accepted the SDR’s recommendations in full and that implementation details would be outlined in the forthcoming Defence Investment Plan.
“The Government accepted the recommendations of the SDR in full and will publish the Defence Investment Plan as soon as possible to set out the plan for its implementation,” he said.
The statement comes amid reports that the Army is restructuring its airborne forces, with indications that 2nd and 3rd Battalions of The Parachute Regiment may lose their routine parachute jumping qualification. Under the emerging model, parachute insertion would remain a specialist capability, rather than a mass infantry deployment method held across multiple battalions. While supporters of the change argue this reflects modern operational realities and could generate cost savings, critics have warned it risks eroding a key rapid-entry capability and could represent a long-term decline in conventional airborne forces.

UN chief urges dialogue amid worsening fuel shortage in Cuba
Guterres 'very concerned about situation in Cuba, which is worsening as oil needs continue to be unmet,' says spokesperson
HAMILTON, Canada
UN chief Antonio Guterres continues to follow the situation in Cuba as the island nation grapples with a worsening fuel shortage, his spokesperson said on Monday.
"The Secretary-General has been following the situation in Cuba extremely closely, and I can tell you that he's very concerned about the situation in Cuba, which is worsening as oil needs continue to be unmet," Stephane Dujarric said during a news conference.
Recalling the UN General Assembly's repeated calls for an end "to the embargo imposed by the United States on Cuba," Dujarric said that Guterres "would like to see all parties pursue dialogue and respect for international law yet again."
"But our teams on the ground are working with the Government to help support the humanitarian relief for the people of Cuba," he added.
Cuba’s fuel crisis has worsened after the US cut off oil supplies from longtime ally Venezuela, which had been shipping tens of thousands of barrels daily to the island.
The disruption followed a US operation that captured former Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and the seizure of oil tankers, effectively halting key fuel deliveries.

Austria wins gold in 1st Olympic men's super team ski jump as event is shortened due to weather

Austria wins gold in 1st Olympic men's super team ski jump as event is shortened due to weather
Austria has won the first Olympic men’s super team ski jumping event
- Bookmark
Austria won the Olympic debut of the men's super team ski jump on Monday, capturing its first medal in the sport in the Milan Cortina Games as heavy snow and wind canceled the final round of the event.
Poland took silver and Norway got bronze.
The new format replaced the former four-man team contest on the large hill with teams of two. Seventeen nations jumped in the first round and the top 12 made the second round. The best eight moved on to the final.
But as a snow squall held up competition with only a few skiers left to make their final jump, the round was canceled and the second round standings determined the winners.
The result was redemption for the Austrian team that had won the men’s team event in Beijing in 2022, but had not reached the podium in this Olympics.
Jan Hoerl, who was part of the 2022 winning team, was paired with Stephan Embacher, who was in his first Olympics, for the victory.
Austria led Slovenia, Poland, Germany and Japan after the first round.
Poland moved into second and Norway moved into third in the second round as Slovenia slid into fifth place.
Poland's Kacper Tomasiak, a rookie in his first year on the World Cup circuit, has been the surprise of Olympic ski jumping, winning a silver on the normal hill and a bronze on the large hill. He was paired with Pawel Wasek, whose best Olympic finish was sixth in a team event in 2022.
The Norwegian team was made up of Johann André Forfang, who had won gold on the large hill and silver on the normal hill in Pyeongchang in 2018 but had not had a good Olympics before Monday, and Kristoffer Eriksen Sundal, who won silver in the mixed team event in these games.
Forfang was suspended last yea r in a jumpsuit-tampering scandal that brought shame to the country that invented the sport.
Forfang and teammate Marius Lindvik were suspended for three months last year after their coaches and a staff member were caught on camera tampering with their suits.
Stitching was added to the suits to stiffen the crotch area, allowing the athletes to fly farther.
Neither Lindvik nor Forfang was charged with knowing about the manipulation, but the international ski federation, FIS, the governing body for ski jumping, said the jumpers “should have checked and asked questions about the nighttime adjustments.”
The team leaders involved were recently banned from the sport for 18 months.
The U.S. team of Kevin Bickner and Tate Frantz made it to the final round but ended up in eighth place.

FIFA President Infantino celebrates in Beirut after receiving a Lebanese passport
FIFA President Gianni Infantino has received a Lebanese passport after Lebanon’s president granted him citizenship
- Bookmark
FIFA President Gianni Infantino received a Lebanese passport at the Interior Ministry in Beirut on Monday, months after he was granted citizenship by the country’s president.
Infantino, who is married to Lebanese citizen Lina al-Ashkar, thanked President Joseph Aoun at a meeting at the Interior Ministry where Infantino filed documents and had a photograph and fingerprints taken before being handed his new blue Lebanese passport.
Infantino also has citizenship in Italy and Switzerland.
“I’m very proud and very happy to be here in Beirut at the Ministry of Interior to finally get my Lebanese passport,” Infantino said in a video carried by local TV stations. “I love Lebanon."
Lebanese women normally cannot pass their citizenship to their foreign husbands and children under Lebanese law. But Aoun made and exception for Infantino and granted him and his family members citizenship.
Lebanese men married to foreign women automatically pass their nationality to their children, while their wives become eligible for citizenship after being married for a certain period of time.
FIFA is the international soccer governing body.

Former NRL star shot multiple times in Sydney drive-by shooting
Updated ,first published
Former NRL star Matt Utai has been shot in the chest and leg in a brazen drive-by shooting in Sydney’s south-west on Tuesday morning.
First responders were called to Macquarie Street, Greenacre about 6am after reports multiple gunshots were fired from occupants of an SUV, which sped away after Utai, 44, was shot.
Four ambulances were dispatched to Greenacre, where they discovered Utai conscious. He was treated for gunshot wounds.
He has been rushed to hospital in a serious condition.
Police were then called to nearby Samuel Street in Wiley Park, where they found a burnt-out SUV suspected to be used in the shooting. The car was seized for forensic examination after the fire was extinguished by Fire and Rescue NSW.
Crime scenes have been established at both locations. Bankstown detectives are treating the incidents as linked.
Former teammate Brent Sherwin, the halfback during Canterbury’s 2004 grand final win against the Roosters, said he was devastated by the news.
“My heart goes out to his partner and kids. We’re praying he comes through. I wish him all the best and hope he is OK. We’re praying he’s alright,” Sherwin said.
Sherwin said the Bulldogs’ 2004 premiership wouldn’t have been possible if not for the two tries Utai scored in the decider.
”He was a massive part of our team, not just scoring tries, but taking the hard carries on our own line,” Sherwin said.
“He never shirked away from any of it, he put his hand up and took it all. He had a big heart. We’re praying he will be OK.”
Premiership-winning prop Mark O’Meley said that Utai was “breathing OK” as he continues to receive treatment.
“Everyone has been on the group chat all morning, we just hope he’s OK,” he said.
“[Teammate] Reni Maitua has been chatting to the family and keeping us updated, which has been great.”
Utai, born in Auckland in 1981, burst onto the rugby league scene for the Bulldogs in 2002, earning the Dally M Rookie of the Year award after a first-season return that included 13 tries and 15 line-breaks.
Utai represented New Zealand on the international stage, earning a call-up following his debut first grade season. He played for the Kiwis on four occasions, before representing Samoa at the 2008 World Cup, at which he scored two tries in three matches.
He left the Bulldogs in 2009 after several years marred by injury. A move to Super League side Celtic Crusaders was aborted in 2010 amid concerns about an injury. He signed for the Wests Tigers in 2011, and stayed until the end of his playing career in 2013.
He scored 85 tries across 167 games for the Canterbury Bulldogs and Wests Tigers.

Eileen Gu wins silver in freestyle big air at Winter Olympics, Canada's Megan Oldham takes gold
Defending Olympic champion Eileen Gu took silver in freeski big air at the Milan Cortina Games as Canada's Megan Oldham won the gold medal on Monday night.
Oldham topped the 10-woman final with a combined score of 180.75 points from two jumps. Gu was next with 179. Italy's Flora Tabanelli took bronze, four months after she tore an ACL.
This is the second medal for the 24-year-old Oldham at these Winter Games. She won bronze in slopestyle last week.
In 2022, Gu became the first freestyle skier to win three medals in a single Games after taking gold in big air and halfpipe and silver in slopestyle at age 18.
Gu, who was born in the United States but competes for her mother's native China, has collected five medals in two Olympic appearances. She also won silver in slopestyle last week, and she has a chance at a sixth medal on Saturday, when she tries to defend her halfpipe gold.
Gu hadn't competed in a big air contest since triumphing at the Beijing Games, concentrating on her other events. But there are enough similarities between big air and slopestyle that she found her rhythm quickly.
Oldham locked up gold with her first two jumps. She had an inconsequential fall on her third jump, the last of the final, which became a victory lap.
Oldham and Gu embraced before they stepped onto the medal podium.
The initial final field of 12 was reduced by two after Mathilde Gremaud and Anouk Andraska, both of Switzerland, got hurt practicing jumps before the final. Gremaud, who defended her slopestyle gold last week, hurt her hip and needed to be stretchered off. Andraska hurt her wrist.
In big air, skiers get three jumps and must land two. Their scores include points for difficulty and execution.
Monday's final was delayed by more than an hour because of a snowstorm.

French President Macron arrives in India for bilateral talks, AI summit
Indian Prime Minister Modi to host Macron for talks in financial hub of Mumbai on Tuesday
NEW DELHI
French President Emmanuel Macron arrived in Mumbai, the financial hub of India, around midnight on Monday, beginning his three-day visit to the South Asian nation, according to an official statement.
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi will host Macron for talks on Tuesday as the two sides strengthen bilateral trade and defense ties, Modi's office said in a statement.
They “will focus on cementing India-France strategic partnership and further diversifying it into new and emerging areas,” it added.
Macron and Modi will also exchange views on issues of "regional and global importance,” the statement said, adding they will also inaugurate the "India-France Year of Innovation."
Marcon, who visited India last in 2024 as the chief guest for India's 75th Republic Day, will also visit New Delhi this week to participate in the AI Impact summit hosted by India.
India and France established diplomatic relations soon after India’s independence in 1947, and their bilateral trade volume reached $15 billion in 2024.
The two nations have strengthened their ties, particularly in defense, as the Indian Defense Ministry last week approved the fresh acquisition of Rafale jets from France.
India first inducted the French defense industry company Dassault's twin-engine, multirole fighter aircraft into its Air Force in 2020.
The defense chiefs of India and France will also hold their annual dialogue in the southern city of Bengaluru, where they are expected to renew a 10-year defense pact which includes joint manufacturing of Hammer missiles.

At least two killed and several others injured in mass shooting at Rhode Island ice rink
The suspected shooter also died during the incident at Dennis M Lynch Arena in Pawtucket, police say
- Bookmark
A mass shooting at an indoor ice rink in Rhode Island has left at least two dead and multiple others injured, according to authorities.
Chaos erupted at the Dennis M Lynch Arena in Pawtucket, near Providence, on Monday afternoon, as gunfire rang out during a high school hockey game.
Aside from the victims who had died, three more were injured, police said. The suspected shooter has also died, according to authorities. It wasn’t immediately clear what led to the shooting or the condition of those injured.
The Pawtucket mayor’s office said a young girl was killed in the shooting in a statement shared by local outlet WJAR. Local officials said authorities are not searching for any other suspects in the shooting.
“It seems that this is a targeted event and it may have been a family dispute,” Pawtucket Police Chief Tina Goncalves told reporters Monday.
The Providence Police Department announced on X that it was “monitoring the situation” and had officers at the rink “providing assistance.”
State police officers were seen outside the ice rink behind crime scene tape.
There were also FBI agents at the scene, according to the agency’s field office in Boston.
“At this time, there is no imminent threat to public safety and there has been no request for FBI assistance. However, the public should continue to avoid the area,” FBI Boston wrote on x.
The shooting happened during a hockey game between two local co-op teams: Coventry-Johnston and St. Raphael-Providence Country Day-North Providence-North Smithfield.
Goncalves asked for the public’s help in the investigation by giving information to the Pawtucket Police Department.
“Any recordings that they may have, because obviously people were recording, their kids were on the ice...provide those to the police department,” the chief said.
A Walgreens employee told WPRI that panicked patrons came into the nearby pharmacy saying there was a shooting. The police were called.
Goncalves asked for the public’s help in the investigation: “Any recordings that they may have, because obviously people were recording, their kids were on the ice.”
Coventry and Johnston school districts said that all of their students are believed to be safe.
"We have been informed that students are secured in multiple locations. At this time, we are still working to confirm the status and location of all individuals,” Coventry's superintendent, Don Cowart, said in a message shared by WJAR.
Johnston Public Schools said, per WJAR, “We have confirmed that our Johnston High School student-athlete who was participating in the game is safe. We are also aware of another Johnston student who was in attendance, and that student is safe as well.
“At this time, to the best of our knowledge, no Johnston High School students were harmed during this incident."
Providence Country Day School wrote on an Instagram story that it was “shocked and saddened” by the shooting, adding that all students, parents and staff who were at the game are safe.
Rhode Island Governor Dan McKee wrote on X that he was “actively monitoring the shooting,” adding, “I am praying for Pawtucket and everyone involved.”
The Providence Bruins, the American Hockey League affiliate of the National Hockey League’s Boston Bruins, said their “thoughts are with all those affected by the tragic events at the High School Hockey game at Dennis M Lynch Arena in Pawtucket today.”

Greece will seek to obtain Nazi execution photos offered for sale on eBay
The images that appeared over the weekend allegedly show 200 Greek men being led to their deaths on May 1, 1944, at an Athens shooting range
Greece said on Monday it will seek to obtain a series of photos that appear to show the final moments of 200 Greeks who were executed by a Nazi firing squad in Athens during World War II, after the previously unknown pictures appeared on an online sale site.
The images that appeared on eBay over the weekend allegedly show the men being led to their deaths on May 1, 1944, at a shooting range in the Kaisariani suburb of the Greek capital. Although the executions were well known, there were no known photos or film documentation of the event.
Greece’s Culture Ministry said on Monday that “it is very possible that these are authentic photographs”, adding that it will seek to obtain them as historical archives after they were put up for auction on eBay on Saturday by a collector in Belgium of German military memorabilia.
The series of pictures shows men being led through a gateway and down a path. They stand straight as they are lined up in front of a wall.
The Kaisariani executions of 200 communist political prisoners were one of the worst atrocities during the Third Reich’s occupation of Greece and remain a seminal moment for the country.
As World War II ended, a vicious civil war between Western-backed government forces and communist fighters broke out and lasted until 1949. Its wounds have still not entirely healed.

UN experts urge probe into Epstein files, warn crimes against humanity possible

UN human rights experts have called for independent and impartial investigations into the Epstein files, warning that the alleged abuses documented in the disclosures could amount to crimes against humanity.
In a statement on Monday, the experts said the files contain "disturbing and credible evidence of systematic and large-scale sexual abuse, trafficking and exploitation of women and girls."
They said the acts described could constitute sexual slavery, reproductive violence, torture, and other grave violations under international law.
"So grave is the scale, nature, systematic character, and transnational reach of these atrocities against women and girls, that a number of them may reasonably meet the legal threshold of crimes against humanity," they said.
Under international criminal law, crimes against humanity involve widespread or systematic attacks against civilians, including sexual slavery, rape, enforced prostitution, trafficking, and murder.
The disclosure process follows the Epstein Files Transparency Act signed in November 2025. On Jan. 30, the US Department of Justice released more than 3 million pages of material, along with thousands of videos and images.
The experts also raised concerns over what they described as serious redaction failures that exposed sensitive victim information, in some cases before records were withdrawn.
“Not above the law"
They stressed that states are obligated under international human rights law to prevent, investigate, and punish violence against women and girls.
"Any suggestion that it is time to move on from the ‘Epstein files’ is unacceptable," they said, adding: "No one is too wealthy or too powerful to be above the law."
The experts urged US authorities and other governments to ensure full accountability and reparations for victims.
"Failure by governments to effectively investigate, and prosecute those responsible for these crimes, including by complicity or acquiescence, where jurisdiction exists, risks undermining legal frameworks aimed at preventing and responding to violence against women and girls," they warned.
Convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein was found dead by suicide in a New York City jail in 2019 while awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges involving underage girls.

More third-country nationals have been deported by the US to Cameroon, lawyers tell AP
Lawyers say a new group of third-country nationals has been deported by the United States to Cameroon
- Bookmark
A new group of third-country nationals was deported by the United States to Cameroon on Monday, lawyers told The Associated Press, days after it came to light that the Trump administration sent nine people to the Central African nation last month as part of its secretive program to remove immigrants to countries they have no ties with.
Lawyer Alma David of the U.S.-based Novo Legal Group said that a group of migrants who were not Cameroonian citizens arrived on a deportation flight that landed in the capital, Yaounde, on Monday.
David and Cameroon-based lawyer Joseph Awah Fru said they believed there were eight third-country nationals on the plane but had not spoken to them yet. The two lawyers said they are giving legal advice to some of the nine migrants — five women and four men — from other African countries who were deported from the U.S. to Cameroon last month.
The lawyers also expected to offer counsel to the new group of deportees, they said.
“For now, my focus is handling their shock,” Fru said.
A White House official, who was not authorized to comment publicly about the matter and spoke on condition of anonymity, acknowledged the second deportation flight to Cameroon but gave no details.
The New York Times first reported Saturday on the group of nine sent secretly to Cameroon last month. Two of them have since been repatriated to their home countries, David said.
Most of the deportees had protection orders
Eight of those nine previously deported migrants had protection orders granted by a U.S. immigration judge that prevented them from being deported to their home countries for fear of persecution or torture, David said, some of them because of their sexual orientation and others because of political activity.
Deporting them to a third country like Cameroon, from where they could ultimately be sent home, was effectively a legal “loophole,” David said.
“That is why the United States did not send them directly to their countries,” Fru said. “Because there is cause for concern that they might be harmed, that their lives are threatened.”
David said none of the nine sent to Cameroon last month, which included migrants from Zimbabwe, Morocco and Ghana, had criminal records apart from driving-related offenses. She had no details yet on the eight who arrived on Monday.
African nations are being paid millions
Cameroon, where 93-year-old President Paul Biya has ruled since 1982, is the latest of at least seven African nations to receive deported third-country nationals in a deal with the U.S. Others that have struck deals with the Trump administration include South Sudan, Rwanda, Uganda, Eswatini, Ghana and Equatorial Guinea.
Some of them have received millions of dollars in payments to take deported migrants, according to documents released by the U.S. State Department. Details of some of the other agreements, including the one with Cameroon, have not been released by the Trump administration.
The Trump administration has spent at least $40 million to deport roughly 300 migrants to countries other than their own in Africa, Central America and elsewhere, according to a report compiled by the Democratic staff of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and released last week.
According to internal administration documents reviewed by the AP, there are 47 third-country agreements at various stages of negotiation. Of those, 15 have been concluded and 10 are at or near conclusion.
Immigration policies are a ‘top priority’
The U.S. State Department said Monday in a statement to the AP on the Cameroon deportations that it had “no comment on the details of our diplomatic communications with other governments.”
“Implementing the Trump Administration’s immigration policies is a top priority for the Department of State,” it said, adding “we remain unwavering in our commitment to end illegal and mass immigration and bolster America’s border security.”
Cameroon's Foreign Ministry didn't respond to a request for comment.
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security confirmed there had been deportations to Cameroon in January but didn't give specific information on third-country migrants. It did not comment on the second plane.
“We are applying the law as written. If a judge finds an illegal alien has no right to be in this country, we are going to remove them. Period," the department said. “These third-country agreements, which ensure due process under the U.S. Constitution, are essential to the safety of our homeland and the American people."
The Trump administration has used third-country deportation deals as a deterrent to force migrants who are in the U.S. illegally to leave on their own, saying they could end up “in any number of third countries" if deported.
It has also defended the practice as part of a crackdown to remove what it refers to as dangerous criminals and gang members.
Activists and lawyers say the U.S. should know that sending migrants to third countries with poor human rights records risks them being denied due process and exposed to abuse.
Last year, the U.S. deported five nationals from Vietnam, Jamaica, Cuba, Yemen and Laos to the southern African nation of Eswatini. The deportees had all been convicted of serious criminal offenses, including murder, attempted murder and rape. They had all served their criminal sentences in the U.S.
Four of them have been held at a maximum-security prison in Eswatini for more than six months without charges and have not been allowed to meet in person with a lawyer. Their detentions are the subject of two legal challenges in Eswatini.
Eswatini, which is ruled by a king as Africa's last absolute monarchy, will be paid $5.1 million to take up to 160 third-country deportees, according to details of the deal released by the State Department. The Eswatini king, Mswati III, has long been accused of clamping down on pro-democracy protests in a country where political parties are banned while using public money to fund his lavish lifestyle.

BUDAPEST, February 16. /TASS/. Western European leaders continue to live in a world of illusions, believing that Ukraine will emerge victorious from the conflict with Russia, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said.
He noted that Western European politicians are set to continue providing Ukraine with military support "until Russia is exhausted." "But who can believe that the Russians will run out of steam before Ukraine? That's something from the world of illusions," the M1 television channel quoted him as saying at a meeting with the parliamentary faction of the ruling Fidesz - Hungarian Civic Alliance party.
"Russia's reserves significantly exceed Ukraine's, even taking into account the support it receives from Europe," he stated. According to Orban, in 1944-1945, people also said that Russia would soon be destroyed, but since then Russia has become a nuclear power, while the Germans are only now beginning to arm themselves."
He slammed Western European politicians’ actions as irresponsible because they are seeking to protract the conflict in Ukraine and are hampering its peaceful settlement.

Russian Poisonings Aim to Kill — And Send a Message

Polonium, Novichok and now dart frog poison: the finding that Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny was killed with a rare toxin has revived the spectre of Moscow’s use of poisons against opponents -- a hallmark of its secret services, according to experts.
The neurotoxin epibatidine, found in Ecuadoran frogs, was identified in laboratory analyses of samples from Navalny’s body, the British, Swedish, French, German and Dutch governments said in a joint statement released on Saturday at the Munich Security Conference.

“Only the Russian state had the means, motive and opportunity to deploy this lethal toxin,” said Britain’s Foreign Office, with the joint statement pointing to Russia as the prime suspect.
The Kremlin on Monday rejected what it called the “biased and baseless” accusation it assassinated Navalny, a staunch critic of President Vladimir Putin who died on February 16, 2024, while serving a 19-year sentence in a Russian Arctic prison colony.
But the allegations echo other cases of opponents being poisoned in connection -- proven or suspected -- with Russian agents.
In 2006, the Russian defector Alexander Litvinenko was killed by polonium poison in London. Ukrainian politician Viktor Yushchenko, campaigning against a Russian-backed candidate for the presidency, was disfigured by dioxin in 2004. And the nerve agent Novichok was used in the attempted poisoning of former double agent Sergei Skripal in the UK in 2018.

“We should remain cautious, but this hypothesis is all the more plausible given that Navalny had already been the target of an assassination attempt (in 2020) on a plane involving underwear soaked with an organophosphate nerve agent, Novichok, which is manufactured only in Russia,” said Olivier Lepick, a fellow at the Foundation for Strategic Research specialising in chemical weapons.
Toxin ‘never been used’
“To my knowledge, epibatidine has never been used for assassinations,” Lepick added.
Until now, the substance was mainly known for its effect on animals that try to attack Ecuadoran poison dart frogs.
“It’s a powerful neurotoxin that first hyperstimulates the nervous system in an extremely violent way and then shuts it down. So you’ll convulse and then become paralysed, especially in terms of breathing,” said Jerome Langrand, director of the Paris poison control centre.
But to the scientist, using this substance to poison Navalny is “quite unsettling”.
“One wonders, why choose this particular poison? If it was to conceal a poisoning, it’s not the best substance. Or is it meant to spread an atmosphere of fear, to reinforce an image of power and danger with the message: ‘We can poison anywhere and with anything’?” he said.
Russian ‘calling card’
For many experts, the use of poison bears a Russian signature.
“It’s something specific to the Soviet services. In the 1920s, Lenin created a poison laboratory called ‘Kamera’ (‘chamber’ in Russian), Lab X. This laboratory grew significantly under Stalin, and then under his successors Khrushchev and Brezhnev... It was this laboratory that produced Novichok,” said Andrei Kozovoi, professor of Russian history at the University of Lille.
“The Russians don’t have a monopoly on it, but there is a dimension of systematisation, with considerable resources put in place a very long time ago -- the creation of the poison laboratory, which developed without any restrictions,” he added.
Even if a poisoning can fail -- some targets survived, such as Yushchenko and Skripal -- it also serves to send a message, and acted as “a calling card” left by the Russian services, according to Kozovoi.
“Poison is associated in the collective imagination and in psychology with a terrible, agonising death. The use of chemical substances or poisons carries an explicit intention to terrorise the target and, in cases such as Litvinenko, Skripal or Navalny, to warn anyone who might be tempted to betray Mother Russia or become an opponent,” said Lepick.
“A neurotoxin, a radioactive substance, or a toxic substance is much more frightening than an explosive or being shot to death.”

The Ethiopian National Defense Forces have likely received Russian KamAZ-53949 Typhoon-K armored vehicles.
This was reported by OSINT analyst Rich Tedd, who posted a video on social network X.
The footage, shot in Ethiopia, shows two trucks carrying two olive-colored Typhoon-K armored vehicles on trailers.
The history of the Typhoon line began in 2010 as part of a program to develop a new generation of armored vehicles for the Russian army.
The 53949 model was designed as a more compact and maneuverable version of the heavy three-axle vehicles in this series.
The vehicle has a V-shaped bottom that effectively dissipates the energy of an explosion, and special energy-absorbing seats. The vehicle’s armor consists of steel plates and ceramic inserts, providing protection against armor-piercing bullets and artillery shell fragments.
The armored vehicle can carry up to 10 people, including two crew members and eight paratroopers. The total weight of the vehicle is about 15 tons, and the 350 horsepower engine allows it to reach speeds of up to 105 km/h on the highway.

Greece moves to obtain newly discovered photos of Nazi executions

Greece announced Monday it will attempt to acquire photographs believed to capture the final moments of 200 Greeks executed by Nazi forces in Athens during World War II, after the previously unseen images were listed for sale online.
The images that appeared on eBay over the weekend allegedly show the men being led to their deaths on May 1, 1944, at a shooting range in the Kaisariani suburb of the Greek capital. Although the executions were well known, there were no known photos or film documentation of the event.
Greece's Culture Ministry said Monday that "it is very possible that these are authentic photographs," adding that it will seek to obtain them as historical archives after they were put up for sale on Saturday by a collector in Belgium of German military memorabilia.
The series of pictures show men being led through a gateway and down a path. They stand straight as they are lined up in front of a wall.
The Kaisariani executions of 200 communist political prisoners were one of the worst atrocities during the Third Reich's occupation of Greece and remain a seminal moment for the country.
As World War II ended, a vicious civil war between Western-backed government forces and communist fighters broke out and lasted until 1949. Its wounds have still not entirely healed.
Shortly after the photos were posted for sale, a memorial at the site to those killed was vandalized, with plaques listing their names smashed.
"Historical memory will not be erased, no matter how much it bothers some people," Kaisariani municipality said in a statement posted on its Facebook page, adding that it would repair the monument. The photos, it said, had caused "a chill of emotion for the heroic, valiant stance of the 200 communist heroes who stood up against the firing squad."
The Culture Ministry said there were "quite a few legal complications" to lay claim to the pictures. It said experts from the ministry were already in touch with the collector who put them up for auction and would be visiting him in Ghent, Belgium, to examine "the authenticity and legality of origin."
A ministry committee also was to convene Wednesday to determine whether to classify the photographs as being part of Greek heritage.
If the images are determined to be both authentic and legally obtained, "the Culture Ministry will immediately finalize the measures for their acquisition through the appropriate legal means," it said.

Pentagon ‘close to cutting ties’ with AI firm Anthropic amid frustration over restrictions
Anthropic wants to safeguard its Claude AI tool from being used for mass surveillance or advanced weapons development, Axios news reported
The Pentagon is close to cutting ties with Anthropic and may label the artificial intelligence company a supply chain risk after becoming frustrated with restrictions on how it can use the technology, Axios news website reported.
Anthropic’s talks about extending a contract with the Pentagon are being held up over additional protections the artificial intelligence company wants to put on its Claude tool, a person familiar with the matter said.
Anthropic wants to put safeguards in place to stop Claude from being used for mass surveillance of Americans or to develop weapons that can be deployed without a human involved, the person said, asking not to be identified because the negotiations are private.
The Pentagon wants to be able to use Claude as long as its deployment does not break the law. Axios reported on the disagreement earlier.
AI’s use cases for developing weapons and gathering personal data are a burgeoning risk for powerful models. Anthropic, which positions itself as a more responsible AI company that aims to avoid catastrophic harms from the technology, built Claude Gov specifically for the US national security apparatus and aims to serve government customers within its own ethical bounds.
Claude Gov has enhanced capabilities for handling and interpreting classified materials and intelligence and for understanding cybersecurity data.

At least three people are dead and three more hospitalized in critical condition in a mass shooting at an indoor ice rink in Pawtucket, Rhode Island, during a high school hockey match on Monday afternoon, the police said.
The Pawtucket police chief, Tina Goncalves, told reporters at a news conference that the suspect is one of the dead.
“We’re putting all the pieces together,” Goncalves said, adding that one of the shooting victims died at the Dennis M Lynch arena and a second succumbed to their wounds later at a hospital.
The attacker appears to have died from a self-inflicted gun wound,” Goncalves said.
Goncalves also said that the shooting appeared to have been a targeted event, possibly connected to a “family dispute”, but did not provide further details. Officials are not releasing names of any of the victims yet.
The Providence Journal reported that video acquired from a service that livestreams sports events captured audio of a burst of roughly 13 shots, fired in rapid succession, and showed panicked players and spectators rushing away.
A Rhode Island high school sportswriter, Eric Rueb, shared a video clip on social media with the caption: “You cannot see anything – the noise is unmistakeable – but the reaction and chaos that follows the follows tells the story.”
The shooting took place during a boys’ hockey game with students from multiple local schools, Pawtucket’s mayor, Don Grebien, said.

Epstein files: Inside a depraved transatlantic elite and the institutions that protected it

The release of millions of pages linked to Jeffrey Epstein has expanded scrutiny of political, financial and cultural elites in the United States and Europe. Congress ordered the disclosures under the Epstein Files Transparency Act.
After months of pressure from the media and some lawmakers, finally the Department of Justice and the FBI published millions of highly redacted emails, investigative files, financial records, flight manifests, photographs and videos tied to Epstein and his network.
The material spans decades and includes records from before and after his 2008 conviction in Florida for soliciting prostitution from a minor. The files present a record that extends beyond Epstein himself.
They contain documents, testimonies, logs and emails that chart his contact with presidents, prime ministers, billionaires, senior bankers, media executives, academics, intelligence-linked figures and members of royal families. The records show that after his 2008 plea agreement, and after he became a registered sex offender, he maintained contact with prominent figures across sectors.
PBS NewsHour reported on 14 November 2025 that newly released emails revealed how Epstein continued to communicate with political, business and academic figures after his conviction. The broadcaster said many correspondents were aware of his status.
Emails cited by PBS show invitations to meetings, requests for introductions, discussions of donations and exchanges about conferences and travel. Large sections remain redacted or withheld, including grand jury transcripts and certain surveillance materials. There is still millions of unreleased files which analysts beleive incriminate more political figures and elite including and espcially Donald Trump who is one of the most mentioned political figures in the files.
Even in redacted form, the files identify recurring names. Political figures cited across analyses include Donald Trump, Bill Clinton, Prince Andrew, Ehud Barak, Peter Mandelson, Bill Richardson and George Mitchell.
Business and technology leaders listed include Bill Gates, Elon Musk, Reid Hoffman, Peter Thiel, Les Wexner, Glenn Dubin and Jes Staley.
Lawyers and figures from media and entertainment also appear, including Alan Dershowitz, Steven Tisch, Casey Wasserman, Woody Allen, Naomi Campbell, Courtney Love and Noam Chomsky. The files also reference employees and intermediaries within Epstein’s circle.
Appearance in the documents does not in itself establish criminal conduct.
A New York Times analysis reported Trump is mentioned more than 38,000 times across over 5,300 individual files in the DOJ’s Epstein database. Other reporting has cited “over 1,000” or “around 1,800” hits when searching just the most recently released 3 million‑page tranche. The records range from contact books and flight logs to internal notes gathered by investigators.
”Trump's name appears more times in the Epstein files than God's name appears in the book about God. Trump's name also appears more times in the Epstein file than Harry Potter's name appears in the seven books about Harry Potter,” said Representative Jared Moskowitz of Florida, during a House hearing where he was grilling former Attorney General Pam Bondi about the Epstein files and the Trump administration’s handling of their release.
Bondi, who was defending her office’s lack of action against alleged offenders, refused to turn and face the victims of Epstein’s trafficking of minors seated in the hearing room. A photograph of the dossier in front of her during testimony later revealed that her department, working with the FBI, had monitored members of Congress who accessed the unredacted files and had secretly logged their search terms.
Trump has denied wrongdoing and has said he cut ties with Epstein years before his 2019 arrest.
NPR reported on 12 November 2025 that political factions in Washington sought to emphasise or downplay references to Trump and other public figures as batches of documents emerged.
The scale of the release has also renewed attention to the 2008 plea agreement in Florida, which allowed Epstein to avoid federal prosecution at the time. The deal was highly unusual, granting Epstein and both named and unnamed associates sweeping immunity for a wide range of known and potential future charges arising from the investigation.
CBS News reported that law enforcement agencies had received warnings from victims years before his arrest in 2019. Internal correspondence in the newly released files includes discussions among prosecutors about strategy and exposure.
In the United Kingdom, newly released DOJ documents and bank records prompted a criminal inquiry involving Peter Mandelson.
Al Jazeera reported on 14 February 2026 that records suggest Epstein sent about 75,000 dollars in three payments in 2003 and 2004 to accounts linked to Mandelson or his partner. Mandelson said he does not recall the payments and is seeking to verify the transactions.
Emails cited in the reporting show Mandelson passing what he described as “political insights”. One 2010 message referred to a 500-billion-euro bailout as “nearly finalized” shortly before European governments announced such a package. Another note referred to the expected resignation of then prime minister Gordon Brown in terms of the effect on the value of Epstein’s “chapters” in a book project.
UK officials allege Mandelson may have misled vetting authorities about post-2008 contact, gifts and hospitality linked to Epstein. British authorities referred him for possible misconduct in public office charges. He was dismissed as ambassador to Washington. He resigned from the House of Lords and from the Labour Party.
Members of the United States Congress have asked him to cooperate with their investigation. Mandelson has denied wrongdoing.
PBS reported in February 2026 that related disclosures in Europe contributed to political fallout in several countries, including scrutiny of former leaders and senior officials over travel, gifts and financial arrangements connected to Epstein.
The files show that Epstein continued to host meetings at his properties in New York, Florida and on his private island. Flight manifests list politicians, executives and public figures travelling on his aircraft. Banks maintained accounts connected to him for years after his conviction. Universities accepted donations. Regulators and public institutions engaged with him in professional contexts.
Victims’ representatives have called for full disclosure of the remaining sealed material. An attorney for several accusers said, “The public deserves to know who enabled Jeffrey Epstein and who looked the other way.” Federal prosecutors have not announced new charges directly tied to the 2025 and 2026 releases.
The Justice Department has stated that it continues to review evidence. As further tranches appear, congressional committees have scheduled additional hearings. Investigators and journalists continue to review the material as disclosures proceed whle lawmakers from both parties have demanded more unsealing of court records. The publication of the archive has broadened the public record. Beyond the individual names, the files outline a deeper pattern in which Epstein functioned as a broker within a transnational network of political and financial power, rather than as an isolated offender.
The correspondence and travel records suggest that his homes, jets and island operated as informal meeting points where business, politics, philanthropy and intelligence interests intersected, with social events and alleged exploitation occurring in the same spaces.
The archive shows how institutions often treated the scandal as a reputational management problem instead of a structural failure: prosecutors negotiated limited deals, universities and cultural bodies weighed reputational risk against donations, and banks balanced compliance concerns against lucrative relationships. The documents also illuminate long-standing questions about oversight and capture, as regulators, law enforcement and security services repeatedly encountered warning signs yet failed to intervene decisively while Epstein remained useful to well-connected clients and interlocutors.
The reactions to the releases in the United States and Europe highlight contrasting capacities to hold elites accountable. In several European states, the new material contributed to resignations, formal inquiries and, in some cases, criminal charges against former senior officials, whereas in the United States the fallout has so far focused on political argument over transparency, redactions and the treatment of a small number of public figures.
The disclosures prompted renewed debate over whether existing legal frameworks are adequate to address cross-border exploitation networks that rely on secrecy jurisdictions, complex financial structures and social venues designed to blur lines between private indulgence and public responsibility. They also intensified discussion of how concentrated wealth and influence can shape prosecutorial discretion, media coverage and legislative priorities, especially when those same elites are the subjects of potential investigation.
Taken together, the files underscore that the Epstein case is not only a record of individual crimes but also a lens on how a narrow, interlocking elite across the United States and Europe has been able to operate with a high degree of impunity. The term ”Epstein Class” has been used to describe the corrupt elite rulling with impunity.
The documents show that reputational risk, rather than ethical red lines, often determined when institutions chose to distance themselves, and that serious allegations could coexist for years with invitations, board seats and philanthropic partnerships.
As the remaining sealed materials come under pressure and more connections are mapped, the disclosures continue to raise questions about where responsibility lies—not only with Epstein and his immediate accomplices, but with the wider systems that enabled, protected and then only partially exposed them.

At least two killed and several others injured in mass shooting at Rhode Island ice rink
The suspected shooter also died during the incident at Dennis M Lynch Arena in Pawtucket, police say

A mass shooting at an indoor ice rink in Rhode Island has left at least two dead and multiple others injured, according to authorities.
Chaos erupted at the Dennis M Lynch Arena in Pawtucket, near Providence, on Monday afternoon, as gunfire rang out during a high school hockey game.
Aside from the victims who had died, three more were injured, police said. The suspected shooter has also died, according to authorities. It wasn’t immediately clear what led to the shooting or the condition of those injured.
The Pawtucket mayor’s office said a young girl was killed in the shooting in a statement shared by local outlet WJAR. Local officials said authorities are not searching for any other suspects in the shooting.
“It seems that this is a targeted event and it may have been a family dispute,” Pawtucket Police Chief Tina Goncalves told reporters Monday.
The Providence Police Department announced on X that it was “monitoring the situation” and had officers at the rink “providing assistance.”
State police officers were seen outside the ice rink behind crime scene tape.
There were also FBI agents at the scene, according to the agency’s field office in Boston.
“At this time, there is no imminent threat to public safety and there has been no request for FBI assistance. However, the public should continue to avoid the area,” FBI Boston wrote on x.
The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives also responded to the shooting, according to its Boston Field Division.
The shooting happened during a hockey game between two local co-op teams: Coventry-Johnston and St. Raphael-Providence Country Day-North Providence-North Smithfield.
A Walgreens employee told WPRI that panicked patrons came into the nearby pharmacy saying there was a shooting. The police were called, according to the employee.
One hockey player from Coventry Public Schools told reporters that the shooting was “very scary.”
The student was on the ice when shots rang out. He then rushed into the locker room.
"We pressed against the door and just tried to stay safe down in there. It was very scary. We were very nervous," he said, per CBS Boston. "It was a lot of shots."
Goncalves asked for the public’s help in the investigation by giving information to the Pawtucket Police Department.
“Any recordings that they may have, because obviously people were recording, their kids were on the ice...provide those to the police department,” the chief said.
Coventry and Johnston school districts said that all of their students are believed to be safe.
"We have been informed that students are secured in multiple locations. At this time, we are still working to confirm the status and location of all individuals,” Coventry's superintendent, Don Cowart, said in a message shared by WJAR.
Johnston Public Schools said, per WJAR, “We have confirmed that our Johnston High School student-athlete who was participating in the game is safe. We are also aware of another Johnston student who was in attendance, and that student is safe as well.
“At this time, to the best of our knowledge, no Johnston High School students were harmed during this incident."
Providence Country Day School wrote on an Instagram story that it was “shocked and saddened” by the shooting, adding that all students, parents and staff who were at the game are safe.
Joseph Goho, the superintendent of North Providence Public Schools, said in a statement shared by NBC10 Boston, “All students involved in the game are safe.”
"Our thoughts and prayers go out to those involved in this tragic incident," Goho said.
Rhode Island Governor Dan McKee wrote on X that he was “actively monitoring the shooting,” adding, “I am praying for Pawtucket and everyone involved.”
The Providence Bruins, the American Hockey League affiliate of the National Hockey League’s Boston Bruins, said their “thoughts are with all those affected by the tragic events at the High School Hockey game at Dennis M Lynch Arena in Pawtucket today.”
The shooting comes two months after a mass shooting at Brown University in Providence that left two students dead and nine others injured.

'If this isn’t a massacre, what is?': Ex-hostage decries removal of 'massacre' from Oct. 7 bill

Former Gaza hostage Or Levy spoke out against an Israeli government decision to remove the term “massacre” from official legislation regarding Hamas’s October 7 terror acts during an interview with KAN Reshet Bet on Monday.
Levy was held in captivity by terrorists in Gaza for nearly 500 days before his release in February 2025, and his wife, Einav, was murdered by Hamas during the massacre.
He stated that when he saw headlines about the government's push to remove the word from a bill establishing a national day of commemoration for the attack, he thought it was a mistake.
“I heard ministers talking about how we shouldn’t portray ourselves as victims and that we weren’t massacred, so it’s important for me to say, I was there. They massacred me and my wife,” Levy stated.
“There is no other way to describe it. If this isn’t called a massacre, then what is? Soon they’ll say the Holocaust didn’t happen.”
Levy 'enraged' at government 'trying to change history'
Levy additionally commented on government attempts to block the establishment of a state commission of inquiry into the October 7 massacre and related national security failures.
He recounted visiting the bomb shelter from which he was kidnapped on October 7 with IDF investigators. “I sat with two incredible investigators, but they told me, ‘We don’t know,’ ‘There’s no information,’ ‘We assume.’ It’s the year 2026. We’re supposed to know everything, apparently, they don’t want to.”
The words of the investigators and the government's reluctance to greenlight a probe did not make Levy feel reassured that such an attack wouldn’t happen again, he said, adding, “feeling that they are disgracing my wife’s memory enrages me. Feeling that they are trying to change history enrages me.”

The IDF thwarted an attempt to smuggle hundreds of kilograms of tobacco disguised as canned food products into the Gaza Strip, the military confirmed on Monday.
The tobacco was concealed inside dozens of cans labelled as containing grape leaves, which smugglers attempted to transfer via the Kerem Shalom Border Crossing.
All of the truck's contents were seized and transferred for further handling by customs and other authorities.
In response to the incident, the newly promoted Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT), Chief Maj.-Gen. Yoram Halevi ordered the immediate suspension of the company's permit to bring aid into the Gaza Strip until further notice, the IDF confirmed.
Halevi's decision was made in light of "the severity of the case and in order to preserve the integrity of the aid entry mechanism, while preventing its exploitation for prohibited purposes," the military stated.
Shin Bet chief's brother indicted for aiding Hamas during wartime in Gaza smuggling case
Bezalel Zini, the brother of Shin Bet (Israel Security Agency) David Zini, was indicted on February 5 along with two other men in a wide-ranging wartime security case in which prosecutors allege that a network of Israeli reservists and civilians smuggled prohibited goods - primarily cigarettes and tobacco - into the Gaza Strip during Israel’s war with Hamas.
According to an indictment filed at the Beersheba District Court, Zini was charged with aiding the enemy during wartime, prohibited dealings in property for terror purposes under the Counter-Terrorism Law, aggravated fraud, and accepting bribes while serving as a public official.
Prosecutors allege that the operation generated millions of shekels in revenue and materially benefited Hamas by strengthening its economic control inside the enclave.

President Volodymyr Zelensky has announced sanctions on ten Russian athletes whom Kyiv says have actively supported Russia’s aggression in Ukraine.
According to the President’s Office, the measures will apply to sports figures who visited occupied Ukrainian territories, publicly defended Russia’s invasion and occupation, raised funds for Russian forces, or organized events for Ukrainian children forcibly abducted by Russia.

“This Ukrainian sanctions package should be a signal to others around the world – a signal that one cannot simply turn a blind eye to support for aggression,” Zelensky said.
“When Ukrainians at the Olympics are forbidden to even mention the victims of Russian aggression, that is clearly a global rollback of justice. We will restore justice,” he added.
The sanctions list was created following a petition from Ukrainian skeleton racer and National Olympic Team member Vladyslav Heraskevych.
Ukrainian media reports identified the ten figures as: Arkady Dvorkovich, president of the International Chess Federation (FIDE); wrestler Yevgeny Baydusov; Wrestler Imam Ganishov; Taekwondo athlete Vladislav Larin; Taekwondo athlete Maksim Khramtsov; archer Svetlana Dashanimaeva; sabre fencer Yana Egoryan; Gymnast Angelina Melnikova; judoka Madina Taymazova; and boxer Fedor Chudinov.
The President’s Office did not detail the exact sanctions, though Ukrainian outlets suggest they may include asset freezes.

Praising the sanctions on X, Heraskevych said: “A very important step to significantly reduce the spread of Russian propaganda in international sports. Reducing the spread of Russian narratives = saving lives.”
Last week, Heraskevych was barred from competing in the Winter Olympics after refusing to remove a helmet honoring 24 Ukrainian athletes and children killed by Russia. He called the IOC ruling “purely discriminatory.”
Zelensky at the time also condemned the decision, saying: “Sport shouldn’t mean amnesia, and the Olympic movement should help stop wars, not play into the hands of aggressors.”
He also hit out at the inclusion of 19 Russian athletes in the games under a “neutral” banner.
“They compete under ‘neutral’ flags at the Games, while in real life publicly supporting Russian aggression against Ukraine and the occupation of our territories. And they are the ones who deserve disqualification,” he said.
Following the Olympic controversy, Heraskevych launched a fundraising initiative for families of Ukrainian athletes killed by Russia and submitted a petition urging the government to sanction Russian sports figures who support the invasion.
“The introduction of sanctions by Ukraine against Russian athletes will be the first step toward the introduction of sanctions against them by Ukraine’s partner countries,” he said at the time.
“This will make their performances on the international stage impossible, which they use to support the war against Ukraine.”
According to Andriy Sybiha, the foreign minister, over 650 Ukrainian athletes and coaches have been killed and more than 800 sports facilities have been destroyed over the course of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

SpaceX, xAI compete for Pentagon contract to develop autonomous drone swarms — Bloomberg

NEW YORK, February 16. /TASS/. Elon Musk’s companies, SpaceX and xAI, have entered a closed Pentagon technology competition to develop a technology for controlling drone swarms using voice commands, Bloomberg reported citing sources.
The participation of two of Musk's companies in the development of AI-supported weapons marks a new and potentially controversial stage for the businessman, the agency writes. Musk’s companies are among a select few participants in the competition launched in January with a $100 million fund. The initiative aims to create a technology capable of translating voice commands into digital instructions for simultaneously controlling multiple drones in the air and at sea.
The development under this defense initiative will proceed in five phases ranging from software creation to field testing. The organizers are the Defense Innovation Unit and the Autonomous Battle Group, established under the second administration of Donald Trump.
Musk has previously advocated for a ban on the use of offensive autonomous weapons capable of independently selecting and engaging targets.

Cuba’s Havana piles with rubbish as US chokehold halts garbage trucks
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
HAVANA - Garbage has begun to pile up on street corners in the Cuban capital of Havana, attracting hordes of flies and reeking of rotten food, in one of the most visible impacts of the US bid to prevent oil from reaching the Caribbean’s largest island
State-run news outlet Cubadebate reported in February that Havana only 44 of 106 of its rubbish trucks were able to keep operating due to fuel shortages, slowing garbage collection.
Cardboard boxes, used bags, plastic bottles and rags piled up on street corners across the seafront capital, as some residents sorted through the waste looking for scraps they could re-use, while motorists, pedestrians and bikers are forced to circumvent the imposing heaps.
“It’s all over the city,” said local resident Jose Ramon Cruz. “It’s been more than 10 days since a garbage truck came.”
In other towns on the island - home to around 11 million people - residents took to social media to warn of the risks to public health.
Cuba’s government has implemented rationing measures to protect essential services in the country that was already suffering from severe shortages of food, fuel and medicine.
The country’s oil supply has fallen off dramatically in two months.
Venezuela - once Cuba’s top supplier - effectively stopped sending shipments in mid-December. Mexico’s government also said it was halting shipments after Washington threatened tariffs against countries that send supplies to Cuba.
A Russian newspaper last week reported that Moscow was preparing to send crude and fuel cargoes to the Communist-run island in the near future, without giving a specific date.
The United States has maintained an embargo on Cuba since the 1960s, but in recent months the administration of President Donald Trump has hardened its stance, sanctioning vessels shipping oil to Cuba and threatening tariffs on suppliers.
It argues the measures will pressure a political change in Cuba. The United Nations has long voted for the US to end its embargo, and leaders from Mexico and Venezuela said blocking fuel could have serious humanitarian impacts. REUTERS

Israel's approval of West Bank land registration sparks outrage
France
Unknown Publisher

05:35:05 KST

Israel's government has approved a process to register land in the West Bank as "state property", drawing condemnation from Arab nations and critics who said it would accelerate annexation of the Palestinian territory.
Israel's foreign ministry said the measure, approved late Sunday, February 15, would enable "transparent and thorough clarification of rights to resolve legal disputes", and was needed after unlawful land registration in areas controlled by the Palestinian Authority.
Arab nations Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Qatar and Jordan criticized the move as illegal under international law. The measure is "aimed at imposing a new legal and administrative reality in the occupied West Bank" that would undermine peace efforts in the region, Saudi Arabia's foreign affairs ministry said in a statement. Jordan's King Abdullah II said the actions "undermine efforts to restore calm and threaten to exacerbate the conflict", according to a statement released by the royal court.
The European Union called on Israel to reverse the move. "This constitutes a new escalation after recent measures already aimed at extending Israeli control," EU foreign affairs spokesman Anouar El Anouni said. "We reiterate that annexation is illegal under international law."
UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres echoed that point and called the move "destabilizing", warning the "decision could lead to the dispossession of Palestinians of their property". He also called for the decision's immediate reversal, adding in a statement from his spokesman that "the current trajectory on the ground is eroding the prospect for the two-State solution".
The Ramallah-based Palestinian Authority called for international intervention to prevent the "de facto beginning of the annexation process and the undermining of the foundations of the Palestinian state".
'Mega land grab'
Israeli anti-settlement watchdog Peace Now called the measure a "mega land grab". Jonathan Mizrachi, the NGO's co-director, told AFP that the move would attribute new resources for land registration.
The process will take place only in Area C, which constitutes some 60 % of the West Bank's territory and is under Israeli security and administrative control.
"There was a lot of ambiguity regarding the land, and Israel decided now to deal with it," Mizrachi said, adding that the grey area over Area C land ownership is likely to be used against Palestinians. "A lot of land that Palestinians consider theirs, they will find out it's not theirs under this new registration process," he said, believing the move would further the Israeli right's annexation agenda.
Palestinians see the West Bank as foundational to any future Palestinian state, but many on Israel's religious right want to take over the land.
Last week, Israel's security cabinet approved a series of measures backed by far-right ministers to tighten control over areas of the West Bank administered by the Palestinian Authority under the Oslo accords, in place since the 1990s. Those measures, which also sparked international backlash, include allowing Jewish Israelis to buy West Bank land directly and allowing Israeli authorities to administer certain religious sites in areas under the Palestinian Authority's control.

FBI refuses to share evidence about Alex Pretti’s killing at hands of fed agents with Minnesota investigators
Officials warn against Justice Department’s ‘concerning and unprecedented’ refusal to support local authorities
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
The FBI will not share information with Minnesota authorities investigating the killing of Alex Pretti, who was fatally shot by federal officers during the Trump administration’s surge into Minneapolis last month.
The Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension said Monday it formally received notice from the bureau that it will not provide the state agency with “access to any information or evidence that it has collected” in connection with Pretti’s death.
“While this lack of cooperation is concerning and unprecedented, the BCA is committed to thorough, independent and transparent investigations of these incidents, even if hampered by a lack of access to key information and evidence,” Superintendent Drew Evans said in a statement.
“Our agency has committed to the FBI and Department of Justice that should its stance change we remain willing to share information that we have obtained with that agency and would welcome a joint investigation,” he added. “We will continue to pursue all legal avenues to gain access to relevant information and evidence.”
The FBI’s decision to withhold evidence from Minnesota authorities follows a similar decision in the case of Renee Good, another Minnesota resident who was fatally shot by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer last month.
A spokesperson for the FBI declined to comment but referred The Independent to remarks from Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, who previously announced that the Department of Justice had opened a “standard” investigation into the case.
Hours after the Pretti’s killing, Minnesota law enforcement agencies sued to block Homeland Security officials from destroying or altering any evidence from the scene, and a federal judge appointed by Donald Trump granted the order later that night.
But earlier this month, the judge said inflammatory statements by top administration officials and a potentially compromised crime scene were not enough to block federal law enforcement agencies from handling evidence, for now.
Though the administration has repeatedly rebuffed attempts for local authorities to investigate the killings, the Justice Department has opened a federal civil rights investigation into Pretti’s death. Blanche has sought to downplay the Justice Department’s inquiry, describing it as a “standard investigation by the FBI.”
Homeland Security is separately reviewing the case.
Administration officials “decided the day Mr. Pretti was killed that the federal officers who shot him did nothing wrong,” District Judge Eric C. Tostrud, a Trump-appointee, wrote this month.
On X, White House deputy chief of staff for policy Stephen Miller baselessly labeled Pretti a “domestic terrorist” who “tried to assassinate federal law enforcement.” Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said Pretti “committed an act of domestic terrorism” and intended to “inflict maximum damage on individuals and to kill law enforcement.”
“These statements are troubling,” Tostrud wrote. “They reflect, not a genuine interest in learning the truth, but snap judgments informed by speculation and motivated by political partisanship.”
Miller later claimed that the statements were based on reports from Customs and Border Protection personnel “on the ground.”
Last week, Trump administration’s top immigration enforcement officials testified that such characterizations did not come from them or anyone who reports to them.
Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty has also demanded evidence in the killings of Pretti and Good from Homeland Security and the Department of Justice, and the state has launched a website to collect evidence from the public.
Pretti’s family, meanwhile, has urged the FBI and Minnesota authorities to jointly investigate the death of the 37-year-old intensive care unit nurse.
“Justice and accountability requires a thorough and impartial investigation to establish the facts,” the family said in a statement. “A truly joint state and federal investigation would be a welcome development.”
An initial investigation into Pretti’s killing was led by Homeland Security Investigations, the agency’s investigative arm, which is required to “preserve all evidence collected, including physical evidence collected by other federal entities, which are then properly transferred” to homeland custody, according to a sworn declaration in court documents from Mark Zito, the agency’s Special Agent in Charge for the St. Paul office.
All evidence was “collected and transported back to the FBI Minneapolis Field Office,” according to a sworn statement from an FBI official whose name is redacted in court filings.
That evidence includes body-worn camera footage, which has been “preserved,” according to Jeffrey Egerton, the executive director for the Investigative Operations Directorate within Customs and Border Protection’s Office of Professional Responsibility.
“There’s a lot of other video, there’s body-cam video that’s all being looked at, and until all that evidence is evaluated, I can’t jump to a conclusion” about the case, Customs and Border Protection commissioner Rodney Scott testified to the Senate Homeland Security committee last week.
“I would ask America to do the same thing, but I am committed to transparency, to making sure all the information we have is made public when it’s appropriate,” he said.
Border Patrol agents were filmed shooting 10 rounds at Pretti after tackling him to the ground January 24, two weeks after an ICE officer fatally shot Good.
Their deaths have fueled outrage against the Trump administration’s weeks-long surge of immigration officers into Minnesota, where agents have been accused of brutally targeting immigrants and citizens alike during protests and violent arrests.
White House border czar Tom Homan, who was deployed to the state in the wake of Pretti’s killing and the apparent removal of Border Patrol “commander-at-large” Greg Bovino, announced last week that “a small footprint of personnel” will remain in the state to supervise the transfer of “full command and control” of immigration enforcement back to the ICE field office in Minneapolis.

Democratic Maryland governor says president’s ‘actions’ speak for themselves, even amid Trump’s denials of racist intentions

Maryland Gov. Wes Moore, the nation’s only current Black governor, addressed the now-deleted post from Donald Trump’s account depicting Barack and Michelle Obama as apes at a town hall that aired Sunday.
Moore sat down with CBS News’ Norah O’Donnell and declined to say directly whether he thought the president was a racist, calling it a question for Trump himself. But the governor did smile quickly, almost to himself, as O’Donnell described how Trump claimed he was the “least racist” president in history after an uproar over the post began.
“I think that’s a question for President Trump,” Moore said. “I can tell you I know how his actions hit Black folks, and how they hit people of color.”
He added: “I think his actions probably give the answer before he even has a chance to answer it himself."
Moore pointed to the video as well as the policy priorities of the Trump administration as evidence that the president may hold animus towards Black Americans.
Maryland is home to tens of thousands of federal workers, and was hit particularly hard by the White House’s wild cost-cutting spree led by Elon Musk’s DOGE initiative. Moore’s office claims that an estimated 24,900 Marylanders lost federal employment during the first year of Trump’s presidency, something the governor’s office has noted hit Black communities and women particularly hard.
During the CBS town hall, he referred to it as the “greatest assault on Black female employment that we’ve seen in our nation’s history”.
The video was posted from Trump’s Truth Social account and appeared to have been created originally by another user. It was deleted from Trump’s personal account hours later.
The video depicted the former president and his wife as apes in the jungle, imagery that aligned with historical racist depictions of Black people. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt initially defended the video and denied those connotations, but later the White House declared that it had been posted by a staffer by “mistake”.
Trump himself has refused to apologize directly for the video post being spread by his acount.
The president’s critics haven’t bought that explanation. Republican Sen. Tim Scott, the only Black senator in the GOP, called it the “most racist thing” he’d seen emerge from the second Trump administration, and the video was roundly condemned by lawmakers on both sides in Capitol Hill. Mike Johnson, the speaker of the House, echoed the statement calling it a “mistake” and claimed that Trump himself had never seen it.
Obama responded to the video on a podcast with Brian Tyler Cohen that aired Sunday. The former president said that a majority of Americans find the White House’s conduct “troubling”, and added: “[T]here’s this sort of clown show happening in social media and on television, and what is true is that there doesn’t seem to be any shame about this among people who used to feel like you had to have some sort of decorum and a sense of propriety and respect for the office. So that’s been lost.”
“But the reason I point out that I don't think the majority of the American people approve of this is because, ultimately, the answer is going to come from the American people,” he continued.
Fallout from the video comes at a time when the White House cannot afford to lose further political capital on the Hill. The Republican House caucus is facing its thinnest majority yet as it hurtles towards the 2026 midterm elections, while Trump also continues to face defections in the Senate from moderate GOP senators.
The Maryland governor has repeatedly expressed his disinterest in running for president and did so again in his town hall with CBS, telling O’Donnell: “I’m not running for president...I don’t see a reason. I love my job. I love what I’m doing.”
But his prominence within the Democratic Party and the fact that Moore, if re-elected this November in a race he is widely expected to win, would be halfway through his second and final term as governor in 2028 has continued to stoke speculation about his potential future in national politics.
Moore is heavily favored to win re-election in deep-blue Maryland, and in recent days former Gov. Larry Hogan announced that he would not challenge him for the seat. Hogan is seen as one of the few Republicans in Maryland with statewide appeal, partly due to his anti-Trump stance.

In Munich, Ukraine and Europe face collapse of post-Cold War order

In Munich, Ukraine and Europe face collapse of post-Cold War order

The U.S.-Europe dynamic was more cordial at the Feb. 13-15 Munich Security Conference than last year, with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio delivering a conciliatory speech.
But the substance of the relationship remained unchanged, despite the softer rhetoric.
U.S. President Donald Trump's foreign policy upheavals, from Ukraine to Greenland, were fresh on everyone's mind – as well as the confrontational address by U.S. Vice President JD Vance during last year's conference.
European leaders made it clear: the post–Cold War global order is ending — or at least undergoing profound change — and Europe can no longer afford to remain in Washington’s shadow.
"If there had been a unipolar moment after the fall of the Berlin Wall, a unipolar moment in history, it has long passed," German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said in his speech, heralding the return of "power politics" and warning that the U.S. cannot "go it alone."
French President Emmanuel Macron, in turn, urged Europe to become a “geopolitical power,” while hinting at reforms to France’s nuclear doctrine as Paris weighs extending its nuclear umbrella over the continent.
With Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in attendance, Russia’s invasion was still on the agenda, though partly overshadowed by broader global turbulence and a transatlantic rupture.
The Munich Security Conference also painted a bleak picture of peace prospects for Ukraine, contradicting the recent optimism from U.S. officials. Furthermore, some officials and analysts cast doubt on whether the U.S. and Europe could provide Kyiv with NATO-style security guarantees.

The transatlantic wake-up call
Despite the bold calls for European autonomy, there was clear relief when Rubio, the most senior U.S. official present, delivered a speech markedly different in tone from Vance's.
"So in a time of headlines heralding the end of the transatlantic era, let it be known and clear to all that this is neither our goal nor our wish – because for us Americans, our home may be in the Western Hemisphere, but we will always be a child of Europe," the U.S. diplomat said in a speech met with a standing ovation.
Nevertheless, some noted that Rubio was delivering a familiar Trumpian message, simply packaged in more diplomatic language.
"Secretary Rubio said exactly the same things (as Vance), just in a more polite way," Estonia's Foreign Minister Margus Tsahkna told the Kyiv Independent on the sidelines of the event, referring to the American's calls for a stronger Europe.
The Estonian official acknowledged that some U.S. criticism is warranted — and even useful — and described Europe as a former athlete “getting fat” from inactivity.
"We just need to start training… We have more strength to act on defense, but also on an economic level," Tsahkna said. "And also Ukraine is part of our future — a huge opportunity."
In fact, few European officials have challenged Washington’s call for Europe to rearm, as reflected in last year’s pledge by NATO members to raise defense spending to 5% of gross domestic product (GDP).
But the U.S. message has been muddled by a simultaneous push for a weaker EU, Washington's support for far-right and populist parties, and a brief threat to impose U.S. tariffs on countries that opposed Trump's bid to annex Greenland.
Notably, after his appearance in Munich, Rubio traveled to Slovakia and Hungary — arguably the two most Kremlin-friendly EU member states, both heavily reliant on Russian energy.

No high hopes for Ukraine talks
Despite recent optimism from U.S. envoys, the Munich Security Conference cast a gloomy picture regarding progress toward peace in Ukraine.
As the conference took off, Trump called on Zelensky to "get moving" with peace talks ahead of trilateral negotiations in Geneva on Feb. 17-18, claiming that "Russia wants to make a deal."
But Moscow has dismissed key elements of a peace framework drafted by Ukrainian and Western officials, refusing to compromise on its territorial and political demands.
In Munich, Rubio's message was out of step with his boss's.
"We don't know if the Russians are serious about ending the war," the U.S. diplomat said, while Zelensky asked the attendees: "Can you imagine (Russian President Vladimir) Putin without war?"
"No one in Ukraine believes he will ever let our people go. But he will not let other European nations go either – because he cannot let go of the very idea of war," the Ukrainian leader said, warning that carving up Ukraine through territorial concessions would not bring a lasting peace.
In contrast with his scathing remarks about Europe in Davos, Zelensky thanked European allies for stepping up military support as the U.S. withdrew. He also said that it is a "big mistake" that Europe is absent from the negotiating table.
Many echoed this message. In an interview with Bloomberg in Munich, Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski complained that Europe is being sidelined from negotiations even though it – not the U.S. – foots the bill for Ukraine's defense.
Last year, the U.S. halted nearly all new aid allocations, while European military support surged by 67%, including through purchases of American hardware for Ukraine. The Munich conference also followed U.K. Defense Secretary John Healey's announcement of $35 billion in fresh allied assistance this year.

Missing answers
Zelensky and Rubio met on the sidelines of the event to discuss air defenses, Russia's escalating attacks on Ukraine's energy grid, and the upcoming round of peace negotiations.
"We also touched on the sequence of steps. It's important to make progress on issues of security guarantees and economic recovery," Zelensky said after the meeting.
At the conference, the Ukrainian leader called for 20-year security guarantees to be signed before a potential peace agreement, a sequence that clashes with Washington's push for the fastest possible end to hostilities.
Although the West has previously signaled readiness to provide Ukraine with “Article 5-like” security guarantees, backed by a post-war European-led multinational force, officials who spoke with the Kyiv Independent were cautious.
"The primary security guarantee is strong Ukrainian armed forces," Latvian Defense Minister Andris Spruds told the Kyiv Independent in an interview.
The deployment of forces led by the Coalition of the Willing would additionally demonstrate Europe's engagement, the Latvian defense chief said. He declined to speculate on what would happen if a Russian missile struck the said troops.
Lithuanian Foreign Minister Kestutis Budrys warned against offering "hollow" promises and "fake guarantees" to Kyiv. In an interview with the Kyiv Independent, he dismissed the concept of Article 5-like guarantees, calling them mere "rhetorical expressions."
"There can be nothing similar to Article 5… Because Article 5 means that if you are in trouble, I promise you that I will come and if it is needed, I will die for you," he added.
Instead, he underscored financial support for Ukraine's Armed Forces or Ukraine's future EU membership as more realistic guarantees.
The question remains: what security guarantees — short of direct Western military involvement — would deter Russia, given that extensive security aid and sanctions have failed to end the war?
U.S. political scientist Ian Bremmer said he does not consider the proposed security guarantees credible.
"Trump has shown that he is willing to throw Ukrainians under the bus, repeatedly," Bremmer told the Kyiv Independent.
He added that the U.S. president appears determined to end the war and claim political credit — without putting American lives at risk.
But even if Europe — backed by Washington — were to formally commit to military intervention, the expert said he "can't see the Russians accepting that today."
Bill Browder, an American-born British financier and sanctions advocate, expressed skepticism that Moscow would relent in 2026, despite mounting economic woes.
"I think if we just were to watch the pressure that they're under right now, going into 2026, I don't think that's enough to stop them in the war in Ukraine," he told the Kyiv Independent.
Comparing Putin to North Korea, Browder said: "He will always have enough money for his war, even if he has to starve his population. So, you need to make sure that he just doesn't have enough money for anything."

China Wants 203,000 Satellites in Low Earth Orbit, Compared to SpaceX’s Current Leadership of 10,000

China has submitted applications to the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) to deploy super-large satellite groups. The documents mention a potential fleet of up to 203,000 devices in low Earth orbit.
The declared scale significantly exceeds the current global market figures. This has attracted the attention of analysts and the space industry, according to Bloomberg.
The news agency also provides statistics: for comparison, SpaceX’s Starlink network already has nearly 10,000 active satellites. The system remains the largest active constellation in LEO (Low Earth Orbit).
Bloomberg also notes that Chinese applications may be regulatory in nature. This refers to the reservation of frequencies and orbital positions without guaranteed implementation.
Submissions to the International Telecommunication Union allow countries to fix spectral resources. Such applications are taken into account during international coordination.
This practice creates technical limitations for competitors. Operators are forced to take potential radio interference into account in advance.
The context for these decisions is the rapid growth in the number of devices in orbit. Since 2020, the numbers have increased several times over.
Experts warn of the risks of LEO overload. This refers to both spectral conflicts and the threat of cascading collisions.
The Falcon 9 rocket remains a key factor in SpaceX’s dominance. The reusable system ensures low launch costs and a high rate of satellite deployment.
Analysts emphasize the technological gap between operators. The lack of similar launch capabilities limits the scalability of competitors.
Despite China’s ambitious plans, Elon Musk retains market leadership. It is the pace of launches that currently determines the balance of power in low orbit.
WMilitarnyi recently mentioned the topic of satellite telecommunications space as it relates to Ukraine in the article Starlink – a new story of protecting SatCom sovereignty.

Zelenskiy warns of new Russian strikes ahead of Geneva peace talks
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
Feb 16 - President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Monday that Ukrainian intelligence showed more Russian attacks on energy targets lay ahead and that such strikes made it more difficult to reach an agreement on ending the nearly four-year war.
"Intelligence reports show that Russia is preparing further massive strikes against energy infrastructure so it is necessary to ensure that all air defence systems are properly configured," Zelenskiy said in his nightly video address.
Ukrainian, Russian and American delegations are gathering in the Swiss city of Geneva for a third round of U.S.-brokered talks on Tuesday focused for the first time on the thorniest question of the war — the fate of Ukrainian territory occupied by Russia.
Zelenskiy said Russian attacks were "constantly evolving" and resorting to a combination of weapons, including drones and missiles, requiring "special defence and support from our partners".
"Russia cannot resist the temptation of the final days of winter cold and wants to strike Ukrainians painfully," he said. "Partners must understand this. First and foremost, this concerns the United States."
Reuters was not able to immediately reach Russian officials for comment.
The head of Ukraine's delegation, Rustem Umerov, said on Telegram that his team was already in Geneva looking forward "to constructive work and substantive meetings on security and humanitarian issues".
Moscow wants Ukraine to cede the entirety of the Donbas area.
Russian news agencies quoted aviation sources as saying that the Russian delegation had left for Geneva, headed by Vladimir Medinsky, an aide to President Vladimir Putin.
"This time, the idea is to discuss a broader range of issues, including, in fact, the main ones. The main issues concern both the territories and everything else related to the demands we have put forward," Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters.
He said military intelligence chief Igor Kostyukov would also take part in the talks and that Putin's special envoy, Kirill Dmitriev, would engage in a separate working group on economic issues.
Two earlier rounds of U.S.-backed talks in the United Arab Emirates led to a prisoner swap but no breakthrough toward a settlement. REUTERS

FBI won’t share Alex Pretti shooting evidence, Minnesota authorities say

Minnesota law enforcement authorities have said the FBI is refusing to share any evidence on its investigation into the death of Alex Pretti, the man killed by federal immigration authorities in late January.
Pretti was shot on 24 January by Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officials in Minneapolis during the Trump administration’s surge of immigration enforcement operations in the city. His killing came just two weeks after an immigration official shot and killed Renee Good and 10 days after the shooting of Julio C Sosa-Celis.
On Monday, Minnesota’s bureau of criminal apprehension (BCA), a state-level criminal investigative law enforcement agency, said the FBI had formally notified it that it would not share any information or evidence related to Pretti’s shooting.
The Minnesota governor, Tim Walz, has demanded an “impartial” investigation into the shootings in Minneapolis.
“Trump’s left hand cannot investigate his right hand,” he said on Monday in response to the FBI’s refusal to share evidence. “The families of the deceased deserve better.”
The BCA’s superintendent also expressed frustration.
“While this lack of cooperation is concerning and unprecedented, the BCA is committed to thorough, independent and transparent investigations of these incidents, even if hampered by a lack of access to key information and evidence,” added Drew Evans.
He added that the agency remained committed to a joint investigation and said it would “continue to pursue all legal avenues to gain access to relevant information and evidence”.
The FBI did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The agency has also previously refused to share any information related to the shootings of Good or Sosa-Celis, a lack of cooperation that led the BCA to stop its investigation into Good’s killing.
“As we’ve previously said, full access to evidence, witnesses and information is necessary to meet the investigative standard that Minnesota law and the public demands; without it, we cannot do so,” the BCA said back in January, after the FBI boxed it out of the investigation.
The Trump administration in December deployed federal officials to the Minneapolis area for an aggressive roundup of immigrants dubbed “Operation Metro Surge” that has seen a series of violent incidents as masked officials arrest people they claim to suspect lack proper residency documentation.
Democrats and Republicans have both called on independent investigations into the Minneapolis shootings.
Pretti, a nurse at the Department of Veterans Affairs, was observing immigration enforcement operations in Minneapolis when he was killed. Good was similarly an observer in Minneapolis, who was shot in her car by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officer. Homeland security officials initially accused Good, 37, of “weaponizing” her vehicle, but local officials have disputed those claims.
Both Pretti and Good were US citizens and video footage of their shootings has circulated widely, leading to mass protests.
Sosa-Celis was shot by an ICE official in the leg last month. Trump administration officials initially claimed Sosa-Celis and two other men had “ambushed” the ICE officer who then “fired a defensive shot to defend his life”. But last week two ICE officials were placed on leave while they are investigated for allegedly lying under oath about the interaction.

‘The whole state is still a tinderbox’: Victoria braces for extreme fire conditions

‘The whole state is still a tinderbox’: Victoria braces for extreme fire conditions
Emergency services are warning people to have their bushfire plan ready and to postpone activities involving heavy machinery, as extreme fire danger once again bears down on Victoria.
The temperature is set to reach 37 degrees in Melbourne on Tuesday, with wind gusts up to 60km/h and the risk of thunderstorms in central and western parts of the state.
Towns across Victoria will also feel the heat, with Mildura forecast to hit 37 degrees, Seymour, Bendigo and Wangaratta 35, Geelong and Bairnsdale 36 and Ballarat 32.
A total fire ban has been declared for the central (including Melbourne, Geelong and Ballarat), North Central, Southwest, West and South Gippsland and Wimmera fire districts, meaning no fire can be lit in the open air or allowed to remain alight on February 17.
Extreme fire danger is forecast in each of these areas, and also in Victoria’s north-east. There are currently no emergency warnings or advice messages active in the state, but authorities said any new fires that start will be difficult to fight.
“The concerns will very much be for the western parts of the state, in particular, down into western south Gippsland, where we still have a lot of grassland fire load in our landscape,” said Emergency Management Commissioner Tim Wiebusch in an update on Monday afternoon.
“The whole state is still a tinderbox in terms of the fuel types that are there, and so the concerns, particularly around the metropolitan area, would be in those north-western suburbs, all the way through the grasslands down towards Geelong.
“Please make sure you’ve downloaded the Vic emergency app. If you haven’t already, make sure you’ve set the watch zone for the area that you may be either living, working or holidaying during this period of time.”
The Bureau of Meteorology’s Morgan Pumpa said a cool change would not reach Melbourne until the late afternoon or evening, as a south-westerly wind change pushes an ocean breeze across Victoria.
“That’s in the east that we’ll see a little bit of cooler air … for the most part, everyone should just expect winds to be hot, and they’re going to be dry,” Pumpa said.
Thunderstorms were possible in a large swath of Victoria, stretching from Echuca-Moama to Mount Baw Baw to Traralgon, Pumpa said.
Parts of the state have not had meaningful rain for weeks, leaving abundant dry fuel despite major blazes already this season.
“We’re seeing very dry fuels across large parts of the state, and when that’s paired with low humidity, fires can start easily and spread quickly,” said Country Fire Authority Chief Officer Jason Heffernan.
“Days like [Tuesday] are about prevention. The safest choice is to postpone activities involving machinery and keep up to date with changing conditions.”
Speaking on 3AW radio Tuesday morning, Heffernan said firefighters were hopeful for some rain on Tuesday, but the long-range forecasts were bleak.
“So we could see a dry autumn and the beginning of winter,” he said.
The anticipated temperature spike has also prompted V/Line to implement extreme heat timetables on Tuesday.
On the Ararat, Ballarat, Geelong, Maryborough, Seymour, Shepparton and Warrnambool lines, trains that usually travel at up to 160km/h need to slow down to 90km/h or less because steel tracks expand in the heat.
The dangerous weather predicted follows a January during which fires burnt more than 400,000 hectares of Victoria.
One person was killed and nearly 1600 structures were damaged or destroyed after fires began in the first week of the year, and were then aggravated by extreme heat peaking on January 9.
A major bushfire in the Otways flared up later in the same month, prompting further evacuations and causing further property losses.
On Monday, Wiebusch said the Otways fire would hopefully be contained next week, while two enormous fires in Longwood and Walwa were only contained last Friday, six weeks after they ignited.
A gusty south-westerly wind change with some rain is set to move through parts of Victoria on Tuesday afternoon.

BHP analysis from the experts
Zavier Wong, Market Analyst at eToro says BHP's financial results send "a clear message" that the cash flow pressures felt by the mining giant in the past, have eased.
"The turnaround has been largely driven by copper. Prices surged 32% year on year, production guidance has been upgraded, and Escondida is delivering record throughput.
"BHP's pivot towards copper continues to gather pace, with the $US4.3 billion Wheaton streaming deal on Antamina silver a clever way to unlock capital without giving up any copper exposure. For a company that tried to buy Anglo American's copper assets not long ago, BHP is finding other ways to build its position.
"Iron ore remains the cash engine, but the headwinds haven't gone away. Chinese steel production has held around 1 billion tonnes for seven straight years, but that resilience is being propped up by strong exports and manufacturing rather than the property sector that traditionally drove demand. The question is how long that can last."

Day 2 of ACCC vs Coles beginning soon
The second day of what has been described as "the case of the century" gets underway at the Federal Court in Melbourne soon.
On day one, we heard mostly from the ACCC's legal counsel Garry Rich, who argued that the signature marketing strategy of Coles was misleading and deceptive.
The supermarket giant has used its "Down Down" campaign since 2010. It's where Coles slashes the price of a ticketed item.
But the ACCC alleged that the supermarket giant artificially inflated the price — sometimes only for a few days — before reducing it to a level that is actually higher than what it previously was.
We heard from John Sheahan from Coles' legal team, for the last hour or so on Monday.
Coles will argue that the steep price rises were completely justified during a time of high inflation and price volatility.
We're expecting him to continue presenting Coles's case when proceedings resume in front of Justice O'Bryan at 10:15am AEDT.
We will keep you posted with key updates from the Federal Court throughout the day.

Top 20 global companies' movements this year
Following on from the last piece by Reuters, here are some handy graphs that look at the movement of the top 20 global companies.
Firstly with each of their year-to-date change in market value, with more than half going backwards.
And where they are positioned based on market value, with US tech company Nvidia Corp up the top.
Words from BHP's CEO
BHP Chief Executive Officer, Mike Henry has put out a statement following BHP's latest results.
"We continue to prosecute our strategy of operational excellence, distinctive social value creation and growth in copper and potash. We have achieved 30% growth in copper production in the last four years, positioning us ahead of the strengthening copper market that we had anticipated.
"This half marks a milestone for BHP with Copper contributing the largest share of our overall earnings, at 51% of Underlying EBITDA.
"BHP is the world’s largest copper producer and with strong performance at Escondida, and solid contributions from our other operations in Chile and South Australia, we have increased FY26 group copper guidance to 1.9 – 2.0 Mt. This is allowing us to maximise increased earnings from the recent run up in copper prices as well as gold.
"With four compelling growth options across Chile, Argentina, Arizona and South Australia, we are well positioned to capture the forecast higher long term copper prices. We expect first production and revenue from the Jansen Stage 1 potash project in mid-CY27. Following completion of our definitive updated cost estimate, at our recent Operational Review we announced an increase in Jansen Stage 1 project expenditure to $US8.4 billion.
"Our Western Australia iron ore business continues to deliver for shareholders. WAIO achieved record first half production and shipments and we further strengthened our position as the world’s lowest cost major iron ore producer. We continue to invest in this business. We are adding a sixth rail car dumper at Port Hedland so trains can unload faster, supporting an uplift in sustainable volumes to >305 Mt.
"At a Group level, we again delivered a safe, reliable half, with resilient margins and cash flows that support disciplined investment and strong shareholder returns.
"Underlying EBITDA increased 25% to $US15.5 bn with an Underlying EBITDA margin of 58%. Underlying Attributable profit also increased by more than 20% to $US6.2 billion. Underlying ROCE increased by around 3 percentage points to circa 24%.
"Consistently strong cash generation and balance sheet strength remain hallmarks of BHP. We generated US$9.4 bn in operating cash and finished the half with net debt of $US14.7 billion, comfortably around the midpoint of our $US10–20 bn target range.
"We determined an interim dividend of US 73 cents per share, equivalent to a 60% payout ratio, reflecting strong operating performance, disciplined capital allocation and confidence in our outlook.
"Today, we announced the most valuable silver streaming agreement ever relating to our share of Antamina’s future silver production, which follows the agreement in December relating to our share of WAIO’s inland power consumption.

Big tech stocks lose billions as AI spending fears hit valuations
The world's most valuable technology stocks have suffered sharp declines in market value this year after years of outsized gains, as investors question whether heavy spending on AI will generate sufficient returns to justify the lofty valuations.
Microsoft shares have fallen about 17% year-to-date on concerns over risks to its AI business and growing competition from Google's latest Gemini model and Anthropic's Claude Cowork AI agent, wiping roughly $US613 billion off its market value to about $US2.98 trillion as of Friday.
Amazon has shed about 13.85% so far this year, erasing about $US343 billion in market value and leaving the company valued at roughly $US2.13 trillion.
Earlier this month, Amazon said it expected capital spending to jump more than 50% this year.
Nvidia, Apple and Alphabet have also seen their market values decline by $US89.67 billion, $US256.44 billion and $US87.96 billion, respectively, since the start of 2026, to $US4.44 trillion, $US3.76 trillion and $US3.7 trillion.
The pullback signals a broader shift in market psychology, with investors moving from rewarding long-term AI ambitions to demanding near-term earnings visibility after years of speculative enthusiasm.
By contrast, TSMC, Samsung Electronics and Walmart have added $US293.89 billion, $US272.88 billion and $US179.17 billion in market value, respectively, over the same period, lifting their valuations to $US1.58 trillion, $US817 billion and $US1.07 trillion.

Baby Bunting results
Baby Bunting has released its financial results for the half year ending December 29, 2025.
- Net Profit After Tax was $5 million, up 4.1% from $4.8 million in the period prior.
- Total Sales of $271.4 million, up 6.7% compared to the period prior, underpinned by strong comparable store sales growth of 4.7% – exceeding the group’s guidance range – and supported by the opening of five new stores.
- Gross Profit of $111.4 million was up 10% on 1H FY25, reflecting the benefit of annualised supplier trading terms and continued growth in the group’s private label and exclusive product ranges.
- Inventory closed at $107 million, reflecting an increase in average store inventory of 4%, and higher safety stock cover in core categories to support growth in exclusive products.
- Cost of doing business increased to $96.8 million, including significant items of $1.9 million relating to network optimisation and the relaunch of six Store of the Future refurbishments.
- Net Debt closed at $21.1 million, up from $9.1 million at 1H FY25. To support ongoing funding of the group’s growth strategy, the board has determined no dividend will be paid.
Baby Bunting's CEO, Mark Teperson says, "We’re pleased to have delivered another strong result, exceeding expectations across multiple metrics and demonstrating the ongoing momentum in our strategy.
"Our record revenue result was driven by growth in our customer base, the continued success of our Store of the Future program along with strong gross margin performance.
“Across nine refurbished stores, average sales in the half are up 25% since reopening, which is at the top end of our 15%-25% uplift target.
"We prioritised speed in our capex investment so stores scheduled for refurbishment would be opened and trading through key sales events. This is supporting stronger returns which continue to underpin our commitment to achieving a sub-three-year payback."
The first seven weeks of trade this year have seen +6.7% comparable sales growth.

Arizona officials may sue EPA over its rollback of greenhouse gas regulations: Report
At Friday morning press conference criticizing EPA’s decision, head of environmental protection unit in Arizona Attorney General’s Office says pursuing legal action among options considered
ISTANBUL
Environmental advocates warn that the Trump administration’s decision to halt regulation of greenhouse gas emissions could severely harm the US state of Arizona, a state already experiencing increasingly extreme heatwaves, local media reported on Monday.
While it remains uncertain how Arizona will respond, at least one elected official has not ruled out suing the federal government.
On Thursday, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Lee Zeldin announced that the agency’s 2009 endangerment finding had been terminated, according to Tucson Sentinel website.
The finding originated from a 2007 US Supreme Court ruling that affirmed the EPA’s authority to regulate greenhouse gases that endanger public health.
It has long served as the legal basis for emissions standards governing cars, airplanes, power plants, and other major sources of pollution.
US President Donald Trump’s move to scrap the finding aligns with his broader agenda to roll back climate regulations affecting the auto and fossil fuel industries.
During the 2024 campaign, Trump told fossil fuel executives he would eliminate environmental rules to increase their profits if they helped raise $1 billion for his presidential campaign.
Legal challenges are widely expected once the repeal is finalized, and Arizona could be among the states that file suit.
At a Friday morning press conference criticizing the EPA’s decision, Kirsten Engel, head of the environmental protection unit in the Arizona Attorney General’s Office, said pursuing legal action is one of several options being weighed.
She said Attorney General Kris Mayes considers eliminating the endangerment finding both unlawful and contrary to the EPA’s mission to protect public health.
“The attorney general opposes it and considers that every option that her office has is on the table in response,” she said.
The repeal of what had been a cornerstone of federal climate regulations has unsettled environmental advocates. Pita Juarez, Arizona field organizer for Moms Clean Air Force, which has 1.6 million members nationwide, including 28,000 in Arizona, called the decision reckless and cautioned that it would carry serious consequences.
“Our children and future generations will pay the price for this unprecedented attack on public health protections,” she said.
Juarez emphasized that Arizona is likely to be among the states most affected if greenhouse gas regulations are further weakened.
Despite Trump’s assertions that climate change is a hoax, decades of scientific research have concluded that greenhouse gas emissions are raising global temperatures and will continue to do so without major reductions.
The past four years have been the hottest ever recorded in the US, with Arizona particularly impacted.
In Phoenix, summer 2025 brought 113 consecutive days of triple-digit temperatures. Statewide, extreme heat contributed to or caused as many as 427 deaths last year.
Rep. Mariana Sandoval, whose district includes rural and agricultural communities, said farmworkers and other outdoor laborers cannot afford for the federal government to step back from addressing climate change.
She warned that placing workers who spend most of their time outdoors, including those harvesting crops, at greater risk would have wide-ranging consequences.
“Rescinding the endangerment clause is like taking all the road signs and the highway patrol off of the interstate,” Sandoval said.
“It puts everyone at risk.”
Sandoval, who has consistently advocated for stronger state-level heat mitigation policies with limited success in the Republican-controlled Legislature, said she is uncertain how Arizona can step in if federal protections are withdrawn.
With the legislative session nearly over, introducing new proposals is unlikely this year, but she plans to meet with the governor’s and attorney general’s offices to discuss possible strategies.
Last month, the state’s Workplace Heat Safety Task Force, established by Gov. Katie Hobbs, released recommendations aimed at improving worker protections as temperatures rise.
The proposals urge employers to provide water, shade, and rest breaks during periods of extreme heat.
However, critics and workers argue that the guidelines lack enforcement measures.
Sandoval agreed that worker protections need stronger enforcement to ensure compliance.
An advisory committee to the Arizona Division of Occupational Safety and Health is scheduled to take a final vote on the proposed rules on March 3.

UK government drops plans to delay May council votes, adding to pressure over U-turns
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
LONDON - British Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s government on Feb 16 abandoned plans to delay 30 local council elections due in May after being advised it could lose a legal challenge, piling fresh pressure on him after a series of policy U-turns.
Mr Starmer survived a leadership crisis last week the rise of Mr Nigel Farage’s populist Reform UK party
The government had permitted some councils to postpone their elections ahead of an upcoming reorganisation of local government, but political opponents had said that move was designed to minimise potential losses.
Days before the decision was due to be scrutinised in court, in a legal case brought by Reform UK, the government issued a statement abandoning its plans, citing legal advice.
Mr Steve Reed, the minister responsible for local government, said all elections would now go ahead as originally scheduled in May.
Around 4.5 million voters would have been affected by the postponements. Councils oversee services such as housing, social care and waste collection.
Starmer’s judgment in the spotlight
Since winning a landslide election victory in July 2024, Mr Starmer has struggled to implement his agenda and has had some important decisions challenged in court.
The government has reversed course on a number of big-ticket budget measures under pressure from voters, industry and from within Labour. Courts ruled last week that a decision to ban a pro-Palestinian group was unlawful.
Mr Starmer’s leadership came under threat last week over his decision to appoint Mr Peter Mandelson as US ambassador after new disclosures showed the depth of his ties to the late US sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.
The May elections could prove the next flashpoint for Labour figures who believe Mr Starmer should be replaced.
Political opponents seized on the latest U-turn.
“We took this Labour government to court and won,” Mr Farage wrote on X on Feb 16, describing the decision as a “victory for democracy”. Court papers showed his party argued the postponements constituted an abuse of power.
The leader of the opposition Conservative Party, Kemi Badenoch, said the move was “predictable chaos from a useless government that cannot make basic decisions.” REUTERS

Switzerland To Receive the SAMP/T Air Defense System in 2029 if It Declines the Patriot

SAMP/T air defense missile systems may enter service in Switzerland as early as 2029, becoming an alternative to American Patriot systems.
France came up with this initiative after Switzerland acknowledged that delivery times from the US had become unpredictable, according to NZZ.
The Swiss Ministry of Defense emphasizes that it currently has no reliable information about the terms and dates of arrival of the American systems.
The country has been without modern long-range ground coverage since 1999, when the British Bloodhound systems were decommissioned.
Although Swiss air defense during the Cold War was considered one of the most robust in Europe, today these capabilities have been lost, and plans to restore them are in jeopardy.
Defense Ministry spokesman Robert Scheidegger notes that the Swiss side is in an information vacuum regarding contracts with Washington. The US does not provide guarantees that orders will be fulfilled within the previously specified deadlines, which effectively paralyzes the country’s defense planning.
In this context, the French proposal regarding SAMP/T is seen as a real chance to close the “hole” in the sky much faster than the expected American deliveries.

The patience and the poker face: Iran’s wily diplomat set to face the US in nuclear talks
Unknown
Unknown Publisher

20:10:48 UTC
05:10:48 KST

If the US and Iran are to avoid a regional war, both sides need to start to make concessions at talks in Geneva on Tuesday, and also to accommodate one another’s very different bargaining styles.
The Iranian foreign minister Abbas Araghchi, steeped in almost 15 years of Iranian nuclear talks, is a near lifelong diplomat who has written a book on the art of negotiations that reveals the secrets of the Iranian diplomatic trade – the feints, the patience, the poker faces.
He has a bachelor’s degree from Iran’s faculty of international relations, a master’s degree in political science from Islamic Azad University and a doctorate in political thought from the University of Kent in the UK.
Donald Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff studied law at Hofstra, a university on Long Island near New York, before making his fortune in property development.
While Araghchi, much more a consensus figure inside Iranian politics than his famous predecessor Javad Zarif, will have gameplanned the parameters of what Iran can offer in endless consultations across the spectrum of government, including the supreme leader Ali Khamenei, Witkoff works to a shifting brief devised by one man.
Trump sees diplomacy as a branch of pro-wrestling. The Iranian foreign ministry regards it as a branch of chess, almost an art form.
Indeed, for those in the US who claim Iran loves to play for time and spin a negotiation out, Araghchi’s book, The Power of Negotiation, provides some support.
“The main principle of bargaining is practice: repetition, repetition, and repetition – combined with steadfastness and persistence. Insisting on positions and repeating demands is a necessity that must be done each time with different rhetoric and reasoning,” he writes.
Born into a family of merchants – his grandfather was a carpet trader – he argues Iranian diplomacy reflects the country’s bazaars.
“The Iranian negotiation style is generally known in the world as the ‘market style’, which means continuous and tireless bargaining. It requires a lot of time and energy, and he who gets tired and bored quickly will lose.”
More theoretically, he argues in the book – written when out of office in 2014 – that when a negotiator enters the room, their true power rests on the level of national cohesion back home and the country’s military strength.
If there is not at least a balance of power with your adversary, he argues it is best to decline talks until there is equilibrium, something Iran did after the bombing of its nuclear sites in June last year.
Nevertheless, the Iranian tendency to say “Yes, but” can go far. Famously, Araghchi reduced his US counterpart Wendy Sherman to tears of frustration – something he regrets.
Araghchi, who has already had six rounds of direct and indirect talks in two phases with Witkoff also discloses how vital it is to remain opaque.
“The face of a skilled diplomat is inscrutable, and it is impossible to catch any emotion from it. The ability to control the expression of emotions on the face is not easy and requires continuous work and practice.”
Providing your adversary with a graceful way out, he argues, is integral to diplomacy, describing this as providing “the Golden Bridge”, a term he has picked up from China (Araghchi spent four years as ambassador to Japan).
This suggests that if Trump ends up accepting a version of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal from which he walked out in 2018, Araghchi will not be triumphalist. “Diplomacy is not a game that you must necessarily win, but a process where you must necessarily understand the other side,” he writes.
Married twice, and with five children, Araghchi is a veteran of the Iran-Iraq war and maintains close relations with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps IRGC, unlike his predecessor, Zarif, who criticised the elite forces’ power.
“Araghchi is much more technocratic and careful in walking the tightrope necessary to survive,” said Ellie Geranmayeh from the European Council on Foreign Relations. “Zarif was more political and outspoken, and willing to test the boundaries of what was digestible for the regime.”
Indeed, some thought Araghchi was put in the nuclear talks with Washington by Iranian conservatives to act as a check and balance on Zarif.
Geranmayeh expects the US to make clear demands on diluting, or removing Iran’s stockpile of highly enriched uranium, but such an irreversible step by Iran would require parallel irreversible steps by the US, such as releasing many of Iran’s large assets frozen abroad.
The scope for a compromise on enrichment exists on the basis that the bombing of its nuclear sites makes it impossible to enrich for 3 to 5 years. But this would require the return of the UN nuclear inspectorate, the IAEA, to be able to visit the bombed sites, an issue that was probably at the centre of talks on Monday between Araghchi and Rafael Grossi, the IAEA director general.
Outside the nuclear aspects of the deal, Geranmayeh says: “In this Trumpian world, do not expect every agreement to be written down on paper. There could be a series of not verifiable understandings, including a non-aggression pact between Iran and the US and its allies.”
Ali Ansari, professor of modern history at the University of St Andrews, said Iran may offer concessions “to keep the discussions going, but Trump is in no rush at present anyway”.
Bringing in US oil companies – an economic concession that has been floated – would be a significant change in Iran’s anti-US revolutionary doctrine.
Either way, Araghchi knows that whatever the outcome, he faces domestic criticism.
Araghchi recalled once meeting with Zarif in the lift of Hassan Rouhani’s residence after the latter’s 2013 presidential election victory. At the time, Zarif had not yet accepted Rouhani’s offer to serve as his foreign minister. Araghchi asked him why. Zarif replied: ‘In the end, we’ll be found wanting, and we will be the victims.”

Man faces terrorism charges for plot against Taylor Swift’s Eras show
A 21-year-old man has been charged in Austria for allegedly planning an attack on a Taylor Swift concert scheduled for Vienna in 2024.
Prosecutors state the defendant declared allegiance to the Islamic State group, sharing propaganda and obtaining instructions to build a shrapnel bomb, of which he produced a small amount.
The man also reportedly made several attempts to illegally acquire and import weapons into Austria.
The suspect, identified by Austrian media as Beran A., was arrested in August 2024 and remains in custody.
Austrian authorities cancelled the planned concerts in August 2024 after the plot was foiled, with intelligence provided by the United States.

What we know about the IS-linked families who want to return to Australia
Unknown

05:08:52 KST

The question of whether — and how — to help the Australian families of Islamic State fighters return home has been one that governments have grappled with for years.
Despite pressure from aid agencies and some politicians in Australia, successive governments have been reluctant to facilitate their return.
Citing safety issues in and around the camps, and security concerns back home, Australia has made limited progress in clearing a passage for the Australian women and their children.
Now, these families are attempting to make their own way to the Syrian capital, Damascus, to begin the long journey home.
Who are they?
This group comprises 34 Australians, and local reports suggest there are 11 women and 23 children in the convoy.
Most — if not all — of the women were married to Islamic State group (IS) fighters who were captured or killed when Kurdish forces, backed by the United States, helped to defeat IS in 2019.
Some of the Australian children who have been detained in Syrian camps were brought there, but others were born in Syria.
The women are not currently accused of any crimes in Syria, but the Australian government says they will face close scrutiny from police and intelligence agencies if they return.
Where have they been living?
Australian families of IS fighters are known to have lived in two camps in north-eastern Syria, Al-Hawl and Al-Roj.
The UN says most of the people in the larger Al-Hawl camp, which was captured by advancing Syrian forces, have now left and that Syria plans to relocate those who remain.
It's not clear if any Australians still live in Al-Hawl.
The women and children now trying to leave Syria have been living in Al-Roj camp, which is still controlled by the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF)
It is home to more than 2,000 people of dozens of nationalities.
Amnesty International says the conditions in the camp are dangerous, with inadequate access to food, water and health care.
How many Australians have already left?
In 2019, the Morrison government — working with an aid agency — completed the repatriation of eight Australian orphans from Syrian camps, including the children of Islamic State fighter Khaled Sharrouf.
At the time, Mr Morrison said it was "despicable" that their parents had put them in harm's way.
"However, children should not be punished for the crimes of their parents," he said.
"Repatriating these children was not a decision the Australian government made lightly.
"As I have said repeatedly, my government would not allow any Australian to be put at risk."
In 2022, the Australian government repatriated four Australian women and their 13 children from a Syrian camp.
Then-home affairs minister Clare O'Neil said the government sought intelligence advice prior to that operation.
"The decision to repatriate these women and their children was informed by individual assessments following detailed work by national security agencies," she said in 2022.
Last year, six women and children escaped Syria without Australian government assistance and made it to Beirut, where they were issued Australian passports.
They have since returned to Australia.
Will the government help this group home?
In a statement issued late on Monday, a government spokesperson said it "will not repatriate people from Syria".
"People in this cohort need to know that if they have committed a crime and if they return to Australia they will be met with the full force of the law,"it said.
That aligns with Foreign Minister Penny Wong's evidence to a Senate estimates hearing last week, when she said no repatriation operations were being planned.
However, she also anticipated some of the Australians in Syria would try to make their own way back, without the government helping to coordinate logistics.
"Australians in these situations may seek to return, in what we've described as a self-managed return," she told a Senate estimates hearing.
When Liberal senator Sarah Henderson asked her to guarantee no "ISIS brides" would be granted passports, she said Australia had certain obligations.
"Australian citizens have various entitlements which are not discretionary under law and no government is able to make them discretionary," Senator Wong said.
However, she said the government had the option of applying temporary exclusion orders (TEOs) to people returning from Syria.
TEOs allow the government to block Australians aged 14 and above from entering Australia without a permit if they are deemed to be a national security threat.
The minister for home affairs can apply conditions to such permits, like requiring the subjects to notify authorities about their movements and communications.
"Our first priority is to keep the Australian community safe," Senator Wong said.
Who is helping the Australians try to leave?
It is not clear who is coordinating the extraction efforts on the ground, or who will fund the group's transport to Australia once they reach Damascus.
Save the Children has long campaigned for the Australian government to repatriate the families from Syria.
In 2023, it took the Albanese government to the Federal Court on behalf of 20 children and 11 women who wanted to come to Australia.
That case was unsuccessful and, in 2024, the High Court refused the charity special leave to appeal.
Despite its long-term advocacy, Save the Children says it hasn't been involved in any operation to extract the Australians.
"Save the Children does not fund or conduct repatriations, nor do we ever intend to play such a role," CEO Matt Tinkler said.
"These reports, if true, underscore what national security experts have repeatedly said: that the unmanaged return of Australian citizens would inevitably happen in the absence of federal government action to repatriate them."
He said Australians should never be left without a safe or viable way home.
"These innocent children have already lost years of their childhood, and deserve the chance to rebuild their lives in safety at home, and to reintegrate into the Australian way of life."

Robert Duvall, Oscar-winning actor and star of The Godfather, dies aged 95
The legendary US actor was nominated for seven Oscars and won for his role as a washed-up country singer in Tender Mercies.
Oscar-winning actor Robert Duvall, best known for his work in The Godfather and Apocalypse Now, has died aged 95, his wife has announced in a Facebook post.
“For each of his many roles, Bob gave everything to his characters and to the truth of the human spirit they represented,” Luciana Duvall said in a statement on Monday.
Duvall was best known for playing forceful roles such as his depiction of Tom Hagen, consigliere to the Corleone Mafia family in The Godfather.
He also played Lieutenant Colonel Bull Meechum in The Great Santini and the title character in Stalin, as well as broken-down and fallen characters in Tender Mercies and The Apostle.
Tributes have poured in for the Hollywood great. Former co-star Adam Sandler said Duvall was “one of the greatest actors we have ever had”, whilst Sopranos star Michael Imperioli paid tribute to “one of the best ever”, who was “an actor’s actor”.
Duvall, the son of a US Navy admiral and an amateur actress, grew up in Annapolis, Maryland in the United States. After graduating from Principia College in Illinois and serving in the US Army, he moved to New York City, where he roomed with Dustin Hoffman and befriended Gene Hackman when the three were struggling acting students.
After working on a variety of television shows, Duvall made a strong impression in his first forays onto the big screen, such as his first movie part as the mysterious recluse Boo Radley in To Kill a Mockingbird.
Duvall got the part at the suggestion of the film’s screenwriter, Horton Foote, who had liked Duvall’s work in one of his plays. Foote later wrote Tender Mercies, a 1983 film for which Duvall won the Academy Award for best actor as a washed-up country singer.
Duvall was nominated for another six Oscars, including for his work in Frances Ford Coppola’s 1979 Vietnam epic Apocalypse Now. Duvall played the off-kilter, surfing-obsessed Lieutenant Colonel Bill Kilgore.

In all, Duvall appeared in almost 100 movies. And when he grew weary of Hollywood, he made his own films. He wrote, directed and won an Oscar acting nomination for The Apostle, the story of a conflicted preacher.
Duvall did the same with Assassination Tango, a movie that allowed him to exhibit his passion for the tango and Argentina, where he met his fourth wife, Luciana Pedraza.
In later life, Duvall split his time between Los Angeles, Argentina and a farm in Virginia, where he converted the barn into a tango dance hall.

TBILISI, February 16. /TASS/. Representatives of the Georgian government and opposition are holding the first-ever televised debates on the country’s potential membership in the European Union.
The debates, aired live by the Rustavi 2 television channel, were initiated by Vakhtang Shakarisjvili, leader of the United Neutral Georgia party, which claims that European integration presents a danger to the nation. The party insists that there will be no peace inside the country until it drops the idea of joining the European Union and NATO.
The ruling Georgian Dream - Democratic Georgia party is represented by leader of its parliamentary faction Irakli Kirtskhalia. The ruling party insists that the course toward European and Euro-Atlantic integration is committed to paper in the country’s constitution and cannot be revised.
Taking part in the debates are also Georgy Khaindrava, a film director and former minister of state for conflict settlement, German Sabo of the Girchi opposition party, Guram Macharashvili, a lawmaker with the opposition People’s Power party, and other politicians.
Georgia’s constitution of 2017 has a provision on the need for taking all necessary measures to ensure the country’s full-fledged integration into the European Union and NATO.

Tehan still waiting to hear about shadow frontbench role
Angus Taylor is expected to reward factional allies when he unveils his shadow frontbench in the coming days.
Liberal MP Dan Tehan doesn't know if he's made the cut or what role he might be taking on.
"Obviously these decisions are rightly up to Angus ... I'm looking forward to being part of the team wherever he sees fit to place me," he told Sky News.
Tehan, who put his hand up in the contest for the deputy leadership last Friday, was also asked about the leaked Liberal proposal to ban people coming to Australia from terror-declared areas.
He said he hadn't seen the policy.
"But there were definitely parts of it which I think we would normally consider, including the reduction in net overseas migration. Putting a number to that was something we took to the last election. Making sure we can deal with those people who are overstaying their visas and using our court system to try and prolong their stay here."
He said that if "anyone sees the actual draft" policy he's sure that the Liberals would take a look.
"Like we would everywhere else to make sure we're taking the very best ideas to deal with what we've said all along is too much immigration," Tehan said.
Angus Taylor bets on migration politics amid a global rightward shift
The Liberal Party is searching for its centre of gravity. In the process, it has rediscovered an old anchor — migration.
Angus Taylor said the door should be shut to those who did not accept "Australian values". Tony Abbott argued past immigration settings better protected social cohesion.
The message is clear — national identity is back at the centre of conservative politics.

PM doesn't rule out changes to capital gains tax discount
Anthony Albanese won't be drawn on whether the government is considering scaling back the capital gains tax discount.
The CGT concession has been flagged for potential changes ahead of the budget in May.
Speaking with ABC's News Breakfast, the prime minister said he wasn't going to give any hints on the morning show.
"I'm not here to announce what might or might not be in the budget because those deliberations take place every year," he said.
"What we're focused on is income tax cuts."
'If you make your bed, you lie in it': PM's blunt message to Australians with IS links in Syria
Anthony Albanese has invoked his mother as he rationalised why the government would not provide support to Australian families with links to IS fighters trying to return home from Syria.
The group of 34 women and children were forced to turn around after leaving a camp in Syria to try to begin their journey home to Australia.
"My mother would have said, 'If you make your bed, you lie in it'. These are people who went overseas … and went there to provide support for people who basically want a caliphate," he told ABC's News Breakfast.
He agreed it was unfortunate for the children involved.
"We have a very firm view that we won't be providing assistance or repatriation," he said.
"We want to make it clear, as we have to the people involved, if there are any breaches of the law then they will face the full force of the Australian law."
Stop Australians returning from Syria: Henderson
Liberal senator Sarah Henderson has called on the federal government to block Australian citizens returning home if they have "subscribed to ISIS ideology."
The ABC has been told that 11 families (34 women and children) left the Al-Roj camp in north-eastern Syria on Monday morning, local time. They were then forced to return because Syrian authorities would not allow them to continue their journey.
The women are believed to be the partners of jailed or killed members of ISIS. Speaking on ABC's Radio National Breakfast, Henderson raised concerns about the group
"The most important task of any government is to keep Australians safe. If these are people who subscribed to ISIS ideology, who subscribed to this extremist ideology, they should not be returning to Australia," she said.
"The government has a number of options before it.
"They can make security assessments, they can impose temporary exclusion orders … we need to ensure these adults do not pose a threat to Australia."
In a statement, the federal government said it would not repatriate people from Syria.
Thanks, Jeff!

LoadingAlbanese insists he won't be complacent despite struggling opposition
Anthony Albanese has hit the radio airwaves this morning, where he discussed everything from the social media ban and the cost of living to the Liberal leadership drama.
The prime minister reiterated that he didn't feel the opposition gave ousted leader Sussan Ley "a crack".
But as opinion polls suggest Labor's on track for another election win in 2028, Albanese said the government was "not complacent".
"My job is to provide stable, orderly government and to get stuff done," he said, pointing to his cost-of-living measures.
Asked about One Nation's surge in support off the back of its hardline immigration stance, the PM said migration reduced by 40 per cent last year.
"When the former government were in office their projection for what the population would be in 2030 were some 754,000, to be precise, higher than what ours are now," he said.
For those wondering what song was played leading into PM's interview, it was Joy Division's Love Will Tear Us Apart.
And no he wasn't wearing the T-shirt that Ley attacked him for wearing (we know because he told us).
"No-one was more shocked than me that that became a controversy," he said.
Barnaby Joyce open to recontesting his seat in lower house
One Nation MP Barnaby Joyce says he's reconsidering his decision not to contest his seat at the next election.
When he left the Nationals late last year, Joyce said he wouldn't run for the seat of New England and would instead run for the Senate.
But speaking to Channel Nine this morning, Joyce said he might change his mind, now that he's with a different party.
"If it becomes apparent that [One Nation's] got a number of seats we're going to win in the lower house, then yes, of course, you're going to have to have someone with experience there to do the very best job we can," he said.
"But that is not a conversation we have now, that's a conversation for down the track".
Leaked migration proposal doesn't reflect actual policy: Sharma
Liberal MPs are continuing to distance themselves from a leaked proposal to ban people coming to Australia from terror-declared areas, such as Gaza and Somalia.
The migration policy was drafted within Sussan Ley's office but was not signed off by shadow cabinet prior to the leadership spill that installed Angus Taylor.
Speaking with Nine, senator Dave Sharma said the leaked proposal did not reflect the party's policy.
"I cannot say that what I've seen in the newspapers today actually reflects our policy. It doesn't reflect what I know of our policy," he said.
"I mean, I'm not in the shadow cabinet, but as far as I'm aware, our policy is not going to single out any particular region or group of people."
Labor won't assist return of Australian families with links to IS fighters
Australian families with links to Islamic State fighters have been forced to turn around after leaving a camp in Syria to try to begin their journey home to Australia.
The ABC has been told that 11 families, with 34 women and children in total, left the Al-Roj camp in north-eastern Syria on Monday morning, local time.
Labor frontbencher Amanda Rishworth said the government would not be assisting the families in their return.
"They made a choice to go to Syria. We won't be repatriating them from Syria. Of course as Australian citizens under the law they are able to make their way back," she told Nine.
Australian authorities were monitoring the situation, she said. When asked if she was comfortable with not assisting the children in the group, she repeated Labor wouldn't be offering help.
Liberal senator Dave Sharma, who was also on the morning television panel, said he'd like to see assurances before the families returned to Australia.
"I think the Australian people deserve to know exactly what those assurances are, what monitoring is being put in place, what vetting is being done, what are our intelligence agencies doing about this?" he said.
Taylor distances himself from Ley immigration policy
Opposition Leader Angus Taylor has denied knowledge of an immigration policy that was looking to ban people coming to Australia from terror-declared areas.
The policy developed under former leader Sussan Ley was reported by some media to bar entry to people from parts of Gaza, Somalia and the Philippines.
Taylor denied any knowledge on 7.30 and said that after Ley lost the leadership in a Friday spill motion it was not valid anyway.
"That document, which I haven't actually seen, has no validity," Taylor said.
"It didn't go through shadow cabinet or the leadership and as I understand it, it wasn't seen by the relevant immigration shadows.
"Frankly, I don't know what the document is, I don't know where it's come from and I don't know what's in it."

US military airlifts a nuclear reactor across three states after Trump pushes for more of the energy source
The ‘next-generation’ reactor could potentially power up to 5,000 homes, the Pentagon announced
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
The U.S. military has successfully transported a small nuclear reactor by air, advancing the Trump administration’s plan to deploy the energy source across the nation.
The “next-generation” Valar Atomics Ward 250 nuclear reactor — comparable in size to a large truck — was loaded onto a C-17 transport plane at the March Air Reserve Base in California on Sunday.
It was then flown about 700 miles to the Hill Air Force Base in Utah. It will eventually be sent to an energy lab in the state for evaluation and testing, the Pentagon announced.
The compact, 5-megawatt reactor could potentially power up to 5,000 homes or ensure reliable and secure energy for a military base.
The reactor’s flight aligns with President Donald Trump's plan to modernize America's nuclear power infrastructure — a goal bolstered by a series of executive orders he signed in May.
“It is the policy of the United States to expedite and promote to the fullest possible extent the production and operation of nuclear energy to provide affordable, reliable, safe, and secure energy to the American people,” one of the orders states.
Michael Duffy, the undersecretary of defense for acquisition and sustainment, lauded the operation — which was jointly carried out by the Defense and Energy Departments.
“Powering next generation warfare will require us to move faster than our adversaries, to build a system that doesn't just equip our warfighters to fight, but equips them to win at extraordinary speed,” Duffey said. “Today is a monumental step toward building that system. By supporting the industrial base and its capacity to innovate, we accelerate the delivery of resilient power to where it's needed.”
Secretary of Energy Chris Wright added that the administration’s goal is to have a trio of small reactors online by July 4.
"The American nuclear renaissance is to get that ball moving again, fast, carefully, but with private capital, American innovation and determination," Wright said.
Currently, there are 94 operable nuclear reactors in the U.S., which generate about 20 percent of the country’s electricity, according to the World Nuclear Association.
Polls show that the American public is broadly on board with nuclear power in spite of several major accidents throughout the past decades.
According to a Gallup survey conducted last year, 61 percent of Americans favor using nuclear energy, marking a near-record high. Republicans were significantly more likely to support nuclear energy than Democrats.

Pro-Assad singer killed in shootout with Syrian security forces

Syrian singer Jamal Assaf, a staunch supporter of ousted president Bashar Assad who was known for praising his forces and was sometimes referred to as “Assad’s singer,” was killed over the weekend in an exchange of fire with security forces of Syria’s new government led by Ahmad al-Sharaa.
After reports of Assaf’s death circulated overnight between Saturday and Sunday, Syria’s Interior Ministry issued an official statement Sunday afternoon saying Assaf was part of a smuggling network targeted by government forces and was killed during the operation.
According to authorities in Damascus, internal security forces had been tracking the smuggling ring and launched a raid at a location in the al-Fardous neighborhood of Aleppo where one of its members was believed to be staying. That individual was later identified as Assaf.
The Interior Ministry said that during the raid, the wanted suspect opened fire on security forces, who returned fire at the source of the shooting and “neutralized” him. One member of the Syrian security forces was seriously wounded in the operation.
During Assad’s rule, Assaf gained prominence for inflammatory rhetoric against the former president’s opponents. He publicly called for the use of military force against cities where rebels were active and urged attacks on Idlib, a major rebel stronghold in northwestern Syria, including the use of so-called barrel bombs, improvised explosives dropped from aircraft that became a hallmark of the conflict.
According to SyriaTV, Assaf on several occasions boasted that he had taken part in fighting alongside Assad’s forces. The channel cited two of his songs, “Your Revolution Is a Revolution of Thugs” and “Idlib Will Pay the Price,” as examples of his pro-government messaging.
Some reports said that after Assad’s government fell, Assaf attempted to portray himself as having changed his position and claimed to support the uprising that led to Assad’s removal, though few appeared convinced by the shift.

India seizes three Iran-linked US-sanctioned tankers
India has seized three US-sanctioned oil tankers linked to Iran this month and stepped up surveillance in its maritime zone to curb illicit trade, Reuters news agency reported on Monday, confirming a post on X by Indian authorities earlier in February that had been deleted.
India aims to prevent its waters from being used for ship-to-ship transfers that obscure the origin of oil cargoes, Reuters reports, citing a source with direct knowledge of the matter.
The seizures and heightened surveillance follow an improvement in US-India relations. Washington earlier this month announced it will cut import tariffs on Indian goods to 18% from 50%, after New Delhi agreed to stop Russian oil imports.
The three sanctioned vessels - Stellar Ruby, Asphalt Star and Al Jafzia - frequently changed their identities to evade law enforcement by coastal states, the source said, adding that their owners were based overseas.
VESSELS SEIZED OFFSHORE MUMBAI
Iranian state media cited the National Iranian Oil Company as saying that the three tankers seized by India had no connection to the company. It said that neither the cargoes nor the vessels were linked to the company.
Indian authorities had said in a post on X on February 6 that they intercepted three vessels about 100 nautical miles west of Mumbai after detecting suspicious activity involving a tanker in India's exclusive economic zone.
The post was later deleted, but the source confirmed that the vessels had been escorted to Mumbai for further investigation.
The Indian Coast Guard has since deployed about 55 ships and between 10 and 12 aircraft for round-the-clock surveillance in its maritime zones, according to the source.
The U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control said last year it had sanctioned three vessels, called Global Peace, Chil 1, and Glory Star 1, with IMO numbers identical to the ships lately captured by India.
Two of the three tankers are linked to Iran, with Al Jafzia having carried fuel oil from Iran to Djibouti in 2025 and Stellar Ruby flagged in Iran, according to LSEG data.
The Asphalt Star mostly operated on voyages around China, the data show.
Sanctioned oil and fuel are often sold at deep discounts due to the risks involved, with intermediaries moving cargo through complex ownership structures, false documentation and mid-sea transfers that complicate enforcement.

Remains of legendary ‘guerrilla priest’ identified decades later
The search unit used public and classified records to locate his remains
- Bookmark

The Colombian state entity tasked with finding and identifying more than 135,000 people who have disappeared during the country's six decades of civil conflict announced on Monday the identification of Camilo Torres' remains.
Torres was a Catholic priest famous for his membership in the National Liberation Army (ELN) rebel group and was killed in combat in the 1960s.
The Search Unit for Disappeared People (UBPD) was created by a 2016 peace deal between the government and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) guerrilla group.
Its role is to take charge of archival and forensic efforts to find disappeared people, including those forcibly disappeared by right-wing paramilitaries, rebel groups and state security forces, those forced to join armed groups, soldiers missing in action and others.
The ELN, founded in 1964, remains active and is itself accused of forced disappearances.
It has held sporadic peace talks with various governments and said in December it was willing to resume negotiations.
Torres, son of a well-connected Bogota family, was an adherent of liberation theology, a Catholic, anti-imperialist social justice movement.
He joined the ELN some four months before his death and was killed in February 1966 in eastern Santander province in a skirmish with the army.
UBPD Director Luz Janeth Forero told journalists the search unit used public and classified records, including from the military justice system, to find where Torres' remains had been interred by the military after his death.
DNA samples from bones found in 2024 in the military section of a cemetery in Bucaramanga were compared with a sample taken from the remains of Torres' father Calisto, which were exhumed for testing from a cemetery in Bogota.
"After 60 years of disappearance, the search unit found, identified and completed a dignified handover of Father Camilo Torres," Forero said.
The unit, which began work in 2017, has found nearly 5,000 remains, identifying and handing over some 700 to loved ones so far, Forero added. It has also found 500 living people who were reported as disappeared.
Torres' remains were handed over to Javier Giraldo, a Catholic priest well-known for his activism on behalf of conflict victims, on Sunday, the 60th anniversary of Torres' death, Forero said.
Giraldo, who recognised the efforts of Torres' mother Isabel Restrepo to find her son while she was alive, said Torres will be buried at Bogota's National University, where he studied and worked as a chaplain.
Though the Catholic Church has historically rejected Torres' involvement with the ELN, there is now more openness to discussing his legacy as a chaplain, activist and social justice thinker, Giraldo added.

‘A European Moment:’ E.U. Leaders Push Back Against U.S. ‘Civilizational Erasure’ Claim
Unknown

E.U. leaders are pushing for increased European sovereignty in the midst of frayed relations with the United States.
“We want to cut through knots, we want to find solutions always with the goal of strengthening Europe's sovereignty and making Europe strong. This is a very European moment,” said German Finance Minister Lars Klingbeil on Monday.
“I believe what happened at the beginning of the year with Greenland, woke up everyone who cares about Europe, and it is leading to the fact that we are not getting bogged down in national interests or hiding behind them, but ready to make compromises," he continued, referencing President Donald Trump’s push to acquire Greenland, which saw him briefly threaten to tariff European countries who opposed his efforts.
Klingbeil made the comments before a meeting of E.U. finance ministers in Brussels, according to Reuters.
His encouragement towards Europe’s self-reliance comes after Kaja Kallas, the European Commission's high representative for foreign affairs, hit back at remarks made by the U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio at the Munich Security Conference over the weekend.
In her own address on Sunday, Kallas told the audience: “Contrary to what some may say—woke, decadent Europe is not facing civilizational erasure.”
“In fact, people still want to join our club. And not just fellow Europeans. When I was in Canada last year I was told that over 40% of Canadians have an interest in joining the E.U.,” she claimed. “The waiting list is getting long. I just hope those who have been waiting for quite some time would not have to wait for longer.”
“Those who are already members want their union to take a stronger role in the world: To defend our values. To take care of our people. To push humanity forwards,” she said, later adding that “European bashing” is currently “very in fashion.”
Kallas’ remarks appeared to be in response to Rubio’s speech from the day before, during which he said the U.S. will always be “a child of Europe,” but also issued a warning about perceived incoming threats.
He claimed that “acting together” will “restore to us a clearer sense of ourselves. It will restore a place in the world, and in so doing, it will rebuke and deter the forces of civilizational erasure that today menace both America and Europe alike.”
The notion of “civilizational erasure” in Europe was also put forward in a U.S. national security strategy report in November, which claimed that policy decisions, including those on migration, from E.U. nations was having a detrimental impact.
European policies are “creating strife, censorship of free speech and suppression of political opposition, cratering birthrates, and loss of national identities and self-confidence,” the report claimed.
In Munich, although Rubio offered a more conciliatory tone in comparison to Vice President J.D. Vance’s speech from last year’s conference, he repeatedly warned of the dangers of “mass migration” and said “we must gain control of our national borders.”
“If at times we disagree, our disagreements come from our profound sense of concern about a Europe with which we are connected—not just economically, not just militarily. We are connected spiritually and we are connected culturally. We want Europe to be strong,” said Rubio, encouraging a united approach moving forward.
European leaders, meanwhile, expressed concern over transatlantic relations throughout the conference.
Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen expressed her belief that Trump’s interest in Greenland “is not over.”
“Unfortunately I think the desire is the same… I would also add that I think the pressure on Greenland is totally unacceptable. We are talking about threats, but the people of Greenland have never been threatened before by anyone,” she said, maintaining that there are “red lines that will not be crossed,” with a solution still being discussed.
Prior to Rubio’s speech, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz warned of a “deep rift” between the U.S. and Europe.
Merz argued that the U.S. “will not be powerful enough to go it alone” in the future and urged everyone to “repair and revive transatlantic trust together.”
Referencing Vance’s address from last year’s conference, in which the Vice President targeted Europe’s idea of free speech, Merz told the Munich audience: “The culture war of the MAGA movement is not ours… Freedom of speech ends here with us when that speech goes against human dignity and the constitution. We do not believe in tariffs and protectionism, but in free trade.”

In the wake of the Munich Security Conference, we ask: what happens now? With Russia’s war on Ukraine still raging, do the grand words of Munich mean anything to those struggling to feed themselves, stay warm, or survive under Vladimir Putin’s ongoing missile and drone attacks?
On European security, tensions are rising. Germany is pressing France to increase its defence spending, with Foreign Minister Johan Wadephul essentially telling Emmanuel Macron to put his money where his mouth is. But with France facing a massive public debt crisis, finding the 5% of GDP required for NATO commitments is far from simple.
Meanwhile, US Senator Marco Rubio is visiting Budapest, delivering a message of support from President Trump to his ally Viktor Orbán — Europe’s most outspoken admirer of Putin. Rubio’s words at Munich suggested conciliation, but standing side by side with Orbán raises questions: is the gap between the US and the EU widening, just when unity is needed most for Ukraine?

NHS ’clearly failing’ to ensure children get measles vaccine, experts warn

Children are at risk of measles because the NHS is “clearly failing” to ensure they get the MMR vaccine and its system needs an urgent overhaul, MPs and health experts have warned.
Calls are growing for major reform of how MMR jabs are delivered as it emerged that vaccination rates in some parts of England are now on a par with those in Afghanistan and Malawi.
More outbreaks of measles like the one in north London are inevitable, public health specialists believe, given that fewer than 60% of five-year-olds in some places have had both the recommended doses of MMR.
In Enfield, where 60 children have recently contracted measles, of whom 15 have been hospitalised, the MMR vaccination rate is only 64.3%. That is lower than the 69.3% rate in Malawi and just above Afghanistan’s 62% rate. The World Health Organization advises a 95% rate.
The outbreak in Enfield has reignited public and medical anxiety about unvaccinated children getting measles, which can damage the brain and lungs and in some cases lead to meningitis, blindness or even death. Five “catch-up clinics” have been set up in local community centres to vaccinate children who got either one or no doses of MMR when it was offered to their parents.
NHS England has been accused of displaying “complacency” for its failure to halt a relentless decline over the last decade in the number of five-year-old children who are fully vaccinated, from 88.2% to 83.7%.
Ministers are under pressure to let pharmacies start administering MMR jabs to infants so that they can supplement the immunisation programmes that GP surgeries and schools already run.
In England, GP staff, mainly practice nurses, deliver the first and second doses of MMR to children when they are 12 and 18 months old. Schools also play a key role by hosting catch-up events at which unvaccinated and under-vaccinated pupils can get covered.
Ben Coleman, a Labour MP on the Commons health and social care select committee, said: “The long-term decline in uptake of MMR and growing number of very worrying measles outbreaks, like the one in Enfield just now, show that that system is clearly failing.
“That means that children are at risk of hospitalisation and even of dying from measles. Given that undervaccination poses real risks to public health, it’s time for the NHS to accept that GPs and schools on their own appear not to be able to provide the 95% coverage the WHO rightly insists on. Pharmacies are somewhere families often visit and they’re being wasted as a resource. We can’t afford complacency.”
A child died of measles last summer in Alder Hey children’s hospital in Liverpool amid an increase in cases in the city.
The Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, which represents specialist children’s doctors, said pharmacies should be handed a role in offering vaccines. Prof Steve Turner, its president, said the change would help “make it faster and easier for parents and guardians to get their children vaccinated”.
He said: “With appropriate training and support, enabling pharmacists to deliver MMR vaccines could be particularly helpful for families who have missed routine appointments or need to catch up on their children’s vaccinations.”
The National Pharmacy Association also backed the call. “The decade-long reduction in uptake of MMR vaccinations among children is a sign that the current system is simply not working and needs urgent reviewing by the NHS,” said Olivier Picard, the trade body’s chair. “We need to work across the whole health service to perform this vital public health role, not leave it to one small part of it.”
Helen Bedford, a vaccination expert and professor of child health at University College London, said pharmacies could help supplement existing NHS efforts to ensure better MMR uptake, especially as some schools – including some faith schools – do not take part in catch-up campaigns.
“That may be because of disruption to studies or that they don’t see it as a priority. Or it may be about [their] views about vaccination generally,” she said.
Coleman said MPs on the health committee sensed “complacency” among NHS bosses over falling MMR take-up when they gave evidence last week about trends in vaccination.
At the hearing, Dr Mary Ramsay, the UK Health Security Agency’s director of public health programmes, admitted under questioning by Coleman that opposition among GPs to pharmacies being paid to perform a role currently undertaken by family doctors made that change difficult.
The MP asked: “GPs might be annoyed if pharmacies can do it?” Ramsay replied: “That is an element.”
The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) did not indicate if pharmacies might start delivering MMR jabs. Superdrug has said it would start providing MMR jabs if asked.
Prof Andrew Pollard, the director of the Oxford Vaccine Group at Oxford University, said of the Enfield outbreak there was “a real risk of further spread both locally and in other parts of London”, since the virus could easily spread in communities where less than 95% of people were vaccinated, as is the case in many parts of London.
“When ‘enough’ people have been infected, the outbreak will die down, only to return again later when more unvaccinated children are born and the number who are susceptible has re-accumulated; there will be another explosive outbreak,” he said.
A spokesperson for the DHSC said: “It is vital for anyone not yet vaccinated against MMR to do so as soon as possible. Not only does this ensure that you are protected, but also those around you.
“To improve uptake and provide earlier protection against measles, from January children can have their second dose of MMR sooner. We’ve also introduced chickenpox protection into the childhood programme with the MMRV vaccine.
“Low vaccination rates leave communities vulnerable, and we are taking urgent action with partners across London to boost MMR uptake and safeguard children’s health.”
The government launched a campaign on Monday encouraging parents to ensure their children were up to date with all their vaccinations. It said childhood immunisations prevent about 5,000 deaths and 228,000 hospitalisations each year in England alone.

Morocco, Albania, Greece expected to join International Stabilization Force in Gaza

Morocco and Albania will join the International Stabilization Force (ISF) in Gaza, which will handle aspects of peacekeeping in Gaza during the Trump administration's Phase II of the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, The Jerusalem Post has learned.
In addition, KAN News reported on Monday night that Greece will also join the ISF.
The leaks and public announcements have been timed to coincide with Sunday's announcement that Indonesia will be the first country to join the ISF mission, and ahead of the Board of Peace summit, which is set to take place in the United States on Thursday.
On Sunday, the Associated Press additionally reported that Indonesia's contribution to the ISF will begin in April, with a primary deployment of Indonesian forces targeted for June.
The same report set the number of Indonesian soldiers to be deployed in April at 1,000 and the full June force at around 8,000, which is higher than some earlier figures the media had speculated about.
There is still no specific information on the timing of deployments for the three additional countries, but by mid-January, reports indicated that Morocco would join Indonesia as the two largest peacekeeping forces.
Morocco has maintained special defense relations with Israel since signing the Abraham Accords in 2020.
Indonesia selecting ISF soldiers
According to the AP report, aspects of Indonesia's process for selecting and clearing soldiers to join the force are underway.
However, Indonesia also said that if conditions in Gaza were not suitable for deployment when it comes to any possible conflict with Hamas, the force might postpone travel to Gaza.
In previous months, Indonesia was mentioned as a possible contributing country to the ISF, along with the United Arab Emirates, Morocco, Egypt, Italy, Azerbaijan, Pakistan, Qatar, Turkey, and others, but to date, no country has progressed past general promises to concrete readiness to send troops.
Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto will be visiting Washington for Trump's Board of Peace summit on February 19.
Neither the ISF in general, nor Indonesia in particular, is expected to seek direct confrontation with Hamas or to proactively disarm them.
Rather, they are expected to supervise current ceasefire lines and possibly handle other border-related issues.

Pentagon faces backlash after using AI model Claude for offensive measures in Maduro capture - WSJ

The US Defense Department used AI company Anthropic's Claude model during the operation to capture former Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro and his wife in Caracas last month, the Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday.
This led to disagreements between the Pentagon and Anthropic, as Claude is not meant to be used for offensive measures, per Anthropic's public usage policies.
These policies include prohibiting the model from facilitating violence, developing weapons, or conducting surveillance, per WSJ's report.
An Anthropic spokesperson said the company could not comment on whether Claude or any other model was used in any specific operation and that any development must comply with its usage policies.
Deployment of Claude occurred through Anthropic's partnership with data company Palantir Technologies, whose tools and models are used by the Pentagon.
The Pentagon then questioned its future relationship with Anthropic, with chief Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell saying that the Defense Department requires "our partners to be willing to help our warfighters win in any fight."
Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said at an event in January announcing that the Pentagon would work with xAI that the department would not "employ AI models that won't allow you to fight wars."
WSJ also reported that tensions over Anthropic’s constraints on military use have prompted officials to consider canceling a contract worth up to $200 million. The contract was awarded last summer, the report said.
WSJ added that Anthropic was the first AI model developer to be used in classified Defense Department operations, and that other tools could have been used for unclassified tasks. AI models can support activities such as summarizing documents, generating reports, and assisting with research, while the most contentious debates center on autonomous lethal uses and surveillance.
Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei has publicly called for stronger regulation and guardrails around advanced AI, the report said, putting the company at odds with officials who want fewer restrictions on wartime applications.
The Journal reported that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth previously said the Pentagon would not employ AI models that “won’t allow you to fight wars,” referencing discussions involving Anthropic.
How the US captured Nicolas Maduro
The operation to capture Maduro began with overnight US strikes across Venezuela, with multiple explosions reported in Caracas and a loss of power in parts of the capital’s southern districts, followed by a rapid assault that ended with Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, being taken into custody and flown out of the country.
Venezuelan authorities declared a national emergency and, in the immediate aftermath, senior officials said they did not know the couple’s whereabouts, while Washington said Maduro would be brought to the United States to face prosecution.
In the days that followed, the humanitarian and political fallout widened: Cuba announced that 32 of its citizens, described as members of its armed forces and intelligence services assigned to security duties, were killed during the raid and declared two days of national mourning, while Venezuelan officials later cited a death toll of roughly 100 and said both Maduro and Flores were injured during the operation, as competing accounts continued to emerge over casualties, damage, and the scope of the strikes.

Fertility patients win high court battle to save embryos after consent error

More than a dozen fertility patients have won a high court battle to save their embryos, eggs and sperm from destruction after errors meant they did not renew consent to store them within the 10-year window required by law.
Ruling that the material could be kept, the judge said they should not “have the possibility of parenthood … removed by the ticking of a clock”.
Lawyers for 15 groups affected by the errors – some of them former cancer patients – asked the court in London to declare it would be lawful for the embryos or cells to remain in storage, despite the consent expiring in June last year. In some cases this was because fertility clinics failed to notify those affected.
In an unusual situation, the move was unopposed, with no objections from the clinics, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority or the health secretary.
Mrs Justice Morgan ruled that it would be lawful in 14 of the 15 cases for the material to continue to be stored and used. She said laws around human fertilisation and embryology were “unbending” but “the rigidity of the scheme is not rigidity for its own sake”.
She continued: “It is surely consent that is important, not consent by an immutable date. I find it hard to conclude that parliament intended the possibility of parenthood should be removed by the ticking of a clock, not in the cliched phrase, the ticking of the biological clock, but by the ticking of the clock beyond midnight of the day when existing consent expires, whatever might be the circumstances.”
Under the law, fertility clinics need written consent from clients every decade to continue storing biological material. The rules are intended to prevent cells being kept or used without people’s knowledge or permission.
Owing to delays and issues accessing fertility treatment during the pandemic, the law allowed for a two-year extension, meaning people using the service on 1 July 2020 were granted extra time.
Confusion caused by the extension meant some clinic users were not notified when they needed to renew consent, so it lapsed.
In the one case where the judge ruled against, the circumstances were legally different. Morgan said the pair involved had not originally consented to an embryo being stored but one had been retained accidentally and they now wished to use it.
She said: “There was never, on their case, a consent to renew. To be permitted to take advantage of the storage of the embryo which they say ‘contradicted’ their express wishes because the clinic acted on the wrong consent form to change their mind is not in my judgment renewing consent. It is a change of consent.”

Finance Minister Smotrich says he won't educate his daughter to enlist in the IDF

Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich does not want his daughter to serve in the IDF, he said Monday.
“I will educate my daughter not to enlist in the army,” the chairman of the Religious Zionist Party (RZP) said during his party’s press conference in the Knesset.
“I respect anyone who thinks differently from me. This is the ruling of my rabbis, and I hope the liberals will respect my position. Mixing men and women in tanks is, in my view, delusional.”
Smotrich also discussed efforts to lower the cost of living in Israel and combat monopolies to strengthen the economy.
The controversial haredi conscription bill
In recent months, the government has been fast-tracking a controversial haredi (ultra-Orthodox) conscription bill. A haredi protest in Bnei Brak on Sunday against serving in the IDF turned violent. Two female soldiers were attacked by a haredi mob before being rescued by police.
“We cannot continue like this,” Smotrich said. “We must, simply must, pass a draft law that will truly lead to the enlistment of our haredi brothers and their integration into bearing the burden of security and national existence.”
Critics of the draft bill say its current version fails to enforce haredi conscription and instead aims to appease the haredi parties in the Knesset.
The IDF has repeatedly said there is an urgent need for additional manpower, especially after more than two years of war.
Smotrich has not said whether he would support the bill in its current form. His indirect stance, however, has led to speculation that he might vote in favor.
Developments with the haredi draft bill have also become intertwined with the government’s passage of the 2026 state budget. The haredi parties have threatened to vote against the budget unless progress is made on the draft bill.
Smotrich said the draft bill and the state budget should not be linked.
Support from Religious Zionist Party MKs is considered crucial to whether the bill can pass its second and third readings in the Knesset plenum and become law.
Aliyah and Integration Minister Ofir Sofer (RZP), a growing number of coalition MKs, and opposition MKs have strongly criticized the current draft bill's outline.

US blogger calls London’s idea of allowing children to change gender identity madness

MOSCOW, February 16. /TASS/. The British government'’s initiative to allow children as young as four to change their gender identity (propaganda of gender reassignment and the operation itself are banned in Russia) is insane and leads to the destruction of the country, Jozef Schutzman, an American blogger and IT specialist, told TASS in an interview.
"We should not be surprised in the slightest about the insane idea of the British government planning to allow children as young as four years old to change their gender identity. The British government hates their country anyways. And they have been trying to destroy it for decades, and they're doing a really fine job at it. This is why more and more families from Western countries are moving to Russia, where family values and children are protected by law and the government," he said.
On February 13, the Daily Mail newspaper reported that the UK Department for Education has released new guidelines for schools on working with "gender-questioning children" (propaganda for gender reassignment and the operation itself are banned in Russia), which allow for the possibility of "full social transition" for primary school students, including children as young as four. According to its information, under these guidelines, teachers and students will be able to refer to children using pronouns that do not correspond to their sex but rather reflect their gender. For example, a girl could be addressed as "he" and a boy as "she."
In the United States, Schutzman built a successful career in the IT sector, holding high positions at corporations such as Microsoft, Oracle and Red Hat. He and his wife are raising eight children and advocate for traditional values. When their state passed a law allowing minors to change gender without parental consent, the family decided to move to Russia. In 2023, they sold all their property in the United States and relocated to the Moscow Region, as Schutzman told TASS in an interview. Together with fellow American Eddie Gonzalez, Schutzman runs a blog popular in the West called Russia Up Close. Their mission is to convey the truth about Russia to residents of Western countries.

Nancy Guthrie kidnapping investigators work with Walmart after identifying suspect’s backpack
Nancy Guthrie kidnapping investigators work with Walmart after identifying suspect’s backpack
Investigators working on the disappearance of “Today” show host Savannah Guthrie’s mother are consulting with Walmart management to develop leads because a backpack the suspect was wearing is sold exclusively at the stores, the Pima County, Arizona, sheriff said Monday.
Nancy Guthrie, 84, was last seen at her Arizona home on Jan. 31 and was reported missing the following day. Authorities say her blood was found on the front porch. Purported ransom notes were sent to news outlets, but two deadlines for paying have passed.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation released surveillance videos of a masked person wearing a handgun holster outside Guthrie’s front door in Tucson the night she vanished. A porch camera recorded video of a person with a backpack who was wearing a ski mask, long pants, a jacket and gloves.
Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos said in a text message to The Associated Press on Monday that the 25-liter “Ozark Trail Hiker Pack” backpack was the only clothing item that has been “definitively identified.”
“This backpack is exclusive to Walmart and we are working with Walmart management to develop further leads,” Nanos said.
The suspect’s clothing “may have been purchased from Walmart but is not exclusively available at Walmart,” the Pima County Sheriff’s Department said in a statement Monday. “This remains a possibility only.”
Investigators on Sunday announced that a glove discovered near the Guthrie home has been sent for DNA testing. The FBI said that it received preliminary results Saturday and was awaiting official confirmation. The development comes as law enforcement gathers more potential evidence and as the search for Guthrie’s mother heads into its third week. Authorities previously said they had not identified a suspect.
The FBI said the suspect in the surveillance footage is a man about 5 feet, 9 inches tall with a medium build.
Nanos said on Monday that members of Guthrie’s family, including siblings and spouses, are not suspects.
“The family has been nothing but cooperative and gracious and are victims in this case,” Nanos said in a statement.
Authorities have expressed concern about Nancy Guthrie’s health because she needs vital daily medicine. She is said to have a pacemaker and have dealt with high blood pressure and heart issues, according to sheriff’s dispatcher audio on broadcastify.com.

Liberal senator Sarah Henderson has been asked whether Australian IS brides and their children should be allowed back into Australia upon their return from Syria.
“Anyone who shares or potentially shares ISIS ideology … This is the ideology that underpinned the Bondi terrorist attack. 15 Australians were tragically killed. We believe that self-managed returns must end,” she told ABC’s Radio National earlier.
“If these are people who subscribed to ISIS ideology, who subscribe to this extremist ideology, then they should not be returning to Australia.”
Pressed on where they should go if Australia turns them away – considering they are Australian citizens – Henderson provided no alternative.
“What should be happening is that Australians must be given every confidence that for people who are linked with ISIS, that all of the appropriate security assessments have been made,” she said.

Czech Initiative: Ukraine Already Received 4.4 Million Shells

Ukraine has already received 4.4 million large-caliber shells under the Czech Initiative program, which accounts for more than 50% of all large-caliber ammunition provided.
This was announced by Czech President Petr Pavel in an interview with Odkryto.
As part of the Czech initiative to purchase ammunition for the Ukrainian Armed Forces in third countries, nearly 4.4 million large-caliber shells have been delivered to Ukraine.
“If we look at the past period, since the initiative was launched, it has delivered about 4 million 400,000 units of large-caliber ammunition to Ukraine. Last year alone, it was almost two million. Without this supply of ammunition, the Armed Forces of Ukraine would not have been able to conduct effective defense, because if you do not have a secure and predictable supply of ammunition, you cannot plan your defense effectively,” he said.
Pavel emphasized that the Czechia not only initiated this project, but also contributed its know-how on how to bring together partners, finances, resources, routes, and logistics to collect ammunition from all over the world, wherever it is available, and deliver them to Ukraine “under reasonable conditions and at reasonable prices in the shortest possible time.”
The Czech Initiative has been in place since early 2024, with the first deliveries of shells beginning in the summer of that year. The program involves purchasing ammunition in third countries and delivering it to Ukraine.
The program provides for the purchase of not only 155 mm shells, but also other types of shells with a caliber of 100 mm and above. In particular, there were reports of deliveries of 122 mm, 152 mm, and 155 mm artillery shells.
After the change of government in Czechia at the end of 2025, there was uncertainty about the continuation of this initiative, but the new government decided to continue it, provided that Czechia itself would not financially support it, but would only coordinate it.
It is known that as of mid-December 2025, partner countries had already secured funding for the purchase of 760,000 artillery shells for Ukraine in 2026 under the Czech Initiative.

Man faces terrorism charges in foiled Taylor Swift concert attack plot in Vienna
Austrian public prosecutors filed terrorism-related charges Monday against a 21-year-old defendant who they say planned to attack one of superstar singer Taylor Swift's concerts in Vienna in August 2024.
Vienna public prosecutors said in a statement that the unnamed defendant had declared allegiance to the Islamic State group by sharing propaganda material and videos via various messaging services.
Vienna prosecutors also accuse the defendant of having "obtained instructions on the internet for the construction of a shrapnel bomb based on the explosive triacetone triperoxide" typically used by IS, and of having produced a small amount of the explosive.
Prosecutors also say that the defendant had made "several attempts" to buy weapons illegally outside the country and to bring them to Austria.
Omar Haijawi-Pirchner, head of the Directorate of State Security and Intelligence, said at the time of the suspect's arrest that he wanted to kill "as many people as possible using the knives or even using the explosive devices he had made."
Vienna public prosecutors plan to proceed with a criminal case against the unnamed suspect in Wiener Neustadt, a town near the Austrian capital.
The spokesperson for the Vienna public prosecutors' office confirmed to The Associated Press that the defendant is in custody. Austrian media identified the suspect as Beran A. and said he was arrested in August 2024.
A total of three suspects had been arrested and charged in connection with the plot, including a teenage boy who was convicted in a German court last year of preparing a serious act of violence and supporting a terrorist act of violence abroad. The Berlin court gave Mohammad A., a Syrian national, a suspended 18-month sentence.
Austrian authorities canceled three planned Swift shows in Vienna in August 2024 after they said they foiled an apparent plot to target the Eras Tour performances.
The U.S. provided intelligence that fed into the decision to cancel the concerts. The move left tens of thousands of Swift's fans, many of whom had traveled to Vienna from elsewhere in the country or abroad specifically to see a show, devastated. Concert organizers in Austria said they had expected up to 65,000 fans inside the Ernst Happel Stadium at each concert and as many as 30,000 onlookers outside.
"The United States has an enduring focus on our counterterrorism mission. We work closely with partners all over the world to monitor and disrupt threats. And so as part of that work, the United States did share information with Austrian partners to enable the disruption of a threat to Taylor Swift's concerts there in Vienna," then-White House national security spokesman John Kirby said in August 2024.

YouTuber facing federal charges after taking drone footage of top-secret ‘underground Pentagon’, FBI claims
Stuart Dale Bennett accused of violating airspace above the Raven Rock Mountain Complex, a secure facility where top US officials will be whisked in the event of nuclear war
- Bookmark
A YouTuber is facing federal charges after he flew a drone over a highly sensitive military installation known as the “underground Pentagon,” capturing footage of the ultra-secure compound that he later posted online, according to an FBI probable cause affidavit reviewed by The Independent.
Stuart Dale Bennett, who runs the “Area 82 Surveillance911” YouTube channel, is accused of gathering aerial recordings of the Raven Rock Mountain Complex, which has been described as one of the nation’s “most closely guarded secret military facilities, roughly comparable to ‘Area 51’ in southern Nevada.”
The self-contained 650-acre subterranean city, hidden deep within a hollowed-out mountain on the Maryland-Pennsylvania border and known as the “underground Pentagon,” is meant to serve as an emergency relocation site for top U.S. officials and vital military operations in the event of a nuclear attack or other catastrophe.
The affidavit, filed February 12 in support of a criminal complaint against Bennett, alleges the videos appeared to depict “critical infrastructure of importance to national security” – specifically, two clips titled, “Raven Rock Mountain Complex COG Site (2nd Pentagon),” and “Blue Ridge Summit / Former Fort Ritchie Communications Site with lots of secret squirrel antennae.”
“Notably, the Area 82 Surveillance911 YouTube channel actually included video titles that in some cases identifies sites as being considered ‘classified’ or ‘Top Secret,’” the affidavit states.
“Additionally, Area 82 Surveillance911 had a folder titled, ‘Classified Secret Sites’ which contained approximately seven videos of UAS overflight of U.S. Government facilities,” the affidavit continues.
The investigation into Bennett, from Maryland, began on September 8, 2025, when an unidentified U.S. military official contacted the Naval Criminal Investigative Service, made famous by TV series NCIS.
Theofficial flagged a YouTube channel that had posted drone footage a week earlier of what the probable cause affidavit describes as “an identified sensitive U.S. national defense facility.”
Ten days later, the FBI joined the investigation, the affidavit states. Agents reviewed the channel, “Area 82 Surveillance911,” maintained by a user going by “mtsxhacker,” and flagged multiple videos of Raven Rock, which “appeared to have been taken from an Unmanned Aircraft System,” according to the affidavit.
The agents traced the account’s IP address, and subpoenaed YouTube for the associated email and recovery phone numbers, identifying mtsxhacker as Bennett, who had used them previously to “submit unrelated complaints to the FBI,” the affidavit continues.
On September 24, a federal magistrate judge approved a trio of search warrants allowing the FBI to search Bennett’s residence, vehicle, and person, along with any electronic devices discovered along the way, the affidavit goes on. The following day, it says agents seized a Potensic Atom drone, four micro-SD cards, and an HP Z240 Tower Workstation, from Bennett’s bedroom.
“During the execution of the search warrant, FBI agents observed that Bennett’s computer monitor (connected to his HP Z240 Tower Workstation) displayed that the Area82 Surveillance911 YouTube channel was logged into and appeared to have a video processing for upload to the channel,” the affidavit states.
A U.S. Customs and Border Protection unit specializing in advanced drone forensics, the Center for Air and Marine Drone Exploitation, (CAMDEx) extracted the contents of one of the micro-SD cards, revealing off-limits footage of Raven Rock, according to the affidavit. It showed an area of the facility called “Site C,” reportedly a key communications site at Raven Rock, and had been taken on September 6, 2025, the affidavit alleges.
The airspace surrounding Raven Rock is restricted, and the affidavit says Bennett “did not seek, nor was granted by the relevant U.S. Government authorities, authorization to conduct such overflight.”
A separate review of Bennett’s computer turned up queries to Google Maps for directions between his home and the Raven Rock complex, as well as visits to websites about the facility, according to the affidavit.
Investigators also located a photo Bennett saved to his files, titled, “2 hf antenna and microwave towers on top of Raven Rock,” along with four videos of off-limits drone footage taken there, the affidavit states. Additionally, it says, Bennett’s search history showed that he visited his own YouTube channel on September 7, 2025 and watched the “Raven Rock Mountain Complex COG Site (2nd Pentagon)” video.
On November 10, 2025, the FBI and NCIS interviewed Bennett at the FBI Baltimore Field Office. Bennett told agents “that he owned and flew UAS,” but was not properly licensed to do so, and admitted to being behind the Area 82 Surveillance911 YouTube channel, the affidavit contends.
“Bennett admitted that he knew he was not permitted to fly UAS over military bases,” it says, adding that Bennett claimed someone named “Elliott” had given him “a list of interesting government sites to fly over,” including Raven Rock.
Bennett, who does not have an attorney listed in court records and was unable to be reached for comment Monday is charged with the knowing and willful violation of national defense airspace. He is set to make his initial appearance in court on February 20.
If convicted, he faces up a year behind bars.
Strategically set about six miles north of the Camp David presidential retreat, Raven Rock is the alternate command center for the North American Aerospace Defense Command and the United States Northern Command, or, NORAD and USNORTHCOM.
In a doomsday-type scenario, a helicopter squadron from Joint Base Andrews would immediately fly a “small number” of senior government officials to Raven Rock and a handful of other hardened bunkers to ensure the continuity of essential government functions, according to historian and journalist Garrett Graff’s 2017 book, Raven Rock: The Story of the U.S. Government's Secret Plan to Save Itself – While the Rest of Us Die.
Among others, Paul Wolfowitz, the deputy secretary of defense under President George W. Bush, was reportedly evacuated to Raven Rock on 9/11.

The frog poison that killed Alexei Navalny likely lab-made
February 16, 2026A poison found in threatened frog species in the Ecuadorian foothills has been named as the cause of Alexei Navalny's death in prison.
Scientists from Germany, France, the Netherlands, Sweden and the UK performed a postmortem analysis of the Russian pro-democracy campaigner and opposition leader, who died on February 16, 2024.
In a joint statement, released during the Munich Security Conference, they declared traces of the chemical epibatidine had been detected in Navalny's tissue samples and that "poisoning was highly likely the cause of his death."
As Navalny died while imprisoned in Siberia, the five nations accused Russia of having deliberately administered the poison.
Frogs with a poisonous skin
Epibatidine is a poison contained within the skin of certain poison dart frogs and, as noted by the five nations, is not found naturally in Russia.
The frogs that produce the toxin live in the Ecuadorian foothills and include Anthony's dart frog (Epipedobates anthonyi) and the phantasmal dart frog (Epipedobates tricolor). According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources, the phantasmal dart frog is threatened.
These frog species feed on insects. Alkaloid chemicals that emerge during digestion are concentrated into toxins that are stored within the frogs' skin, which is brightly-colored as a warning to predators. The frogs have evolved to tolerate the lethal substances.
There are many varieties of frog skin toxins, including the paralysis-causing batrachotoxin.
Of course, dart frogs are so named for their historic use by indigenous South American peoples, who were known to coat their arrowheads in the deadly secretions before going hunting. Epibatidine-producing frogs were not known to be used in this practice.
A deadly chemical, not a viable painkiller
Epibatidine, as identified in Navalny, was first identified by American chemist and pharmacologist John W. Daly when he extracted and analyzed less than a milligram of the toxin from phantasmal poison frogs in the 1970s.
Many animal and plant toxins have been formulated into beneficial drugs, painkillers and continue to be researched for potential treatments for hard-to-treat illnesses like cancer.
So it was that epibatidine was investigated for possible human benefit as a potential non-addictive painkiller.
But the toxin is so powerful, with little difference between its lethal to non-lethal doses, that pharmacists have been unable to develop it into a feasible painkiller for humans.
It is known that epibatidine:
- Is about 200 times more powerful than morphine.
- At toxic levels, causes seizures and paralysis of the lung muscles, leading to asphyxiation.
Did Russia go to Ecuador to get dart poison?
Scientists regularly extract animal venoms and toxins for research and to develop medical drugs and antidotes.
But it's unlikely that Russia would have flown to Ecuador to extract a sample of dart frog poison.
Instead, authorities believe that the poison would have been synthesized in a lab.
Vil Mirzayanov, a Russian analytical chemist who has lived in the United States since the 1990s and revealed his involvement in the development of new Novichok (or newcomer) agents after the fall of the Soviet Union, said it was "not new" that Russia's State Research Institute of Organic Chemistry and Technology (or GosNIIOKhT) worked with natural toxins, pointing out that ricin and fentanyl agents had also been developed at the institute.
He agreed that it was more likely that any toxin used was likely lab-made.
"I think this dart frog poison was synthesized because it's very tough to imagine that they brought kilograms, maybe even 100 grams, from somewhere, from South America," Mirzayanov told DW.
Mirzayanov said it was likely that Russia's security services, which have their own advanced laboratories, would have been responsible for administering any poison.
Five nations refer Russia for treaty breach
Though the five nations have claimed their results as proof Navalny was deliberately poisoned, Russia has denied the allegations.
Navalny had previously been flown to Germany in 2020 with a life-threatening illness from nerve agent poisoning. Russia also denied responsibility on that occasion.
Navalny's widow, Yulia Navalnaya, described the five nations' findings as "science-proven" evidence of his murder, saying on social media that "[Vladimir] Putin killed Alexei with a chemical weapon".
The five nations involved in the analysis have referred Russia to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons for breaching the Chemical Weapons Convention.

Pentagon threatens Anthropic over AI model use in military operations: Report
Anonymous Pentagon official tells Axios disentangling system will be ‘an enormous pain,’ saying department will ‘make sure they pay a price for forcing our hand'
WASHINGTON
The Pentagon has threatened to designate artificial intelligence company Anthropic as a “supply chain risk” as it presses the firm to loosen restrictions on the military use of its Claude AI model, according to a report published Monday.
Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is close to severing the Pentagon’s relationship with Anthropic over the dispute, Axios reported. If the designation is imposed, all Defense Department contractors would be required to either stop doing business with Anthropic or end their ties with the Pentagon.
"It will be an enormous pain in the * to disentangle, and we are going to make sure they pay a price for forcing our hand like this," an anonymous Defense Department official told the online news outlet.
Claude is currently the only AI model authorized for use within the Defense Department’s classified systems and has been deployed in sensitive military operations, according to the report. The Pentagon and Anthropic have been negotiating the terms governing the model’s use for several months.
Anthropic is willing to relax some of its usage restrictions for the Pentagon but has drawn firm limits on the use of its software for mass surveillance of Americans and for the development of weapons capable of firing without human oversight, Axios reported. It was not clear which party provided details of the closed-door discussions.
The Pentagon is seeking assurances that it can use software from Anthropic and three other major technology firms — OpenAI, Google and xAI — for what it described as “all lawful purposes.”
"The Department of War’s relationship with Anthropic is being reviewed. Our nation requires that our partners be willing to help our warfighters win in any fight," Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell said in a statement provided to Anadolu.
"Ultimately, this is about our troops and the safety of the American people," he added.
Anthropic did not immediately respond to a request for comment. However, the company told Axios it is "having productive conversations, in good faith, with DoW on how to continue that work and get these new and complex issues right."
OpenAI, Google and xAI have agreed to lift some internal safeguards if the Pentagon opts to use their AI models, though only for unclassified activities, according to the report.

ALBAWABA- The United Arab Emirates and Bahrain have launched the pilot phase of a new “single travel point” system designed to eliminate duplicate airport procedures and significantly reduce passenger queues.
Under the initiative, citizens traveling between the two countries will complete immigration, customs, and security checks at their departure airport, with no additional formalities required upon arrival.
Announced by UAE authorities on Monday, the pilot is being implemented at Zayed International Airport in Abu Dhabi and Bahrain International Airport. The system relies on biometric pre-clearance technology to accelerate processing and improve passenger flow.
The project represents the first operational step toward a broader Gulf Cooperation Council vision for seamless regional travel. The concept was approved during the 42nd GCC Interior Ministers’ meeting in Kuwait in November 2025 and is intended to eventually link all six GCC states under a unified travel framework.
Initially limited to air travel between the UAE and Bahrain, the scheme is expected to expand to land and sea routes if the pilot proves successful, with full implementation targeted for late 2026 alongside plans for a unified GCC tourist visa.
Officials say the system could cut travel times by up to 50 percent, reduce congestion at major aviation hubs, and boost intra-regional trade estimated at $100 billion annually. Enhanced mobility is also seen as a driver for tourism growth, with GCC states aiming to attract millions of additional visitors by 2030 as part of broader economic diversification strategies.
The launch builds on earlier GCC agreements to standardize biometric platforms and data-sharing protocols, positioning the Gulf bloc as a potential model for technology-driven border management amid global aviation pressures and post-pandemic recovery efforts.

Bangladesh’s foreign policy ‘no longer submissive,’ says outgoing leader Yunus
Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus bids farewell as BNP government prepares to take office on Tuesday
DHAKA, Bangladesh
In a farewell address on Monday, outgoing interim leader Muhammad Yunus told the nation of 176 million that Bangladesh’s foreign policy “is no longer submissive” and that relations with all countries will be “based on mutual respect and national interest.”
“Bangladesh is no longer dependent on a submissive foreign policy or on the instructions and advice of other countries; today’s Bangladesh is confident, active and responsible in protecting its independent interests,” said Yunus, who took the helm at the peak of the summer uprising of 2024, which ended the 15-year rule of the Awami League, whose Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina fled to India on Aug. 5 that year.
Yunus took charge on Aug. 8 and led an interim administration for 18 months, including holding historic elections last week in which the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) won a two-thirds majority in the 300-seat parliament.
The BNP, led by Tarique Rahman, is set to take oath as the new government on Tuesday after securing 209 of 300 seats.
The election held on Thursday “will be a prime example of how Bangladesh's elections should be in the future. This vote is not just a transfer of power—it marks the beginning of a new chapter for Bangladesh’s democratic system… the birth of a new Bangladesh,” said Yunus, who is a globally renowned economist.
“After faithfully fulfilling the responsibilities entrusted to me for the past 18 months, I have come to bid you farewell today as the chief advisor of the interim government on the eve of handing over to an elected administration,” he continued.
Yunus recalled the poor economic status of Bangladesh left behind by Hasina’s government.
“The previous government left us with a bottomless economy. It embezzled $234 billion and left behind a huge debt burden. Now, as I leave, I am relieved that we have been able to cope with the situation, and we can leave behind the foundation of a new economy with a foreign reserve of $34 billion and record remittances,” said the outgoing leader.
Yunus, Bangladesh’s lone Nobel laureate and the country’s most renowned "global citizen," is a social entrepreneur, banker and economist.
He is best known for his pioneering work in microfinance and social business. He gained international fame for founding Grameen Bank in 1983 and was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006 for his contributions to economic development and poverty reduction.

’Ready to govern’ Hungary: Former ally Magyar challenges Orban with Europe gun
“We’re standing on the threshold of victory,” Peter Magyar confidently declared to thousands of cheering supporters in Budapest this weekend, kicking off the centre-right Tisza party's campaign for Hungary’s April 12 parliamentary elections. The former far-right Fidesz party insider turned defector is now Prime Minister Viktor Orban’s biggest threat after 16 years in power. FRANCE 24 lists the key stakes in what is expected to become one of Europe’s most closely watched election races this year.
-
Who is Peter Magyar?
Forty-four-year-old Peter Magyar burst onto Hungary’s political scene in February, 2024, after having broken ranks with Orban’s Fidesz party over a child sex abuse pardon scandal that led to the resignation of his ex-wife, then justice minister Judit Varga, and then president Katalin Novak.
Magyar, who up until then had been part of Orban’s inner circle, accused the government of walking free from responsibility after letting Varga and Novak take the blame. “I don’t want to be part of a system where the real culprits hide behind women’s skirts,” he said. Shortly afterward he launched his own centre-right party, Tisza (Respect and Freedom), and vowed to crack down on corruption and bring Hungary closer to Europe.
Read moreHungary's Peter Magyar, Orban disciple turned fierce rival
“Step by step, brick by brick, we are taking back our homeland and building a new country, a sovereign, modern, European Hungary,” Magyar said shortly after founding his party.
Just a few months later, Tisza stunned Hungary’s political establishment by securing almost 30 percent of the votes in the European parliamentary elections – cementing Magyar’s role as Orban’s most serious challenger yet.
As both contenders launched their campaigns over the weekend, Magyar’s Tisza already held a comfortable 10-point lead over Orban’s Fidesz – and has done so over the past year, according to a combined poll by Politico.
“Tisza stands ready to govern,” Magyar said at his launch event.
-
Why is Orban’s rule in danger?
Aside from the Fidesz “family values” brand taking a serious hit with the 2024 pardon scandal – prompting some of the party’s conservative members to defect to Tisza – Orban has been unable to to get Hungary’s bleeding economy back on track. In 2023, a presidential pardon had been secretly granted to the deputy director of a children’s home convicted of covering up a case of child sex abuse.
In the wake of Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine – which pushed the country’s energy prices to the skies – Orban also introduced new income rebates, which in 2023 resulted in the worst inflationary surge in Europe, at a staggering 25 percent.
Although the worst of the financial crisis has since subsided, a Eurobarometer survey cited by Reuters last autumn showed that rising prices, inflation and cost of living still top Hungarians’ main concerns.
The state of the country’s economy has also been weighed down by the fact that the European Union has blocked some €20 billion in funds over corruption and the rule of law concerns.
The economy is in other words a sore point for Orban, and Magyar has taken every opoortunity to point that out.
-
Europe in focus
The real battleground in the April ballot will be the two candidates' opposing views on the EU.
While Orban last week declared that the real danger to Hungary is the EU, Magyar has gone the other way: “Hungary will once again be a full-fledged member of the European Union,” he told a Budapest rally last year, touting the EU as the answer to Hungary’s prayers, especially if it releases the withheld EU funds.
On Saturday, Orban told supporters that “Brussels … [is] a source of imminent danger”, adding that the April ballot is therefore a choice between “war and peace”, and that Fidesz, with its anti-EU stance, therefore is the only “safe choice”.
Orban's anti-establishment and nationalist views has won him support from US President Donald Trump, and on Monday US Secretary of State Marco Rubio paid him a symbolic visit, telling him "your success is our success".

Orban hopes his ties with Trump wil help him collect the votes needed to prolong his reign.
If he wins the elections, he has promised to "clear away" the "oppressive machinery of Brussels" in his country.
-
Views on Russia and Ukraine
Under Orban, Hungary has remained Russia’s closest EU ally throughout the war, routinely blocking any European sanction packages against what has remained – despite pleas from Europe – its main gas supplier.
He has equally tried to stonewall any military or financial aid to Ukraine. And at the end of last year, he even went as far as to say it was “unclear who attacked whom”.
Although Magyar has described Moscow as “the aggressor” in the conflict, and last year told the Financial Times he would push for an immediate ceasefire along with Hungary’s EU allies if he comes to power, he has also said he would not reverse Hungary’s current policy of non-support for Kyiv nor totally sever Budapest’s ties with Russia. He staunchly opposes fast-track EU accession for Ukraine.
"On Ukraine, Tisza’s manifesto is notably thin," an analyst note from the Brussels-based think-tank European Policy Center warned, adding that "EU leaders should not assume that a Magyar government would mark a clean break with Orban-era policies."

EU Honors Alexei Navalny; Labs Say He was Poisoned with Rare Neurotoxin

Reported by
The EU Delegation to the United Nations in Geneva on Monday commemorated the Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, marking two years since his death in custody as European officials pointed to new laboratory findings they say strengthen evidence he was poisoned.
Diplomats gathered at a memorial in Geneva, laying flowers and holding photographs before observing a minute of silence. In remarks, the EU ambassador, Deike Potzel, said several European governments had concluded that Navalny’s death was the foreseeable outcome of a political system designed to silence dissent, noting that Russia holds more than 2,000 political prisoners, including journalists, lawyers and rights advocates.
Her comments came days after the United Kingdom, Germany, France, the Netherlands and Sweden said analyses by their national laboratories had “conclusively confirmed” the presence of epibatidine — a rare, highly toxic alkaloid associated with South American poison dart frogs — in biological samples linked to Navalny. The governments said the substance is not found naturally in Russia and that poisoning was therefore “highly likely” to have caused his death.
Speaking in Bratislava, Marco Rubio said the United States had “no reason” to doubt the European findings, calling the report troubling, though he stopped short of announcing any formal U.S. action.
The announcement coincided with international security meetings in Munich attended by Navalny’s widow, Yulia Navalnaya, who said the laboratory conclusions confirmed what she had long alleged: that President Vladimir Putin bore responsibility for her husband’s death.
European officials described the findings as significant because they link Navalny’s death to a specific toxin identified by multiple laboratories, potentially strengthening grounds for international action. The five governments said they had notified the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, signaling a possible violation of the Chemical Weapons Convention.
Members of the Russian opposition platform at the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe said the report confirmed long-standing accusations that Russian authorities were responsible and called for an international tribunal to investigate Navalny’s death and other alleged crimes.
Russian officials have denied involvement and dismissed the accusations as propaganda.

France opens murder probe into right-wing activist's death

France opens murder probe into right-wing activist's death
February 16, 2026French authorities on Monday opened a murder investigation after a 23-year-old man died from a severe brain injury following an attack on the streets of Lyon last week.
Lyon's public prosecutor Thierry Dran announced the probe at a press conference, saying that Quentin Deranque had been attacked by "at least six" people on Thursday.
The victim was part of a group of far-right activists protesting the appearance of a left-wing politician speaking at a university in the western city of Lyon.
Prosecutor Dran said that no arrests had yet been made and that authorities were working to identify the hooded assailants suspected in a killing being treated as a potential case of both "intentional homicide" and "aggravated assault."
Macron calls for calm as government implicates far left
The killing, thought to be part of a clash between left- and right-wing extremists, has strained tensions ahead of municipal elections in March and the 2027 presidential race.
Supporters held a march in memory of Deranque in Paris on Sunday, also attended by some far-right politicians including the founder of the "Reconquest" far-right party, former presidential candidate Eric Zemmour.
President Emmanuel Macron called for calm and for a swift investigation online.
"It is essential that the perpetrators of this ignominy be prosecuted, brought to justice and convicted," Macron wrote on X at the weekend. "Hatred that kills has no place among us. I call for calm, restraint and respect."
Far-right RN leader Marine Le Pen appealed for the "barbarians responsible for this lynching" to face the full force of the law.
An anti-immigration collective called Nemesis said that Deranque had been at the protest to protect its members.
It blamed the killing on a left-wing group called the Jeune Garde (Young Guard), an anti-fascist group cofounded by a current member of the left wing LFI political party, Raphael Arnault, before he joined the political fray.
The group, which was formally dissolved in June last year, denied any connection to the "tragic events." LFI leader Jean-Luc Melenchon rejected any involvement from his party.
Nevertheless, government spokeswoman Maud Bregeon accused the LFI on Monday of having "encouraged a climate of violence for years."
"There is therefore, in light of the political climate and the climate of violence, a moral responsibility of the part of LFI," she said on BFMTV.
One of Arnault's assistants had been banned from parliament after several witnesses mentioned him in the investigation into the fatal beating, parliamentary speaker Yael Braun-Pivet said on Monday.
Far-right and far-left could lead the race for presidency next year
France's political mood is increasingly fractious as April 2027 presidential elections near, when incumbent Macron will not be eligible to run after serving the maximum permitted two terms.
Opinion polls currently suggest that the nationalist RN (National Rally) party of Marine Le Pen, possibly led by her deputy Jordan Bardella if Le Pen proves unable to run amid an ongoing appeal against an election ban, has the advantage — at least when it comes to a first-round vote with more than two candidates standing. Voting habits in a second round with only two choices can be more difficult to predict.
Macron's centrist Renaissance party is struggling, while the traditional center-right and center-left powerhouses of French politics have been consigned to near-irrelevance for some time now.
At present, albeit with polling volatile and more than a year to go until a vote, a relatively new center-right party Horizons founded by Mayor of Le Havre and former Prime Minister Edouarde Philippe appears best placed to challenge the far-right.
A left-wing alliance led by LFI (France Unbowed) might also conceivably mount a serious challenge, as it did in 2024's legislative elections. But that's only if it can again unite a quite large group of ideologically disparate parties, none of which appear likely to challenge by themselves.

The fatal beating of a 23-year-old man in Lyon has shocked France and ignited a fierce political row. The victim, identified only as Quentin, died in hospital after being attacked on 12 February on the sidelines of clashes near a political event at Sciences Po Lyon attended by a left-wing politician. Prosecutors say he was assaulted during confrontations between rival activists and later succumbed to a traumatic brain injury, prompting a murder inquiry by French police.
The killing has intensified tensions between the far right and far left in the run-up to key elections, with national figures calling for calm even as accusations fly about responsibility for the violence. France 24’s Mark Owen is joined by economist Renaud Foucart of Lancaster University to analyse the political and social fallout from this deeply troubling incident.

In Argentina, locals are taking loans to buy food

In Argentina, locals are taking loans to buy food
Argentinians are taking on loans, selling their belongings, and living on credit cards to pay for basics including food.
Buenos Aires, Argentina: Diego Nacasio, 43, works full time as a salesman at a large hardware store in Florencio Varela, a city in the greater Buenos Aires area. He says he doesn’t need a calendar to know what day of the month it is. By the time his salary and that of his wife, who also works full time in a shop, run out, it is around the 15th.
From then on, they look for extra jobs, find things to sell, use their credit cards, and get small loans to pay for basics, including food, until the next paycheques arrive.
“I have never experienced anything like this,” Nacasio told Al Jazeera. “Over the past 25 years, we have worked hard, and our jobs allowed us to build a house from scratch, buy a car and give our 17-year-old son a decent life. Now, we have better jobs than we did then, and still cannot even afford food for the whole month.”
“Living on credit puts you in a very dangerous cycle. It’s very easy to fall behind with payments, and then it is a matter of chasing your own tail. Most people I know are in the same situation. We are living in a constant state of stress and anxiety, and it feels like there’s no way out.”
Nacasio’s story has become increasingly common in Argentina, where nearly half of the people say they are using savings, selling belongings or borrowing money from banks or relatives to cover basics, according to a report by Argentina Grande based on the latest official figures available. Another report, from Fundacion Pensar, found that 63 percent of Argentines have cut down on activities or services to make ends meet.
“The current situation in Argentina is extremely concerning. It is particularly worrying to see that even people who have one or several jobs are getting loans not to buy a house, a car or white goods [appliances], but to buy food,” Violeta Carrera Pereyra, sociologist and researcher at the Argentina Grande Institute and one of the authors of the report, told Al Jazeera.
A tale of two cities
Argentina’s President Javier Milei, who took office in December 2023, says his austerity economic plan, based on achieving fiscal balance while building up reserves of United States currency through drastic cuts to public spending, has revitalised the economy and lifted millions of people out of poverty. He is backed by the International Monetary Fund, which, despite Argentina’s record levels of foreign loans, projects an economic growth of four percent in 2026 and 2027.
But a closer look at the figures shows a different, more sombre, picture.
While economic activity in Argentina has increased overall, growth has been uneven. In November 2025, the most recent month for which data is available, sectors such as banking and agriculture saw growth, but manufacturing and commerce experienced sharp declines, with many factories and shops closing due to falling demand. Consumption, particularly of food, has been falling, with a 12.5 percent drop reported by independent food retailers.
Then there’s inflation, a key variable that in Argentina needs to be kept at bay in order to access essential foreign credit.
While Milei’s shock economic plan managed to significantly reduce inflation from record-high figures when he first took office in late 2023, experts say his administration has taken some controversial measures to keep it low. This includes forcing salaries to remain stagnant and under the rate of inflation, and opening the country up to cheaper imports. These policies have left many without money to spend and forced thousands of factories and small businesses to close.
Critics also say inflation figures are not representative of real price fluctuations. The tool used to measure inflation in Argentina, a sample basket of goods people consume, was developed in 2004 and does not reflect current consumption patterns, including the percentage that items like electricity and fuel – two areas that have seen price hikes considerably higher than inflation – represent in people’s real spending habits.
Carrera Pereyra says that figures also show that the rapid changes in Argentina’s economy have widened inequalities.
“On the one hand, we see that some sectors are able to consume more, so we see a rise in the sales of properties, cars, motorbikes, some as a result of the opening of imports,” she said. “But on the other hand, items like food and medicines are decreasing. So, some people can buy more things than before, while others are struggling to put food on the table.”
An obstacle course
Many Argentines who spoke with Al Jazeera said that making ends meet has become nothing short of an obstacle course. Juggling multiple demanding jobs, selling used items such as clothing, borrowing from relatives, seeking shark loans and bargain hunting have become a regular part of daily life.
“Shopping for food has become a job in itself,” said Veronica Malfitano, 43, a teacher and trade unionist, whose salary was cut by a quarter when Milei slashed public spending. “I team up with relatives or people I work with, and we buy in bulk. I use my credit card or get small loans. This month, for the first time, I have only paid the credit card’s minimum, something I had never done before. It’s all very stressful. Everybody I know is in the same situation.”
Research confirms Malfitano is not alone. Nearly half of supermarket purchases in Argentina are paid with credit cards, a record, according to recent official data.
Both borrowing and default rates have increased. It is estimated that around 11 percent of personal loans are unpaid, the highest rate since the Central Bank of Argentina began keeping records in 2010, according to Central Bank data.
Griselda Quipildor, 49, who lives with her husband, two daughters and two grandchildren, says that even though several people in her family work, money usually runs out by the 18th of every month and they have to start taking loans.
“At the start of the month, we pay debts, the bills and then the money runs out and we have to start borrowing again. It’s an endless vicious circle, one that is very difficult to get away from. We borrow from people we know and people we don’t know. It wasn’t like this before.”
Lucia Cavallero, an analyst, economics expert, and member of Movida Ciudad, told Al Jazeera that even though Argentina’s economic problems are longstanding, their impact on people’s homes is worsening.
“Debt has long been a serious problem in Argentina, and it has now become a crisis,” she said. “The proliferation of informal lenders has created a dangerous situation, leaving many people with no other options.”
In response, a political party has proposed a bill that would help people in lower-income sectors unify their loans and apply for a long-term payment plan at lower rates.
Cavallero says there are some positive aspects to the initiative, but that it largely misses the central point.
“It is good to see the political class recognising that debts are a serious problem for people,” she said. “However, this approach follows the logic of borrowing to pay off debt. While it may provide temporary relief, deeper structural changes are needed.
“Just as banks are bailed out, we are calling for families to be supported. A more sustainable solution is for wages to keep pace with the cost of the basic basket, so that people do not have to go into debt just to afford food,” Cavallero told Al Jazeera.
Despite all the challenges he and his family face, Nacasio says many people like himself still count themselves lucky.
“At least we own our house,” he said. “If we didn’t and we had to pay rent, I don’t know what we would do. I just need things to change, for us and for everybody. Things cannot continue like this.”

MOSCOW, February 16. /TASS/. A senior Russian lawmaker has advised Polish President Karol Nawrotski to stop dreaming about obtaining nuclear weapons.
"I would not advise Nawrotski, even for the sake of domestic PR, to flex his nuclear muscles, which are unlikely to ever be built up," Leonid Slutsky, chairman of the international committee of the Russian State Duma, or lower house of parliament, and leader of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia (LDPR), wrote on his Telegram channel, commenting on the Polish president’s interview with the Polsat television channel, where he said that he wants Poland to strengthen its security "even on the basis of nuclear capacities."
Poland, in his words, will never be able to obtain nuclear weapons "either from the political or military-technical point of view.".

‘Joyful yet tearful’: Khalil Hathaleen on charges for Yinon Levi
The brother of slain Palestinian Awdah Hathaleen says Israeli prosecutors’ plan to indict settler Yinon Levi is welcome news, but a charge of manslaughter “doesn’t rise to the level of the crime.” Levi was recorded wildly firing his gun after antagonising locals in Umm al-Khair.

Shipwrecked sailor and his dog airlifted to safety after crashing into rocks
This is the moment that a shipwrecked sailor and his dog were rescued after their boat ran aground in South Carolina.
Footage released by the US Coast Guard Southeast on Friday (13 February) shows military personnel lowering themselves onto the stranded vessel from a helicopter after receiving a distress call.
The sailor and his pet were both lifted off the wrecked 37-foot vessel’s deck to safety. No injuries were reported.
“Running aground can quickly become dangerous, especially near rocks and shifting conditions,” Lt. Josh Hamilton, a Coast Guard Air Station Savannah pilot, said.
“We encourage all boaters to carry proper communication equipment and continuously monitor Channel 16 so we can respond without delay when every second counts.”

'Racist slob' and 'modern Klansman' Randy Fine faces resignation calls over rabid anti-Muslim post
Unknown

04:25:41 KST

Randy Fine, notorious Florida's Republican US Congressman, has made yet another inflammatory and anti-Muslim comment, with his latest remark likening dogs to Muslims and urging Americans to select the former "if they (Muslims) force us to choose."
Fine ignited widespread outrage and condemnation after posting, "If they force us to choose, the choice between dogs and Muslims is not a difficult one" — a comment particularly timed near Ramadan and targeting an entire faith group of nearly 2 billion Muslims globally.
Fine claimed the racist comment was a response to what was a joke by Nerdeen Kiswani, founder of the New York City-based Palestinian network Within Our Lifetime.
"Finally, NYC is coming to Islam. Dogs definitely have a place in society, just not as indoor pets," she wrote last week. "Like we’ve said all along, they are unclean."
"Lmao at the Zionists frothing at the mouth at this, thinking they're doing something. It's obviously a joke," Kiswani clarified later without mentioning Fine.
"I don't care if you have a dog, I do care if your dog is shitting everywhere and you're not cleaning it."
Another post from Kiswani clarified that it referenced individuals displeased by the amount of dog excrement left on piles of frozen snow throughout the city.
'Randy Fine is an ugly bigot'
Following the Republican’s comments about Muslims, California Governor Gavin Newsom called for the resignation of Fine, who is Jewish and has previously been criticised by Democrats, civil rights groups, and Jewish organisations for his anti-Muslim views and celebration of genocide in Gaza.
"Resign now, you racist slob," Newsom wrote on X.
Cameron Kasky, a Jewish activist, wrote on X in response to Fine's post: "Imagine if an American politician said this about Jews."
"Randy Fine is an ugly bigot. He should not be in Congress," said Representative Brendan Boyle, a Pennsylvania Democrat.
Representative Yassamin Ansari, an Arizona Democrat, said: "If anyone said something this vile in any workplace, they'd be fired. Randy Fine has repeatedly dehumanised Muslims without consequence. It's unacceptable and should not be normalised by Congress. @SpeakerJohnson should reprimand him immediately. And if Fine cannot meet the most basic standard of human dignity, he should resign."
The Council on American-Islamic Relations issued a statement on Monday demanding that congressional leaders call for Fine's resignation, describing his rhetoric, including this comment and prior ones, as racist, comparing him to a "modern Klansman and Nazi" targeting Muslims and Palestinians, and highlighting it as part of a pattern including calls for the destruction of "mainstream Muslims."
Celebrating genocide
In 2021, when a user on X asked Fine how he sleeps at night in a post that had the image of a dead Palestinian child pulled from rubble, the rabble-rousing politicians quipped, "Quite well, actually! Thanks for the pic!"
Fine has repeatedly lauded the deaths and suffering in Gaza genocide, remarking recently, "The Palestinian cause is an evil one.… We nuked the Japanese twice [in World War II]."
During a House committee hearing last year, Fine stated: "I don’t know how you make peace with those (Muslims) who seek your destruction, I think you destroy them first."
Fine has previously called for a "Muslim travel ban," "radical deportations of all mainstream Muslim legal and illegal immigrants," and "citizenship revocations wherever possible," claiming "Mainstream Muslims have declared war on us" and that they should be "kicked the hell out of America."
He has previously threatened Muslim Congresswomen like Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib, remarking "The Hebrew Hammer is coming" with "#BombsAway".
Fine, known for his hateful remarks, caused uproar after celebrating Israel’s killing of 26-year-old Turkish-American activist Aysenur Ezgi Eygi in the occupied West Bank, labelling Eygi a "Muslim terrorist."

Finland Determines Location for NATO Forward Land Forces Headquarters

Finland has determined the permanent location for NATO’s forward land forces headquarters. It will be in Rovaniemi, the administrative center of Lapland.
The decision was made by Finland’s Defense Minister Antti Häkkänen, according to Yle.
This refers to a multinational group of NATO’s forward-deployed land forces (Forward Land Forces) that will operate within the country.
The units will mainly operate in the northern regions of Finland, which is in line with the Alliance’s defense planning on the northern flank.
According to the defense minister, Rovaniemi was chosen for its operational expediency and “synergy effect” for the interaction of allied forces.
The headquarters will have permanent status and a continuous presence in Finland. The number of personnel may vary depending on the tasks.
During training periods or in the event of an escalation of the security situation, the contingent is planned to be increased, potentially to brigade level.
Regular rehearsals of scenarios for the rapid deployment of additional forces and equipment to the area of deployment are planned.
Sweden has taken on a key role in the formation of the group. Denmark, Norway, Iceland, the United Kingdom, France, and Italy are also involved.
The deployment of Forward Land Forces in Finland is part of a broader adaptation of NATO’s force structure following the country’s accession to the Alliance.
Earlier, President of Finland Alexander Stubb stressed that NATO membership had become a critical security factor for Finland and Sweden in the changed geopolitical situation.
Militarnyi also recently reported that NATO’s forward brigade in Finland will be formed on the basis of Swedish units.

California governor ‘a loser’, says Trump as state signs green energy deal with UK
Unknown

04:23:52 KST

Donald Trump has vented his fury against a green energy deal between the British government and California’s governor, Gavin Newsom, a likely future Democratic presidential candidate.
“The UK’s got enough trouble without getting involved with Gavin Newscum,” Trump said in an interview with Politico, using the derogatory nickname he reserves for Newsom. “Gavin is a loser. Everything he’s touched turns to garbage. His state has gone to hell, and his environmental work is a disaster.”
In an intervention that is likely to be clocked by British government officials wary of potential new landmines in the UK’s relationship with the White House, Trump went on to say it was “inappropriate” for Newsom to strike such agreements and “inappropriate for them [the UK] to be dealing with him”.
Newsom, one of the loudest domestic opponents of the US president on issues ranging from ICE deportation raids to the climate crisis, signed a memorandum of understanding in London with the UK’s energy secretary, Ed Miliband.
Their agreement is aimed at deepening existing cooperation between the UK and California and creates a new framework to scale up clean energy technologies and enhance ties between businesses and researchers in Britain and the US state, which is in effect the world’s fourth largest global economy.
The UK and California will also share practical expertise on protecting biodiversity and building resilience amid extreme weather, Miliband’s department announced on Monday.
Miliband said: “Strong international partnerships like today’s announcement with the state of California strengthen opportunities for UK businesses and secure investment for our country.”
The signing follows their meeting in New York in September. On Monday in London, Newsom and Miliband also discussed AI and the implications for energy, and lessons from California’s wildfires – over which Trump and Newsom have clashed, the US president blaming them on the state’s management of fires.
A source close to Miliband said: “It was a productive meeting based on the huge clean energy jobs and investment opportunities that the UK and California can bring to one another.”
Newsom was in London just after attending the Munich Security Conference, where he said: “Donald Trump’s administration is temporary. California’s commitment is not.”
The governor also used his visit to Europe to continue cultivating European leaders who have been notably outspoken in their opposition to policies pursued by the Trump administration.
Last week he met Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, who was quick to join Latin American countries in condemning the recent US military intervention in Venezuela, and the German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, who used an appearance in Munich to criticise Trump’s reorientation of US foreign policy.
Both Newsom and Miliband are bete noires for the new populist right. Nigel Farage, the leader of the hard-right Reform UK party, said on Monday that he believed Miliband was the most likely candidate to take over from Keir Starmer if the latter is forced out in the event of a disastrous Labour party performance in upcoming local elections. Farage said Labour would then “shift to the left”.

Hamas ‘used emojis’ to signal start of the October 7, 2023 attack on Israel
Citing the army, Israeli media reported that emojis were found on mobile phones belonging to members of Hamas’ elite Nukhba Forces unit
The militant Palestinian organisation Hamas used emojis to signal to its fighters the start of the attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, the Israeli TV channel N12 reported on Monday.
It cited the Israeli army as its source but a military spokeswoman was initially unable to officially confirm the story.
According to the report, the emojis were found on mobile phones belonging to members of Hamas’ elite Nukhba Forces unit, which were seized by the Israelis on the day of the attack. The specific emojis were not disclosed.
Militants from Hamas and other extremist groups killed more than 1,200 people in Israel in the assault and took more than 250 others hostage in Gaza.
The Jerusalem Post newspaper reported that Hamas fighters had moved to mosques or designated assembly points in Gaza after receiving the emoji signal.

Winter Olympics recap: Meyers Taylor finally gets gold for US and Eileen Gu wins second silver
Winter Olympics recap: Meyers Taylor finally gets gold for US and Eileen Gu wins second silver
MILAN (AP) — Small margins decided gold medals at the Milan Cortina Olympics as Eileen Gu had to settle for another silver in defense of her big air ski freestyle title and Elana Meyers Taylor of the U.S. finally won bobsled gold in her fifth Olympics.
Also on Day 10 of the Winter Games, a Norwegian contender’s emotional reaction overshadowed the last men’s Alpine ski event, and the U.S. and Canada advanced to another gold medal showdown in women’s hockey after winning their semifinal games.
Silver again for Gu in big air
Gu came to Italy to fight for gold medals in three different freestyle ski events. She has two silvers and still has her best event, the halfpipe, to go.
After a long delay because of heavy snow, it was Canada’s Megan Oldham who soared to victory with a combined score of 180.75 to Gu’s 179.
It was still a remarkable performance from Gu, the San Francisco-born skier for China who hadn’t competed in big air in the four years since winning gold at the 2022 Olympics.
The athlete who beat Gu to the gold in slopestyle last week, Switzerland’s Mathilde Gremaud, was ruled out of the big air final when she injured her hip in practice hours before.
The wait is over for Meyers Taylor
Vancouver, Sochi, Pyeongchang, Beijing. Meyers Taylor won at least one medal at each of her first four Olympics, but the gold always eluded her.
No longer.
The 41-year-old American won that long-awaited medal by just four hundredths of a second in women’s monobob when the last competitor, Germany’s Laura Nolte, made a small but costly mistake on her final run.
Meyers Taylor’s sixth career medal extends her record as the most decorated Black athlete at the Winter Olympics. She’s also the oldest American woman to win gold at the Winter Games.
Meyers Taylor’s U.S. teammate Kaillie Armbruster Humphries was third, 0.08 off Nolte’s time.
McGrath’s moment alone in the forest
The men’s slalom race had a finish like no other.
Norway’s Atle Lie McGrath was leading the race and skiing last on the second run but straddled a gate and was out. He stopped, threw his ski poles over a fence and then started walking through deep snow to the forest for some time alone.
“I thought that I would get some peace and quiet, which I didn’t,” said McGrath, who said photographers and police tracked him down.
The dramatic finish overshadowed Loic Meillard of Switzerland winning gold, and an earlier fall for giant slalom winner and South American history maker Lucas Pinheiro Braathen.
It’s been an especially tough Olympics for McGrath, whose grandfather died on the day of the opening ceremony. McGrath was racing with an armband as a tribute.
US-Canada again for women’s hockey gold
The U.S. and Canada will play for the gold medal on Thursday after the U.S. routed Sweden 5-0 and Canada struggled past Switzerland 2-1 in Monday’s semifinal games.
U.S. goaltender Aerin Frankel preserved a shutout streak which now stands at 331 minutes. The U.S. team is unbeaten and has allowed just one goal all tournament as it seeks a first gold medal since 2018.
Captain Marie-Philip Poulin broke the all-time Olympic scoring record with two goals in an unusually narrow win for Canada.
World record gives Japan a figure skating win
Riku Miura and Ryuichi Kihara needed something special after placing fifth in the pairs figure skating short program. They delivered.
Miura and Kihara produced a world record score in the free skate to win Japan’s first-ever pairs gold.
Georgia got its first medal in any Winter Olympic sport with Anastasiia Metelkina and Luka Berulava in second. Short-program leaders Minerva Fabienne Hase and Nikita Volodin of Germany dropped to the bronze medal position.
Xandra Velzeboer won her second gold medal of the Olympics in the women’s 1,000-meter short track speedskating to match her Dutch teammate Jens van ’t Wout with two gold medals for the games. Italy’s Arianna Fontana was chasing what would have been her 14th career Olympic medal but placed fourth.
Austria won the first-ever Olympic gold in men’s super team ski jumping. The Austrians were leading when the competition was cut short due to heavy snow and wind.

California braces for a major winter storm expected to bring heavy rain and snow

California walloped by winter storm with high winds and heavy rain and snow
California walloped by winter storm with high winds and heavy rain and snow
California was walloped Monday by a powerful winter storm carrying treacherous thunderstorms, high winds and heavy snow in mountain areas.
Millions of Los Angeles County residents faced flash flood warnings as rain pounded the region and people in some areas scarred by last year’s devastating wildfires were under an evacuation warning through Tuesday because of the potential for mud and debris flows.
Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass ordered emergency crews and city departments to be ready to respond to any problems.
The storm wreaked havoc on roadways spanning from Sonoma County to the Sierra Nevada. Traffic was halted temporarily in both directions on I-80 near the Nevada state line due to spinouts and crashes, the California Department of Transportation reported. In Santa Barbara County, a large tree toppled onto US-101, shutting down southbound lanes.
Forecasters said the western slope of the Sierra Nevada, northern Shasta County — including portions of Interstate 5 — and parts of the state’s Coast Range could see up to 8 feet (2.4 meters) of snow before the storm moves through late Wednesday. The heavy snow, wind and low visibility could also make travel conditions dangerous to near impossible, forecasters added.
“It has seemed ‘springlike’ for a large part of 2026, but winter is set to show it’s not quite done yet,” the Shasta County Sheriff’s Office said in a social media post urging residents to stay aware of the storm.
California’s Office of Emergency Services said it was placing fire and rescue personnel and resources in areas most at risk for flooding, mud and debris flows.
In Southern California, Six Flags Magic Mountain was closed Monday due to the storm, and Knotts Berry Farm amusement park shut its doors early. But the winter weather was celebrated by local ski resorts that have waited weeks for snow.
Other states on Monday braced for different threatening weather events. Residents in parts of eastern Colorado received warnings that they could be in fire danger due to a combination of abnormally high temperatures, gusty winds and dry conditions. The risks were expected to continue further into the week as gusts up to 60 mph (96 kph) are likely to hit the Colorado eastern plains on Tuesday. Parts of Texas, New Mexico and Kansas were also under red flag warnings.
The latest storm comes amid a snow drought across much of the American West, with snow cover and depth measuring at the lowest levels scientists have seen in decades. Most states saw half their average precipitation or less in January, though California fared better others due to heavy rains in December.
It was the first of several days of stormy weather forecast for California. A coastal flood advisory was in effect for San Francisco until Tuesday afternoon, with cooler showers and a chance of hail on Tuesday, while nearby mountains were expecting snow, the National Weather Service in Monterey reported.
Kashawna McInerny, a Realtor in the mountain community of Wrightwood, about 80 miles (130 kilometers) northeast of Los Angeles, on Monday said she was still dealing with several tons of rock and debris on her property from Christmas and New Year’s storms that pummeled the community. After the last one, she said she got help trenching part of her side yard to direct stormwater down the street and placed a barrier of metal and wood by a door in hopes of keeping out mud and debris.
“We’re not panicking yet. At least I’m not,” she said with a laugh.

Prosecutors plan to charge an Israeli settler with killing a Palestinian activist in the West Bank

Prosecutors plan to charge an Israeli settler with killing a Palestinian activist in the West Bank
RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) — Israeli prosecutors said Monday that they plan to charge a settler in the killing of a Palestinian activist during a confrontation that was caught on video, opening a rare prosecution of violence by Jewish settlers in the occupied West Bank.
Attacks from settlers and home demolitions by authorities have spiked dramatically over the past two years, but the death in July of Awdah Hathaleen has drawn particular attention due to his involvement in the 2025 Oscar-winning film “No Other Land,” which chronicled Palestinian villagers’ fight to stay on their land. The case also stands out because the confrontation between Palestinians and Yinon Levi, an internationally sanctioned settler, was captured on video from multiple vantage points.
In a video that family members say was taken by Hathaleen himself, Levi could be seen firing toward the person holding the camera. Another showed Levi firing two shots without showing where the bullets struck.
An Israeli judge released Levi from custody six months ago, citing a lack of evidence that he fired the shots that killed Hathaleen.
Israel’s State Attorney General’s office confirmed in a statement Monday that it had initiated proceedings to indict Levi. It did not specify the charges.
Eitan Peleg, an attorney for Hathaleen’s family, said the office had informed them it planned to indict Levi for reckless homicide, triggering a process that allows Levi to contest charges before they’re formally filed.
“Enforcement of the law in cases like this involving Palestinians in the West Bank is very rare, so this is unique,” Peleg told The Associated Press on Monday.
Israel’s military referred questions on the indictment to police, who have not yet responded. Both bodies enforce laws in the area.
More than 3.4 million Palestinians and 700,000 Israelis live in the occupied West Bank and east Jerusalem, territories captured by Israel in 1967 and sought by Palestinians for a future state. The international community overwhelmingly considers Israeli settlement construction in these areas to be illegal and an obstacle to peace.
Palestinians and rights groups say authorities routinely fail to prosecute settlers or hold them accountable for violence. Under National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, investigations into settler attacks have plummeted, according to the Israeli rights group Yesh Din.
Khalil Hathaleen, Awdah’s brother, said the family was glad some measure of justice was being pursued but felt the charge of “reckless homicide” was insufficient.
“It was an intentional killing in broad daylight, with prior intent and premeditation,” he said.
Levi’s attorney, Avichai Hajbi, declined Monday to comment on the coming indictment, which he said he hadn’t received. After the shooting, he told The Associated Press that Levi acted in self-defense, without elaborating. Levi did not answer phone calls Monday.
Parts of the confrontation were filmed
Video released last year by B’Tselem, an Israeli human rights group showed Levi firing a gun toward the person filming. At the moment that B’Tselem says Hathaleen collapsed, the visuals are jostled but moans of pain can be heard. The group said it obtained the video from the family of Hathaleen, who said he filmed it.
Additional footage obtained by the AP last year showed Levi waving a pistol during the standoff in Umm al-Khair that was with a group of Palestinians over an excavator that had rolled down from a nearby settlement and damaged Palestinian property earlier in the day.
Alaa Hathaleen, a cousin who filmed the encounter, told AP at the time that he had approached Levi to tell him the group was unarmed and to stop the bulldozing.
In the video, one Palestinian insults Levi and another challenges him to shoot. Levi shoves someone just out of the frame, demands to know who threw stones, and later fires a shot, seemingly away from the crowd. He then fires again and yells toward the crowd to get away from the excavator.
The footage did not show where bullets struck, though other relatives said they saw Awdah Hathaleen fall immediately after shots were fired.
Levi was detained before being released to house arrest. That condition was eventually lifted, too.
Levi was among the Israeli settlers sanctioned by the United States and other Western countries over allegations of violence toward Palestinians in 2024. U.S. President Donald Trump lifted the U.S. sanctions after taking office the following year.
Attacks spike as spotlight grows
Activists and crew members on the film “No Other Land” have said settler attacks have intensified on the village portrayed since the movie won the Oscar.
Hamdan Ballal, one of the film’s directors, said his family home in Umm al-Khair was subject to another attack on Sunday. Four relatives were arrested during the confrontation, he said.
Ballal said a soldier, who came to their home accompanied by another soldier and a settler-herder, grabbed his brother by the neck and tried to choke him. Neither the army nor the police responded to requests for comment on the incident.
“The year after I won the Oscar, the assaults increased significantly. On a daily basis, settlers come and destroy the fields, destroy the trees, destroy the crops around the house,” he said.
Israeli proof-of-ownership rules spark anger
As prosecutors move to indict Levi and violence persists across the West Bank, Israel is moving ahead with measures to deepen its control over land in the occupied territory.
On Sunday, it announced it would resume a land registration process across the West Bank to require anyone with a claim to land to submit documents proving ownership. Rights groups say the process could strip Palestinians of land they’ve lived on and farmed for generations and transfer vast swaths of land to Israeli state control.
Israel’s Foreign Ministry said the steps countered Palestinian Authority land registration efforts in areas where Israel maintains civil and military control.
The measures follow years of accusations by Palestinians that actions by settlers and the military — campaigns of violence, harassment and demolitions — have pushed them from their land.
The decisions have drawn widespread condemnation as violations of international law, including from countries involved in the ceasefire process in the Gaza Strip and Trump’s Board of Peace.
Saudi Arabia’s Foreign Ministry in a statement on Monday said the measures were part of Israel’s effort to impose a “new legal and administrative reality” that undermines prospects for peace and stability. Egypt’s Foreign Ministry called the move a “flagrant violation” of international law, warning it would escalate tensions in the Palestinian territories and across the region.
U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres condemned Israel’s decision, calling it not only destabilizing but unlawful according to the International Court of Justice, the U.N.’s highest tribunal, his spokesman Stéphane Dujarric said.

Robert Duvall, Oscar-winning actor and ‘Godfather’ mainstay, dead at 95
LOS ANGELES (AP) — Robert Duvall, the Oscar-winning actor of matchless versatility and dedication whose classic roles included the intrepid consigliere of the first two “Godfather” movies and the over-the-hill country music singer in “Tender Mercies,” has died at age 95.
Duvall died “peacefully” at his home Sunday in Middleburg, Virginia, according to an announcement from his publicist and from a statement posted on his Facebook page by his wife, Luciana Duvall.
“To the world, he was an Academy Award-winning actor, a director, a storyteller. To me, he was simply everything,” Luciana Duvall wrote. “His passion for his craft was matched only by his deep love for characters, a great meal, and holding court. For each of his many roles, Bob gave everything to his characters and to the truth of the human spirit they represented.”
The bald, wiry Duvall didn’t have leading man looks, but few “character actors” enjoyed such a long, rewarding and unpredictable career, in leading and supporting roles, from an itinerant preacher to Josef Stalin. Beginning with his 1962 film debut as Boo Radley, the reclusive neighbor in “To Kill a Mockingbird,” Duvall created a gallery of unforgettable portrayals. They earned him seven Academy Award nominations and the best actor prize for “Tender Mercies,” which came out in 1983. He also won four Golden Globes, including one for playing the philosophical cattle-drive boss in the 1989 miniseries “Lonesome Dove,” a role he often cited as his favorite.
In 2005, Duvall was awarded a National Medal of Arts.
He had been acting for some 20 years when “The Godfather,” released in 1972, established him as one of the most in-demand performers of Hollywood. He had made a previous film, “The Rain People,” with Francis Coppola, and the director chose him to play Tom Hagen in the mafia epic that featured Al Pacino and Marlon Brando among others. Duvall was a master of subtlety as an Irishman among Italians, rarely at the center of a scene, but often listening and advising in the background, an irreplaceable thread through the saga of the Corleone crime family.
“Stars and Italians alike depend on his efficiency, his tidying up around their grand gestures, his being the perfect shortstop on a team of personality sluggers,” wrote the critic David Thomson. “Was there ever a role better designed for its actor than that of Tom Hagen in both parts of ‘The Godfather?’”
In another Coppola film, “Apocalypse Now,” Duvall was wildly out front, the embodiment of deranged masculinity as Lieutenant Colonel Bill Kilgore, who with equal vigor enjoyed surfing and bombing raids on the Viet Cong. Duvall required few takes for one of the most famous passages in movie history, barked out on the battlefield by a bare-chested, cavalry-hatted Kilgore: “I love the smell of napalm in the morning. You know, one time we had a hill bombed, for 12 hours. When it was all over, I walked up. We didn’t find one of ‘em, not one stinkin’ dink body.
“The smell, you know that gasoline smell, the whole hill. Smelled like — victory.”
Coppola once commented about Duvall: “Actors click into character at different times — the first week, third week. Bobby’s hot after one or two takes.”
Honored, but still hungry
He was Oscar-nominated as supporting actor for “The Godfather” and “Apocalypse Now,” but a dispute over money led him to turn down the third Godfather epic, a loss deeply felt by critics, fans and “Godfather” colleagues. Duvall would complain publicly about being offered less than his co-stars.
Fellow actors marveled at Duvall’s studious research and planning, and his coiled energy. Michael Caine, who co-starred with him in the 2003 “Secondhand Lions,” once told The Associated Press: “Before a big scene, Bobby just sits there, absolutely quiet; you know when not to talk to him.” Anyone who disturbed him would suffer the well-known Duvall temper, famously on display during the filming of the John Wayne Western “True Grit,” when Duvall seethed at director Henry Hathaway’s advice to “tense up” before a scene.
Duvall was awarded an Oscar in 1984 for his leading role as the troubled singer and songwriter Mac Sledge in “Tender Mercies,” a prize he accepted while clad in a cowboy tuxedo with Western tie. In 1998, he was nominated for best actor in “The Apostle,” a drama about a wayward Southern evangelist which he wrote, directed, starred in, produced and largely financed. With customary thoroughness, he visited dozens of country churches and spent 12 years writing the script and trying to get it made.
Among other notable roles: the outlaw gang leader who gets ambushed by John Wayne in “True Grit"; Jesse James in “The Great Northfield Minnesota Raid"; the pious and beleaguered Frank Burns in “M-A-S-H"; the TV hatchet man in “Network"; Dr. Watson in “The Seven-Per-Cent Solution"; and the sadistic father in “The Great Santini.”
“When I was doing ‘Colors’ in 1988 with Sean Penn, someone asked me how I do it all these years, keep it fresh. Well, if you don’t overwork, have some hobbies, you can do it and stay hungry even if you’re not really hungry,” Duvall told The Associated Press in 1990.
In his mid-80s, he received a supporting Oscar nomination as the title character of the 2014 release “The Judge,” in which he is accused of causing a death in a hit-and-run accident. More recent films included “Widows” and “12 Mighty Orphans.”
Ungifted in school, gifted on stage
Robert Selden Duvall grew up in the Navy towns of Annapolis and the San Diego area, where he was born in 1931. He spent time in other cities as his father, who rose to be an admiral, was assigned to various duties.
The boy’s experience helped in his adult profession as he learned the nuances of regional speech and observed the psyche of military men, which he would portray in several films.
Duvall reportedly used his Navy officer father as the basis for his portrayal of the explosive militarist in “The Great Santini,” based on the Pat Conroy novel. He commented in 2003: “My dad was a gentleman but a seether, a stern, blustery guy, and away a lot of the time.” Bobby took after his mother, an amateur actress, in playing a guitar and performing. He was a wrestler like his father and enjoyed besting kids older than himself.
He lacked the concentration for schoolwork and nearly flunked out of Principia College in Elsah, Illinois. His despairing parents decided he needed something to keep him in college so he wouldn’t be drafted for the Korean War. “They recommended acting as an expedient thing to get through,” he recalled. “I’m glad they did.” He flourished in drama classes.
“Way back when I was in college,” Duvall told the AP in 1990, “there was a wonderful man named Frank Parker, who had been a dancer in World War I. We did a full-length mime play and I played a Harlequin clown. I really liked that.
“Then, I played an older guy in ‘All My Sons,’ and at one point I had this emotional moment, where this emotion was pouring out. Parker said at that moment he didn’t think acting can be carried any further than that. And this guy was a very critical guy. So I thought, at that moment at least, this is what I wanted to do.”
After two years in the Army, he used the G.I. Bill to finance his studies at the Neighborhood Playhouse in New York, hanging out with such other young hopefuls as Robert Morse, Gene Hackman and Dustin Hoffman. After a one-night performance in “A View From the Bridge,” Duvall began getting offers for work in TV series, among them “The Naked City” and “The Defenders.”
Between his high-paying jobs in major productions, Duvall devoted himself to directing personal projects: a documentary about a prairie family, “We’re Not the Jet Set”; a film about gypsies, “Angelo, My Love”; and “Assassination Tango,” in which he also starred.
Duvall had been a tango dancer since seeing the musical “Tango Argentina” in the 1980s and visited in Argentina dozens of times to study the dance and the culture. The result was the 2003 release about a hit man with a passion for tango.
His co-star was Luciana Pedraza, 42 years his junior, whom he married in 2005. Duvall’s three previous marriages — to Barbara Benjamin, Gail Youngs and Sharon Brophy — ended in divorce.

Godfather and Apocalypse Now actor Robert Duvall dies aged 95

LOS ANGELES - Robert Duvall, who played the smooth mafia lawyer in The Godfather and stole the show with his depiction of a surfing-crazed colonel in Apocalypse Now, has died at the age of 95, his wife said on Feb 16.
His death on Feb 15 was confirmed by his wife Luciana Duvall.
“Yesterday we said goodbye to my beloved husband, cherished friend, and one of the greatest actors of our time. Bob passed away peacefully at home,” she wrote.
Blunt-talking, prolific and glitz-averse, Duvall won an Oscar for best actor and was nominated six other times. Over his six decades-long career, he shone in both lead and supporting roles, and eventually became a director.
“To the world, he was an Academy Award-winning actor, a director, a storyteller. To me, he was simply everything,” Mrs Luciana Duvall said. “His passion for his craft was matched only by his deep love for characters, a great meal, and holding court.”
Duvall won his Academy Award in 1983 for playing a washed-up country singer in Tender Mercies.
But his most memorable characters also included the soft-spoken, loyal mob consigliere Tom Hagen in the first two installments of The Godfather and the maniacal Lieutenant Colonel William Kilgore in Francis Ford Coppola’s 1979 Vietnam War epic Apocalypse Now.
The latter, which earned Duvall an Oscar nomination and made him a bona fide star after years playing lesser roles, sees him utter what is now one of cinema’s most famous lines.
“I love the smell of napalm in the morning,” his war-loving character – bare chested, cocky and sporting a big black cowboy hat – muses as low-flying US warplanes bomb a beachfront tree line where he wants to go surfing.
That character was originally created to be even more over the top – his name was at first supposed to be Colonel Carnage – but Duvall had it toned down, demonstrating his meticulous approach to acting.
“I did my homework,” Duvall told veteran talk show host Larry King in 2015. “I did my research.”
Duvall was sort of a late bloomer in Hollywood – he was already 31 when he delivered his breakout performance as the mysterious recluse Boo Radley in the 1962 film adaptation of Harper Lee’s novel To Kill a Mockingbird.
He would go on to play myriad roles – a bullying corporate executive in Network (1976), a Marine officer who treats his family like soldiers in The Great Santini (1979), and then his star turn in Tender Mercies.
Duvall often said his favourite role, however, was one he played in a 1989 TV mini-series – the grizzled, wise-cracking Texas Ranger-turned-cowboy Augustus McCrae in Lonesome Dove, based on the novel by Larry McMurtry.
Film critic Elaine Mancini once described Duvall as “the most technically proficient, the most versatile, and the most convincing actor on the screen in the United States.” AFP

Report: Lebanese army sets 8-month timeline for Hezbollah disarmament north of Litani River

The Lebanese army has set a timeline of four to eight months to complete the second phase of weapons consolidation in southern Lebanon, including the disarmament of Hezbollah north of the Litani River, Lebanese media reported Monday.
Army commander Gen. Rudolph Haykal presented the timeframe to the Lebanese government during a briefing on the monthly progress of the weapons collection plan. According to reports, the timeline could be extended if necessary.
Lebanese military sources told the Qatari newspaper Al-Araby Al-Jadeed that Haykal did not set a firm deadline for collecting weapons north of the Litani but stressed the need to complete the process quickly.
The remarks come about a month after the Lebanese army announced it had completed the dismantling of Hezbollah weapons south of the Litani River, a claim rejected by Israel.
The developments unfold amid a diplomatic stalemate and Hezbollah’s continued refusal to hand over its weapons, arguing that U.N. Security Council Resolution 1701 applies only to areas south of the Litani.
Several key dates are expected to shape the next phase. A committee overseeing the ceasefire monitoring mechanism is scheduled to meet on the 25th of the month. On March 5, France is set to host a conference in support of the Lebanese army and security forces.
Hezbollah Secretary-General Naim Qassem on Monday criticized the Lebanese government’s focus on weapons consolidation, calling it “a grave mistake” that serves “the goals of the Israeli enemy.”
Speaking at an event commemorating leaders of the group, Qassem said responsibility for resistance in Lebanon rests with “the state, the army and the people,” and urged continued opposition to what he described as occupation.
“If you want to surrender, amend the constitution,” Qassem said, arguing that it mandates taking all necessary measures to liberate Lebanese territory. He called for national unity and full sovereignty but opposed efforts to centralize weapons under state control.
“The government is responsible for the enemy’s greed because of its continuous concessions,” Qassem said, adding that Hezbollah does not seek war but is prepared to defend itself. “There is a big difference between defense and initiating a war.”
Meanwhile, the military in Israel said it carried out a strike in the Tulousa area of southern Lebanon targeting a Hezbollah member. Lebanese reports said one person was killed in a strike on a vehicle, identifying him as Ahmad Tarmas.
Early Sunday, the military said it struck sites used to store weapons and launchers belonging to Hezbollah. Strikes targeting what Israel describes as Hezbollah’s attempts to rebuild its capabilities have continued daily through airstrikes, drone attacks on vehicles and artillery fire, amid the lack of diplomatic progress.

Israel’s 'land grab' in occupied West Bank flagrant violation of international law: UN
Unknown

UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Monday condemned Israel's decision to classify areas of the occupied West Bank as “state property.”
"The Secretary-General condemns the Israeli government’s Feb. 15 decision to resume land registration procedures in Area C of the occupied West Bank, following a cabinet decision in May 2025," said Guterres' spokesperson Stephane Dujarric during a news conference, warning that the move could dispossess Palestinians of their property and expand Israeli control over land in the area.
"Such measures, including Israel’s continued presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, are not only destabilising but, as recalled by the International Court of Justice, unlawful," Dujarric said.
The statement came a day after the Israeli government approved a proposal to register Palestinian land in the West Bank as "state property".
Israel’s public broadcaster reported that Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, Justice Minister Yariv Levin and Defence Minister Israel Katz submitted the proposal.
Palestinians view the measures as a prelude to the formal annexation of the West Bank and a step toward the de facto annexation of large parts of the territory, moves they say would undermine the two-state solution endorsed by the UN.
Calling on Israel to "immediately reverse these measures", Guterres warned that "the current trajectory on the ground is eroding the prospect for the two-state solution."
"The Secretary-General reiterates that all Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and the regime associated with them, have no legal validity and are in flagrant violation of international law and relevant UN resolutions," Dujarric told the press.
He also stated that Guterres called on all sides to "preserve the only path to lasting peace, a negotiated two-state solution, in line with relevant Security Council resolutions and international law."
Oslo Accords
The current administrative structure of the occupied West Bank largely stems from the 1993 Oslo Accords, which divided the territory into Areas A, B and C.
Area A, comprising about 18 percent of the occupied West Bank, includes major Palestinian cities and is under Palestinian civil and security control.
Area B, accounting for roughly 22–23 percent of the territory, falls under Palestinian civil administration with Israeli security control.
Area C, which covers around 60 percent of the occupied West Bank, remains under full Israeli occupation and contains most of the land reserves for future Palestinian urban growth, agriculture and grazing, according to the United Nations.
Roughly 150,000 Palestinians live in Area C.

Gazans who fled the enclave face traumatic return

When Rotana Al-Raqb stepped off the bus and set foot in Gaza on February 2, cameras trained on her, she could not hold back her emotions. Cries and tears intermingled. "No one should leave Gaza! No to forced exile!" she repeated, embracing her family after 11 months apart. The footage, captured by Palestinian journalists, spread rapidly on social media – Israel has barred foreign press from entering the enclave for the past 28 months.
Rotana, age 31, was among the first Gazans allowed to return to the Gaza Strip following the reopening of the Rafah border crossing with Egypt on February 2, after one year and nine months of closure imposed by Israel. As the only exit point to the outside world, Rafah's reopening had been highly anticipated and was supposed to take place during the first phase of the ceasefire agreement reached between Israel and Hamas on October 9. However, Israel made this deadline conditional on the return of all Israeli hostages, both dead and alive, held by Hamas in the enclave, a condition that was finally met on January 26.
On the bus chartered by the United Nations that was taking her and 11 other passengers to Nasser Hospital in Khan Yunis, Rotana had promised herself she would remain silent. "But when I saw all those eyes on me, I couldn't stay quiet anymore. I had to get the message across: This journey is a nightmare," said the mother, reached by Le Monde over the phone from Gaza. In March 2025, she went to Egypt with her mother, who needed cardiac treatment, but her husband and five children were not allowed to travel with her. Rotana, like many Gazans returning home, had to endure a grueling journey marked by humiliation and intimidation.

India sentences 3 to death for rape of Israeli and Indian women, killing of Indian man
Judge says ‘extreme brutality’ of crime merits punishment; in March 2025, the three attacked a group of 5 tourists stargazing near canal, pushed men into water, raped women
An Indian court on Monday sentenced three men to death for gang raping an Israeli woman and an Indian woman and for killing an Indian man, according to news outlets in the South Asian country.
In the March 2025 incident, a group of three men allegedly attacked a group of five people that included an Israeli woman and an American man who were on a stargazing outing.
According to the NDTV Indian news outlet, the three assailants were sentenced to death by a district court in the southwest state of Karnataka, after being found guilty last year of murder, gang rape, and robbery.
The English-language newspaper, The Hindu, identified the three as Handi Malla, 22, Chaitannay Sai, 21, and Sharanappa Sharanabasavaraj, 27.
According to the paper, the judge “noted the extreme brutality” of the crime, and underscored that “such heinous crimes” against Indian citizens and tourists merit the death penalty.
The sentence is pending confirmation from a higher court, reports added.

The attack happened when a 29-year-old Indian woman, who was hosting travelers, took her guests, two Indian men, an American man, and a 27-year-old Israeli woman, on a stargazing trip at the Tungabhadra Canal.
According to Indian media reports, the five were sitting and playing guitar by the canal when three men on a motorbike approached the group and asked for directions to a gas station, before demanding money.
The three attackers then pushed the three men into the canal and sexually assaulted the two women. One of the Indian men, Bhibash Kumar Nayak, 26, drowned.
The attackers also stole some of the group’s personal belongings and fled. They were found by police and arrested days later in the neighboring state of Tamil Nadu.
There were 31,000 reported rapes in India in 2022, the latest year for which data is available — nearly 90 per day. Several high-profile cases of rape and murder in recent years led to widespread protests.

Ukrainian Drones to be Equipped with French SAR Radars Capable of Operating Through Clouds and Fog

Ukrainian UAVs will be equipped with reconnaissance SAR radars from the French company Harmattan AI, which will enable reconnaissance even in the presence of clouds or fog.
This was announced by the CEO of Harmattan AI in an interview with Le Grand Continent.
According to him, Harmattan AI has developed a sensor that is unique in the world — a SAR radar for drones weighing less than 150 kilograms. This system will be integrated into Ukrainian systems and deployed in Ukraine.
He also noted that European manufacturers have a lot to learn from certain Ukrainian systems or certain Ukrainian manufacturers who have years of war behind them — not only since 2022, but since 2014. They have created an industry that changes every week: they have built proximity to the modern battlefield and its limitations, and this has prompted them to develop system resilience.
“Industrial cooperation is often viewed from a mercantile perspective: since some companies sell defense systems and there is a war going on, we should go and sell them there. Such a rather crude contract is undoubtedly appropriate — both for Ukrainians and for us — but it is also interesting to collect data and draw industrial and technological conclusions in order to learn what the modern theater of war is like. This involves, in particular, understanding the limitations of electronic warfare: when it is no longer possible to communicate via radio waves or position oneself using GPS, how should one act on the modern battlefield?” he explains.
In his opinion, sometimes you have to admit that the enemy is the best, and the defense sector has historically never been able to accept this. This realization is new: war has changed its form. It has become statistical. Therefore, the proportion of systems capable of operating above a certain level of capability is important.
It is not necessary for 100% of their systems to work. It is much more important that a significant proportion of the systems supplied work. Supplying 1,000 systems, 100% of which function, is much less useful than supplying 100,000 systems, 80% of which work.
This issue concerns not only production or its quality, but also the definition of the product and the program itself. Government agencies responsible for arms procurement need to completely change their approach to system procurement: it is no longer necessary to strive to completely eliminate the risks of system development. Instead, it should be recognized that fast delivery of a product is better than delivery of a perfect product — speed has become more important than quality.
“The real strategic weapon of World War II was not the bomber, but the factory. In the US, Germany, or anywhere else, all the parties that survived the war relied on it,” he emphasized.
SAR radar (synthetic aperture radar) is an active remote sensing system that uses microwave radiation to create highly detailed images of the Earth’s surface. It allows you to obtain images of territories in any weather conditions: during rain or fog, day or night.
According to the Harmattan AI website, the Sahara SAR radar can take images with a resolution of 0.25 m at a distance of 2 km and 1.2 m at a distance of 10 km. At the same time, the radar module weighs less than 3.5 kg.
It is not disclosed which Ukrainian drones will be equipped with French radars. However, it is known that in October 2025, the Ukrainian aviation holding Skyeton and the French defense company Harmattan AI announced a strategic partnership. As part of the cooperation, in particular, it is planned to integrate Harmattan AI’s sensor technologies with Skyeton’s Raybird drone.
Ukrainian companies are also working on similar developments. In 2020, Radionix presented a compact SAR radar for UAVs. It is known that at the time of the demonstration, it had already been tested on Skyeton’s Raybird-3 UAV.

BRUSSELS — Ireland on Monday sounded the alarm over a new group of Europe’s largest six economies, dubbed “E6,” amid fears that smaller countries’ interests could be bulldozed.
“I am conscious, and I say this very respectfully, a lot of the countries in that E6 will have different views on some fundamental issues,” Irish Finance Minister Simon Harris said ahead of a meeting with his eurozone peers in Brussels.
“I would much rather see a structure where countries come together on issues where they share a common view rather than the entry to the club being based on your size exclusively,” he said.

Anti-Zionist groups in Canada target Jewish children’s summer camps
Activists accuse youth programs of supporting a ‘genocidal state’; campaign marks new front in global campaign targeting Israel
Luke Tress is The Times of Israel's New York correspondent.
Anti-Zionist groups in Canada last week launched a campaign against Jewish children’s summer camps, marking a new front in activists’ global effort to dismantle the Jewish state and demonize its supporters.
A coalition of Canadian leftist and pro-Palestinian organizations announced the campaign seeking to strip accreditation from Jewish children’s summer camps due to their support for “a genocidal state.”
The campaign targeted at least 17 camps across Canada, in Ontario, Quebec, Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, and Nova Scotia.
“They pose a problem because they encourage support for a genocidal, settler-colonial state,” the campaign said of the camps.
The campaign cited the camps for alleged offenses, such as celebrating Israel’s Independence Day and Memorial Day, staffers visiting Israel, and employment of IDF veterans.
A camp in Quebec, for example, employed a woman as a counselor who had served as a social worker in the IDF. Another camp’s director was decried as a “Zionist who publicly supports Israel.” A camp in Ontario was attacked for cultural “appropriation” for using za’atar, a Middle Eastern spice.
The groups supporting the effort included the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) campaign targeting Israel, the Palestinian Canadian Congress, the anti-Israel group Just Peace Advocates, the Ontario Palestinian Rights Association, and PAJU Montreal.
Children’s camps in Canada must meet a set of standards to gain accreditation from provincial camp associations. The accreditation is a stamp of approval that means the camps meet standards for safety, health, staffing, and programming.
The campaign against the Jewish camps instructed supporters to contact provincial camp accreditors to demand that the Jewish camps lose their accreditation.
Organizers said more than 800 letters had been sent to camp associations.
Anti-Zionist groups have widened their net in recent years to targets including Jewish and Israel-affiliated nonprofits, university clubs, comedy shows, and synagogues.
The latest campaign appeared to mark the first time anti-Zionist activists held an organized, concerted effort targeting Jewish children’s camps.
The campaigners argue they are fighting against “genocide” by Israel, while opponents say the activities amount to de facto stigmatization of Jews.
Anti-Zionist activists have incessantly accused Israel of “genocide” since the Hamas invasion of Israel in October 2023. Genocide is an international crime with a strict legal definition, and international courts have not found that Israel committed the crime.
Some groups have sought to expand the legal definition of genocide to condemn the Jewish state.
The rhetoric used by the anti-Zionists has steadily escalated. In recent months, protesters chanted for Hamas outside a New York synagogue for the first time, and demonstrators in Philadelphia hanged effigies of Israeli soldiers.
The escalating rhetoric also illustrated the international nature of the campaign against Israel, where tactics adopted in one country are often followed elsewhere. After a hip-hop group in the UK led a crowd in chants of “Death to the IDF” last year, for example, the chant began appearing at protests in the US.
Jews are targeted in hate crimes more than any other group in Canada, a figure that surged following the start of the Gaza war. Recent incidents include gunfire at synagogues, violent chants at a Holocaust museum, antisemitic bullying of schoolchildren, support for terrorism on college campuses, and attempted kidnappings of Jewish women.
The announcement targeting the summer camps sparked alarm from Jewish groups.
The UJA Federation of Greater Toronto called the campaign an attempt to “bully and harass” the camps.
“This direct targeting of Jewish campers and staff is a deliberate act of intimidation,” the federation said in a statement.
The Ontario Camps Association, a non-Jewish group that accredits camps, decried the statements as “deeply concerning.”
“…Certain characterizations and claims, we believe, reflect rhetoric that is discriminatory and antisemitic in nature,” the association said in a statement. “Campaigns such as these can be a dangerous expression of the singular demonization and wholesale attempt at the delegitimization of one minority group and have no place in camp culture or elsewhere.”
The association said it was engaging with Jewish groups to evaluate the situation.

Germany and France intend to purchase Polish Piorun man-portable air defense systems as part of the SAFE program.
According to Defence24, Deputy Minister of National Defence Cezary Tomczyk announced Germany’s interest at a press conference last Friday, while France’s interest was revealed by the Polish publication’s own sources.
In the case of the French order, some of the MANPADS will be supplied to the Security and Defense Forces of Ukraine. This accounts for about 70% of the systems purchased by France.
If the agreements are finalized, Germany and France will join the users of MANPADS, which already include Belgium, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Norway, Sweden, the United States, and Ukraine.
Ukraine has been successfully using Polish MANPADS in combat since 2022 and has shot down a number of Russian helicopters, aircraft, cruise missiles, and drones with their help. Read more about this in the article.
Piorun MANPADS is a Polish anti-aircraft system developed by Mesko (leader), CRW Telesystem-Mesko, and the Military University of Technology.
It can engage aircraft, helicopters, unmanned aerial vehicles, or other flying objects at ranges from 400 m to 6.5 km and altitudes from 10 m to 4 km.

SSU Detained Perpetrators of February 11 Terrorist Attack in Kyiv

The SSU apprehended Russian agents who blew up a car in Kyiv on February 11 this year.
The Security Service of Ukraine reported this on its social media.
The perpetrators are a 47-year-old Ukrainian Armed Forces serviceman recruited by the enemy, who left his place of service in the Sumy region without permission, and his 29-year-old accomplice from Kyiv.
Russian special services purchased a used van through front men and ordered it to be converted into a supposed ambulance for transporting wounded Defense Forces soldiers.
“To do this, the car sellers installed oxygen and gas cylinders in the vehicle’s interior and equipped it with a webcam with remote access, which was then used by Russian special services,” the SSU reported.
The ‘order’ was carried out by a 47-year-old Ukrainian Armed Forces serviceman recruited by the enemy, who had left his place of service in the Sumy region without permission. After fleeing the garrison, the deserter ‘went underground’ in western Ukraine.
He enlisted the help of a 29-year-old accomplice from Kyiv, whom he introduced as a Ukrainian special services agent, and instructed him to make a homemade explosive device (HED) with remote activation.
The perpetrators first loaded the van with explosives and then blew it up while it was parked next to one of the SSU facilities.
“Gas cylinder equipment was supposed to be used to increase the destructive power of the explosion, and the Russians used video equipment to monitor the parking of the van at the site of the planned terrorist attack,” the SSU said in a statement.
After making the explosive device, the suspects placed it inside the van and quickly left the location. Russian special services then remotely detonated the vehicle.
As a result of comprehensive measures taken jointly with the National Police, investigators from the SSU Main Directorate in Kyiv and the Kyiv region, and under the procedural guidance of the prosecutor’s office, the organizers of the terrorist attack were detained within 24 hours.
“During searches of the temporary residences of the perpetrators, components for a homemade bomb, video surveillance cameras, and SIM cards were found, which were being prepared for new terrorist attacks,” the SSU reported.
Currently, Security Service investigators have notified both agents of their suspicion under Part 2 of Article 258 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine (terrorist act). The detainees are in custody. They face up to 12 years in prison with confiscation of property.

Takamitsu Muraoka, Japanese pioneer of Dead Sea Scrolls Hebrew studies, dies at 88

Takamitsu Muraoka, Japanese pioneer of Dead Sea Scrolls Hebrew studies, dies at 88
A prominent specialist in Semitic languages, Muraoka was proud to describe himself as the first Japanese student to complete a PhD at the Hebrew University
Japanese pioneer Hebraist Takamitsu Muraoka died last week in Leiden, the Netherlands, at age 88, after suffering a stroke a few weeks earlier and never fully recovering.
A specialist in Semitic languages and biblical Hebrew, Muraoka was proud to describe himself as the first Japanese student to complete a doctorate at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, according to Steven Fassberg, the Caspar Levias Professor of Ancient Semitic Languages at the Hebrew University’s Department of Hebrew Language, who knew Muraoka since the early 1990s.
The Japanese scholar, he added, advanced the study of the Dead Sea Scrolls from a linguistic perspective and remained connected to Israel and in close contact with Israeli scholars for the rest of his life, even as he moved across the world to pursue his academic career, teaching at Manchester University in the United Kingdom, at Melbourne University in Australia, and finally at Leiden University, until he retired some 20 years ago.
“[Muraoka] did a doctorate with [prominent Semitic Languages Professor] Chaim Rabin, which was published years later as a book called ‘Emphatic words and structures in Biblical Hebrew,’” Fassberg told The Times of Israel over the telephone. “While he was doing his doctoral work, he took courses with all the greats at the university at the time.”
Fassberg explained that although Muraoka’s thesis was on biblical Hebrew, he also became an expert in Aramaic. By the end of his career, he knew several ancient and modern languages.
“He was a polyglot,” Fassberg said. “His English was impeccable. His Hebrew was excellent. He knew French and German. When he went to the Netherlands, he learned Dutch so he could lecture in Dutch. And, of course, he knew the ancient languages, Greek, Aramaic, Ugaritic… He was a very, very impressive scholar.”
Both during his active career and after he retired, Muraoka remained a prolific researcher, publishing dozens of academic works.
“He updated a grammar of biblical Hebrew that had been written in French in 1923, translated it into English, and it has become a classic since it appeared in the 1990s,” Fassberg said. “He was very interested in Septuagint studies, and he published a grammar of Aramaic in the Dead Sea Scrolls and wrote a syntax of the Hebrew of the Dead Sea Scrolls.”
According to Fassberg, Muraoka was instrumental in promoting the study of the Dead Sea Scrolls – a collection of approximately 1,000 biblical and non-biblical scrolls dating between the 3rd century BCE and 1st century CE – from a linguistic perspective in the early 1990s. That’s also how they met.
“He had recently moved to Leiden from Melbourne, and he had two graduate students, one working on the Dead Sea Scrolls, and one on the book of Ben Sira,” he said, referring to the 2nd century BCE Hebrew work known as wisdom literature that is part of the Catholic biblical canon (but not of the Jewish or Protestant ones).
“He organized an international conference on the Hebrew of the Dead Sea Scrolls and in Ben Sira, and invited several people, and I was lucky enough to be one of them,” he added.
In the following years, several additional conferences on the topic were organized in different universities across the world.
“These conferences and this renewed interest in studying the Hebrew of the Dead Sea Scrolls and of Ben Sira, were all due to him because up until then, the Dead Sea Scrolls, of course, had been studied intensely and extensively, but people hadn’t really been all that interested in the language,” Fassberg said. “Some scholars were interested, but Muraoka really wanted to stress the language of the scrolls and encourage the study of the language, and he was very successful in doing so.”
The Japanese expert maintained close ties with Israel and Israeli academics.
“He was very much concerned about what was happening in Israel,” Fassberg recalled. “I remember emails [on the topic] all the way back to the assassination of Rabin [in 1995]. After Rabin was assassinated, he wrote to me that he had heard that [Rabin] had a song written on a piece of paper in his pocket when he was assassinated, and he wanted to know what the song was. In a later email, he asked me about certain words in the song. He knew modern Hebrew very well. He even published in modern Hebrew and translated at least one story by [Israeli writer Shai] Agnon into Japanese.”
Muraoka was in touch with Fassberg also in the weeks after the Hamas attack on October 7, 2023, to inquire about his well-being and his family.
“He was upset and concerned,” Fassberg recalled.
They last exchanged emails about a year ago.
Muraoka was also a devout Christian, although according to Fassberg, this never influenced his academic work.
“He was a believer, but you would never know it from reading any of his academic work,” he noted.
After he retired, Muraoka often traveled to the Far East to teach biblical Hebrew in Christian seminaries, especially in countries where occupying Japanese forces committed atrocities during the Second World War.
“He was terribly upset and embarrassed by the Japanese occupation, and this was his way of atoning for it,” Fassberg said.
Although Muraoka was born in Hiroshima in 1938, just a few years before the US dropped an atomic bomb on the city at the end of the war in 1945, he never shared publicly what happened to him or his family during that period, as far as Fassberg knows.
On a personal level, according to the Israeli professor, Muraoka was reserved but always available to his colleagues.
“He was wonderful, always extremely helpful,” Fassberg said. “If you crack the outer veneer, he had a sense of humor.”
“He will be missed,” he added.
If so, we have a request.

Top Netanyahu aide: Hamas will have 60 days to disarm or IDF will ‘complete’ mission

Top Netanyahu aide: Hamas will have 60 days to disarm or IDF will ‘complete’ mission
Cabinet secretary does not specify start date for 2-month period, echoes PM in saying Hamas must give up AK-47 rifles; IDF: Troops kill 6 more terrorists from Rafah tunnels
Israel plans to afford Hamas a 60-day period to disarm, and if it does not, the Israeli military will go back to war in the Gaza Strip, a senior adviser to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Monday.
Cabinet Secretary Yossi Fuchs made the statement a day after the premier asserted that the terror group must give up its small arms as part of the disarmament process, including its AK-47 rifles — after some reports that the terror group might be allowed to hold onto its rifles for now.
Speaking in Jerusalem to the Besheva Group conference, Fuchs said that the Trump Administration had asked for a 60-day period, and “we are respecting that.”
Fuchs clarified that he is unsure when the 60-day period starts, but it may begin with Thursday’s Board of Peace conference.
During that time, Hamas “will have to give up all of its weapons,” including rifles, he said, asserting that the terror group’s AK-47s “will be taken from them entirely.”
“We will evaluate it,” he said. “If it works, great. If not, then the IDF will have to complete the mission.”
He added that it was a “reasonable estimate” that before Israel’s next election — which is currently set for October but could be moved up to June — either Hamas will have given up its weapons or the IDF will be in the midst of an intensive new military campaign in Gaza.
Fuchs said there were many Gaza tunnels that also needed to be destroyed as part of the process.
“Today, whoever plows the fields in Be’eri sees the sea,” he says of the Gaza border kibbutz invaded and brutalized by Hamas on October 7, 2023. “There is barely a building left standing in the Gaza Strip, but the work is not yet completed.”
A day earlier, Netanyahu said that disarmament means Hamas “must give up its weapons, not [just] its main weapons,” asserting that “the one that does the most damage is called an AK-47.”
“That’s what they used in the massacre of October 7,” the prime minister said, adding that the group still holds some 60,000 rifles in Gaza.
A report in The New York Times last week said Hamas would be allowed to keep “some small arms,” at least initially, while surrendering all weapons that are “capable of striking Israel,” according to a draft plan drawn up by officials involved in the US-led Board of Peace.
According to the report, a team including US envoys Steve Witkoff, Jared Kushner and Nickolay Mladenov, the Board of Peace’s Gaza envoy, plans on sharing the document in question with Hamas in the coming weeks.
IDF: Troops kill 6 terrorists from Rafah tunnels
Meanwhile, inside Gaza, the IDF on Sunday said it had killed six more Hamas terror operatives who have been holed up for months in a tunnel in southern Gaza’s Rafah, on the Israeli side of the ceasefire line.
Dozens of Hamas operatives trapped on the Israeli side of the so-called “Yellow Line” diving Gaza in accordance with the October 2025 ceasefire agreement were believed by the military to have been there since the collapse of a previous truce in the Strip in early 2025.
The IDF has reported killing or capturing some 50 of them in recent months.
According to the military, troops of the 7th Armored Brigade carried out several “significant actions” in the tunnels in the eastern Rafah area in the past week, “in order to eliminate additional terrorists residing there.”
A week ago, the IDF said troops exchanged fire with several gunmen who emerged from a tunnel in the area.
In an update, the military said that on Sunday, during scans of the area, it was confirmed that three gunmen were killed in that exchange of fire, and the bodies of six more were located after they were “eliminated as part of the operations carried out along the tunnel route.”
The IDF said it is continuing to operate in the area “to eliminate the terrorists in the tunnel routes.”
Elsewhere in the Strip, the IDF said late Sunday night that it struck terror operatives who engaged in “suspicious activity on the ground” and approached troops in the northern Gaza Strip earlier in the day.
According to the IDF, troops of the Gaza Division’s Northern Brigade identified the operatives on the Israeli side of the Yellow Line. The army said that in addition to “carrying out suspicious activity on the ground,” the operatives approached the soldiers “in a manner that posed an immediate threat.”
After they were identified, the Israeli Air Force struck and “eliminated two of the terrorists to remove the threat,” the IDF said. It did not specify what happened to the others.
Since the start of the ceasefire in October, the IDF has said it has killed dozens of terror operatives and other “suspects” who have crossed the Yellow Line and approached troops. Such incidents have taken place on a near-daily basis.

Russian Intelligence Uses Former Wagner Group Recruiters for Sabotage in Europe
Unknown

Russian special services have begun using a network of recruiters and propagandists from the former Wagner Group to organize sabotage operations in European countries.
According to Western intelligence, after the death of Yevgeny Prigozhin, the group’s structures were integrated into the operations of the Main Directorate of the General Staff of the Russian Federation (GRU), reports the Financial Times.
Now, instead of looking for volunteers for the front, these units are focused on recruiting Europeans to carry out sabotage operations on NATO territory.
The main targets of recruiters are economically vulnerable and marginalized residents of European countries. Using established channels on Telegram and other social networks, operatives offer money for setting fire to warehouses with aid for Ukraine, politicians’ cars, or for spreading disinformation.
Western officials call such agents ‘disposable’ because they have no special training and are easily replaceable in case of failure.
The use of intermediaries from the Wagner network allows Russian intelligence to create several levels of cover between themselves and the direct perpetrators. This allows the Kremlin to deny involvement in the attacks.
Although the FSB more often turns to criminal circles and diasporas, it is Wagner’s tools that have proven to be more effective for mass recruitment through online platforms.
Western intelligence services note the high adaptability of Wagner propagandists to working with foreign audiences. Thanks to the experience of ‘troll factories’ in St. Petersburg, they create attractive content for young people prone to radicalization. Anonymous recruiters operate through encrypted chats, where they find people willing to commit crimes for quick money.
One example of such activity was the arson attack on a warehouse in London in March 2024. At that time, 21-year-old local resident Dylan Earl, recruited by Wagner structures through social media, recruited four other people to carry out the attack.
Last year, he was sentenced to 23 years in prison. The court emphasized that the hidden hand of the internet allowed anonymous proxy agents to radicalize British citizens.
Having lost a significant portion of its spies in Europe, the GUG is forced to rely on cruder and less covert methods of operation. This gives European security agencies a certain advantage, as the use of amateurs leads to poor-quality operational planning.
Currently, most sabotage attempts are detected and prevented in time. However, European intelligence services continue to gather data on an extensive network of ‘disposable’ agents across the continent. The main goal of these attacks remains unchanged — to weaken the determination of Western countries to support Ukraine and provoke social instability within Europe.

Radev Will Form a Government “One Way or Another,” Says Former Spokesman
Anton Kutev, former spokesperson for three caretaker governments, expressed confidence that former President Rumen Radev will secure a victory in the upcoming elections and establish a government regardless of circumstances. Speaking on Nova News, Kutev emphasized his readiness to support Radev’s political project, though he acknowledged that his direct participation remains uncertain.

“I do not know if I will be invited to join Radev’s initiative, but I would certainly like to contribute, as it seems both useful and meaningful. We have an opportunity to change the country, though whether we succeed remains to be seen. Even without a formal role, I am prepared to assist in any way possible,” Kutev stated. He also noted that participation is not limited to being on electoral lists.
At present, Radev has not revealed details about his project, including its name, potential partners, or who might hold the mandate, citing tight deadlines for registering a new party. Since his January 30 appearance on BNT’s “Panorama,” the president has communicated mainly through Facebook and his press office, leaving the public largely uninformed about potential coalition plans.
Recent polling by Market Links, conducted February 7-13, indicates that Radev’s forthcoming party enjoys 25.6 percent support. Other parties likely to enter parliament include GERB, “We Continue the Change-Democratic Bulgaria,” DPS-New Beginning, and “Revival.” Pollsters note that 18 percent of respondents remain undecided, representing roughly 700,000 potential votes.

Meanwhile, the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP) faces uncertainty following the appointment of Krum Zarkov as its new leader on February 7. Zarkov, a former MP, acting Minister of Justice, and Radev’s former secretary for legal affairs, has sought to distance the party from Peevski’s New Beginning. Despite previous disagreements between Zarkov and Radev over the euro referendum, their split was not acrimonious, leading to speculation that the Socialist Party could align with the presidential project - a notion Zarkov has publicly denied.

Kutev echoed this assessment, suggesting that BSP will prioritize establishing its own identity rather than forming ties with Radev. “I believe the BSP will look to assert its independence and avoid alliances with Radev. A coalition is unlikely, as it would compromise their identity. The first question is whether they even secure parliamentary representation,” he concluded.

British Museum removes some references to ‘Palestine’ after accuracy complaints
UK Lawyers for Israel prompts change, arguing applying name to periods when no such entity existed risks ‘obscuring the history of Israel and the Jewish people’
The British Museum in London has removed some references to “Palestine” and people of “Palestinian descent” in some of its displays and is reviewing more cases, deeming them historically inaccurate and no longer neutral, following complaints by a pro-Israel group.
UK Lawyers for Israel (UKLFI) said in a statement Saturday that it had raised concerns about using the term in gallery panels and labels describing the ancient Levant and Egypt.
The group said it wrote to the museum’s director, Nicholas Cullinan, that “several maps and descriptions retroactively apply the term ‘Palestine’ to periods in which no such entity existed and risk obscuring the history of Israel and the Jewish people.”
Applying a single name across thousands of years “erases historical changes and creates a false impression of continuity,” it argued, asking for the terminology to be amended “so regions are referred to by historically accurate names such as Canaan, the Kingdoms of Israel and Judah, or Judea, depending on the period being described.”
A variation of the name Palestine, which the Romans gave to the Land of Israel in the 2nd century CE, was first documented in Greek literature in the 5th century CE. It is believed to be named after the Philistines, an ancient non-Semitic people mentioned in the Bible.
UKLFI said in its statement that a spokesperson for the British Museum replied that it was “in the processes of reviewing and updating panels and labels on a case-by-case basis. For example, the information panels in the Levant gallery, covering the period 2000-300 BC, have all been updated to describe in some detail the history of Canaan and the Canaanites and the rise of the kingdoms of Judah and Israel using those names. A revised text devoted to the Phoenicians was installed in early 2025.”
One of the examples given was a panel in the Egypt galleries having been changed from “Palestinian descent” to “Canaanite descent.”
“The Museum’s spokesperson explained that the larger graphic panels and maps require significantly more coordination and resources and cannot be updated and replaced at once, given their importance for visitor navigation of the gallery,” UKLFI added. “This work is being scheduled with designers and interpreters but, because of the scale and cost, will be implemented in phases over the coming years as part of the Museum’s long-term Masterplan redevelopment.”
The museum itself confirmed making the alterations, telling media outlets that “for the Middle East galleries for maps showing ancient cultural regions, the term ‘Canaan’ is relevant for the southern Levant in the later second millennium BCE. We use the UN terminology on maps that show modern boundaries, for example, Gaza, West Bank, Israel, Jordan, and refer to ‘Palestinian’ as a cultural or ethnographic identifier where appropriate.”
Since the changes have been made, thousands have signed an online petition urging the museum to reverse them.
Reacting to the museum’s actions, UKLFI said: “We welcome the British Museum’s willingness to review and amend terminology which is inaccurate or liable to convey an incorrect meaning today. The finding of its audience testing, that the term ‘Palestine’ is in some circumstances no longer meaningful, is relevant to and should be taken on board by other museums and cultural institutions.”

Nazi-Linked Lukovmarsh Took Place in Sofia After Court Overturned City Ban
A procession in memory of Gen. Hristo Lukov took place in Sofia on Saturday, after a court decision lifted the municipality’s ban on the event.
Bulgarian State Railways (BDZ) is offering a special retro train experience from Sofia to Bankya on 1 March to celebrate Baba Marta Day, one of Bulgaria’s most beloved springtime traditions. Passengers will travel aboard historic railcar No. 19 001.7, a diesel unit built in 1960 that was once reserved for high-ranking state officials and remains notable for its advanced technical features for the era. The festively decorated train will operate two return trips during the day.
The first journey departs Sofia Central Station at 09:50 and arrives in Bankya at 10:15, with the return leaving at 11:40 to reach Sofia at 12:05. The second trip sets off from Sofia at 13:00, reaching Bankya at 13:25, and returns at 14:25, arriving back in Sofia at 14:50. Travelers can combine the ride with a stroll through Bankya’s park and town centre, both within easy reach of the station.
Tickets are sold as return journeys with reserved seating and can be purchased at station ticket offices, railway bureaux nationwide, or online. Prices are €22 (43.03 leva) for adults and €11 (21.51 leva) for children under 10, with availability limited.
Baba Marta, celebrated annually on 1 March, marks the farewell to winter and the welcoming of spring. Central to the tradition are Martenitsas, red and white twisted thread ornaments symbolizing health, happiness, and protection against evil spirits. These are exchanged with friends, family, and colleagues and are typically worn on the wrist or clothing. In some mountain villages, Martenitsas are also used to decorate homes and animals.
Traditional Martenitsas often feature two small dolls, Pizho and Penda. Pizho, the male figure, is usually white, while Penda, the female figure, is red and distinguished by her skirt. The threads used can be wool, silk, or cotton, reflecting the enduring cultural significance and charm of this centuries-old Bulgarian custom.
Today, February 14, Bulgarians across the country are raising their glasses to celebrate Trifon Zarezan, the traditional holiday honoring the patron saint of vineyards and wine.
The Bulgarian Orthodox Church today commemorates Saint Agatha the Martyr. On this day, people bearing the names Dobrin, Dobromir, Dobri, as well as women with related female names, mark their name day.

Bulgarian Court Cuts Sentence for Husband Who Killed Wife and Hid Her in a Suitcase
The Sofia Court of Appeals has reduced the sentence of Orlin Vladimirov, convicted of murdering his wife Evgenia, from life imprisonment to 20 years. Evgenia, 33, was discovered in a suitcase submerged in a pond in late 2021. Orlin Vladimirov and his father, Plamen Vladimirov, were both originally sentenced to life in prison by the Sofia Court of Appeals in 2023.
In December 2024, the Supreme Court of Cassation overturned these life sentences, citing procedural concerns, and sent the case back for a retrial before a new panel at the Court of Appeals. Following the new hearing, the court issued a 20-year prison term for Orlin Vladimirov, while his father Plamen was acquitted.
The court noted that procedural violations had occurred during the original trial. Specifically, evidence involving police officers’ reconstructions of “operational conversations” with the defendants had been improperly excluded from the discussion.
The verdict is not yet final. Julian Lefterov, the prosecutor, remarked that one member of the panel had issued a special opinion that is well-argued and consistent with decisions from other Supreme Court panels, suggesting that there are no obstacles to further questioning of witnesses.
Lyudmil Rangelov, representing the victim’s family, expressed the profound grief caused by the case, stating, “Each of you can imagine what it means to have your child's life interrupted in this way. There is no measure of suffering.”

Hamas used emojis to signal operatives to prepare for Oct. 7 assault
IDF investigation finds same string of pictograms was sent to phones of terrorists on two prior instances when Hamas had intended to launch onslaught
Emanuel (Mannie) Fabian is The Times of Israel's military correspondent
Hamas used a sequence of emojis sent to its operatives’ phones as a coded signal to prepare to launch the October 7, 2023, terror onslaught, it was revealed on Monday.
The revelation was first reported by Channel 12 news and approved for publication by the Military Censor, more than two years after the attack.
It is believed that the sequence of emojis was used to instruct members of Hamas’s elite Nukhba Force to equip their phones with Israeli SIM cards to be used in Israeli territory, to gather at various staging grounds — including in homes, mosques, and tunnels — and to prepare their weapons for the attack.
At 9 p.m. on October 6, 2023, the Shin Bet security agency identified a handful of Israeli SIM cards in the hands of Hamas Nukhba terrorists being activated.
The SIM cards were being monitored by the Shin Bet, and the agency updated IDF intelligence officials on the development. Later that night, more SIM cards were activated, totaling several dozen.
On phones seized from Hamas terrorists who invaded Israel on October 7, the IDF identified that the same string of emojis was sent on two previous instances in which Hamas intended to launch its large-scale attack, in May 2023 and September 2022.

In May 2023, the Shin Bet also identified dozens of Israeli SIM cards in the hands of Hamas terrorists being activated, though ultimately the terror group did not launch the attack then.
The use of the emojis by Hamas to notify its terrorists to prepare to launch the onslaught was only discovered retrospectively as part of the IDF’s investigations into October 7 and was not identified in real time.
The IDF’s investigations into the failures of October 7 found that the military’s conduct, decision-making, and the intelligence it possessed on the night between October 6 and 7 were based on the results of years of false assessments about Hamas.
As a result, intelligence officials on all levels failed to provide a warning for what would come. Hamas’s October 7 attack claimed the lives of more than 1,200 people in Israel, mostly civilians, with another 251 people kidnapped and much of the area devastated. It launched the war in Gaza, which raged until an October 2025 ceasefire that has largely held, though violence has continued.

Rubio to Hungary’s PM Orban ahead of election: ‘Your success is our success’

Rubio to Hungary’s PM Orban ahead of election: ‘Your success is our success’
Top US diplomat’s meetings with populist leaders of Hungary and Slovakia come on heels of his call in Munich confab for Europeans to get on board with Trump’s immigration agenda
BUDAPEST, Hungary — US Secretary of State Marco Rubio hailed Viktor Orban’s leadership during a visit to Budapest on Monday, ahead of elections threatening the nationalist Hungarian prime minister’s hold on power.
Rubio’s visit is the final stage of a whirlwind trip to Europe that also saw him address the Munich Security Conference and visit another right-wing ally, Slovakian Prime Minister Robert Fico.
US President Donald Trump has made no secret of his high regard for Orban, saying in a social media post on Friday that the prime minister, accused of leading a democratic backslide during his 16 years in power, had produced “phenomenal” results in Hungary.
But Orban, 62, has a fight on his hands for the April 12 legislative elections in Hungary. Polls suggest his Fidesz party is trailing opposition leader Peter Magyar’s TISZA.
“I can say to you with confidence that President Trump is deeply committed to your success because your success is our success,” Rubio said during a joint press conference with Orban after their meeting.
“The president has an extraordinarily close relationship to the prime minister, he does, and it has had tangible benefits,” he said.

— Clash Report (@clashreport) February 16, 2026
Orban said the government “will be created after the election in Hungary based on the intention of the Hungarians.”
“Sometimes I lose, sometimes I win,” said Orban.
“So don’t be afraid [of] what will be if we are not winning because it’s regularly happened here,” he added.
In a speech on Saturday, Orban insisted he would keep up his fight against “pseudo-civil organizations, bought journalists, judges, politicians” — echoing similar Trump tirades in the United States.
He also took aim at the “oppressive machinery of Brussels,” another jibe at the European Union’s leadership, with whom he has long been at loggerheads on a host of issues.
Orban has provoked the ire of EU leaders who accuse him of silencing critical voices in the judiciary, academia, media and civil society. They also accuse him of going after minorities.
Adding to tensions with the EU is the close relationship Orban has maintained with Russia’s President Vladimir Putin — another thing the Hungarian prime minister has in common with Trump.
European Commission spokesperson, Paula Pinho, told reporters at a press briefing that it was “up to the United States government to decide whom, when, and how they support — or not.”
Rubio arrived in Budapest on Sunday for the talks on Monday, before flying back to Washington.
The decision to visit Fico and Orban, two nationalist leaders close to both Trump and Putin and out of step with the EU consensus, sends a clear diplomatic message.
In his speech on Saturday to the Munich Security Conference, Rubio called on Europe to join Trump in his fight to defend Western civilization from the threat of mass immigration.
He tried, too, to reassure European leaders over the US position on NATO, and on Greenland — with mixed success.
But if his main message was that Europe should get behind the vision of the US president, in Bratislava on Sunday he stressed: “We’re not asking Europe to be a vassal of the United States.”
“We want to be your partner. We want to work with Europe. We want to work with our allies.”
Orban is one of several leaders to have announced he will travel to Washington this week for the inaugural meeting of Trump’s controversial “Board of Peace” — which critics see as an instrument designed to undermine the UN Security Council.
Orban became a hero to many Trump supporters for his hostility to migration during the Syrian refugee crisis a decade ago. He has made several visits to Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.
Energy was also on the agenda in Monday’s talks, just as it was in Slovakia.
When Orban visited the White House in 2025, Trump granted Hungary an exemption from sanctions imposed on Russian oil and gas imports over Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine.

NATO Will Strike Russia If It Attacks Baltics, Says Foreign Ministry of Estonia

The Foreign Minister of Estonia has stated that NATO is ready to respond harshly in the event of Russian aggression against the Baltic states.
He made these comments in an interview with The Telegraph.
According to the Foreign Minister, a possible attack by Russia would not be limited to a local conflict. The Alliance is considering scenarios for strikes on Russian territory.
This involves potential air strikes ‘deep inside Russia.’ This approach is positioned as an element of deterrence.
The minister stressed that the Baltic states have their own defense plans. They do not involve passively waiting for help.
Tallinn considers scenarios of rapid occupation of the region to be outdated. These assessments are based on growth in defense spending.
Estonia and its neighbors have declared investments of up to 5% of GDP. The emphasis is on strengthening combat capabilities.
The statements were made in the context of discussions in NATO defense circles. They concern the risks of potential escalation after the war in Ukraine.
Previously, a series of military simulations modeled rapid offensive actions by the Russian Federation. In some scenarios, Russia achieved tactical successes.
Baltic officials have criticized such models. They called such assessments politicized and unrealistic.
Official Tallinn insists on the concept of immediate repulsion. It involves deterring the aggressor from the very first hours of the conflict.
We would like to remind you that recently, Militarnyi mentioned joint defense procurement and rearmament strategies of the Baltic states.

Russian Forces Capture Rivne and Press Further Toward Pokrovsk

Civilian Deaths in Ukraine Surge 26% in 2025 Amid Intensified Russian Strikes
Civilian casualties in Ukraine rose sharply during 2025, with the impact of bombings and missile strikes increasing by 26% compared to the previous year.
Russian forces have taken control of the village of Rivne, situated between Pokrovsk and Myrnohrad in Donetsk Oblast, according to DeepState, a Ukrainian monitoring and analytical group. The capture forms part of a broader Russian push in this section of the front line.
The analysts report that, in addition to occupying Rivne, Russian units have advanced further inside the cities of Pokrovsk and Myrnohrad, as well as in the nearby town of Rodynske. These movements indicate a continued effort by Moscow’s forces to expand their foothold around the Pokrovsk axis, which has remained one of the most contested areas in eastern Ukraine.
Despite the pressure, Ukrainian defenders have continued to resist. Over the past 24 hours alone, Ukrainian forces repelled 63 Russian attacks on the Pokrovsk front. However, the overall situation has remained tense, with sustained assaults and shifting control in and around urban areas.
Earlier this month, on Feb. 6, Colonel Volodymyr Polevyi, head of communications for the 7th Air Assault Corps, said Russian troops had seized key high ground in the Myrnohrad and Pokrovsk area. According to him, this development significantly complicated logistics for Ukraine’s Defense Forces operating in the sector.
Ukraine’s East troop grouping later reported that Russian forces were concentrating personnel and heavy equipment in preparation for a possible assault on Myrnohrad. At the same time, Ukrainian units were said to be holding their defensive positions and inflicting fire damage on advancing enemy forces. The grouping also stated that Ukrainian troops retained control of the northern part of Pokrovsk and were conducting search-and-assault operations against Russian units in built-up areas of the city.
On Feb. 9, DeepState warned that conditions around Pokrovsk were worsening, noting that Russian infantry had entered the northern part of the city while disorganized and intense fighting continued in Myrnohrad. The following day, the 7th Air Assault Corps reported renewed Russian attempts to expand their offensive in Pokrovsk, including infantry assaults on the village of Hryshyne in Donetsk Oblast.
Civilian casualties in Ukraine rose sharply during 2025, with the impact of bombings and missile strikes increasing by 26% compared to the previous year.

Man Who Found Bodies in Petrohan Lodge Left Bulgaria, Investigation Continues

Death, Deception, a "Cult": Inside Bulgaria's Disturbing Petrohan Investigation
In early February 2026, Bulgaria was rocked by a grim discovery that would spiral into one of the country's most disturbing cases in recent memory.
Deyan Iliev, the man who discovered the bodies in the Petrohan lodge on February 2 and subsequently alerted the police, has left Bulgaria, according to information published by 24 Chasa. Iliev found the bodies of 49-year-old Ivaylo Ivanov, 45-year-old Decho Iliev, and 51-year-old Plamen Stattev and formally reported the case to the Ministry of Interior before departing the country a few days later.
Concerns about Iliev’s whereabouts were publicly raised by Ralitsa Asenova, whose son Nikolay Zlatkov was found dead on February 8 beneath Okolchitsa Peak alongside Ivaylo Kalushev and 15-year-old Aleksandar Makulev. Speaking on Nova TV, Asenova said Iliev had informed her about the deaths in the Petrohan lodge but had not mentioned that the victims had gunshot wounds. She also voiced serious concern, saying she had been unable to contact Iliev or his partner.
It later became clear that Iliev, known by the nickname “the Mexican,” left for Mexico last week. As there are no direct flights from Bulgaria, he first traveled to Spain. His destination is linked to his personal life, as he lives with a Mexican woman named Lola. The two previously lived together in a house in the village of Gintsi, located near the mountain rangers’ base and closest to the Petrohan lodge.
A day before discovering the bodies, Iliev received a message from Ivaylo Kalushev reading: “Goodbye, friend, we are very tired and have no more strength.” Iliev passed this information on to the Ministry of Interior. He was questioned twice and cooperated with investigators before leaving the country.
Iliev became part of Ivaylo Kalushev’s inner circle when he was 16 years old. He later took part in boat journeys to Mexico, a fact confirmed by Valeri Andreev, who has stated that he had sexual relations with Kalushev while still a minor. In recent years, however, Iliev appears to have distanced himself from the most closely initiated members of the group associated with the so-called cult of Lama Ivo, likely due to his relationship with his Mexican partner.
There are records of Iliev’s activities in Mexico until 2024, when he rented a house in the Tulum area. In 2025, he purchased a property in the village of Gintsi, near the Petrohan lodge. His family background has also drawn attention. His father, Delcho Danailov Iliev, was recruited as a counterintelligence agent in 1987, according to data from the Commission on Files. He served in the same department to which Georgi Kalushev, the father of Ivaylo Kalushev, was later transferred.
Meanwhile, investigators have stepped up their work related to Ivaylo Kalushev. Teams from the Criminal Police at the Burgas Regional Directorate of the Ministry of Interior, together with officers from the Tsarevo regional unit, are searching Kalushev’s house in the Burgas village of Bulgari, as reported by bTV and BNR. Law enforcement entered the property for the first time, having previously only inspected it from outside. The operation is focused on locating documents, while devices storing video surveillance footage are also expected to be seized, with reports indicating there are nearly ten cameras on the premises.
The bodies found on February 2 in the Petrohan lodge were followed a week later by another grim discovery. Under Okolchitsa Peak, investigators found three more bodies in an abandoned camper: 51-year-old Ivaylo Kalushev, 22-year-old Nikolay Zlatkov, and 15-year-old Aleksandar Makulev. The investigation established that between January 27 and 31, the three had been staying in the village of Bulgari before heading toward the Vratsa Balkan.
Residents of Bulgari said that shortly before leaving, Kalushev, Zlatkov, and the teenager had been repairing a water tap in the yard of the property. Their departure was described as abrupt, as they left the water shaft open and did not close the gate to the yard. A specialized locksmith team was later brought in to help open the house.
The property in Bulgari was purchased by Ivaylo Kalushev in 2022 and was used as a base for his organization near the sea. Neighbors said the previous owner was Russian. A check in the Property Register shows that Kalushev had acquired a total of 21 properties across Bulgaria over the years through purchases, donations, and inheritance. His largest asset was the Petrohan lodge itself, near which he bought five acres of land from the Ministry of Agriculture in 2021 for 4,918 leva, or about 2,514 euros. Outside Bulgaria, Kalushev also owned real estate in Mexico.
The Sofia Court of Appeals has reduced the sentence of Orlin Vladimirov, convicted of murdering his wife Evgenia, from life imprisonment to 20 years
The car and the entrance to the home of Samuil Popov, mayor of the village of Bistritsa, were deliberately set on fire in the early hours of the morning, shortly after 1:30 a.m.

WATCH the full episode here:
More from The Daily Briefing
While the prospect of American intervention in Iran appears to be receding, Horovitz discusses the mixed signals from the US and Iran and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s repeated remarks that Israel has multiple requirements for any deal that might take shape.
As election season nears, Horovitz reviews the latest efforts by the prime minister to minimize the blame attached to him for October 7, including recasting the war in Gaza as a war of revival, with that term used on the gravestones of the fallen.
Following a Haredi riot in the Tel Aviv suburb of Bnei Brak in which a mob attacked two young female soldiers visiting an ultra-Orthodox draftee, Horovitz discusses the riot, the lack of an immediate response from the police, and the idea that IDF soldiers can’t move around freely in Israel.
Finally, Horovitz and Steinberg discuss some of the latest issues facing the former hostages, as some choose to share the atrocities of their captivity, others have taken to crowdfunding to raise funds for their rehabilitation, and many are staying firmly out of the public eye.

The Fourth Law has raised a new round of strategic investment from the U.S. technology group Axon.
The funding will accelerate the development of artificial intelligence solutions for unmanned systems, the company told Militarnyi.
The partnership focuses on autonomy technologies designed for the combat deployment of drones.
Founded in Kyiv in 2023, The Fourth Law specializes in AI and robotics for defense and public safety.
Its flagship products are already in use by the Ukrainian military, including the Lupynis-10-TFL-1 unmanned aerial vehicle and the TFL-1 autonomy module.
According to the developers, Level 1 autonomy increases the effectiveness of FPV missions by 2–4 times, while raising the platform’s cost by approximately 10%.
A separate line of development is the TFL-Anti-Shahed module. The solution is designed for interceptor drones.
The system uses on-the-edge AI to detect attack UAVs. Its algorithms analyze the target’s thermal signature, movement, and other parameters.
The technology is platform-agnostic. The modules can be integrated into unmanned systems from different manufacturers and are compatible with various communication channels.
The company’s founder, Yaroslav Azhniuk, said the investment will be directed toward R&D, with priority given to developing autonomous counter-drone solutions.
Rick Smith, CEO of Axon, noted the rapid pace of development in Ukraine’s unmanned technologies. He emphasized the importance of a real combat environment for the fast evolution of AI systems.
The company said the teams were introduced through Brave1. The partnership is viewed as an example of attracting international investors to Ukraine’s defense tech sector.
Notably, Brave1 recently funded AI-based developments capable of autonomously targeting and eliminating Russian infantry.

Rubio Tells Orban: Trump Is “Deeply Committed” to Hungary’s Success as Ties Enter “Golden Age”

Orban: Europe Can “Win” by Cutting Aid to Ukraine
Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said that Europe’s “easiest path to victory” would be to stop providing financial assistance to Ukraine.
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said President Donald Trump is “deeply committed” to the success of Hungary and its prime minister, Viktor Orban, during a visit to Budapest. Rubio described relations between the two countries as exceptionally strong, arguing that the close personal ties between Trump and Orban are the key reason behind the current state of US–Hungarian cooperation.
According to Rubio, the relationship has entered what he called a “golden era,” not simply because of shared views between societies, but because of the direct and growing bond between the two leaders. He said there should be no doubt about Trump’s attitude toward Orban, recalling their interaction during Trump’s first presidential term and stressing that the connection has become even closer during his second term. Rubio underlined that Washington views Hungary’s success as directly linked to its own interests, particularly in Central Europe, and said Trump would take a personal interest if Hungary faced economic difficulties, obstacles to growth, or threats to stability.
Rubio also addressed questions about Hungary’s expanding cooperation with China, a strategic rival of the United States. He said countries inevitably pursue their own national interests, even when these do not fully align with those of their allies. The US, he stressed, does not expect any country to isolate itself from others and understands that geography, history, economic realities, and future challenges shape national decisions. Rubio added that while Washington raises concerns with partners, engagement with China is unavoidable, noting that the US itself maintains relations with Beijing and that Trump is expected to travel there in April. He said it would be unrealistic for two major global powers to avoid contact, even though serious differences remain.
Hungary has become a significant destination for Chinese trade and investment, with Budapest actively seeking Chinese capital through tax incentives and infrastructure support. This policy has drawn attention in Washington, but Rubio framed it as part of Hungary’s sovereign economic strategy rather than a point of confrontation.
On the war in Ukraine, Rubio said the United States appears to be the only country capable of bringing Ukraine and Russia to the negotiating table. He argued that neither the United Nations nor European countries have succeeded in doing so. Rubio emphasized that Washington is not attempting to impose a settlement or force either side into an unwanted agreement, but wants to help end a conflict he described as extremely destructive. He said Trump has invested significant time and political capital into peace efforts, even though negotiations have stalled over key issues, particularly territorial demands, where Russia continues to hold firm positions.
Rubio also linked past US decisions directly to the Trump–Orban relationship. He said the one-year exemption Hungary received from US sanctions last year, allowing it to continue using Russian oil and gas, was granted because of the close ties between the two leaders. According to Rubio, Washington wants Hungary’s economy to perform well and sees this as serving US national interests, especially while Orban remains in office. Hungary’s continued dependence on Russian energy since the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 has drawn criticism from several EU and NATO partners.
Rejecting claims that Hungary is becoming internationally isolated, Rubio pointed to sustained US corporate investment, crediting what he described as strong leadership and a business-friendly environment. He highlighted energy as a key sector for further bilateral cooperation. He also said US–Hungarian relations are as close as he could imagine, not just in rhetoric but in concrete actions, citing a newly signed agreement that builds on a meeting held at the White House in November. Rubio expressed hope that this agreement would be followed by many others.
For his part, Orban said Hungary would continue to back US-led peace initiatives aimed at ending the war in Ukraine. He repeated his view that the conflict would not have begun if Trump had been president at the time and argued that without Trump in office now, prospects for peace would be minimal. Orban added that Hungary remains willing to host a peace summit in Budapest if circumstances allow.
Orban acknowledged that Hungary has clashed with other Western partners over its approach to Russia, including its refusal to send weapons to Ukraine and its opposition to European Commission plans to phase out Russian gas and LNG imports by the end of 2027. These disagreements have contributed to ongoing tensions between Budapest and Brussels.
Describing ties with Washington, Orban said relations had entered a new “golden age” following Trump’s return to the White House. He said the current level of cooperation is unprecedented in his more than three decades in politics, both in terms of balance and friendliness. Orban thanked Trump personally and said that since January last year, 17 US investments have been approved in Hungary, a figure he described as a record over several decades. He also expressed appreciation for visa-free travel for Hungarians to the United States.

Iran FM meets with UN nuclear chief ahead of 2nd round of US talks, as IRGC holds drill
Araghchi vows ‘no submission before threats,’ as IRGC navy drills in Hormuz Strait amid US buildup; deputy Iranian FM says compromise on nuclear issue possible if US discusses sanctions relief
Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi met with Rafael Grossi, head of the United Nations nuclear watchdog, in Geneva on Monday, ahead of a second round of indirect nuclear talks there with the United States on Tuesday.
Araghchi said he would also meet with Omani Foreign Minister Badr al-Busaidi, whose country is mediating the talks and hosted their first round in Muscat on February 6.
The negotiations commenced amid a US naval buildup that sought to pressure Iran into reining in its nuclear program. On Monday, Iran’s Revolutionary Guards navy held a drill in the Hormuz Strait to test the readiness of operational forces in the face of “possible security and military threats,” semi-official Iranian news agency Tasnim reported.
Writing on X, Araghchi said he was in Geneva “with real ideas to achieve a fair and equitable deal” in the renewed indirect talks with US Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff and White House adviser Jared Kushner, President Donald Trump’s son-in-law.
“What is not on the table: submission before threats,” added Araghchi.
The meeting with Grossi was set to include “deep technical discussions” accompanied by nuclear experts, said Araghchi.
The IAEA has been calling on Iran for months to say what happened to its stockpile of 440 kilograms (970 pounds) of highly enriched uranium following US strikes on three key Iranian nuclear facilities during the 12-day Israel-Iran war in June, which put an end to previous US-Iran talks.
Araghchi’s direct meeting with Grossi is a significant step after Iran suspended all cooperation with the IAEA following the June war. The two also met briefly on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in September.
Iran’s stockpile of uranium enriched to 60 percent could allow the country to build as many as 10 nuclear bombs, should it decide to weaponize its program, Grossi previously told The Associated Press. He added that it doesn’t mean that Iran has such a weapon.
On Friday, Grossi told the Munich Security Conference that IAEA inspectors had returned to Iran since the war but have been unable to visit any of the facilities targeted by the US. He also said reaching a deal with Iran on inspection of its processing facilities was possible but “terribly difficult.”
While Iran, whose leaders are sworn to destroy Israel, denies seeking nuclear arms, it has enriched uranium to levels with no peaceful application, obstructed international inspectors from checking its nuclear facilities, and expanded its ballistic missile capabilities.
Iranian deputy FM: ‘The ball is in America’s court’
The second round of US-Iran talks comes after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu rushed to Washington last week to urge Trump to ensure that any deal would curtail Iran’s ballistic missile program and end its funding for proxy terror groups in the Middle East.
According to a CBS report Sunday, US-Israel discussions on possibly striking Iran’s missile facilities are ongoing, and Trump told Netanyahu in December that the US would back an Israeli strike on Iran’s ballistic missile program should talks fail.
Iran, for its part, has agreed to discuss only its nuclear program in the indirect talks with the US. The Islamic Republic has also refused to stop enriching uranium outright, as demanded by the US.
Iran’s Deputy Foreign Minister Majid Takht-Ravanchi signaled Sunday that Tehran could be open to compromise on the nuclear issue, but is looking for an easing of US-led international sanctions.
“The ball is in America’s court. They have to prove they want to have a deal with us,” Takht-Ravanchi told the BBC. “If we see a sincerity on their part, I am sure that we will be on a road to have an agreement.”
“We are ready to discuss this and other issues related to our program, provided that they are also ready to talk about the sanctions,” he added.

Trump initially threatened to take military action over Iran’s bloody crackdown on nationwide protests last month, but then shifted to a pressure campaign in recent weeks to try to get Tehran to make a deal over its nuclear program.
Trump said Friday the USS Gerald R. Ford, the world’s largest aircraft carrier, was being sent from the Caribbean to the Mideast to join other military assets the US has built up in the region. He also said a change in power in Iran “would be the best thing that could happen.”
Iran has threatened to attack Israel and US bases in the region in response to a US strike.

Shutting down buzz, Obama says no evidence aliens have made contact
Former US president clarifies he wasn’t saying he knows aliens exist during jocular interview, only that they likely do, but probably have not visited Earth
Former US president Barack Obama said he did not see evidence that aliens “have made contact with us,” after sending social media abuzz by saying aliens were real on a podcast over the weekend.
During a lightning round of questions with podcast host Brian Tyler Cohen, Obama was asked, “Are aliens real?”
“They’re real,” he answered, continuing: “But I haven’t seen them. And, they’re not being kept in Area 51.”
On Sunday, the former president released a statement on Instagram, appearing to clarify what he meant by his comments that have since gone viral.
“I was trying to stick with the spirit of the speed round, but since it’s gotten attention let me clarify. Statistically, the universe is so vast that the odds are good there’s life out there. But the distances between solar systems are so great that the chances we’ve been visited by aliens is low, and I saw no evidence during my presidency that extraterrestrials have made contact with us. Really!”
Secrecy around Area 51, a top-secret Cold War test site in the Nevada desert, has long fueled conspiracy theories among UFO enthusiasts.

In 2013, the CIA acknowledged the existence of the site, but not UFO crashes, black-eyed extraterrestrials or staged moon landings.
Declassified documents referred to the 575-square-mile (1,489-square-kilometer) installation by name after decades of US government officials refusing to acknowledge it.
The base has been a testing ground for a host of top-secret aircraft, including the U-2 in the 1950s and later the B-2 stealth bomber.

MEP: Constitutional Court Is the Safest Way for Bulgaria to Exit the Trump Board of Peace

Bulgaria Adds 20 New Vehicles to Boost Protection of Natura 2000 Sites
Twenty new high-clearance vehicles have been added to support state authorities in safeguarding Bulgaria’s territories within the EU’s Natura 2000 ecological network
Bulgarian MEP Radan Kanev has argued that referring the agreement on the so called "Trump Board Peace" to the Constitutional Court is the most appropriate way for Bulgaria to withdraw from the format without provoking political tension with the United States. Speaking in a Dir.bg podcast, Kanev said the agreement signed by outgoing Prime Minister Rosen Zhelyazkov contradicts both the Bulgarian Constitution and EU treaties, while also placing Bulgaria in an isolating position within the Union.
According to the EPP representative, a constitutional review is likely and would provide a legally sound exit. Kanev also expects the newly elected 52nd National Assembly to reject ratification of the agreement altogether. In his view, this institutional approach would allow Bulgaria to disengage without escalating the issue diplomatically.
Kanev stressed that a request to the Constitutional Court offers a careful solution. He expressed confidence that the court would rule objectively that Bulgaria’s participation in such a format is not constitutionally permissible. At the same time, he acknowledged the political sensitivity of the move, remarking that there is a small risk of triggering an emotional reaction from US President Donald Trump, which is why the exit must be handled with caution.
Beyond the Board of Peace issue, the interview also addressed broader European topics. Kanev discussed the concept of a European Defence Union, which he said could push the EU toward deeper integration and federalisation. He warned against the idea of a two speed Europe and commented on the Union’s strategic focus on boosting competitiveness.
Among the key points highlighted were support for a common European defence framework without creating a single European army, expectations that the “Made in EU” industrial acceleration regulation will be adopted soon, and the emergence of the European Competitiveness Fund as a central element in the next multiannual financial framework. Kanev also noted that the European Parliament is preparing to vote on new safeguard measures aimed at protecting European agriculture under the Mercosur agreement.
Anton Kutev, former spokesperson for three caretaker governments, expressed confidence that former President Rumen Radev will secure a victory in the upcoming elections and establish a government regardless of circumstances
A new survey by the sociological agency Market Links shows that if parliamentary elections were held now, five political formations would enter the National Assembly, with the future coalition around Rumen Radev clearly in the lead
Former president Rumen Radev said he will announce the structure, name and program of the political formation with which he will take part in the upcoming early elections no later than March 4

Sofia Proposes New Admission Rules for Nurseries and Kindergartens

Nazi-Linked Lukovmarsh Took Place in Sofia After Court Overturned City Ban
A procession in memory of Gen. Hristo Lukov took place in Sofia on Saturday, after a court decision lifted the municipality’s ban on the event.
Sofia Municipality has proposed changes to the rules governing admission to nurseries and kindergartens in the Bulgarian capital. The draft amendments have been published for public consultation and are intended to revise both residency requirements and the way points are awarded in admission rankings. Under the current system, permanent address has carried greater weight, a balance the municipality now aims to adjust.
According to the proposal, a permanent or current address of one parent within Sofia Municipality that has remained unchanged for three years or more will bring 8 points. If the address has been changed within the past one to three years, it will carry 5 points, while a change within the last year will be awarded 3 points. The goal is to better reflect long-term residence without disproportionately disadvantaging certain families.
Deputy Mayor for Education Desislava Zhelyazkova said the existing approach has often worked unfairly against parents living in rented housing. Speaking on BNT, she noted that tenants who are unable to change their permanent address due to a landlord’s refusal have effectively been penalized through no fault of their own.
The point system for families in remote areas is also being updated. Children will receive an additional point when applying either to their designated kindergarten or to one located in a neighboring settlement, a measure aimed at easing access for families outside central districts.
Another significant change is the removal of the bonus point previously granted to children who had already attended a nursery. According to the municipality, this practice led to discrimination and blocked places that could otherwise be used, as some children formally occupied spots without actually attending. This amendment is scheduled to take effect next year.
The new rules also clarify procedures for admitting children whose parents are detained and who have no relatives able to care for them. While such provisions already existed, the municipality is removing the working group that reviewed these cases. Zhelyazkova explained that court rulings and official orders already require immediate placement of such children, making the additional review step unnecessary.
Among the longer-term policy directions is a plan to transfer nurseries to the Ministry of Education, alongside the introduction of an integrated early childhood development framework covering children from birth to the age of seven.
The municipality expects the revised admission rules to enter into force ahead of the next major ranking round for nurseries and kindergartens in Sofia.

Norway and Germany Sign Defense Pact to Strengthen Security in Northern Europe

Norway and Germany have signed a bilateral defense agreement known as the Hanseatic Agreement.
The signing ceremony took place during the Munich Security Conference and was attended by Norway’s Minister of Defence, Tore Sandvik, and his German counterpart.
The agreement formalizes a strategic partnership between the two countries. Its goal is to strengthen European security and ensure a fairer sharing of responsibilities within NATO.
The agreement covers five key areas of cooperation, including space surveillance and communications, maritime security in the North Atlantic, and land forces.
The two countries also plan to expand cooperation in the defense industry and develop mechanisms for the rapid deployment of reinforcements.
A central element of the maritime partnership is a joint submarine construction program. The Norwegian parliament has recently approved the purchase of two additional submarines, increasing the total number to six.
As a result, Norway and Germany will operate identical submarine fleets. In addition, the parties are jointly developing the promising long-range naval missile 3SM.
As part of strengthening its land forces, Norway is purchasing German Leopard 2A8 tanks. An important part of the contract is production localization: the Norwegian company Ritek will assemble 37 of the 54 ordered vehicles.
Operating the same main battle tanks will allow the armies of Norway and Germany to exchange experience more effectively in tactics, logistics, and personnel training.
Special attention under the Hanseatic Agreement is also given to the space sector. Norway and Germany are implementing joint technological projects, making use of the spaceport facilities on Andøya.
Space capabilities are viewed as a critically important element for ensuring modern military communications and targeting during joint operations.
German forces continue regular training on the territory of Norway, including as part of the upcoming winter exercise Cold Response 26. The parties are also discussing the possibility of pre-positioning German military equipment at Norwegian bases. This would reduce deployment time in the event of an escalation on the Alliance’s northern flank.

New settlement to ‘expand Jerusalem’ for first time since 1967

New settlement to ‘expand Jerusalem’ for first time since 1967
Left-wing group accuses government of ‘backdoor annexation’; West Bank regional council head lauds ‘realization of the settlement vision,’ says more such steps on the way
Jeremy Sharon is The Times of Israel’s legal affairs and settlements reporter
A recent development agreement signed by the state and the West Bank’s Mateh Binyamin Regional Council will, once given final approval, see the establishment of a new settlement that would in practice constitute the first expansion of Jerusalem since 1967.
The proposed settlement announced earlier this month would technically be a westward expansion of the Adam settlement, which lies very close to Jerusalem’s northeast boundary. It includes plans for the construction of some 2,780 housing units in a new “neighborhood” for Adam.
But the land on which the new settlement would be built is physically separated from Adam, first by Route 437, a major traffic artery, and second by the security barrier.
The proposed settlement would therefore have much greater territorial contiguity with the East Jerusalem neighborhood of Neve Yaakov, which is inside Jerusalem’s municipal boundaries, than with Adam.
It would not be a formal part of Jerusalem, and would officially be a neighborhood of Adam, although officials from the Peace Now organization claim that the new settlement would likely obtain at least some municipal services from Jerusalem.
The settlement would be built on 500 dunams of land between the Palestinian towns of Hizma and Al-Ram, and would involve an investment by the government of some NIS 120 million ($39 million) in order to construct the necessary infrastructure, public spaces and community institutions for the new development.
The plan has yet to be deposited with the Civil Administration’s Higher Planning Committee, meaning that full authorization could still take as long as two years.
Nevertheless, 500 housing units have already been marketed for the first phase of development, the Housing Ministry said.
“The agreement constitutes a significant step in continuing the development of the settlement and strengthening the settlement continuity in the area, while providing a response to the demand for housing in and around Jerusalem, and integrating a phased and balanced planning of new neighborhoods alongside the existing fabric,” the Housing and Construction Ministry said in a statement on February 3 announcing the development.
The Peace Now organization, which campaigns against the settlements, said that the new plans constituted a further form of annexation by the government and an unprecedented expansion of Jerusalem.
Following Israel’s conquest of East Jerusalem and the West Bank in the 1967 Six Day War, Knesset legislation and ministerial directives formally expanded the capital’s boundaries to their current position, taking in what had been Jordanian-controlled East Jerusalem. All neighborhoods built by Israel in East Jerusalem since that time, considered settlements by most of the international community, have been constructed inside those boundaries.
“This is the first time since 1967 that Jerusalem has been expanded into the West Bank,” asserted Peace Now.
“Under the pretext of a new settlement, the government is carrying out a backdoor annexation here. The new settlement will function for all intents and purposes as a neighborhood of the city of Jerusalem, and its planning as a ‘neighborhood’ of the Adam settlement is just an excuse and an attempt to conceal the move, the implication of which is the application of Israeli sovereignty to territories in the West Bank,” it said.
Democrats MK Gilad Kariv also condemned the move, describing it as “another unprecedented act of annexation that draws us closer to an explosion in the West Bank.”
Kariv said that he had written to Housing and Construction Minister Haim Katz about “the plan to expand Jerusalem over the Green Line and to de facto annex territory,” adding, “Annexation will bring about a security catastrophe.”
Mateh Binyamin Regional Council head Israel Ganz lauded the new development, describing it as “the realization of the settlement vision” for his region.
“The new plan will allow us to build thousands of housing units, while at the same time dramatically upgrading the quality of life of the residents,” said Ganz, adding that his council is “already working on additional agreements” that will “herald dramatic change on the ground.”

Russia Recruits More Foreign Mercenaries Amid Rising Losses

Russia is becoming increasingly dependent on foreign mercenaries due to mounting losses that it is unable to offset with its own recruits.
UK Defence Secretary John Healey stated this during the Munich Security Conference, Bloomberg reports.
According to him, the Kremlin is being forced to recruit thousands of fighters from India, Pakistan, Nepal, Cuba, Nigeria, and Senegal.
Healey emphasized that foreigners are often recruited through deception, without being warned that they will become part of the ‘Russian meat grinder’ on the front line. He also estimated the number of North Korean troops involved at 17,000.
“They are often recruited under false pretenses and coerced into service, without realizing they are destined to end up in Russia’s meat grinder on the front line,” the minister said.
UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer warned that Russia continues to rearm and rebuild its forces despite significant human losses.
He stressed that even if a peace agreement is signed, Russia’s militarization will only accelerate, posing an even greater threat to Europe. Western officials predict that Russia will be able to sustain combat operations throughout 2026.

Wagner Operatives Recruited to Carry Out Sabotage Across Europe

21:00:00 KST

Western intelligence sources indicate that former recruiters and propagandists of the Russian private military company Wagner are now being repurposed as channels for Kremlin-backed sabotage operations across Europe. The Financial Times, citing European Pravda, reports that these operatives are leveraging their existing networks to recruit Europeans - particularly those facing economic hardship - to carry out acts of violence on NATO territory.
Further reading: Activists Claim Discovery of Russian Paramilitary Site in Bulgarian Village
The operational status of Wagner has remained ambiguous since June 2023, following the failed rebellion against Russian military leadership and the death of its founder, Yevgeny Prigozhin. Previously, Wagner recruiters focused on enlisting young men from rural Russia for deployment in Ukraine. According to one Western intelligence official, Russian military intelligence is now “using the talent it has got available,” applying the Wagner network to European sabotage efforts.
Moscow’s broader campaign of destabilisation and sabotage over the past two years aims to undermine Western support for Ukraine while fostering social unrest. With a decline in covert operatives in Europe due to repeated diplomatic expulsions, Russian intelligence increasingly relies on intermediaries like Wagner to implement its agenda. European intelligence sources confirm that Wagner’s network has been effective for these operations, even if crude in execution.
Recruited individuals are often financially motivated and socially marginalised, with limited direction or purpose. Wagner operatives provide instructions ranging from arson attacks on politicians’ vehicles and warehouses storing humanitarian aid for Ukraine to posing as extremist propagandists. European officials note that Wagner’s existing network of propagandists and recruiters gives Russian intelligence a ready-made pipeline capable of targeting specific audiences with cultural and linguistic familiarity.
Operational security for these efforts typically includes multiple “cut-out” layers, providing deniability for Russian intelligence (GRU). Wagner operatives, who have a long-standing relationship with the GRU, act as intermediaries between the agency and amateur saboteurs. Meanwhile, Russia’s FSB tends to rely on criminal networks and diaspora communities in neighbouring countries, but these channels are considered less effective for large-scale recruitment.
Wagner’s strong online presence, previously focused on Russian audiences, has been adapted to recruit internationally. Sophisticated Telegram channels and social media accounts have been used to enlist recruits, including a group of British nationals in late 2023. European intelligence gradually mapped the broader network of Wagner operatives and “disposable” agents following that incident.
Authorities note that while the use of Wagner intermediaries allows Russian intelligence to scale its sabotage campaigns cost-effectively, it also reduces operational competence and secrecy. European security services report having prevented more attacks than those that have succeeded. Poland recently upheld convictions of Russians involved in recruiting individuals for Wagner, highlighting the ongoing legal and intelligence response to the network’s operations in Europe.

Australian archaeology museum recovers Egyptian artifacts after break-in
Man charged with stealing mummy mask, jewelry and wooden cat and causing ‘irreparable damage’ to other items, says he believed Abbey Museum was tied to Catholic Church
SYDNEY, Australia — Australian police have recovered a trove of stolen Egyptian artifacts and charged a 52-year-old man with a nighttime smash-and-grab at a museum.
The man was accused of breaking a window and making off with the priceless treasures in the early hours of Friday from the Abbey Museum of Art and Archeology in the Queensland town of Caboolture.
Police said they found all the stolen goods — except for a wooden cat sculpture — with only minor damage when they searched a car the following day at a ferry terminal south of the museum.
They arrested the suspect on the same evening.
“Police will allege the man was found in possession of the last missing artifact, the wooden cat sculpture,” they said.
The man, named by local media as Miguel Simon Mungarrieta Monsalve, was charged with various counts including breaking and entering, and three counts of willful damage.
In court on Monday, a prosecutor said the man stole a mummy mask, a collar, a piece of jewelry and the wooden cat while also causing “irreparable damage” to other items, according to public broadcaster ABC.
The suspect told police that he believed the museum had links to the Catholic Church, the prosecutor was quoted as telling the court.
The museum said it was “relieved and grateful” to get the artifacts back, but they could not go back on display immediately.
“Each piece must first undergo professional assessment and conservation to protect its long-term future.”

At the start of the year, Bulgaria’s fruit market has seen notable price swings, particularly for citrus fruits. Data from the State Commission for Commodity Exchanges and Markets (DCBMT) show that in January, tangerine prices surged by over 14 percent, reaching 1.33 euros per kilogram, while oranges increased by nearly 6 percent. Entering February, wholesale prices began to ease, with oranges declining by 5.27 percent to average around 1.15 euros per kilogram.
Despite this recent easing in wholesale markets, retail prices for oranges in Bulgaria remain among the highest in the region. According to Numbeo data, the average price for oranges is 1.58 euros per kilogram, surpassing prices in neighboring countries such as Greece, Romania, and North Macedonia. In North Macedonia, oranges are 22 percent cheaper, costing around 1.23 euros per kilogram, while Greek consumers pay 1.31 euros, about 17 percent less than in Bulgaria. In Romania, the price difference is nearly 12 percent in favor of local buyers.
These figures highlight a notable economic paradox. In Greece, where the standard of living is roughly 29.4 percent higher than in Bulgaria, citrus fruits are more affordable, and in North Macedonia, with a lower overall cost of living by almost 15 percent, the situation is similar. Analysts attribute these disparities to a combination of logistical challenges, differences in VAT rates on food, and local supply chain structures, which together place Bulgarian consumers at a relative disadvantage when compared to their regional neighbors.

The Dutch State Secretary for Defence, Gijs Tuinman, said that the software of F-35 fighter jets could potentially be hacked in a way similar to unlocking an iPhone.
He made the statement on the “Boekestijn en de Wijk” podcast on BNR Nieuwsradio, as reported by The War Zone.
According to Tuinman, the aircraft’s closed digital system could theoretically be unlocked to allow software updates from third-party developers.
If such protections were bypassed, countries operating the F-35 could independently upgrade and modernize the jet’s combat systems. Tuinman noted that he was discussing matters he “probably should never have said publicly,” highlighting the sensitivity of the issue.

It is currently unknown whether there are real technical means to gain access to the fighter jets, or whether the statement was merely figurative.
The issue of dependence on the United States is critical, as these aircraft are currently the only type of fighter jet in service with the Netherlands. Full digital integration of the aircraft with U.S. infrastructure means that, without authorization from Washington, D.C., the operational capability of the fleet could be quickly neutralized.
There is also an article on Militarnyi about whether F-35 fighter jets can be remotely disabled.

Hungary Ends Operation of Mi-24 Helicopters
Unknown

19:26:08 KST

Hungary has retired its Mi-24 attack helicopters. The phase-out took place quietly in early February 2026 after all remaining airworthy aircraft reached the end of their service life.
The final flight was carried out on February 4. The very next day, the airworthiness certificate of the last operational helicopter expired, according to Portal Militarny.
Hungary’s Mi-24 history began in 1978, when the first four Mi-24D helicopters were delivered from the Soviet Union as part of a total order of 30 aircraft. The fleet was later expanded with upgraded Mi-24V variants. In 1995, Hungary also received additional used helicopters free of charge from Germany, previously operated by the former East German Army.
Despite the large number of helicopters received, economic difficulties and military downsizing steadily reduced the number of active aircraft.
After several years without flights, eight helicopters underwent major overhauls in 2018–2019 at a Russian plant in St. Petersburg. Specialists upgraded the TV3-117 engines and adapted the cockpits for the use of night vision goggles. It was at that time that the Hungarian helicopters received their distinctive graphite-black paint scheme.
In the final period of their service, the combat value of these helicopters was minimal. Hungary had no remaining stocks of 9M114 guided anti-tank missiles, and the storage life of the unguided S-5 and S-8 rockets had long expired. Due to safety risks, they were not even used for training, leaving the 30 mm cannon of the Mi-24P variant as the only available weapon.
All helicopters have now been towed to storage areas at the Szolnok airfield, where they will await a final decision on their future.
The Soviet-era aircraft are being replaced by Airbus H145M light attack helicopters. Hungary received 20 of these helicopters between 2019 and 2021.

Bulgaria Adds 20 New Vehicles to Boost Protection of Natura 2000 Sites
Twenty new high-clearance vehicles have been added to support state authorities in safeguarding Bulgaria’s territories within the EU’s Natura 2000 ecological network
In January, Bulgaria recorded a monthly inflation rate of 0.6%, marking the first month after the country’s adoption of the euro, according to preliminary figures from the National Statistical Institute (NSI). The annual inflation rate reached 3.5%, slightly below the NSI’s earlier express estimates of 0.7% for the month and 3.6% for the year.
The most notable price increases were observed in personal care, which rose by 1.8%, and in restaurants and bars, which climbed by 1.6%. Insurance, as well as entertainment, sports, and cultural services, saw monthly price growth exceeding one percent. Food prices increased by 0.9%, reflecting typical seasonal shifts: non-seasonal vegetables such as tomatoes and cucumbers became more expensive, while citrus fruits declined in price. Among non-food items, higher fees for issuing official documents were included in the index, and hairdressing services rose by more than 3%.
Preliminary NSI data also indicate that harmonized inflation grew by 0.6% in January, with the annual rate at 2.3%. The price index for the small consumer basket rose 0.5% compared to December 2025 and 2.9% compared to January 2025.
For households in the lowest-income 20%, the small basket showed the most pronounced price increases in food products, which went up by 0.7% over the month. Service prices climbed 0.6%, while non-food items remained largely unchanged.
Authorities conducted widespread inspections in January through the National Revenue Agency and the Consumer Protection Commission to address unreasonably high prices. The focus of these checks closely mirrored the sectors where NSI data highlighted the strongest inflationary pressure.

Israeli charged with spying on ex-defense minister Gallant for Iran

Israeli charged with spying on ex-defense minister Gallant for Iran
Fares Abu al-Hija, 32, allegedly carried out missions for figure he met via social media, including stashing phones in Haifa, photographing former minister’s home in Amikam
Prosecutors filed charges Monday against a man for allegedly gathering intelligence on former defense minister Yoav Gallant on behalf of an Iranian agent.
The defendant, Fares Abu al-Hija, 32, was arrested in late January after taking photos of streets near Gallant’s home in Amikam at the behest of his handler, according to the indictment.
A joint statement from the police and the Shin Bet security service said the defendant is from the Galilee village of Kaukab Abu al-Hija, about an hour’s drive north of Gallant’s residence.
He first came into contact with the Iranian agent on the Telegram messaging app while searching for work in August last year, according to the indictment.
Between October and January, al-Hija carried out requests made by the person, who called himself “Martin,” even though he suspected he was a foreign agent, the statement said.
According to prosecutors, among the tasks al-Hija completed were to purchase and then hide cellphones and chargers at various locations around Haifa, activate the devices, install communication apps on them, record where they were stashed, and then pass on the information to his handler. He was also asked to take an envelope containing the password to a cryptocurrency account to a location in Zichron Yaakov, and to photograph a cafe in Tel Aviv.
Al-Hija was paid in cryptocurrency to carry out the intelligence-gathering missions. In return for taking photos and videos of the cafe, he earned $1,000 in cryptocurrency, according to the indictment.
In January, al-Hija was asked to photograph Gallant’s home. He was arrested at the location shortly after having sent the photos to his handler.
He was indicted at the Haifa District Court on the charge of contact with a foreign agent. Prosecutors requested that he be kept in custody until the end of legal proceedings against him.
Gallant was the defense minister from 2022 until 2024, when he was fired by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over political differences. In the past, he served as head of the Israel Defense Forces Southern Command.
In their statement, police and the Shin Bet noted that Iran is increasing its efforts to engage Israelis as spies within the country.
Law enforcement “takes a very serious view of any involvement in such activities and will continue to bring to justice those involved in harming the country’s security and its citizens,” they said.
Over the past two years, dozens of Israelis have been charged with espionage on behalf of Iran. In many of the cases, Iranian agents recruited Israelis via social media, specifically the Telegram messaging app.
Last week, two Israeli citizens were arrested on suspicion of spying for Iran in exchange for money, and earlier this month, a 22-year-old ultra-Orthodox yeshiva student from Beit Shemesh convicted of conducting espionage missions for Iran was sentenced to three years’ imprisonment and given a NIS 10,000 ($3,200) fine.
Many alleged Israeli spies recruited by Iranian agents begin with relatively innocuous tasks, such as vandalizing buildings with anti-government and pro-Iranian messages, then sending photos of the graffiti to their handlers. These gradually turn into more serious offenses, like intelligence-gathering and assassination plots.
The growing number of Iranian agents even prompted Israel to open a new wing for them in Haifa’s Damon prison. Only one of the alleged spies — Stern — has been convicted of espionage so far, as most cases are still making their way through the legal system.
Another Israeli was convicted on the lesser charges of contact with a foreign agent and entering an enemy state without authorization over meetings he had with Iranian agents, some of them inside Iran, in which they discussed a plot to assassinate Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. He was sentenced to 10 years in prison

19:18:21 KST

The American reference website Designation-Systems.Net has released its 2026 update, disclosing the official U.S. designations for several new missiles.
The update covers advanced systems currently undergoing testing as part of programs focused on developing affordable, mass-produced precision weapons.
Among them is the AHM-4A HACM hypersonic cruise missile developed by Raytheon. It uses a scramjet engine and can exceed Mach 5, with a reported range of up to 1,850 km. A new ‘H’ prefix was introduced specifically to identify hypersonic missiles in the U.S. designation system.
In the category of lower-cost cruise missiles, the AGM-188A Rusty Dagger developed by Zone 5 Technologies was also listed. The missile weighs about 225 kg, is powered by a turbojet engine, and has a range of more than 930 km. It was developed specifically for Ukraine under the ERAM (RAACM) program as an asymmetric solution to the shortage of more expensive weapons.
Anduril Industries has received the AGM-189A designation for its Barracuda-500 missile. This munition, with a range of over 900 km and a 45 kg warhead, is positioned as a lower-cost alternative to expensive systems such as the Tomahawk cruise missile.
Another system is the small AGM-190A Black Arrow cruise missile developed by Leidos Dynetics. Weighing just 90 kg, it has a range of up to 740 km and is designed for launch from the AC-130J Ghostrider or MQ-9 Reaper platforms.

Civilian Deaths in Ukraine Surge 26% in 2025 Amid Intensified Russian Strikes
Unknown

19:00:00 KST

Civilian casualties in Ukraine rose sharply during 2025, with the impact of bombings and missile strikes increasing by 26% compared to the previous year. The surge reflects intensified Russian targeting of Ukrainian cities and critical infrastructure, according to data from the monitoring group Action on Armed Violence (AOAV).
AOAV reported that 2,248 civilians were killed and 12,493 injured by explosive violence throughout Ukraine last year, with incidents affecting more people per attack than before. On average, 4.8 civilians were killed or wounded per strike, marking a 33% increase from 2024. The deadliest single attack occurred in Dnipro on June 24, when Russian missiles hit a passenger train, apartments, and schools, resulting in 21 deaths and 314 injuries, including 38 children.
Iain Overton, AOAV’s executive director, said the statistics demonstrate a broader collapse of restraint in modern conflicts, noting that the principle of proportionality in war is “at breaking point” across multiple theatres including Gaza, Sudan, Congo, and Ukraine. Deliberate attacks on civilians or civilian infrastructure that exceed military necessity constitute war crimes, but Overton warned that the erosion of accountability is now widespread.
Missile and drone strikes in Ukraine occurred almost nightly in 2025 and continued into 2026, leaving millions without reliable access to electricity, heating, or water. The largest single raid recorded by AOAV took place on September 9, when Ukrainian territory was struck by 805 drones and 13 missiles. The monitoring group compiles figures based on English-language media reports, a methodology that consistently undercounts the true scale of casualties due to incomplete coverage.
Globally, AOAV recorded a total of 45,358 civilian casualties from explosive violence in 2025, down from 61,353 in 2024. Of these, 17,589 were killed and 27,769 injured. The overall reduction is largely attributed to a ceasefire in Gaza, where civilian casualties fell by 40% compared to the previous year. Israeli authorities confirmed that the health ministry’s figures for Gaza—70,000 killed since October 2023—are broadly accurate. In 2025 alone, 25,718 Palestinians were recorded killed and 62,854 injured, highlighting the significant gap between English-language reporting and actual casualties.
The countries causing the highest number of civilian casualties last year were Israel and Russia, responsible for 35% and 32% of reported deaths and injuries from explosive violence, respectively. Other conflict zones with significant civilian harm included Sudan and Myanmar, with 5,438 and 3,178 casualties recorded.
Overton stressed that a pattern of impunity is taking hold across conflict zones. “Across Ukraine, Myanmar, Gaza and Sudan, the message is the same,” he said. “When impunity becomes normalised, war crimes stop being shocking exceptions and begin to resemble a method of warfare.”
This trend illustrates the growing human toll of modern conflicts, where both urban centers and civilian infrastructure are increasingly caught in the crossfire of sustained military operations.

Fake Euros Used in Bulgarian City: 35-Year-Old Suspect Detained
Forensic experts in the Bulgarian city of Shumen have identified and arrested a 35-year-old man who attempted to pay for a soft drink with a counterfeit 50-euro banknote
Shumen remains without water as the city faces an ongoing disruption at its main pumping station, BNT reported. Specialists from Varna have been deployed to assist with repairs, working to assess the facility and safely restart the pumps. Authorities warned that it will take several hours before the water supply network can be fully restored.
The breakdown followed an electric shock yesterday that partially flooded the pumping station. Emergency teams from the water company and the local fire department worked to remove the water from the facility. Both main pumps and the backup, along with the power supply and motors, were affected by the flooding. Drying of the electrical components is now underway, according to Eng. Ivan Pushkarov, manager of ViK-Shumen, who described the situation as evolving.
To support residents during the outage, water carriers will be set up across the city until the pumping station is fully operational again.

Navalny Poisoning Verified by Five Countries

Civilian Deaths in Ukraine Surge 26% in 2025 Amid Intensified Russian Strikes
Civilian casualties in Ukraine rose sharply during 2025, with the impact of bombings and missile strikes increasing by 26% compared to the previous year.
Independent labs in five European countries have confirmed that Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny was poisoned with a rare neurotoxin. The Insider reported on February 14, 2026, that tests of biological samples taken from Navalny and smuggled abroad revealed the presence of epibatidine, a highly toxic compound derived from a South American frog. Britain, Sweden, France, Germany, and the Netherlands issued a joint statement corroborating the findings and accusing Russia of violating the Chemical Weapons Convention. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio echoed the European assessment, describing it as “troubling,” while Russia’s Foreign Ministry dismissed the conclusions as deliberate misinformation.
The Russian government reacted sharply. Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova criticized the European countries for raising the Navalny case instead of focusing on investigations into the Nord Stream pipeline bombing. She demanded the chemical test results and formulas before commenting, labeling the reports as a “planted story” intended to distract the West. The Russian embassy in London called the joint statement a “political pageant” staged alongside the Munich Security Conference, accusing Western politicians of “necro-propaganda,” claiming it mocked the dead rather than sought justice. Russian state television largely ignored the European statement, while outlets such as Kommersant, Forbes, and Lenta.ru covered it only after Zakharova’s remarks.
Western reactions were swift. Rubio confirmed that the U.S. had no reason to question the European labs’ findings. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen condemned the poisoning as “a cowardly act from a frightened leader” and highlighted Russia’s reliance on terror tactics. German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul emphasized that Russian authorities had both the motive and means to carry out the attack. British Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper described the poisoning as evidence of Russia’s fear of political opposition, while French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot framed it as a demonstration of Vladimir Putin’s willingness to use chemical weapons to maintain power. Leonid Volkov of the Anti-Corruption Foundation said the confirmation marked a significant milestone after years of propaganda and misinformation, though he cautioned that achieving justice would require much more effort.
Experts have provided insight into the neurotoxin used. Azerbaijani toxicologist Ismail Efendiev explained that epibatidine is extraordinarily potent, with a lethal dose potentially as small as hundredths or thousandths of a gram. Symptoms resemble those caused by Novichok, but unlike Novichok, the standard treatment administered to Navalny in 2020 - atropine - would be ineffective. Treatment can only manage symptoms, as no specific antidote exists. Efendiev also noted that epibatidine persists in the body, making detection easier, and stressed that it cannot be synthesized outside specialized government laboratories.
The confirmation of Navalny’s murder and the ongoing revelations about the poison mark a grim milestone in Russian political repression. Today, on the anniversary of his death, the case continues to draw international scrutiny and condemnation, highlighting the dangers faced by opposition figures under the Russian regime.
Russian servicemen and pro-war commentators reacted with open outrage after the authorities began slowing down and restricting Telegram, warning that the move threatens communication on the battlefield and could seriously undermine military operations in

Bulgaria: Arson Attack Targets Bistritsa Mayor’s Home and Car

Europe’s Best-Selling New Car Revealed for 2025
The Dacia Sandero has emerged as the best-selling new car in Europe for 2025, maintaining a strong presence at the top of retail sales charts since 2017
The car and the entrance to the home of Samuil Popov, mayor of the village of Bistritsa, were deliberately set on fire in the early hours of the morning, shortly after 1:30 a.m. Popov said he was awakened by a loud sound similar to an explosion, which initially made him think thunder had struck nearby.
Moments later, he realized that the vehicle parked in the yard of his house was burning. Smoke then began to fill the stairwell, and it became clear that not only the car but also the front door of the house had been set alight. According to Popov, both the vehicle and the entrance had caught fire almost simultaneously.
The mayor told BNT and Nova TV that he noticed a motorcycle leaving the area immediately after the incident. Based on what he observed, he believes that two individuals entered the property, poured a flammable substance over the car and the front door, and then ignited it. An emergency call was placed to 112, and fire crews arrived quickly to extinguish the flames.
At the time of the arson, Popov, his wife, and their four-year-old daughter were asleep on the third floor of the house. On the first floor live his nephew and the nephew’s mother, while several friends of the nephew were also present that night.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs confirmed that the case is under active investigation and that operational measures are already underway. Popov recalled a previous incident from July last year, when masked individuals appeared at the village hall, and said he cannot rule out a connection between the two cases.
He pointed out that on July 11 he publicly questioned the destination of funds collected from municipal rents for sites in the center of the village. According to him, he did not receive a clear explanation and later sent an official inquiry to the Pancharevo district administration and Sofia Municipality. The response indicated that rental revenues did exist but were being managed through an intermediary.
Popov said he has not received new threats since the summer. Asked whether he suspects anyone in particular, he mentioned that recent media coverage had focused on illegal dumping of earth masses in the area, but stressed that he has no concrete information or assumptions about who might be responsible for the arson. Regarding the earlier case involving masked individuals, he added that, to his knowledge, no perpetrators have yet been identified.
Samuil Popov is currently serving his second term as mayor of Bistritsa. He was first elected as an independent candidate and is now in office under the quota of the WCC-DB coalition.

Bulgarian Fighter Captured in Ukraine After Serving With Russian Forces (VIDEO)

A Bulgarian national fighting on the Russian side has been taken prisoner by Ukrainian forces during combat operations in eastern Ukraine, Bulgarian National Radio reported, citing information published by Ukrainska Pravda.
According to the report, the capture was announced in a post on the Facebook page of the 20th Regiment of Unmanned Systems, known as “K-2”. A company commander from Ukraine’s 115th Separate Mechanized Brigade said the Bulgarian was detained while advancing toward Ukrainian positions in an unspecified sector of the Kupyansk–Lyman direction.
The Ukrainian officer explained that the soldier was first urged to surrender, an offer he accepted. After being taken to a dugout and searched, Ukrainian troops discovered a Bulgarian passport among his belongings, confirming his nationality.
To remove the prisoner from the combat zone, Ukrainian forces used a ground-based robotic evacuation system. The man was restrained to prevent escape attempts. During the operation, Russian forces reportedly tried to strike both the robotic platform and the captured soldier with a drone, but the attack was unsuccessful.
Footage released by the Ukrainian military shows a man in uniform with his hands tied and his face partially covered, speaking in Russian. In the video, he thanks the 115th Mechanized Brigade for capturing him and the K-2 unit for evacuating him safely, adding that he is grateful to be alive and ending his statement with the words “Glory to Ukraine”.
In a separate video released by the Armed Forces of Ukraine, it is stated that the operation took place on February 1. Ukrainian soldiers describe how enemy FPV drones attempted to destroy the robotic complex during the evacuation. The prisoner survived the attack, and during the subsequent search his Bulgarian passport was again shown. His name has not been made public.
According to information cited by Bulgarian media "Sega", the man told Ukrainian soldiers that his Russian military documents had been taken from him. He claimed he was recruited while visiting relatives in the Russian city of Voronezh and was then pressured into signing a contract for military service with the Russian army.
The approximately five-minute video documenting the incident shows that at one stage Russian forces opened fire on the area during the evacuation, effectively shelling the group that included their own captured soldier. The Bulgarian is currently being held by Ukraine’s 115th Mechanized Brigade as a prisoner of war.
In the recording, with his face concealed, the man repeats his thanks to the Ukrainian units involved, says he is relieved to be alive, and again voices support for Ukraine, ending with the phrase “Glory to Ukraine, glory to the heroes.”

Bulgaria Adds 20 New Vehicles to Boost Protection of Natura 2000 Sites
Twenty new high-clearance vehicles have been added to support state authorities in safeguarding Bulgaria’s territories within the EU’s Natura 2000 ecological network
A new survey by the sociological agency Market Links shows that if parliamentary elections were held now, five political formations would enter the National Assembly, with the future coalition around Rumen Radev clearly in the lead. According to the data, Radev’s formation would win 25.6% of the vote among those who say they would participate, followed by center-right GERB with 15.4% and the liberals from We Continue the Change-Democratic Bulgaria (WCC-DB) with 12.5%. Also crossing the parliamentary threshold are “DPS-New Beginning” (led by infamous oligarch Delyan Peevski, sanctioned under the Magnitsky Act) with 10.5% and the right-wing nationalist party “Revival” with 4.5%, while left-wing formations remain well below the 4% barrier.
The study was presented on bTV and was carried out jointly by the media outlet and the agency between February 7 and 13, 2026. It covered 1,019 respondents aged 18 and over, using both face-to-face interviews and an online survey. According to the snapshot, 56% of Bulgarians currently declare readiness to vote, a significantly higher level of electoral engagement compared to the turnout of 38.94% recorded in the 2024 parliamentary elections.

Commenting on the results, Market Links managing partner Dobromir Zhivkov said Radev has clear potential to emerge as the leading political force, but stressed that there is no mass surge comparable to earlier political breakthroughs, such as the rise of Simeon Saxe-Coburg-Gotha or GERB’s ascent in 2009. In his assessment, public attitudes remain strongly personalized rather than program-driven, with voters continuing to place their trust primarily in individual figures.
Further reading: Will Radev and the Liberals Join Forces? What the Caretaker PM Choice Really Means for Bulgaria
In terms of public confidence, the National Assembly ranks at the bottom of institutional trust indicators. Radev currently enjoys the highest level of personal trust, followed by the leader of “Revival” Kostadin Kostadinov. GERB leader Boyko Borissov comes third in approval ratings, with "Morality, Unity, Honor" (MECH) leader Radostin Vassilev following. Zhivkov noted that the early-voting electorate shows stronger eurosceptic and more pro-Russian tendencies.
If the projected results were translated into mandates in a 240-seat parliament, Radev’s formation would receive 89 seats, GERB 54, WCC-DB 44, DPS-New Beginning 37, and Revival 16. MECH, the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP) and several other currently represented parties would remain outside parliament. At an assumed turnout of 56%, this would mean roughly 900,000 votes for Radev’s coalition, equivalent to around 14% of Bulgaria’s total population.
In a 240-seat National Assembly, a party or coalition needs at least 121 seats to form a government on its own.
Based on the Market Links projection, the formation around Rumen Radev would secure 89 seats with 25.6% of the vote.
This means that Radev would fall short by 32 seats of the minimum required to govern alone. Even as the leading political force, he would not be able to form a single-party government and would need support from at least one other parliamentary group to reach a governing majority.
Further reading: Rumen Radev to Reveal Coalition Partners and Program by March 4 Ahead of Early Elections
The survey also registers growing confidence in Radev personally, with trust standing at 51%, an increase of six percentage points compared to the previous month. This rise comes despite the fact that he has not yet publicly announced coalition partners, candidates, or detailed policies, beyond pledges to dismantle what he describes as an entrenched oligarchic model and to combat corruption.
Radev has confirmed, both in Bulgaria and during meetings with Bulgarian communities abroad, including in Berlin, that he will take part in the early elections through a coalition rather than a newly registered party. He has said that the coalition’s name, structure and program will be officially submitted to the Central Election Commission no later than March 4, in line with all legal deadlines. Until then, he is deliberately withholding details about partners and candidates, citing concerns about institutional pressure and last-minute attempts to block the initiative.
He has also announced that on March 4 a public bank account will be opened to allow citizens to provide voluntary financial support for the campaign. According to Radev, messages of backing are already arriving from across the country and from Bulgarians living abroad, whom he sees as a key part of his broader political objective to reverse emigration trends and encourage a return to Bulgaria.

Ukraine’s Former Energy Minister Charged in Largest Corruption Case Under Zelensky

Ukraine’s anti-corruption authorities have formally charged former energy minister Herman Halushchenko in what is described as the largest corruption case to emerge during President Volodymyr Zelensky’s time in office. The National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (NABU) announced on February 16 that Halushchenko faces accusations of money laundering and participation in an organized criminal group.
The charges follow months of investigation into a sweeping corruption probe that has shaken the country’s political landscape. On February 15, one day before the announcement, Halushchenko was detained while allegedly attempting to leave Ukraine.
According to NABU, the case centers on Ukraine’s state-owned nuclear energy company Energoatom. A total of nine people have been charged so far. Investigators allege that the scheme was led by Timur Mindich, described as a close associate of President Zelensky, who is believed to have coordinated the criminal network.
Halushchenko headed the Energy Ministry from 2021 until 2025 and later took over as justice minister in July 2025. As part of the investigation, NABU carried out searches in November at properties connected to him, signaling that he had already been under scrutiny well before his detention.

ECB Sets Timeline for Digital Euro, Eyes 2029 Launch

Bulgaria Ranks Second in EU for Road Deaths

The European Central Bank (ECB) has confirmed that the introduction of a digital euro will proceed only once the necessary legislative framework is established by European institutions. Piero Cipollone, a member of the ECB’s Executive Board, explained in an interview with the Cyprus News Agency that the digital euro is designed as a “digital form of cash,” ensuring that citizens can use public funds for payments even when physical money is impractical.
From an economic perspective, the digital euro aims to reduce market fragmentation and lower transaction costs, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises. At present, smaller businesses face card payment fees up to four times higher than large retail chains. By providing a payment scheme without additional infrastructure charges, the digital euro is expected to create a more competitive environment and ease operational costs for smaller market participants.
Strategically, the currency is intended to enhance the European Union’s financial autonomy. Currently, nearly 70 percent of card transactions in Europe are processed by non-European providers, leaving the bloc dependent on external technology firms. The digital euro is envisioned as an independent alternative that strengthens the sustainability and strategic independence of the European payment system.
Preparatory work for the project is already underway. The European Parliament is expected to adopt its formal position in May 2026. If the legislative process concludes by the end of the year, the ECB plans to launch a pilot program in 2027, with full-scale implementation possible by mid-2029.
To safeguard financial stability, the digital euro will not accrue interest, and holding limits will be introduced to prevent large-scale withdrawals from commercial banks. Transactions will be executed by transferring funds from bank accounts to digital wallets at the time of payment, with only individuals permitted to hold the currency. The ECB has also committed to preserving privacy, particularly for offline transactions, where data will remain visible only to the transaction participants.
Alongside these developments, the ECB continues to monitor market trends closely. In its upcoming macroeconomic forecasts in March, the bank will evaluate how the euro’s appreciation impacts consumer prices. While no specific exchange rate target is set, the euro’s value remains a central factor in assessing inflation and guiding monetary policy.

1.4 Million Bulgarians Still at Risk of Poverty as Income Inequality Persists

Bulgaria remains at the bottom of the European Union in terms of minimum wage, lagging behind not only EU neighbors but also countries outside the bloc such as Turkey, Serbia, and Albania. This was highlighted by Assoc. Prof. Dr. Atanas Atanasov, Chairman of the National Statistical Institute (NSI), during the discussion “Young Families and Income.” Despite steady annual wage growth, Bulgaria is struggling to narrow the gap with other EU nations and regional competitors.
Data from the NSI shows that both average and minimum wages have risen significantly over the past two decades. In 2007, the average wage was 431 leva, while by 2025 it is projected to surpass 2,500 leva. The minimum wage has also grown substantially, from 180 leva at the time of Bulgaria’s EU accession to 933 leva in 2024. Real wages have risen by nearly 50 percent over the past five years. However, despite these gains, poverty remains widespread. While the minimum wage now stands well above the official poverty line, about 1.4 million Bulgarians still live at risk of poverty, a slight decline from 1.6 million in 2008—a reduction largely driven by the country’s shrinking population rather than significant social improvement.
Income inequality in Bulgaria remains among the highest in the EU, with only Latvia and Lithuania showing wider disparities. Atanasov warned that without structural reforms, rising incomes will not close the social gap. He emphasized the need to revisit Bulgaria’s tax and social security system to make it more effective. Another critical area is the optimization of state administration, as current poor data exchange between institutions limits the government’s ability to identify families in extreme poverty. He cited Portugal as an example, where coordination among 16 agencies helps target social support efficiently.
Education was highlighted as a third essential pillar for reducing poverty. Investments in skills and qualifications are considered the most reliable path out of poverty, as countries with higher educational attainment consistently demonstrate lower poverty levels. According to Atanasov, improving education, alongside administrative and fiscal reforms, is crucial to addressing Bulgaria’s persistent social challenges.

The demand for qualified chefs in Bulgaria continues to grow, driven by tourism, urban development, and rising expectations in the hospitality sector. Restaurants, hotels, and catering businesses are no longer looking only for short-term solutions—they need reliable professionals who can contribute to consistent quality and long-term success. For chefs, this creates real opportunities, but only if they know how to navigate the job market effectively.
Finding a stable position is about more than just responding to job ads. It requires understanding employer expectations, identifying reliable workplaces, and continuously developing professional skills. Platforms like Zaplata.bg play a key role in this process, offering structured job listings, clear requirements, and access to employers looking for long-term kitchen staff.
1. The Chef Job Market in Bulgaria Today
The hospitality industry remains one of the most active employment sectors in Bulgaria. While seasonal work is still common, especially in coastal and mountain resorts, there is a noticeable shift toward permanent contracts. Employers increasingly prefer chefs who are willing to commit long-term and grow within a team.
Large cities such as Sofia, Plovdiv, Varna, and Burgas offer year-round opportunities in restaurants, hotels, and catering companies. At the same time, resort areas provide competitive positions for chefs with experience in international cuisine or high-volume service. Job listings clearly reflect this diversity, allowing candidates to compare roles, locations, and working conditions before applying.
2. What Employers Expect from Professional Chefs
Modern kitchens operate under pressure, strict standards, and tight schedules. Employers are not only interested in cooking ability but also in discipline, reliability, and teamwork. A chef who can maintain consistency during peak hours is often more valuable than one with purely creative ambitions.
Professional behaviour, respect for hygiene regulations, and the ability to follow kitchen procedures are essential. Employers also value chefs who show initiative and a willingness to learn. These qualities often determine whether a position becomes a long-term role or a short-term engagement.
3. Key Skills That Improve Job Stability
-
strong understanding of food safety and hygiene standards
-
ability to work with standardised recipes and portion control
-
experience in fast-paced kitchen environments
-
flexibility with shifts, weekends, and seasonal workload
Developing these skills significantly increases the chances of securing stable employment, especially when applying through structured platforms like Zaplata.bg, where employers clearly outline their expectations.
4. Where to Find Reliable Chef Positions
One of the biggest challenges for chefs is identifying employers who offer stability rather than constant staff turnover. Job platforms help filter opportunities by contract type, location, and experience level. Zaplata.bg allows chefs to access up-to-date listings from verified employers across the country.
Hotels, restaurant chains, and established catering companies are among the most reliable employers. They typically offer formal contracts, predictable schedules, and clearer career paths. Applying through a trusted job portal reduces uncertainty and helps candidates focus on positions that match their long-term goals.
5. How Can Chefs Develop Their Skills and Advance
Career growth in the culinary field depends heavily on continuous learning. Chefs who invest in professional development remain competitive and adaptable. This includes attending culinary courses, participating in workshops, and gaining experience in different kitchen environments.
Working in diverse settings—such as fine dining restaurants, hotel kitchens, or large catering operations—builds versatility. Over time, this experience opens doors to senior roles such as sous chef or head chef. Zaplata.bg often features positions that explicitly mention growth opportunities, making it easier for chefs to plan their next career step.
6. Working Conditions and Long-Term Career Outlook
The profession is demanding, both physically and mentally. Long shifts, standing for extended periods, and high expectations are part of daily work. However, the market is evolving. More employers now recognize that better working conditions are essential for retaining skilled chefs.
Competitive pay, structured shifts, and professional kitchen environments are becoming more common. Chefs who clearly communicate their expectations and choose employers carefully are more likely to achieve work stability and professional satisfaction. Transparent job listings help candidates assess these factors before accepting an offer.
A successful career as a chef in Bulgaria is built on informed choices, strong practical skills, and reliable employment. By understanding the job market, developing key competencies, and choosing trustworthy employers, chefs can secure stable positions and grow professionally. If you are ready to move forward, explore current chef job opportunities on Zaplata.bg, compare offers, and apply for roles that support your long-term career development.
