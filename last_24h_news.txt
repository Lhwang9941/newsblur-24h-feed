Russia kills 4 in Sumy Oblast, strikes ambulance carrying minor hospitalized in blast, targets Mondelez factory
A Russian drone attack in northeastern Ukraine's Sumy Oblast killed two brothers and a married couple, while a missile strike damaged a production facility belonging to U.S. multinational company Mondelez, authorities reported Feb. 21.
Four were killed in Znob-Novhorodske, less than four kilometers (about 2.5 miles) from Ukraine's border with Russia.
Two brothers were injured by an explosive device dropped by a drone and taken to the hospital, Sumy Oblast Governor Oleh Hryhorov reported.
"On the way to the hospital, the Russians deliberately attacked the emergency vehicle with a strike drone," he added.
One of the two brothers was a minor at 17 years old, and a married couple was also killed in Russian strikes, Hryhorov said.
A Russian missile strike targeted a production facility belonging to the U.S. multinational food giant, Mondelez, in Trostyanets.
"This is not a military target, but a factory that has operated since the 1990s, producing globally known brands, employing Ukrainians, contributing to our and American economy," Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said in a post to X.
Trostyanets is located just 30 kilometers (18 miles) from Ukraine's border with Russia and was occupied by Russian forces in the early days of Russia's full-scale war against Ukraine, being liberated in March 2022.
"When Russian missiles hit such sites, they are not only targeting Ukraine. They are targeting American business interests in Europe," Sybiha said. "Moscow cannot speak of economic dialogue with the United States while attacking U.S.-owned production facilities."
Mondelez is known for its household names, including Oreo, Milka, and Toblerone. The company has not left the Russian market despite calls to do so.

PARIS - Around two thousand people marched in Paris on Feb 21 to show their support for Ukraine, police estimated, just days before the fourth anniversary of Russia’s invasion.
Demonstrators marching through the French capital chanted: “We support Ukraine against Putin, who is killing it”, and “Frozen Russian assets must be confiscated, they belong to Ukraine”.
“In public opinion, there is massive support for Ukraine that has not wavered since the first day of the full-scale invasion” by the Russian army on February 24, 2022, European Parliament member Raphael Glucksmann, told AFP.
“On the other hand, in the French political class, sounds of giving up are starting to emerge. On both the far left and the far right, voices of capitulation are getting louder and louder,” he added.
Police estimated around 2,000 people joined the demonstration.
Among those marching, Ms Irina Kryvosheia, a Ukrainian who arrived in France several years ago, “thanked with all her heart the people present”.
She said they reminded “everyone that what has been happening for four years is not normal, it is not right”.
Ms Kryvosheia said she remained in daily contact with her parents in Kyiv, who told her how they were deprived “for several days” of heating, electricity and running water following intense bombardments by the Russian army.
Mr Francois Grunewald, head of “Comite d’Aide Medicale Ukraine”, had just returned from a one-month mission in the country, where the humanitarian organisation has delivered around 40 generators since the beginning of the year.
Russia’s full-scale invasion
The war has killed tens of thousands of civilians and hundreds of thousands of military personnel on both sides.
Millions of refugees have fled Ukraine, where vast areas have been devastated by fighting.
Russia occupies nearly 20 per cent of Ukrainian territory and its heavy attacks on the country’s energy sites

Trump doubles down on closing tax loophole on cheap imports
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
TAIPEI - Hours after the Supreme Court struck down a significant portion of US President Donald Trump’s tariffs,
That policy, known as the de minimis exemption, had let US importers bring in goods valued at less than US$800 (S$1,013) without the sender paying taxes or completing detailed customs paperwork. The loophole allowed millions of packages to come straight from Chinese factories to American homes duty-free. Mr Trump has said the exemption also enabled deadly synthetic opioids like fentanyl and their ingredients to flow into the United States.
The exemption was used mostly by companies operating in China, just as American shoppers were getting hooked on buying inexpensive items online and the Chinese government was pushing its manufacturers to find buyers overseas. First on platforms including eBay and Amazon, and then on apps including Shein and Temu, exporters funneled the products of China’s vast manufacturing supply chain straight to the United States. Many American businesses also relied on the exemption for goods sold on sites including Etsy and Shopify.
The exemption, intended to spare customs officials from spending too much time and money processing goods of relatively little value, existed for almost a century. The threshold has changed repeatedly over the years and was raised from US$200 to US$800 in 2016.
Mr Trump ended the exemption for products from China in May and for items from the rest of the world in July.
Although it did not address de minimis directly, the Supreme Court’s decision appeared to invalidate one of the legal grounds for Mr Trump’s decision to end the exemption, potentially opening the door for such inexpensive tax-free shipments to resume.
But in an executive order hours later, Mr Trump said the flow of such goods remained a national emergency, and an independent issue from the basis for other tariff actions. The loophole would remain closed, the order said.
The order claimed the same legal authorities as previous executive orders on the de minimis issue. The order did not directly address the court’s ruling.
These actions add to the complexity that businesses around the world have faced over the past year, as the Trump administration has dismantled the rules that previously governed global trade.
Mr Alex Durante, a senior economist at the Tax Foundation, a think tank that generally favours lower taxes, said the confusion over de minimis adds another challenge for businesses that have adjusted to repeated changes in tariff policy over the past year.
“There’s still this looming tariff uncertainty in general,” Mr Durante said. “In some senses, it’s even worse now.”
Mr Song Guoyou, an expert on US-China economic relations at Fudan University in Shanghai, said the Supreme Court’s decision will likely boost some Chinese exports to the United States. The overall tariff on goods from China is expected to come down because the ruling invalidated, for example, the so-called fentanyl tariff that added 10 per cent to the overall duties on Chinese imports.
However, Mr Song said that Chinese businesses are still grappling with the unpredictable, shifting nature of the Trump administration’s trade policies.
“For Chinese enterprises, the policy uncertainty of the Trump administration always exists,” he said.
Separately, the sweeping legislation to extend tax cuts and slash social safety net programmes, which Mr Trump referred to as the “big, beautiful bill” signed into law last July, will do away with the previous law that had established the de minimis exemption starting in July 2027.
Chinese retailers are also facing tougher policies in the European Union, which plans to impose a flat fee on packages worth less than 150 euros (S$224) beginning in July.
E-commerce stocks went up on Feb 20 after the Supreme Court issued its decision. Etsy ended the day up 8 per cent and eBay up 4 per cent, while Amazon and Pinduoduo, the parent company of Chinese retailer Temu, closed up about 3 per cent. NYTIMES

Salsa music icon Willie Colon died on Saturday, February 21, his family and longtime manager said, leaving fans mourning the loss of "an architect of the New York sound."
Colon, known best as a trombonist but who was also a bandleader and producer, was born in the Bronx and known for blending the Puerto Rican music of his parents and grandparents with his home city's jazz.
He was 75. A cause of death was not given.
Born William Anthony Colon Roman in 1950, the music star "passed away peacefully this morning," his family said in a statement.
"We've lost an architect of the New York sound," said manager Pietro Carolos.
"Willie didn't just change salsa; he expanded it, politicized it, clothed it in urban chronicles and took it to stages where it hadn't been heard before."
Colon was playing in his own band by 15 and released an album at 17. He went on to record hit records with Puerto Rican singer Hector Lavoe in the 1960s and 1970s.
"Siembra," released in 1978 with vocalist Ruben Blades, addressed social issues faced by the growing Latino community in the United States.
"I came from a really tough neighborhood," he once told music publication Billboard.
"My father spent time in jail. Almost everybody went to jail... there was a lot of interaction between us and the police."
He only studied music in junior high school but continued playing and touring through 2025.
In a mark of his continued influence, he is name-checked in Grammy-winning singer Bad Bunny's 2025 hit "Nueva Yol."

Brother tracked down sister swept up in Utah avalanche but wasn’t able to save her
11-year-old girl died in the hospital, police say

The brother of an 11-year-old girl who was trapped in a backcountry avalanche in Utah was able to locate his sister, but she later died in the hospital after her rescue, according to officials.
Madelyn Eitas and her family were skiing outside the boundaries of Brighton Ski Resort, about 25 miles east of Salt Lake City, when an avalanche struck in the early afternoon Thursday.
About 20 strangers joined Wasatch Backcountry Rescue and the Unified Police Department and Fire Authority of Greater Salt Lake in the resulting search.
“Her brother, Cameron Eitas, heroically used an application to locate her,” police said in a statement. “Numerous agencies responded and worked together in an urgent and coordinated effort to care for the victim in attempts to provide life-saving measures.”
Due to safety concerns in the area, air rescue was not possible, and Madelyn Eitas, who hails from Rochester, Massachusetts, was eventually taken by ambulance to a local hospital.
“Despite the tremendous and exhaustive efforts of family, first responders and hospital medical staff, the victim tragically passed away,” the police department said.
"She was sweet and sassy, always laughing and dancing," her mother, Becky Eitas, told WCVB. "She loved her family and friends and her big brother so much."
“This is devastating news for our school community,” Old Rochester Regional School District said in a statement to the outlet. “We offer our sincere condolences to the student's family, friends, classmates, and teachers during this unimaginable time.”
Skiers Maggie and Harrison Garner assisted in the search.
“It was kind of just like a surreal thing,” Maggie Garner, a student at Utah Valley University, told KSLTV. “We were like, ‘What’s even really happening right now?’”
“It was just scary and crazy,” Harrison Garner, a junior at Bingham High School, added.
Thursday’s avalanche followed news that two people died in a separate avalanche while snowmobiling in the region.
Authorities continue to warn of high avalanche danger in the mountains outside Salt Lake City following heavy snows throughout the week.
“The avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE, and today is NOT the day to be in steep avalanche terrain,” according to a Saturday forecast from the Utah Avalanche Center. “That means staying off of — and out from under — slopes steeper than 30 degrees. Large, destructive, and potentially deadly slab avalanches are likely.
“This week’s heavy snowfall and strong winds overloaded preexisting weak layers, creating a HIGH avalanche danger across the entire state.”
Officials in California and Nevada are also sorting through the aftermath of a deadly backcountry avalanche.
Search crews have finished recovering all nine bodies of the people killed in an avalanche on Castle Peak near Lake Tahoe, officials announced Saturday. The incident is California’s deadliest known avalanche.

Trump approves disaster assistance to DC to help with sewage spill into Potomac River
President Donald Trump has approved emergency assistance to Washington, D.C., to help the city address a sewage system leak that dumped at least 250 million gallons of raw sewage into the Potomac River
- Bookmark
President Donald Trump has approved emergency assistance to Washington, D.C., to help the city address a sewage system leak that dumped at least 250 million gallons of raw sewage into the Potomac River.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency announced Trump's approval on Saturday, allowing FEMA to provide equipment and resources to help with the response to the Jan. 19 spill after a pipeline ruptured.
D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser had requested the federal help on Wednesday and declared an emergency.
Trump's approval of the disaster relief request comes after he criticized the handling of the spill, blaming local Democratic leaders and focusing especially on Maryland's Democratic Gov. Wes Moore.
He said in his social media posts criticizing the response that local officials had not asked for emergency help and he intended to step in.
However, the federal government was already involved in the repair and assessing the impact of the leak through the Environmental Protection Agency.
The 72-inch (183 centimeter) pipeline, known as the Potomac Interceptor, burst on Jan. 19, sending 250 million gallons of untreated sewage into the Potomac River just north of Washington in the first five days.
The leak is largely under control, but it could take months to repair the pipe fully. The local water utility, DC Water, along with the EPA, has been working to repair the leak and monitor the impact on the river.
Officials have said the area's drinking water is safe, but people who use the Potomac River for recreation are being cautioned not to have direct contact with the water.

Trump ‘could kill ayatollah’s son and senior mullahs to topple Iranian regime’

Trump ‘could kill ayatollah’s son and senior mullahs to topple Iranian regime’
Updated ,first published
Donald Trump is considering plans to assassinate the son of Ayatollah Ali Khamenei among the military options for a strike on Iran.
The US president has reportedly been presented with a decapitation campaign against the leadership of the Islamic Republic. Mojtaba Khamenei is on the list alongside his father.
The supreme leader’s 55-year-old son had been thought his most likely successor, benefiting from close ties to the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corp, a powerful branch of the armed forces that has been designated a terrorist entity by the United States.
Mojtaba also served in the Iran-Iraq war and studied theology in the holy city of Qom, meeting the constitutional requirement for clerical training.
Trump had not yet decided on whether to strike Iran, Axios news website reported. He could allow a deal that permits the regime to continue with “token” nuclear enrichment, as long as it has no path to an atomic bomb.
But should negotiations over Iran’s nuclear enrichment program fail, among the options under consideration is a dramatic assassination campaign that would aim at wholesale regime change.
“They have something for every scenario. One scenario takes out the ayatollah and his son and the mullahs,” a senior US official told Axios.
The US has dispatched more than one-third of its navy towards Iran and assembled the largest amount of air power in the Middle East since the 2003 invasion of Iraq.
Analysts have pointed to the deployment of more than two-thirds of the available E-3 Sentry fleet as one sign that Trump is prepared to launch military action, with the radars of the reconnaissance aircraft needed to track and direct the interception of incoming missiles.
On Friday (US time), Trump confirmed he was considering a “limited” strike on Iran in an attempt to pressure the regime into making a nuclear deal.
In theory, that strike would display US power but fall below the threshold for provoking a serious response from Tehran. But the risks of a spiralling conflict are self-evident.
The White House’s openness to Iran continuing a scaled-back enrichment program, as confirmed by a senior US official cited by Axios, could create room for a deal and avert war in the Middle East.
However, the outlet noted that any nuclear proposal from Iran would have to meet a very high bar to persuade sceptics within the Trump administration that military action was not needed.
It remains unclear how “token” enrichment would be defined, and what supervision would be in place to ensure Iranian compliance. Iran does not have a strong track record of allowing UN nuclear inspectors to monitor activities.
The senior US official said: “[Trump] will be ready to accept a deal that would be substantive and that he can sell politically at home.
“If the Iranians want to prevent an attack, they should give us an offer we can’t refuse. The Iranians keep missing the window. If they play games, there won’t be a lot of patience.”
On Thursday, Trump said he would give Iran “10 to 15 days” to come to a deal.
The world’s largest aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald Ford, entered the Mediterranean Sea on Friday and will arrive in range of Iran within the timeframe of 10 to 15 days.
Two Israeli officials said they believed the gaps between Washington and Tehran were unbridgeable and the chances of a military escalation were high.
Israel’s government is making preparations for possible joint military action with the US. However, no decision had been made on whether to carry out such an operation, a source familiar with the planning told Reuters.
It would be the second time the US and Israel have attacked Iran in less than a year, following air strikes against military and nuclear facilities in June. Regional officials said oil-producing Gulf countries were preparing for a possible military confrontation that they feared could spin out of control and further destabilise the Middle East.
Some said Tehran was dangerously miscalculating by holding out for concessions, while Trump was boxed in by the build-up of military assets.
They feared he would be unable to scale it back without losing face unless there was a firm commitment from Iran to abandon its nuclear weapons ambitions.
Earlier this week, the US began moving some personnel out of the Middle East to prepare for potential counter-attacks by Iran if Washington strikes Tehran in the coming days.
At least 20 anti-regime protests were held in Iran on Friday at memorials to mark the end of the traditional 40-day mourning period for protesters killed by security forces.
Thousands of demonstrators were killed after taking to the streets over economic woes and a lack of water in Tehran. The violence is what first prompted Trump to make his latest threats of retaliation against the Iranian regime.

Willie Colón, architect of urban salsa music, dies at 75
Willie Colón, architect of urban salsa music, dies at 75
Willie Colón, the Grammy-nominated architect of urban salsa music and social activist, died Saturday. He was 75.
Over his decades-long career, the trombonist, composer, arranger and singer produced more than 40 albums that sold more than 30 million copies worldwide. He collaborated with a wide range of artists, including the Fania All Stars, David Byrne and Celia Cruz.
His celebrated collaboration with Rubén Blades, “Siembra,” became one of the bestselling salsa albums of all time, and the pair were known for addressing social issues through the genre.
Colón’s family and manager confirmed his death through social media posts.
“Willie didn’t just change salsa; he expanded it, politicized it, clothed it in urban chronicles, and took it to stages where it hadn’t been heard before,” manager Pietro Carlos wrote. “His trombone was the voice of the people, an echo of the Caribbean in New York, a bridge between two cultures.”
Colón, who was nominated for 10 Grammys and one Latin Grammy, made famous songs such as “El gran varón,” “Sin poderte hablar,” “Casanova,” “Amor verdad” and “Oh, qué será.”
Blades said on the social platform X that he confirmed “what I was reluctant to believe” and offered his condolences to Colón’s family.
The path to the trombone — and fame
Born in New York’s Bronx borough, Colón was raised by his grandmother and aunt, who from a young age nurtured him with traditional Puerto Rican music and the typical rhythms of the Latin American repertoire, including Cuban son and tango.
At age 11 he ventured into the world of music, first with flute, then bugle, trumpet and finally trombone, with which he stood out in the then-nascent genre of salsa.
His interest in trombone arose after hearing Barry Rogers playing it on “Dolores,” Mon Rivera’s song with Joe Cotto.
“It sounded like an elephant, a lion ... an animal. Something so different that, as soon as I heard it, I said to myself: ‘I want to play that instrument,’” he recalled in an interview published in the Colombian newspaper El Tiempo in 2011.
At 17 he joined the group of artists that formed the famous record label Fania Records, led and created by Jerry Masucci and Johnny Pacheco. Fania was largely responsible for the new sound that was produced in the Latin world of New York and would later be called “salsa.”
Colón’s main characteristic as a musician was the fusion of rhythms, as he harmonized jazz, rock, funk, soul and R&B with the old Latin school of Cuban son, cha-cha-cha, mambo and guaracha, adding the nostalgia of the traditional Puerto Rican sound that encompasses jíbara, bomba and plena music.
In 2004 the Latin Recording Academy awarded Colón a special Grammy for his career and contributions to music.
Community leader and activist
As a community leader, Colón fought for civil rights, mostly in the United States. He was part of the Hispanic Arts Association, the Latino Commission on AIDS, the Arthur Schomburg Coalition for a Better New York and the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute, among others.
In 1991 he was honored with the Chubb fellowship from Yale University, a public service recognition also awarded to the likes of John F. Kennedy, Moshe Dayan, the Rev. Jesse Jackson and Ronald Reagan, among others.
In the political arena, he served as special assistant to David Dinkins, New York’s first Black mayor, and was later appointed special assistant and adviser to Mayor Michael Bloomberg.
Colón had little luck running for public office himself, however. He failed in a challenge to then-U.S. Rep. Eliot Engel in the 1994 Democratic primary, and in 2001 came in third in the Democratic primary for New York’s public advocate.
He backed Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign in 2008, but he told the Observer that he voted for Donald Trump in 2016.
Colón had public clashes with artists and politicians. His friendship with Blades ruptured after Colón sued for breach of contract over the 2003 concert “Siembra ... 25 years later,” held in Puerto Rico. He also sparked a controversy when he called the then-president of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, “rotten” on a social network.
Colón acted in films such as “Vigilante,” “The Last Fight” and “It Could Happen to You,” and on TV in “Miami Vice” and “Demasiado Corazón.” More recently he appeared in Bad Bunny’s music video for “NuevaYol.”
He is survived by his wife and four sons.

Former UK PM Boris Johnson says UK should immediately send non-combat troops to Ukraine
Speaking ahead of the fourth anniversary of Russia’s full-scale invasion, Mr Johnson told the BBC that these troops should be stationed in peaceful regions
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
Former prime minister Boris Johnson has called for troops from the UK and Europe to be deployed immediately to Ukraine.
Mr Johnson said non-combat forces should be stationed in peaceful regions to send a firm message to Russian president Vladimir Putin otherwise the Russian leader would “keep going” with the conflict.
Speaking ahead of the four-year anniversary of the invasion, the former politician told BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg that Ukraine’s allies had been “too slow” to respond.
“We've always delayed needlessly,” he said. “We've then ended up giving the Ukrainians what they have been asking for, and actually it's always served to their advantage and to the disadvantage of Putin. I mean, the one person who suffers from escalation is Putin.”
In the comments, which are set to air on Sunday, Mr Johnson said that he saw no reason why military action could not be taken to support Ukraine during wartime if security guarantees were promised in the event of a ceasefire.
“If we are willing to do it in the context of a ceasefire, which of course puts all the initiative, all the power, in Putin’s hands, why not do it now?’” he questioned.
“There is no logical reason that I can see why we shouldn’t send peaceful ground forces there to show our support, our constitutional support for a free, independent Ukraine.”
Military strategists and commentators have suggested that such a move could be interpreted by Russia as an escalation. Putin has previously remarked that Russia is “ready right now” for war if Europe wants it.
Putin rejected Western peacekeeping proposals in September warning that troops deployed to protect Ukraine would be considered “legitimate targets”.
Mr Johnson pushed back on those comments and insisted that Ukraine and its supporters should be able to operate on their own terms not those dictated by Russia.
“It’s about whether Ukraine is a free country or not,” he said. “If it’s a vassal state of Russia, which is what Putin wants, then obviously it’s up to Putin to decide who comes to his country. If it’s not, then it’s up to the Ukrainians.”
Britain’s ministry of defence responded to the comments to reiterate the government’s existing policy, confirming that ongoing work with the “coalition of the willing” would prepare for troop deployment in the event of a ceasefire.
“The multinational force Ukraine under UK leadership will secure peace for the long term, with the Prime Minister being clear that we will put British troops on the ground following the end of hostilities,” the ministry said in a statement.
Mr Johnson also blamed Western failures for the invasion citing a lack of support for Ukraine after the invasion of Crimea in 2014, a chaotic US withdrawal from Afghanistan and delays in punishing Bashar al-Assad for the use of chemical weapons in Syria.
“I think Putin was emboldened by a Western failure in Syria to punish Assad for using chemical weapons,” he said.
“I think Putin was further emboldened in February 2022 by what he’d seen in Afghanistan, and a sort of general sense that the West was on the back foot. He’d seen those appalling pictures of Americans being forced to flee Afghanistan and the UK pulling out as well, and that really did embolden him.”
A Ministry of Defence spokesperson said: “We are proud of UK leadership on Ukraine – supporting the fight today and working to secure the peace tomorrow.
“It’s why this Government is providing the highest ever level of military support, including a recent half-billion-pound air defence package just last week, accelerating £200 million for the UK military to prepare for any Ukraine deployment, and working with over 30 nations through the UK-led coalition of the willing.
“The multinational force Ukraine under UK leadership will secure peace for the long term, with the Prime Minister being clear that we will put British troops on the ground following the end of hostilities.”

Nico O’Reilly double seals key 2-1 win for Man City over Newcastle United
Manchester City’s win cut Arsenal’s lead at the top of the Premier League to two points.
Nico O’Reilly’s first-half brace inspired Manchester City to a vital 2-1 victory over Newcastle United, which turned up the heat on Premier League leaders Arsenal.
City took the lead on Saturday when O’Reilly slammed in a left-footed shot in the 14th minute before Lewis Hall levelled.

O’Reilly headed in Erling Haaland’s cross to restore City’s lead in the 27th minute, and it proved to be the match-winner as Pep Guardiola’s side cut Arsenal’s lead to two points.
Arsenal face north London rivals Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday, knowing that City are now breathing down their necks.
The stuttering form of Arsenal, who drew with the bottom club Wolverhampton Wanderers on Wednesday, opened the door for City, but victory over Newcastle was imperative.
It looked like a formality early on as they overran their visitors, but it was a different story after the break as they nervously held on to the victory.
Nothing illustrated City’s determination more than the sight of goal-machine Haaland working tirelessly back in his own area, blocking shots and making clearing headers.
Newcastle pushed hard for an equaliser, and when the final whistle blew, there was relief around Etihad Stadium. They will now be watching Arsenal’s Sunday derby with added interest.
City were slick at the start and went ahead when a surging Omar Marmoush played in O’Reilly. He could have touched it on for Haaland to his left, but the 20-year-old opted to trust his left foot, and his powerful shot beat Nick Pope.
Newcastle were level soon afterwards, though, as a weak clearance fell to Hall, whose shot took a touch off a City player before beating keeper Gianluigi Donnarumma.
Haaland was not on the scoresheet but showed many other attributes to his game, and it was his measured cross that was met by O’Reilly, who directed his header past Pope.
City were nowhere near as effective as an attacking force after the break, but they defended doggedly when required and were always a threat on the counter-attack.
They now have 56 points from 27 games. Should Arsenal fail to beat Tottenham on Sunday, City will feel they have the title race firmly in their hands.
O’Reilly said he was “over the moon” about the goals and three points.
“The win was the most important thing: close the gap and apply as much pressure as possible,” he told TNT Sports.
“Very happy with the two goals. It is a dream of mine to win [the Premier League].”
Asked if City, unbeaten in eight games, can win the title, he added: “Yeah, definitely. We always believe we can win games.”
Elsewhere on Saturday, Aston Villa’s faint Premier League title hopes suffered a blow as they were held to a 1-1 draw at home to Leeds United, and Chelsea’s top-four ambitions were damaged when they dropped two points against relegation-bound Burnley.
Anton Stach’s stunning 31st-minute free kick past Emiliano Martinez looked like giving Leeds a vital victory at Villa Park, but substitute Tammy Abraham levelled late on.
Chelsea moved above Manchester United into fourth spot on goal difference, but it felt like two points dropped for the second week running as they drew 1-1 with Burnley at home.
Joao Pedro put Chelsea ahead, but the hosts were reduced to 10 men when Wesley Fofana received a second yellow card and Burnley equalised in stoppage time through Zian Flemming.
Brighton’s James Milner broke the Premier League appearance record in their 2-0 win at Brentford.
The 40-year-old former Manchester City and Liverpool player made his 654th appearance to go past Gareth Barry.
West Ham had the opportunity to really put some pressure on Nottingham Forest and Spurs in the relegation battle, but played out a turgid draw with visiting Bournemouth. It was the sixth successive Premier League stalemate between the sides.

Journalists identify more than 186,000 Russian soldiers killed in Ukraine
The information comes from a joint report by the BBC Russian Service, Mediazona, and a team of volunteers, utilizing open data, according to Ukrinform.
Over the past month, the number of confirmed names has increased by almost 20,000, which is a record increase. However, as the study's authors emphasize, the increase in deaths is not related to the current situation on the front lines.
It is noted that the proportion of volunteers among the dead continues to grow: They now account for 33% of confirmed losses. More than half of all identified volunteers have died in the last year and a half.
The methodology for calculating the figures is based on an analysis of public reports, including obituaries, social media posts, and missing-person announcements. The actual number of casualties may be much higher.
According to Ukrinform, based on data from the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the total combat losses of Russian troops from February 24, 2022, to February 21, 2026, in the war against Ukraine amount to approximately 1,258,890 soldiers.

Someone was shot outside my building. It feels like a macabre rite of passage

Someone was shot outside my building. It feels like a macabre rite of passage
Washington: Hello from a pungent Washington DC, home of the sewage-filled Potomac River.
A few days ago, I joined an unfortunate club – Australian correspondents in Washington DC who have come all too close to a fatal shooting.
I had only been in my new apartment a week when an email lobbed from building management notifying me of an “emerging situation across the street” involving police and emergency services.
The incident occurred at 2.15pm on a Friday, while I was at work. By the time I got home that night, all traces of the emergency had disappeared.
But the next day, I learnt there had been a fatal shooting. The DC Metropolitan Police said the victim was 22-year-old Nehemia Jamaane Williams, a local, who was found inside a car and died in hospital from his injuries. Police were appealing for information. No arrests had been made.
Welcome to the neighbourhood, I guess. My new place is only a few blocks from where Matthew Cranston, a former Washington correspondent for The Australian Financial Review, witnessed a shooting inside a crowded McDonald’s in September 2022.
And that was just metres from where a 15-year-old boy was shot dead a few months earlier, near the apartment building where my predecessor as North America correspondent, Farrah Tomazin, lived.
Those incidents occurred amid a post-COVID crime wave that rocked the US capital and many American cities. It is partly why President Donald Trump sent the National Guard into Washington last year, even though rates of violent crime were already falling.
The fatal shooting outside my building – in broad daylight – was the seventh homicide in DC this year. The eighth came a few nights later in the Navy Yard neighbourhood south of Capitol Hill. And yet, there has been a 68 per cent decrease in the number of homicides so far this year compared to last year.
“We have one of the safest cities in the world,” Trump said on Wednesday (Washington time) at an event for Black History Month, as he welcomed to the stage Felicia Cook, whose grandson was killed during a violent encounter in 2017. “Now you can walk down the street, and you have nothing to fear.”
Trump regularly overstates the case with grand statements about how Washington now has “zero” crime, and how once-empty restaurants are now filled to bursting. “You can be with your child, with your loved one, with your lover,” he said last month. “Your lover’s not going to be killed any more, so you can act like a real lover.”
It’s difficult to take those statements seriously when someone’s shot dead on your doorstep. But, broadly speaking, we have to – because violent crime is down dramatically, not just in DC, but around the country.
The Council on Criminal Justice reported homicides were down 21 per cent in 2025 from 2024, based on data from 35 major US cities. That was 922 fewer homicides.
Furthermore, the council said that when national data is reported by the FBI later this year, there is a strong possibility that the murder rate will drop to 4 per 100,000 residents.
“That would be the lowest rate ever recorded in law enforcement or public health data going back to 1900, and would mark the largest single-year percentage drop in the homicide rate on record,” the council said.
The White House chalked this up as a major victory for Trump’s tough-on-crime agenda, compared to what it called Joe Biden’s “defund the police era”.
In reality, violent crime fell across the board, not just in cities where Trump mobilised the National Guard or cracked down on illegal immigrants. Homicides fell 40 per cent in Washington, but they also fell by the same proportion in Denver and Omaha, and by more than 20 per cent in cities from Atlanta to Dallas to New York.
This is all a good thing. Trump may be overstating his contribution to a trend that was already underway when he took office, but he has also rightly seized on the fact that most Americans want and need relief from violent crime.
Of course, a serious attempt to reduce that harm would involve changing the country’s gun laws. But that is not on the cards.
One thing you come to understand quickly in the US is the complicated nature of attitudes to guns. It’s not just redneck Republicans who cling to their weapons: last week in Washington, my group had a long debate with an otherwise very progressive bartender who was set on her right to bear arms.
DC is much safer than it was last year, and the year before that, and that’s welcome. Thanks, Mr President. But let’s not pretend all is fixed.

We will halve disadvantage gap in schools, ministers say in landmark education reforms
The government will reform how schools get targeted disadvantage funding as part of an attempt to tackle the gap in achievement between pupils from poorer backgrounds compared with their more affluent peers

Ministers will set a target to halve the disadvantage gap by the time children born under this government finish secondary school, as part of a plan to improve the education system in England.
To tackle the achievement gap between pupils from poorer backgrounds and their more affluent peers, the government will reform how schools get targeted disadvantage funding.
The Schools White Paper, set to be published in full on Monday, will also set out two new programmes to tackle the performance of disadvantaged pupils locally in the North East and on the coast.
It comes after details of the special educational needs and disabilities (Send) reforms also forming part of the white paper were leaked on Thursday.
It has been reported that from 2029, EHCPs (education, health and care plan) will be reassessed once children reach the end of primary school, proposals which sparked concern from disability charity Sense who warned that reassessments could increase instability for children and young people.
An EHCP is a legally binding document in the UK for children and young people with special educational needs or disabilities that require more support than is normally available in school.
The reforms are expected to introduce a plan with legal footing for all children with Send called Individual Support Plans (ISPs).
Speaking about plans to halve the attainment gap, education secretary Bridget Phillipson said: “These reforms are a golden opportunity to cut the link between background and success – one that we must seize.
“Our schools have made great strides in recent decades. Yet for too long, many children in our country have been let down by a one-size-fits-all system, denied opportunity because they’re poor or because they have additional needs.
“Our Schools White Paper presents the blueprint for opportunity for the next generation, with an education system that truly serves every child, whatever their needs and wherever in the country they grow up.”
In the latest GCSE results, the disadvantage gap index for year 11s stood at 3.92, according to figures from the Department for Education (DfE).
It had previously narrowed from 4.07 in 2011 to a low of 3.66 in 2019/20 with some small fluctuations in between. It then widened again post-pandemic to the highest it had been in a decade at 3.94 in 2022/23.
The government will also set a new target for attendance to recover 20 million school days a year by the end of 2028/29 compared with 2023/24.
Instead of targeting disadvantage funding based on whether a child is eligible to receive free school meals (FSM), after a consultation, distribution of funding to schools could take into account how low family income is, how long this has been the case, and the place a child lives.
It would also remove the need for families to choose to take up free school meals to be eligible for deprivation funding, in an attempt to cut admin for schools.
The two new programmes, Mission North East and Mission Coastal – will aim to tackle poorer performance for disadvantaged pupils in the areas, including white working-class pupils.
It will be based on the model of the London Challenge, a programme which was introduced to improve schools in London under the Labour government in 2003.
The White Paper will also set out how incentives worth up to £15,000 for newly appointed headteachers to work in parts of the country that need heads.
It will further include a commitment to develop minimum expectations for schools around how they communicate with parents and manage pupils’ transition from primary to secondary school.
The Schools White Paper was originally set to be published in autumn 2025, but was delayed to allow a further period to test Send reforms.

Ministers to set out plans to halve attainment gap in England’s schools

Plans to halve the attainment gap between the poorest pupils in England and their more affluent peers will be set out by the government on Monday.
The schools white paper will detail proposals to change the criteria under which schools receive funding to support the most disadvantaged students.
Disadvantage funding is now allocated based on how many pupils at a school receive free school meals – generally available to children from families with an annual income of less than £7,400.
Labour wants to broaden this criteria, overhauling the funding formula to give greater weight to funding pupils based on family income.
The policy is likely to shift funding for disadvantage payments away from the annual pupil premium payments given to schools for each child eligible for free school meals.
The white paper will also include controversial proposals for local authorities to be able to administer groups of schools through their own multiacademy trusts, and set new minimum expectations for schools to engage with parents.
The “disadvantage gap is as stark today as it was over a decade ago”, Labour said, with only 44% of children in receipt of free school meals achieving a pass of grade 4 or above in GCSE maths and English. This compares with 70% of children who do not qualify for free school meals, the party added.
Bridget Phillipson, the education secretary, said: “These reforms are a golden opportunity to cut the link between background and success – one that we must seize.
“Our schools have made great strides in recent decades. Yet for too long, many children in our country have been let down by a one-size-fits-all system, denied opportunity because they’re poor or because they have additional needs.
“Our schools white paper presents the blueprint for opportunity for the next generation, with an education system that truly serves every child, whatever their needs and wherever in the country they grow up.”
At present, disadvantage funding for schools costs about £8bn a year. There is no guarantee the pot would be increased to reflect the proposed changes, with government sources saying this would be determined at the next spending review.
Some MPs and campaigners have questioned how effective these proposed reforms will be without more guaranteed funding.
Munira Wilson, the Liberal Democrat education spokesperson, said: “Basing funding on income alone risks hard-wiring regional inequalities into the system.
“Instead of reshuffling a fixed pot of money – risking new cliff edges that will leave struggling families even worse off – ministers must restore the pupil premium to its 2015 real-terms value.
“Starmer must also guarantee that any investment will rise with inflation, so no child is left without the support they need.”
Pepe Di’Iasio, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: “We very much agree with the provision of more targeted funding for schools supporting the most disadvantaged children and have advocated for such a measure for several years.
“However, it is vital that this is done through additional investment into the education system, rather than distributing the same pot of money in a different way, with the risk of creating winners and losers.”
The white paper will also outline plans for two new programmes – Mission North East and Mission Coastal – to tackle the performances of deprived pupils in certain parts of the country. The Guardian understands the precise locations for these initiatives have yet to be decided.
They will be based on the London Challenge, a New Labour project aimed at driving up attainment in secondary schools in the capital that focused on schools working together to share learning and ideas. It was praised by Ofsted for helping to improve educational standards.
The government is also planning a radical overhaul of the special educational needs (Send) system as part of its plans. It plans to give every child with Send an individual support plan.
However, some Labour MPs are thought to be nervous about some of the plans, particularly whether parents will retain the right to appeal if they are unhappy with the level of support their child is receiving.
The white paper was originally due to be published last autumn, but was delayed to allow for further consideration of the Send proposals.
Ministers are also expected to announce new attendance targets in an effort to recover 20m lost school days a year.
It will propose pay rises for newly appointed headteachers to incentivise them to work in parts of the country where the need is greatest. This could be worth up to £15,000 to individual teachers.

Pakistan carries out strikes against terrorist targets in Afghanistan

Pakistan has said it has carried out strikes along the Afghanistan border to target terrorists it blames for recent attacks.
Pakistani forces reportedly carried out air strikes in several areas of eastern and southeastern Afghanistan on Sunday, according to Afghan local media and the Pakistani Ministry of Information.
Islamabad did not say precisely in which areas the strikes were carried out or provide details. There was no immediate comment from Kabul.
In comments before dawn Sunday, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar wrote on X that the military conducted what he described as “intelligence-based, selective operations” against seven camps belonging to Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan, or TTP, and its affiliates.
He said an affiliate of the Daesh group was also targeted in the border region.
In October, Pakistan also conducted strikes deep inside Afghanistan to target terrorist hideouts.
“Sources told TOLO News that following the air strikes in Khogyani district, Nangarhar province, Pakistani forces also carried out strikes in the province’s Ghani Khel district, Nangarhar province, and Behsud district, Nangarhar province,” the Afghan news channel TOLO News wrote on X.
“Pakistan expects and reiterates the Interim Afghan Government to fulfil its obligations and deny use of its soil by Khwarij and terrorists against Pakistan, as the safety and security of people of Pakistan comes first and foremost,” the ministry added.
The strikes came in the aftermath of recent suicide bombing incidents in Pakistan, it said.
Pakistan vowed to avenge the killing of two security personnel on Saturday in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, warning that it would not allow any attack launched from Afghanistan to go unanswered.
No confirmed information has been released so far regarding possible casualties.
Pakistan has accused neighbouring Afghanistan of sheltering TTP terrorists and of being responsible for a surge in cross-border attacks, a claim which Afghanistan denied.
The Pakistani government has urged the Afghan government to dismantle the alleged sanctuaries of the TTP terrorist group inside Afghanistan.
According to Pakistani military officials, more than 500 people, including over 311 soldiers, were killed in attacks, largely carried out by the TTP, last year.
Pakistan’s foreign ministry also summoned on Friday an Afghan diplomat over a recent terrorist attack in the northwestern province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa near the Afghan border that killed 11 soldiers.

5 bodies of migrants washed ashore in east of Libya's capital Tripoli, police officer says

TRIPOLI, Feb 21 - At least five bodies of migrants including two women have been washed ashore in َQasr al-Akhyar, a coastal town in the east of Libya's capital Tripoli, a police officer told Reuters on Saturday.
Hassan Al-Ghawil, head of investigations at the Qasr Al-Akhyar police station, said that according to people in the area, a child's body washed ashore and because of the waves' height the body returned to the sea, and the coast guard was asked to search for it.
Ghawil said the bodies are all dark-skinned people. The bodies were found on Emhamid Al-Sharif shore in the western part of the town by people who reported to the police station.
Libya has become a transit route for migrants fleeing conflict and poverty to Europe across the Mediterranean since the fall in 2011 of dictator Muammar Gaddafi to a NATO-backed uprising. Factional conflict has split the country into western and eastern factions since 2014.
Qasr al-Akhyar is a coastal town some 73 kilometers (45 miles) east of Tripoli.
Pictures were posted on the internet, and also seen by Reuters, showing the bodies of the migrants lying on the shore, where some were still within black inflatable lifebuoys.
"We reported to the Red Crescent to recover the bodies," said Ghawil. "The bodies we found are still intact and we think there are more bodies to wash ashore."
Earlier this month, fifty-three migrants, including two babies, were dead or missing after a rubber boat carrying 55 people capsized off the coast of Zuwara town in western Tripoli, the International Organization for Migration said.
Last week, a U.N. report said migrants in Libya, including young girls, are at risk of being killed, tortured, raped or put into domestic slavery, calling for a moratorium on the return of migrant boats to the country until human rights are ensured. REUTERS

Islamic State claims two attacks on Syrian army, announces ‘new phase’ of operations
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
Islamic State claimed responsibility on Feb 21 for two attacks targeting Syrian army personnel in northern and eastern Syria, as the militant group signalled what it described as a new phase of operations against the country’s leadership
The militant group said on its Dabiq news agency that it had targeted “an individual of the apostate Syrian regime” in the city of Mayadin in Deir al-Zor province using a pistol, and attacked two other personnel with machine guns in the northern city of Raqqa.
Syria’s Defence Ministry said in a statement that a Syrian army soldier and a civilian were killed on Feb 21 by “unknown assailants.” A military source told Reuters the soldier belonged to the army’s 42nd Division.
The attacks come amid a sharp escalation by ISIS against Syria’s leadership under President Ahmed al-Sharaa, a former al Qaeda leader who broke with the group in 2016 before leading a coalition of Islamist factions that overthrew President Bashar al-Assad at the end of 2024.
On the evening of Feb 21, ISIS released a recorded statement by its spokesperson, Abu Hudhayfa al-Ansari, who said Syria had “moved from Iranian occupation to Turkish-American occupation.”
The group said it had begun a “new phase of operations” in Syria, describing Mr Sharaa as a “watchdog” of the global coalition and vowing that his fate would be no different from that of Mr Assad.
Mr Sharaa signed Syria’s accession to the global coalition
The latest incidents come two days after IS claimed responsibility for another attack in Deir al-Zor that killed a member of the Interior Ministry’s internal security forces and wounded another.
Several social media accounts and Telegram channels supporting ISIS have in recent hours called for intensified attacks using motorcycles and firearms.
ISIS has carried out six attacks against Syrian government targets since the fall of Assad.
A report by the UN Office of Counter-Terrorism released last week said Mr Sharaa and two senior Cabinet ministers had been targeted in five foiled assassination attempts by ISIS. REUTERS

Attacks on Sudan healthcare facilities killed 69 this year
Five attacks on healthcare facilities have killed dozens of people in Sudan since the beginning of the year, the WHO said Saturday, as the war nears the start of its fourth year.
The fighting between Sudan's army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces has dismantled an already fragile medical system, with more than a third of facilities currently out of service.
"During the first 50 days of 2026, five attacks on health care have already been recorded in Sudan, killing 69 people and injuring 49," WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus wrote on X.
On Sunday a hospital was targeted in the southeastern state of Sennar, leaving three patients dead and seven people wounded, including an employee, Tedros said.
In three other attacks early this month, more than 30 people were killed when medical centres were targeted in South Kordofan, a vast region south of the capital Khartoum that is currently a focus of the fighting.
The WHO has confirmed at least 206 attacks on healthcare facilities since the start of the war in April 2023, resulting in the deaths of around 2,000 people and injuries to several hundred.
Last year alone, 65 attacks killed more than 1,620 people, accounting for 80 percent of all deaths worldwide linked to attacks on the medical sector, according to the WHO.
Since it broke out, Sudan's civil war has killed tens of thousands of people and forced 11 million to flee their homes, triggering what the UN says is one of the world's worst humanitarian crises.
According to the WHO, the country is facing multiple disease outbreaks, notably cholera, malaria, dengue and measles, in addition to malnutrition.
Some 4.2 million cases of acute malnutrition are expected to arise in Sudan this year, including more than 800,000 cases of severe acute malnutrition, the WHO chief said earlier this month.
Around 33 million people will be left without humanitarian aid in 2026, with the United Nations warning in January that its aid stocks could run out by the end of March.

Venezuela receives more than 1,500 amnesty requests under new law
More than 370 political prisoners have already been granted amnesty under the US-backed legislation.
More than 1,5000 political prisoners in Venezuela have applied for amnesty under a new law that came into effect just a few days ago, according to the head of the country’s legislature.
“A total of 1,557 cases are being addressed immediately, and hundreds of people deprived of their freedom are already being released under the amnesty law”, National Assembly chief Jorge Rodriguez told a news conference on Saturday.

Rodriguez’s announcement comes two days after the country’s legislature unanimously adopted a landmark amnesty law.
Amnesty is not automatic under the law: petitioners must ask the court handling their cases.
On Friday, the lawmaker overseeing the amnesty process, Jorge Arreaza, announced that prosecutors had asked courts to free 379 prisoners. They include opposition members, activists, human rights defenders, journalists and many others detained for months or even years.
So far, 80 prisoners have been freed, Rodriguez told the AFP news agency on Saturday. All of those released had been detained in the capital, Caracas, he said, without offering further details.
Further releases could be granted within 15 days, said Arreaza.
Venezuela’s interim president, Delcy Rodriguez, the sister of the top lawmaker, pushed for the United States-backed legislation after she rose to power following the US’s abduction of leftist leader Nicolas Maduro during a military raid on January 3.
The legislation’s approval marked a reversal for Venezuelan authorities, who have for decades denied holding political prisoners and say those jailed have committed crimes.
During its signing, Rodriguez said the law showed that the country’s political leaders were “letting go of a little intolerance and opening new avenues for politics in Venezuela”.
However, opposition figures have criticised the new legislation, which appears to include carve-outs for some offences previously used by authorities to target Maduro’s political opponents.
Human rights organisations are also calling for the law to be applied to all prisoners held for political reasons, even if they are not listed among the beneficiaries.
“It is discriminatory and unconstitutional to exclude imprisoned military personnel and persecuted political figures,” Alfredo Romero, president of rights group Foro Penal, said on X Saturday. Without this, “there can be no talk of national coexistence”.
The law explicitly does not apply to those prosecuted for “promoting” or “facilitating… armed or forceful actions” against Venezuela’s sovereignty by foreign actors.
Delcy Rodriguez has levelled such accusations against opposition leader and Nobel peace laureate Maria Corina Machado, who hopes, at some point, to return to Venezuela from the US.
Opposition politician Juan Pablo Guanipa, a close ally of Machado, had a house arrest order against him lifted, his brother, lawmaker Tomas Guanipa, told the Reuters news agency late on Thursday.
The law also excludes members of the security forces convicted of “terrorism”-related activities.
But the amnesty extends to 11,000 political prisoners who, over nearly three decades, were paroled or placed under house arrest.
“The law provides for those substitute measures to be lifted so that these people can enjoy full freedom”, Rodriguez told reporters.
Outside a national police facility in Caracas known as Zone 7, relatives – some of whom have been on site for weeks – waited patiently.
“Let’s hope it’s true,” Genesis Rojas told AFP.
A group of relatives who have been camped out for days chanted: “We want to go home!”
Hundreds have already been granted conditional release by Rodriguez’s government since the deadly US raid that resulted in Maduro’s capture.
Maduro and his wife are in US custody awaiting trial. He has pleaded not guilty to drug trafficking charges and declared that he was a “prisoner of war.”

Finland secured Olympic bronze in men’s ice hockey with a 6–1 victory over Slovakia in Saturday’s medal match, sealing the country’s eighth Olympic medal in the sport.
The win marked Finland’s fifth bronze and continued a run of podium finishes in tournaments featuring NHL players. In six such Olympic events, Finland have claimed five medals.
The teams had met in the opening group match, when Slovakia won 4–1. This time Finland controlled the decisive stages and scored four times in the third period to settle the contest.
Sebastian Aho opened the scoring at 7:27 of the first period, finishing a play set up by Artturi Lehkonen and Miro Heiskanen. Finland led 1–0 after the opening twenty minutes.
Erik Haula doubled the advantage at 28:05 in the second period, assisted by Joel Armia and Eeli Tolvanen. Slovakia responded late in the period when Tomas Tatar scored at 39:30 to cut the deficit to 2–1.
The game turned early in the third period. With Slovakia pressing for an equaliser, Finland earned a power play. Roope Hintz redirected a point shot at 48:27 to restore a two-goal lead. Heiskanen and Tolvanen recorded assists.
Less than a minute later, Kaapo Kakko extended the lead to 4–1 with a wrist shot from space in the slot. Slovakia struggled to recover after conceding twice in quick succession.
Slovakia withdrew goaltender Samuel Hlavaj in the closing minutes in search of a comeback. Armia scored into the empty net at 55:32 after receiving the puck from Hintz. Haula added his second of the night at 58:42, also into an empty net, with Armia and Rasmus Ristolainen providing assists.
Haula finished with two goals. Armia recorded one goal and two assists. Hintz scored once and added an assist. Heiskanen and Tolvanen each contributed two assists.
Juuse Saros made 30 saves for Finland. Hlavaj stopped 29 shots for Slovakia.
Finland captain Mikael Granlund left the ice in the third period after hitting his head against the boards during a shift. He removed his helmet and went to the dressing room following a discussion with medical staff. According to Yle’s live coverage, Granlund later returned to the bench for the post-match handshakes and continued talks with the team doctor.
The bronze medal represents Finland’s first men’s major tournament medal since the 2022 World Championship title. The country previously won Olympic gold in Beijing and silver in Turin in 2006 and Calgary in 1988.
Saturday’s result concludes the men’s tournament at the Milano-Cortina Winter Games weekend with Finland returning home with a place on the podium.

Slovakia Marks 8 Years Since the Murder of Journalist Ján Kuciak and his Fiancée

Reported by
Hundreds of people gathered in Bratislava and other cities across Slovakia on Saturday to mark the eighth anniversary of the killings of investigative reporter Ján Kuciak and his fiancée, Martina Kušnírová, in a case that shook the country but still lacks a final answer about who ordered their deaths.
The murders on Feb. 21, 2018, were carried out by gunman Miroslav Marček, who shot Kuciak twice in the chest and Kušnírová once in the head, while an accomplice, Tomáš Szabó, waited nearby, prosecutors said.
Both men are serving 25-year prison sentences. Authorities say they acted on instructions relayed by intermediary Zoltán Andruskó, who confessed and received a 15-year term.
Yet the central question — who commissioned the assassination — remains unresolved, leaving one of Europe’s most consequential journalist murder cases without closure.
Prosecutors allege that businessman Marian Kočner ordered the killing through an associate, Alena Zsuzsová, who then tasked Andruskó. Courts have twice acquitted Kočner and once convicted Zsuzsová, but each verdict has been overturned on appeal, effectively resetting the case.
The retrial, now underway at the Specialized Criminal Court in Pezinok, follows a ruling last May by the Supreme Court of Slovakia that cited serious flaws in how earlier judges evaluated evidence. The high court said the panel had failed to address key facts and had not followed prior judicial instructions.
The new proceedings, which opened in January and are scheduled to run through December, also include charges tied to alleged plots against prosecutors. Two additional defendants — Dušan Kračina and Darko Dragić — are accused in those cases.
The killings prompted mass demonstrations in 2018 that helped topple a government and reshaped the country’s political landscape. Eight years on, the case remains a symbol of unresolved justice and the risks faced by investigative journalists.
At a commemorative gathering at Freedom Square, Kuciak’s father, Jozef Kuciak, told attendees, according to The Slovak Spectator: “Every day we live with pain; every day we go to the cemetery to light candles instead of raising our grandchildren.”
In a statement, Pavol Szalai of Reporters Without Borders urged judges to “duly examine” all evidence and rule independently, adding, “Europe’s eyes are on Slovakia.”
Roberta Metsola, president of the European Parliament, said the murders had “shaken Europe” and noted they came months after the killing of Daphne Caruana Galizia. “Their courage remains a beacon for journalists across the continent who risk everything to uncover the truth and safeguard our democracies,” she wrote on X.

K-pop’s big freeze: are cracks in China’s cultural blockade a thaw?
A decade-long geopolitical chill has kept South Korean entertainers largely locked out of the Chinese market, but fans find ways to connect
While K-pop has conquered almost every corner of the globe, South Korea’s entertainment industry remains largely locked out of the Chinese market due to a geopolitical chill that has lingered for a decade.
In early January, the Chinese remake of the South Korean television series My Mister – featuring singer-actress IU – was released on the streaming platform Youku. The Chinese version, titled Loving Strangers, starred actors Mark Chao Yu-ting and Zhang Zifeng. Media reports noted that it was the first South Korean drama remake to be publicly distributed in China since the ban began.
Earlier this month, South Korean entertainment company CJ ENM partnered with JYP Entertainment’s Chinese subsidiary and Tencent Music Entertainment to launch Onecead, an artist management and music production company with a focus on the Chinese market.

Crews recover bodies of 9 backcountry skiers days after California avalanche
Crews recover bodies of 9 backcountry skiers days after California avalanche
TRUCKEE, Calif. (AP) — Crews recovered the bodies of nine backcountry skiers who were killed in a California avalanche four days ago, authorities said Saturday, concluding a harrowing operation hindered by intense snowfall.
A search team reached the bodies of eight victims and found one other who had been missing and presumed dead since Tuesday’s avalanche on Castle Peak near Lake Tahoe. The ninth person who was missing was found “relatively close” to the other victims, according to Nevada County Sheriff’s Lt. Dennis Hack, but it was impossible to see them because there were white-out conditions on Tuesday when the others were located.
At a news conference on Saturday, Nevada County Sheriff Shannon Moon praised the collective efforts of the numerous agencies who helped recover the victims, including the 42 volunteers who helped on the last day of the operation.
“We are fortunate in this mountain community that we are very tight knit, and our community shows up in times of tragedy,” Moon said.
Victims named
The sheriff named for the first time on Saturday the three guides for the Blackbird Mountain Company who were killed in the avalanche. They are Andrew Alissandratos, 34, Nicole Choo, 42, and Michael Henry, 30.
Alissandratos was originally from Tampa, Florida, but moved to Tahoe roughly a decade ago, according to his biography on the guide website. Blackbird Mountain Company. He enjoyed a wide array of adventure, like split-boarding and rock climbing. Henry moved to Colorado in 2016, and then to Truckee three years later, the site said. He is described as “laid back” and eager to share his knowledge and love of the mountains with others. There was no bio for Choo on the website on Saturday.
“This was an enormous tragedy, and the saddest event our team has ever experienced,” Zeb Blais, founder of Blackbird Mountain Guides, wrote in a statement on Wednesday.
“We are doing what we can to support the families who lost so much, and the members of our team who lost treasured friends and colleagues,” he wrote.
The six others killed were women who were part of a close-knit group of friends who were experienced backcountry skiers and knew how to navigate the wilderness of California’s Sierra Nevada, their families said Thursday.
Two of the friends got out alive and were rescued along with four others, including one guide, after Tuesday’s avalanche.
“We are devastated beyond words,” the families said in a statement released through a spokesperson. “Our focus right now is supporting our children through this incredible tragedy and honoring the lives of these extraordinary women. They were all mothers, wives and friends, all of whom connected through the love of the outdoors.”
The six killed lived in the Bay Area, Idaho and near Lake Tahoe. They are Carrie Atkin, Liz Clabaugh, Danielle Keatley, Kate Morse, Caroline Sekar and Kate Vitt, the families said, asking for privacy as they grieve. They added that they “have many unanswered questions.” They were all in their 40s.
Stuck on the mountain for hours
The tragedy began around 11:30 a.m. Tuesday when six survivors called for help, describing a sudden and terrifying avalanche that was approximately the length of a football field. In the aftermath of the snowfall, those survivors had discovered the bodies of three deceased skiers nearby, according to Hack.
It was the last day of the three-day tour in the stunning and remote Sierra Nevada, and the group of 15 skiers decided to end the trip early to avoid the impending snowstorm. There were 11 skiers and four guides. Officials described the path that the group was taking as a “normally traveled route” but declined to specify what that meant.
Initial reports indicated that at least two people in the group did not get swept away, Hack said. The others were standing separately and relatively close together and were hit with the avalanche.
Hack declined to offer more information about what might have set off the avalanche.
First responders weren’t able to reach them until roughly six hours after the initial call for help, Hack said, and were forced to take two separate paths. The rescue teams also found the bodies of five others, leaving only one unaccounted for.
But it was immediately clear to rescuers that it was too dangerous to extract the bodies of the victims at that time due to the heavy snowfall and threat of more avalanches. Those conditions persisted on Wednesday and Thursday, as the families of victims waited for the bad weather to abate.
Breakthrough on Friday
Officials used two helicopters belonging to the California Highway Patrol, with the help of Pacific Gas and Electric company, to break up the snow in the area to intentionally release unstable snowpack to reduce the risk of another avalanche for rescue crews.
The state highway agency was able to recover five victims that evening before it got too dark to access the last three.
Helicopters with the California National Guard and California Highway Patrol recovered the final four bodies on Saturday morning with helicopters by hoisting them from the mountain with ropes, fighting through severe winds that forced the agencies to make multiple trips. The bodies were then taken to nearby snowcats — trucks that are outfitted to be able to drive on snow.
“We cannot say enough how tremendously sorry we are for the families that has been affected by this avalanche,” Moon said.
Land will reopen in March
The area will be closed to visitors until mid-March, said Chris Feutrier, the forest supervisor for the Tahoe National Forest. But he said that officials fully intended on restoring public access as soon as the investigation is complete.
“This is the public’s land, and they love to recreate on it,” Feutrier said. “The Forest Service doesn’t close public land for every hazard or every obstacle. We trust the American people to use their best judgment when recreating.”

Kaillie Humphries Armbruster of U.S. wins record-tying sixth Olympic bobsled medal

Kaillie Humphries Armbruster of U.S. wins record-tying sixth Olympic bobsled medal; Germany's Laura Nolte takes gold
American Kaillie Humphries Armbruster, in perhaps her Olympic bobsled finale, found her way to the medal stand for a record-tying sixth time Saturday in the two-woman bobsled, while Germany's Laura Nolte won gold again.
Nolte is now the back-to-back two-woman Olympic bobsled champion, holding off teammate Lisa Buckwitz to grab gold at the Milan Cortina Games on Saturday night.
Nolte — the winner of the last four World Cup two-woman titles — cemented her status as the sport's current queen, teaming with Deborah Levi to win her second consecutive two-woman gold medal by finishing four runs in 3 minutes, 48.46 seconds.
Buckwitz, with Neele Schuten in her sled, was second in 3:48.99. Humphries Armbruster and Jasmine Jones — two mothers in the same sled for the U.S. — finished third in 3:49.21. It was the sixth Olympic medal for Humphries Armbruster, tying fellow American Elana Meyers Taylor for the most by any woman in the sport's history.
Also for the U.S., Kaysha Love — who has been dealing with a hamstring issue for much of the season and had it flare up again in Italy — and Azaria Hill finished fifth in 3:49.71. Meyers Taylor and Jadin O'Brien, who were doomed by a second-heat skid at the top of the track Friday night, got a few spots back in the standings Saturday and finished tied for seventh in 3:50.49.
Germany now has six bobsled medals in these Olympics, while the U.S. has three and the rest of the world has zero. The divide might get bigger on Sunday in the final sliding event of the Milan Cortina Games; Germany, which already swept the two-man race, is in position to do the same thing in four-man after Saturday's opening two heats of that competition.
And Germany is now up to 17 sliding medals, counting bobsled, skeleton and luge, at Milan Cortina — one more than the rest of the world. Austria has five, the U.S. now has four along with Italy, Britain has two and Latvia has one.
The two-woman race was basically for the bronze going into the final run.
Nolte — who had the lead, albeit a much smaller one, going into the final heat of the monobob competition that Meyers Taylor ended up winning — led Buckwitz by 0.35 seconds going into the last heat. Buckwitz's lead over Humphries Armbruster was 0.19 seconds, and Humphries Armbruster was only 0.09 seconds up on Germany's Kim Kalicki in the race for the bronze.
Kalicki's final time: 3:49.36. It wasn't enough to catch Humphries Armbruster, who hopped out of the sled and wrapped herself and Jones in the American flag, knowing the medal was theirs.
Humphries Armbruster's updated Olympic medal count: three golds, three bronzes.
Meyers Taylor is 41, Humphries Armbruster is 40. Meyers Taylor is a mother of two, Humphries Armbruster has one son, and both women are talking about how they would like to add another baby to their families.
That means Saturday night might have been the last on the Olympic stage for them — and maybe on any sliding stage.
It was the 177th race — counting World Cups, world championships, the short-lived monobob World Series and the Olympics — for Meyers Taylor at the major international level. She has 78 medals from those races, six of them coming in the Olympics, and was a winner either as a driver or pusher in three different decades.
And for Humphries Armbruster, who won three Olympic medals for Canada and now has three more for the U.S., the numbers are even more gaudy: 105 medals in 218 major international races, with 49 of them victories.
If this is the end, for either or for both of them, what a ride it was.

Trump hikes US global tariff rate from 10% to 15%
US President Donald Trump raised the global duty on imports into the United States to 15 per cent on Feb 21, doubling down on his promise to maintain his aggressive tariff policy a day after the Supreme Court ruled much of it illegal.
Mr Trump said on his Truth Social platform that after a thorough review of Feb 20’s “extraordinarily anti-American decision” by the court to rein in his tariff programme, the administration was hiking the import levies “to the fully allowed, and legally tested, 15% level.”
Shortly after the court’s 6-3 ruling that rejected the president’s authority to impose tariffs under a 1977 economic emergency powers act, Mr Trump had initially announced a new 10 percent global levy by invoking a different legal avenue.
At the same time, he launched an extraordinary personal attack on the conservative justices who had sided with the majority, slamming their “disloyalty” and calling them “fools and lap dogs.”
Thousands march in France for slain far-right activist under heavy security
Thousands of people marched in south-eastern France on Feb 21 under heavy security in tribute to a far-right activist whose killing, blamed on the hard left, has put the country on edge.
The crowd – many wearing black and some covering their lower faces with masks – marched through the city of Lyon carrying flowers and placards bearing pictures of Quentin Deranque and the words, “justice for Quentin” and “the extreme left kills”.
The 23-year-old died from head injuries following clashes between radical left and far-right supporters on the sidelines of a demonstration against a politician from the left-wing France Unbowed (LFI) party in Lyon last week.
US citizen shot and killed by federal immigration agent last year, records show
A federal immigration agent shot and killed a US citizen in Texas in March 2025, months before the Trump administration began its deportation surge in Minnesota that led to the shooting deaths of Renee Good and Alex Pretti, according to records released this week.
Mr Ruben Ray Martinez, 23, was killed by agents with the Department of Homeland Security, attorneys for Mr Martinez's family said in a statement.
A DHS agent fired multiple rounds at Mr Martinez, who allegedly hit another DHS agent with his car as the agents assisted local police in South Padre Island, Texas, with traffic control following an accident on March 15, 2025, according to records obtained by American Oversight, a nonprofit watchdog group. The agents were conducting immigration enforcement, the records show.
Political drama Yellow Letters wins Golden Bear at Berlin film festival
Yellow Letters, directed by German filmmaker Ilker Catak, won the Golden Bear for best film at the Berlin Film Festival on Feb 21 in a ceremony reflecting the controversy over Gaza which has dogged 2026’s edition of the event.
A political drama, Catak’s film tells the story of a Turkish director and his actor wife, suddenly barred from working because of their political opinions.
Jury president Wim Wenders called the film “a terrifying premonition, a look into the near future that could possibly happen in our countries as well”.
Chelsea, Aston Villa held in blow to Champions League hopes
Burnley dented Chelsea’s chances of Champions League qualification by snatching a 1-1 draw at Stamford Bridge, while Aston Villa also struck late to salvage a point against Leeds on Feb 21.
The Blues climb into the Premier League’s top four only on goal difference after they paid for failing to build on Joao Pedro’s fourth-minute opener.
Chelsea were dominant until Wesley Fofana was sent off with 18 minutes remaining for a second yellow card.

US ambassador says Israel has right to much of Middle East, sparking uproar
Mike Huckabee’s comments were condemned by Arab and Muslim nations as ‘extremist rhetoric’
Arab and Muslim nations on Saturday sharply condemned comments by the US ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, who said Israel has a right to much of the Middle East.
Huckabee made the comments in an interview with conservative commentator Tucker Carlson that aired on Friday. Carlson said that according to the Bible, the descendants of Abraham would receive land that today would include essentially the entire Middle East, and asked Huckabee if Israel had a right to that land.
Huckabee responded: “It would be fine if they took it all.” Huckabee added, however, that Israel was not looking to expand its territory and has a right to security in the land it legitimately holds.
His comments sparked immediate backlash from neighbouring Egypt and Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman, the Organization of Islamic Cooperation and the League of Arab States.
Saudi Arabia’s foreign ministry described Huckabee’s comments as “extremist rhetoric” and “unacceptable”, and called for the US State Department to clarify its position on them.
Egypt’s foreign ministry called his comments a “blatant violation” of international law, adding that “Israel has no sovereignty over the occupied Palestinian territory or other Arab lands”.

Norwegian star breaks Olympic record with sixth Milano Cortina gold

Johannes Høsflot Klæbo becomes first athlete to win six gold medals at one Winter Olympics
In short:
Norway's Johannes Høsflot Klæbo has become the first athlete to win six gold medals at a single Winter Olympics.
Klæbo passed the previous record of five set by USA's Eric Heiden at the 1980 Lake Placid Games.
Klæbo now has 11 Olympic gold medals, sitting behind only American swim icon Michael Phelps (23) for most ever.
Norway's Johannes Høsflot Klæbo completed his historic gold medal sweep of the men's cross-country skiing events by winning his sixth race and setting the record for the most golds by one athlete in a single Winter Olympics.
Klæbo's victory in the 50-kilometre mass start race shattered the nearly 50-year record set by American speed skater Eric Heiden, who won five golds in the 1980 Lake Placid Olympics.
All of Heiden's wins were in individual races and two of Klæbo's have come in team events, so Heiden's record for individual wins still stands.
"It feels amazing," Klæbo said. "To crown everything here with a 50K, it's unbelievable. In Norway, we say that if you're gonna become a man, you need to win the 50K and today we did, so it's a perfect way to end two perfect weeks."
The solid gold performance matched the feat he accomplished at last year's world championships in Trondheim, Norway, when he won all six events.
Klæbo's teammates, Martin Løwstrøm Nyenget, took silver, and Emil Iversen won bronze in a Norwegian sweep.
The three Norwegians had a lead before the halfway mark and continued to build the gap on their chasers.
Nyenget drove a fast pace, trying the entire race to shake his compatriot, knowing that if he didn't, he'd fall victim to Klæbo's trademark uphill sprint.
Klaebo said he was just trying to hang on and conserve energy for the finish.
Toward the end, Nyenget and Klæbo pushed uphill and dropped Iversen. Klæbo stayed in second waiting to launch his winning move.
As the two reached the final hill, Klæbo ran away from Nyenget.
As he glided toward the finish, he pointed his fingers toward the sky, took one stride across the line, toppled over on his right hip and rolled onto his back. He finished in 2:06:44.8.
Nyenget finished 8.9 seconds later and Iversen was 30.7 seconds behind.
"I went hard from the start, so I managed to get rid of everyone else, but the best," Nyenget said. "So I'm really happy about my performance, but Johannes is the king."
France's Theo Schely finished fourth, nearly three minutes back and Savelii Korostelev, a Russian competing as an individual neutral athlete, finished fifth at 3:38.3 back.
The highest-placed US skier was Gus Schumacher, who won a silver in a team relay, in 13th place.
Five skiers, including Iivo Niskanen of Finland and Harald Oestberg Amundsen of Norway, dropped out of the race and 14 competitors were lapped.
The win extends Klæbo's record for most career Winter Olympic gold medals to 11 over three Games. The previous record had been eight, which Klæbo broke on February 15.
Klæbo has the second-most Olympic golds overall behind only US swimming great Michael Phelps, who has 23.
The win gave Norway a record 18th gold medal and further increased their lead in the total medal count in these games to 40 overall, also a Winter Olympics record, though the 116 medal events this year is more than in the past.
The country set the record on Friday for the most gold medals won by a nation at a single Winter Olympics when biathlete Johannes Dale-Skjevdal won the 15-kilometre mass start race.

Syrian govt takes over management of airport held by Kurds
Syrian authorities have taken over management of Qamishli airport as part of an ongoing process to integrate Kurdish-led forces and institutions into the national government, state media reported Saturday.
The SANA news agency, citing the General Authority of Civil Aviation and Air Transport, said officials had toured the facility on Saturday after assuming control and "discussed mechanisms to restart its operations".
The head of the authority, Omar al-Husari, said on X that taking over the airport was "an important institutional step in the process of unifying the management of airports under the umbrella of the state".
The Kurds - who controlled much of northeast Syria before striking the integration deal under military pressure from the government - had taken over the airport following the fall of longtime ruler Bashar al-Assad just over a year ago.
While it was not open to civilian flights, Russia had used part of the facility as a base before withdrawing last month.
Qamishli is the only airport in northeastern Syria, and for years served as a lifeline for the region's residents, particularly during nearly 14 years of civil war beginning in 2011, during which there were regular flights between it and Damascus.
The airport had remained under the government's control during the war, and continued to receive flights up until Assad's overthrow.
In November 2019, Russian forces turned the airport into a military base to oversee the implementation of an agreement that followed Turkey's large-scale offensive against Kurdish fighters.

Aid to Ukrainians in Poland must be responsible, not chaotic – Marshal of Sejm
This was stated in an interview with Ukrinform by the Marshal of the Polish Sejm, Włodzimierz Czarzasty, commenting on the adoption of a law introducing new rules for the stay of Ukrainian refugees in Poland.
According to Czarzasty, since 2022, Poland has made tremendous efforts: within the framework of Official Development Assistance (ODA), support for Ukraine and its refugees “is measured in billions of zlotys.”
He noted that further decisions will be adapted to the legal situation and to EU-level regulations.
“Our goal is stability, legal residence, and integration for those who work and pay taxes here. Assistance cannot be chaotic; it must be responsible. My compatriots have proven that in a crisis, they know how to open their hearts and embrace friends in need. I would like peace in Ukraine to come as soon as possible. However, we do not know when that will happen, so we must somehow adapt to this dramatic situation,” emphasized the Marshal of the Sejm.
As reported, President of Poland Karol Nawrocki approved the termination of the 2022 special law on aid to Ukrainian citizens who had arrived after the full-scale Russian invasion. Key provisions of that law will be transferred to the law on providing protection for foreigners.
The new law will come into effect on March 5, 2026.
Currently, up to one million Ukrainian war refugees are in Poland.
According to the latest data, a total of 4.35 million people who had to leave Ukraine due to the war hold temporary protection status in the EU. In June 2025, the European Council decided to extend temporary protection for them for one year, starting March 4, 2026.

United States Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee has triggered an avalanche of criticism from Arab and Muslim countries after suggesting Israel has a right to expand its territory across a large swath of the Middle East.
Huckabee delivered the remarks during a sit-down interview with US commentator Tucker Carlson, broadcast on Friday, as he was pressed about the geographical borders of Israel.

Carlson asked Huckabee, a self-professed Christian Zionist and staunch supporter of Israel, to clarify his stance on the Biblical promise of the land spanning the area between the Euphrates River in Iraq and the Nile River in Egypt to the descendants of Abraham, and if the modern Israeli state had the right to claim that lineage.
“It would be fine if they took it all,” said Huckabee.
Such territory would encompass modern-day Lebanon, Syria, Jordan and parts of Saudi Arabia.
The US ambassador later appeared to walk back the claim, saying it was “somewhat of a hyperbolic statement”. He also said Israel was not looking to expand its territory and has a right to security in the land it currently holds.
‘Extremist rhetoric’
Huckabee’s comments sparked immediate backlash from neighbouring Egypt and Jordan, Saudi Arabia, the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation and the League of Arab States, which in separate statements called them “extremist”, “provocative” and “not in line with Washington’s official position”.
Saudi Arabia’s foreign ministry described Huckabee’s comments as “extremist rhetoric” and “unacceptable”, and called for the US Department of State to provide clarification.
Egypt’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs called the remarks a “blatant violation” of international law, adding that “Israel has no sovereignty over the occupied Palestinian territory or other Arab lands.”
Jordan’s foreign ministry dismissed them as “absurd and provocative,” a violation of diplomatic norms and “an infringement on the sovereignty of states in the region”.
“Statements of this nature — extremist and lacking any sound basis — serve only to inflame sentiments and stir religious and national emotions”, the League of Arab States also said in a statement.
Huckabee, whom US President Donald Trump nominated as ambassador in 2024, has long opposed the idea of a two-state solution for Israel and the Palestinian people, and denied the existence of an illegal Israeli occupation of the West Bank. Back in 2008, Huckabee went so far as to question Palestinian identity altogether, saying, “There’s really no such thing as a Palestinian.”
In 2024, the International Court of Justice ruled that Israel’s occupation of Palestinian territory is illegal and must cease immediately.
But Israeli law does not clearly demarcate the country’s borders. Israel also occupies the Golan Heights in Syria, which it illegally annexed in 1981.
The US is the only country that recognises Israel’s claimed sovereignty over the Syrian territory, and only since 2019, during Trump’s first term as president.
After its 2024 war with Hezbollah, Israel also set up military outposts in five points inside Lebanon.
Some Israeli politicians, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, have openly promoted the idea of a “Greater Israel” with expanded borders.

Opinion | Humans vs robots? China begs to disagree
As China embraces humanoid robots, policymakers and companies are expanding the scope of innovation and applications in daily life
Reading Time:3 minutes
Why you can trust SCMP
The 2026 Spring Festival Gala, one of the world’s most-watched television events, featured a dazzling array of humanoid robots. They performed martial arts, executed intricate sword dances and even took part in a comedy skit alongside human celebrities.
While parts of the world still view humanoid robots with a mixture of fear and suspicion, as potential job-stealers or sci-fi villains, China is increasingly embracing them as partners in work, entertainment and daily life. Amid the escalating artificial intelligence (AI) race, China is not just competing on technological prowess but is rapidly outpacing others in its willingness to integrate these machines into public life.
China accounted for 90 per cent of the roughly 13,000 humanoid robots shipped globally last year. The country also represented over half of the humanoid robot exhibitors at the Consumer Electronics Show 2026. This burgeoning ecosystem draws researchers, engineers, entrepreneurs and investors into a fast-growing market.

It is fuelled by a parallel explosion in large language models and multi-modal AI, from ByteDance’s Doubao to the DeepSeek and Qwen models. Such AI models help robots understand user requests, engage in conversation, analyse data and provide useful content. As more robots are deployed in the physical world, the AI models are enhanced by the influx of real-world data, which in turn intensifies competition in large language models themselves and further encourages innovation.
The gala offered a stunning showcase of this progress. Robots from companies like Unitree, Galbot and Noetix ran, danced and performed acrobatics on stage. One might dismiss a backflipping robot, clad in a Monkey King costume, as a spectacle. But the nimbleness of the arms, legs, waist, neck, ankles and fingers shows technological breakthroughs.

Making body components that are flexible requires joint stability, space sensing and navigation, computer vision accuracy and skeleton durability. It demands seamless coordination between what Chinese engineers describe as the robot’s big brain – the higher-level AI for self-learning, planning and decision-making – and its small brain, which handles the movement and motor control needed for everything from walking and running to complex dexterous functions.

Is Iran stalling? Tehran floats flexibility as US signals strike readiness

Iran has sent another message to the US through Oman indicating it is prepared to show flexibility on its nuclear program, provided it is allowed to keep its uranium enrichment facilities and centrifuges on its own soil. Under the proposal, the facilities would not be activated until after an interim period and would operate under strict supervision by the International Atomic Energy Agency. Tehran insists the enrichment would be for civilian purposes only.
According to Western sources familiar with the negotiations, the message followed US dissatisfaction with the Iranian proposal presented in Geneva. The new offer is being examined in Washington but is still far from meeting American demands. If Iran does not move closer to those requirements, the US is considering a series of limited strikes to prove the seriousness of the threat.
The same sources said some senior figures in the Iranian regime believe the US will ultimately refrain from attacking, despite the significant concentration of American forces in the region. Limited strikes, they assess, could send a message while avoiding a full scale conflict.
Details obtained by Israel Hayom indicate that part of the Geneva meeting was devoted to what participants described as a US reprimand of the Iranian delegation. Washington accused Tehran of violating its commitment to discuss all issues, including its ballistic missile program and support for its proxy terrorist organizations. Israel Hayom previously revealed that the first round of talks in Oman had been scheduled, in part, on the basis of an Iranian pledge to address those subjects as well.
However, in Oman the Iranian delegation announced it would agree to discuss those issues only after a nuclear agreement was reached and sanctions were lifted. In Geneva, Iranian officials reiterated that position and demanded that any talks on other matters take place without ultimatums and with the participation of regional countries, which they argue are relevant to the discussion. The US team rejected the demand and lodged a strong protest over what it described as a breach of prior understandings. Despite this outcome, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi issued a positive statement after the meeting, prompting contradictory briefings from US officials.
In Israel, officials assess that Iran will attempt to stall by floating additional proposals on the nuclear issue but will not be able to bridge the gaps with the US. "The spring is coiled, and the readiness of US forces for a full strike is high, but an order to proceed will not be given in the coming days," an Israeli source said.

JPMorgan concedes it closed Trump’s accounts after Jan. 6 attack

JPMorgan concedes it closed Trump’s accounts after Jan. 6 attack
NEW YORK (AP) — JPMorgan Chase acknowledged for the first time that it closed the bank accounts of President Donald Trump and several of his businesses in the political and legal aftermath of the Jan. 6, 2021 attacks on the U.S. Capitol, the latest development in a legal saga between the president and the nation’s biggest bank over the issue known as “debanking.”
The acknowledgment came in a court filing submitted this week in Trump’s lawsuit against the bank and its leader, Jamie Dimon. The president sued for $5 billion, alleging that his accounts were closed for political reasons, disrupting his business operations.
“In February 2021, JPMorgan informed Plaintiffs that certain accounts maintained with JPMorgan’s CB and PB would be closed,” JPMorgan’s former chief administrative officer Dan Wilkening wrote in the court filing. The “PB” and “CB” stands for JPMorgan’s private bank and commercial bank.
Until now, JPMorgan has never admitted it closed the president’s accounts in writing after Jan. 6. The bank would only speak hypothetically about when the bank closes accounts and its reasons for closing accounts, citing bank privacy laws.
A spokeswoman for the bank declined to comment beyond what the bank said in its legal filings.
Trump originally sued JPMorgan in Florida state court, where Trump’s primary residence is now located. The filings this week are part of an effort by JPMorgan Chase to have the case both moved from state to federal court and to have the jurisdiction of the case moved to New York, which is where the bank accounts were located and where Trump kept much of his business operations until recently.
Trump originally accused the bank of trade libel and violating state and federal unfair and deceptive trade practices.
In the original lawsuit, Trump said he tried to raise the issue personally with Dimon after the bank sent him notices that JPMorgan would close his accounts, and that Dimon assured Trump he would figure out what was happening. The lawsuit alleges Dimon failed to follow up with Trump.
Further, Trump’s lawyers allege that JPMorgan placed the president and his companies on a reputational “blacklist” that both JPMorgan and other banks use to keep clients from opening accounts with them in the future. The blacklist has yet to be defined by the president’s lawyers.
“If and when Plaintiffs explain what they mean by this “blacklist,” JPMorgan will respond accordingly,” the bank’s lawyers said in a filing.
JPMorgan has previously said that while it regrets that Trump felt the need to sue the bank, the lawsuit has no merit.
The issue of debanking is at the center of the case. Debanking occurs when a bank closes the accounts of a customer or refuses to do business with a customer in the form of loans or other services. Once a relatively obscure issue in finance, debanking has become a politically charged issue in recent years, with conservative politicians arguing that banks have discriminated against them and their affiliated interests.
“In a devastating concession that proves President Trump’s entire claim, JPMorgan Chase admitted to unlawfully and intentionally de-banking President Trump, his family, and his businesses, causing overwhelming financial harm,” the president’s lawyers said in a statement. President Trump is standing up for all those wrongly debanked by JPMorgan Chase and its cohorts, and will see this case to a just and proper conclusion.”
Debanking first became a national issue when conservatives accused the Obama administration of pressuring banks to stop extending services to gun stores and payday lenders under “Operation Choke Point.”
Trump and other conservative figures have alleged that banks cut them off from their accounts under the umbrella term of “reputational risk” after the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. Since Trump came back into office, the president’s banking regulators have moved to stop any banks from using “reputational risk” as a reason for denying service to customers.
This is not the first lawsuit Trump has filed against a big bank alleging that he was debanked. The Trump Organization sued credit card giant Capital One in March 2025 for similar reasons and allegations. The case is ongoing.

Trump hikes US global tariff rate to 15 percent
President Donald Trump raised the global duty on imports into the United States to 15 percent on Saturday, doubling down on his promise to maintain his aggressive tariff policy a day after the Supreme Court ruled much of it illegal.
Trump said on his Truth Social platform that after a thorough review of Friday's "extraordinarily anti-American decision" by the court to rein in his tariff program, the administration was hiking the import levies "to the fully allowed, and legally tested, 15% level."
Shortly after the court's 6-3 ruling that rejected the president's authority to impose tariffs under a 1977 economic emergency powers act, Trump had initially announced a new 10 percent global levy by invoking a different legal avenue.
At the same time, he launched an extraordinary personal attack on the conservative justices who had sided with the majority, slamming their "disloyalty" and calling them "fools and lap dogs."
The ruling was a stunning rebuke by the high court, which has largely sided with the president since he returned to office, and marked a major political setback in striking down Trump's signature economic policy that has roiled the global trade order.
Saturday's announcement is sure to provoke further uncertainty as Trump carries on with a trade war that has cajoled and punished countries, both friend and foe.
It is the latest move in a careening process that has seen a multitude of tariff levels for countries sending goods into the United States set and then altered or revoked by Trump's team over the past year.
The new duty by law is only temporary - allowable for 150 days. According to a White House fact sheet, exemptions remain for sectors that are under separate probes, including pharma, and goods entering the US under the US-Mexico-Canada agreement.
On Friday, the White House said US trading partners that reached separate tariff deals with Trump's administration would also face the new global tariff.
High court defeat
Friday's court ruling did not impact sector-specific duties Trump separately imposed on steel, aluminium, and various other goods. Government probes still underway could lead to additional sectoral tariffs.
But it nevertheless marked Trump's biggest defeat at the Supreme Court since returning to the White House 13 months ago. The court has generally expanded his power.
Trump heaped praise on the conservative justices who voted to uphold his authority to levy tariffs - Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Brett Kavanaugh, a Trump nominee - thanking them "for their strength and wisdom, and love of our country."
The president alleged the majority of six justices, including two nominated during his first term, had been "swayed by foreign interests."
"I think that foreign interests are represented by people that I believe have undue influence," he said.
Shares on Wall Street - a metric closely watched by Trump - rose modestly Friday after the decision, which had been expected.
Business groups largely cheered the ruling, with the National Retail Federation saying this "provides much-needed certainty" for companies.
In court arguments, the Trump administration said companies would receive refunds if the tariffs were deemed unlawful. But the Supreme Court's ruling did not address the issue.
Trump said he expected years of litigation on whether to provide refunds. Kavanaugh noted the refund process could be a "mess."

Does Trump Have the Legal Authority to Strike Iran? An Expert Explains

After building up a massive military force in the Middle East over the last few weeks, President Donald Trump said Friday that he was considering strikes against Iran to pressure its leaders into accepting a deal on its nuclear program.
Trump has ratcheted up threats of action against the country’s leadership in recent months alongside a steady buildup of military forces. Two aircraft carriers are currently deployed, and one more—the USS Gerald Ford—is expected to arrive imminently.
When questioned by reporters on Friday whether he was weighing limited strikes against the country’s leadership in order to get it to accept a deal over its nuclear program, Trump replied: “I guess I can say I am considering that.”
Read More: Leavitt Says Iran Would Be ‘Wise to Make a Deal’ as Trump Escalates Military Buildup in Region
On Thursday, Trump gave Tehran a deadline of 10 to 15 days to finalize a deal to solve the nuclear dispute or face “really bad things.”
The United States joined an Israeli-led military operation against Iran in June last year that struck three of the country’s nuclear sites. After that operation, Trump claimed Iran’s nuclear enrichment facilities had been “completely and totally obliterated.”
Trump raised the prospect of further military action against Iran following a brutal crackdown on protests there that killed thousands.
That prospect has drawn harsh criticism from inside and outside of the President’s own party.
Rep. Thomas Massie, a Republican, and Rep. Ro Khanna said they would table a War Powers resolution to prohibit the president from ordering military action in Iran without congressional approval.
“Congress must vote on war according to our Constitution. Rep. Ro Khanna and I will be forcing that vote to happen in the House as soon as possible,” Massie wrote on X on Feb. 18. “I will vote to put America first which means voting against more war in the Middle East.”
David Janovsky, Acting Director of The Constitution Project at the Project on Government Oversight, answered TIME’s questions about the legality of potential strikes on Iran.
If Trump orders strikes on Iran tomorrow, however limited in scope, could that be legally justified?
DJ: The short answer is no. There's no indication that there's any sort of circumstance that would give the President the unilateral authority to order military action. It's true that presidents have some inherent authority to deploy the military as Commander in Chief, but that's really limited to true emergency circumstances where there is an attack underway that needs to be repelled, or maybe an extremely clear imminent attack. But there's no suggestion that that's the case today—that would make the strikes illegal.
What steps would the White House need to take for this military action to be legally above board?
DJ: Most simply, the administration would need to go to Congress. This is a contemplated attack against a sovereign state, and that, in simplest terms, is an act of war. And the Constitution gives the exclusive power to declare war to Congress, not the president. So this is something that would need a vote and congressional approval.
How would this operation be different from the strikes on Iran’s nuclear sites in June 2025, legally speaking?
DJ: My position is that those strikes in 2025 were not legally justifiable and also that strikes now would likewise not be justifiable. In 2025, the administration put out a very brief explanation that relied on both the President's inherent authority and a notion of collective self-defense with Israel. But again, self-defense is properly understood to involve a threat that is much more immediate than anything that's at play now.
What would be the legal and political implications if Congress passed a formal War Powers resolution restricting the President’s ability to strike Iran?
DJ: It's important to keep in mind that if Congress did nothing, that would be a sign that Congress didn't approve an act of war, and so it would be illegal.
So, congressional action isn't necessary, legally speaking, to prevent a strike against Iran. But, if Congress were to take the preemptive step of saying, “You cannot do this,” I think it would do two things. First, it would change the legal calculus, because the executive branch, for decades— this is not a new phenomenon—has resorted to creative lawyering to come up with excuses for using the military abroad. A clear statement from Congress should at least make those executive branch lawyers a lot less willing to push the envelope. It could also change the calculus for the military lawyers who would need to review any actual strike order.
And, politically, I think it would send a powerful message. We have seen, especially recently, that the administration is sensitive to losing support, particularly from its allies in Congress, and a clear congressional statement that there is not the buy-in for military action in this case would also be a limiting factor.
Why has the reaction from Congress to this military buildup been so muted?
DJ: I think there are probably both long-term structural reasons and sort of short-term political reasons, hand in hand with the executive branch's decades-long effort to push the envelope of what it can do has been Congress's acquiescence in the face of those expansions. In some ways, this is part of a constitutionally very dangerous but long-running trend.
Back in 2025, there was an effort after the strikes to pass a war powers resolution. But the most charitable explanation for why Congress didn't act then was that there was a suggestion that the strikes were over and done. It was a one-off, and there was no need for Congress to prevent anything else. The fact that we're back here suggests that was not the correct assessment, and certainly underscores the need for Congress to act urgently now.

More than 1,500 prisoners set for release under Venezuela's new amnesty law
At least 1,557 people - including opposition members, activists, human rights defenders and journalists who were held in Venezuela for political reasons, are expected to be released from prison after submitting their applications under an amnesty bill that was signed into law this week, authorities said Saturday.
At least 1,557 people held in Venezuela for political reasons have submitted their applications under an amnesty bill that was signed into law this week and are expected to be released from prison, authorities said Saturday.
Thursday’s measure is expected to benefit opposition members, activists, human rights defenders, journalists and many others detained for months or even years.
Its approval marked a reversal for Venezuelan authorities, who for decades have denied holding any political prisoners. It follows last month’s stunning US military raid in the country’s capital, Caracas, to capture then-President Nicolás Maduro.
“As of today, 1,152 new applications have been received, for a total of 1,557 that are being addressed immediately, and at this moment hundreds of releases of persons deprived of liberty who are benefiting from the Amnesty Law are already taking place,” National Assembly leader Jorge Rodríguez said on Saturday.

Earlier, the president of the special commission overseeing the amnesty law, Jorge Arreaza, said Friday night on state television that 379 amnesty requests had been received and that the applicants’ releases would take place between Friday and Saturday. Further releases could be granted within 15 days, he said.
Gonzalo Himiob, vice president of Venezuela-based prisoners’ rights group Foro Penal, told The Associated Press on Saturday that so far some have been released in the state of Barinas, in the southwest of the country, but the process of verifying releases under the amnesty was still ongoing.
The new law excludes those convicted of homicide, drug trafficking, serious human rights violations and military rebellion.
Human rights organizations are calling for the law to be applied to all prisoners held for political reasons, even if they are not listed among the beneficiaries.
Read moreVenezuela approves amnesty law that could free hundreds of political prisoners
“It is discriminatory and unconstitutional to exclude imprisoned military personnel and persecuted political figures,” Alfredo Romero, president of Foro Penal, said on X Saturday. Without this, “there can be no talk of national coexistence,” he said.
Rodríguez said that thousands of requests are being processed from “individuals who were under alternative measures to the system of deprivation of liberty,” and that they are likewise covered by the recently approved Amnesty Law.
Delcy Rodríguez, acting president of Venezuela since January 5, said during the signing of the law that it showed that the country’s political leaders were “letting go of a little intolerance and opening new avenues for politics in Venezuela.”
The bill’s purpose is to grant people “a general and full amnesty for crimes or offenses committed” during specific periods since 1999 that were marked by politically driven conflicts in Venezuela, including “acts of politically motivated violence” in the context of the 2024 presidential election. The aftermath of that election led to protests and the arrest of more than 2,000 people, including minors.

In the days after Maduro’s January 3 capture, Rodríguez’s government announced it would release a significant number of prisoners. However, relatives and human rights watchdogs have criticized the slow pace of releases and the restrictive conditions under which many have been placed after leaving prison.
Venezuela-based nonprofit Justice, Encounter and Forgiveness has tallied 459 releases of detainees held for political reasons between January 8 and February 20.

Sudanese army repels RSF attack on border town in western Sudan
Clashes erupt in El Tina near Chad border as army-aligned forces deny RSF claim of control
KHARTOUM, Sudan
The Sudanese army and allied joint forces repelled an attack Saturday by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) on the border town of El Tina in North Darfur state.
The Coordination of Resistance Committees in El Fasher said in a statement that RSF fighters infiltrated El Tina, which lies along the Sudan-Chad border, but were confronted by army troops and joint forces of armed movements allied with the military and retreated after clashes.
The group said the attacking forces withdrew at the onset of fighting in the strategically located town.
Darfur regional governor Minni Arko Minawi described the RSF assault on El Tina as “targeting unarmed civilians and criminal behavior.”
In a post on the US social media company Facebook, he shared videos purportedly showing joint forces seizing RSF vehicles and weapons in El Tina.
Fighters from army-aligned armed movements also circulated videos on social media from inside the town, displaying damaged combat vehicles, weapons, and individuals they identified as RSF detainees.
Earlier Saturday, the RSF said in a statement on its Telegram channel that it had taken control of El Tina.
Of Sudan’s 18 states, the RSF controls the five Darfur states in the west, except for parts of North Darfur that remain under army control. The military retains control over most of the remaining states, including the capital, Khartoum.
Darfur accounts for roughly one-fifth of Sudan’s total area of more than 1.8 million square kilometers, though the majority of the country’s estimated 50 million people live in areas controlled by the army.
The conflict, which began in April 2023, has killed tens of thousands and displaced about 13 million people, creating one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises and famine conditions, according to UN reports.

Nasa astronaut shares striking footage of rare ISS ‘cartwheel’ around Earth
Nasa astronaut Zena Cardman has shared striking footage of the International Space Station (ISS) "cartwheeling" around Earth.
The ISS performed the rare manoeuvre to allow for a reboost by the Spacex CRS-33. The space station orbits close enough to Earth that there is a small amount of atmospheric drag, and requires periodic reboosts as a result.
The 60x speed timelapse shows the vessel perform an “orbital cartwheel”, as the American astronaut named it, from the Atlantic to the Pacific.
Zena Cardman said, "This was one of my favourites since it captures a little of everything - sunset, lightning storms, air glow, moon glint, stars, and sunrise."

Ghislaine Maxwell fighting the release of 90,000 more Epstein files
- Lawyers for Ghislaine Maxwell are challenging the release of 90,000 pages of documents related to Jeffrey Epstein and Maxwell, arguing a new law forcing their disclosure is unconstitutional.
- The legal challenge, filed in Manhattan federal court, aims to block the release of files from a decade-old civil defamation lawsuit brought by Virginia Giuffre against Maxwell.
- Maxwell's attorneys contend that the 'Epstein Files Transparency Act' violates the Constitution's separation of powers doctrine, asserting that Congress cannot override the judiciary's power to protect its files.
- They claim the documents, which include over 30 deposition transcripts, contain private financial and sexual information pertaining to Maxwell and others.
- The move comes amidst ongoing releases of Epstein-related documents, which have revealed new details about his abuse and led to complaints from victims whose personal information was disclosed.

The Committee to Protect Journalists published a report alleging the systematic abuse of Palestinian media workers in Israeli detention centers between 2023 and 2026. Through interviews with dozens of former detainees, the organization documented harrowing accounts of torture, starvation, and sexual violence aimed at silencing the press. The findings highlight that the majority of these journalists were held under administrative detention without formal charges or access to legal counsel. Evidence such as medical records and photographs supports claims of extreme weight loss and untreated injuries resulting from physical beatings. The advocacy group is now calling for international accountability and independent investigations into these alleged violations of humanitarian law. Despite these testimonies, the Israeli military maintains that it adheres to international standards and does not intentionally target members of the media.

The Syrian presidency on Saturday appointed a presidential envoy to oversee the implementation of the Jan. 29 agreement with the terrorist organization YPG/SDF, according to state media.
The Syrian Arab News Agency (SANA), citing the presidency’s media directorate, said Brig. Gen. Ziad Al-Ayesh has been assigned to follow up on the accord and facilitate integration under the authority of the Syrian state.
The presidency said the appointment is intended to enhance the presence of state institutions, remove administrative obstacles, and activate public services in areas covered by the agreement.
Al-Ayesh hails from the village of Arjah Al-Jawalah in the countryside of Hasakah province in northeastern Syria, according to Syrian media outlets. He holds a degree in Sharia from Al-Ouzai University in Lebanon and a master’s degree in business administration from Idlib University in northwestern Syria.
Prior to the fall of Bashar Assad’s regime on Dec. 8, 2024, Al-Ayesh headed civil affairs at the Interior Ministry of the Salvation Government in Idlib.
On Jan. 30, the Syrian government announced that it had reached a “comprehensive agreement” with the SDF aimed at ending division in the country and launching a new phase of integration. It said the deal covering the cities of Hasakah and Qamishli and the integration of military forces complements a previous agreement signed on Jan. 18.
The latest agreement followed a military operation by the Syrian Army in which it regained large areas in eastern and northeastern Syria after repeated SDF violations of a March 2025 accord.

Global leaders and businesses react to more U.S. tariff swings

Click here to listen to this article - Share via
- Global leaders from Mexico City to Paris to Seoul convened emergency meetings to navigate the latest twist in an unpredictable tariff landscape.
- Mexico’s secretary of the economy, Marcelo Ebrard, urged “prudence” — “I tell you to put yourselves in zen mode. As tranquil as possible.”
SEOUL — Governments and companies around the world scrambled Saturday to determine the impact of the U.S. Supreme Court ruling that struck down most of President Trump’s sweeping tariffs and his response with a new round of import taxes.
The latest twist in the U.S. tariff roller-coaster ride, launched when Trump returned to office 13 months ago and upended dozens of trading relationships with the world’s biggest economy, roiled trade officials from Mexico to South Korea to South America and beyond.
South Korea’s Trade Ministry called for an emergency meeting Saturday to understand the new landscape. Some specific exports to the U.S., like automobiles and steel, aren’t affected by the U.S. high court decision. Those that are affected will probably now be covered by a new tariff imposed by an executive order Trump signed Friday. Trump announced Saturday morning that he would raise that 10% tariff to 15%.
In Paris, French President Emmanuel Macron hailed the checks and balances in the United States, praising the “rule of law” during a visit to a Paris agricultural fair: “It’s a good thing to have powers and counter-powers in democracies. We should welcome that.”
But he cautioned against any triumphalism.
Officials were going over the language of bilateral or multilateral deals struck with the U.S. in recent months, even as they braced for new swings and Trump’s swift announcement of new tariffs.
“I note that President Trump, a few hours ago, said he had reworked some measures to introduce new tariffs, more limited ones, but applying to everyone,” Macron said. “So we’ll look closely at the exact consequences, what can be done, and we will adapt.”
Mexico braces, adapts
Mexico’s secretary of the economy, Marcelo Ebrard, urged “prudence” Friday in the aftermath of the U.S. Supreme Court ruling. “We have to see where this is going,” Ebrard told reporters. “We have to see what measures [Washington] is going to take to figure out how it is going to affect our country. “
Amid widespread concern about tariffs in Mexico — the United States’ major commercial partner, with almost $1 trillion in annual two-way trade — Ebrard cautioned: “I tell you to put yourselves in zen mode. As tranquil as possible.”
Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, when asked about the tariffs, said, “We’ll review the resolution carefully and then gladly give our opinion.”
Ebrard said he plans to travel to the United States next week to clarify matters.
Last year, Ebrard noted, Mexico managed to stave off Trump’s threats to impose a 25% across-the-board levy on all Mexican imports.
However, Mexico has been pushing back against Trump administration tariffs on imports of vehicles, steel and aluminum, among other products.
Among other impacts, the Supreme Court voided so-called fentanyl tariffs on Mexico, China and Canada. The Trump administration said it imposed those levies to force the three nations to crack down on trafficking of the deadly synthetic opioid.
About 85% of Mexican exports to the United States are exempt from tariffs because of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. The accord extended a mostly free-trade regimen among the three nations, replacing the North American Free Trade Agreement.
The three-way pact is scheduled for joint review starting July 1. That date marks six years since the agreement was signed during the first Trump presidential term.
In Ciudad Juárez, Mexico, along the Texas border, Sergio Bermúdez, head of an industrial parks company, discussed Trump’s plan for a new tariff. Trump, he said, “says a lot of things, and many of them aren’t true. All of the businesses I know are analyzing, trying to figure out how it’s going to affect them.”
The impact could be felt especially in Juarez: Much of its economy depends on factories producing goods to export to consumers in the U.S., the result of decades of free trade between the U.S. and Mexico.
The policy swoons in the United States over the last year have made many global business leaders cautious, as they struggle to forecast and see investment take a hit.
CEO Alan Russell of Tecma, which helps American businesses set up operations in Mexico, has seen his job grow increasingly complicated over the last year — his company’s workload has surged as much as fourfold as it grapples with new import requirements. He worries the last U.S. moves will only make things more difficult.
“We wake up every day with new challenges. That word ‘uncertainty’ has been the greatest enemy,” said Russell, who is American. “The difficult part has been not being clear what the rules are today or what they’re going to be tomorrow.”
A ‘good decision’
Swissmem, a top technology industry association in Switzerland, hailed the Supreme Court ruling as “good decision,” writing on X that its exports to the U.S. fell 18% in the fourth quarter alone -- a period when Switzerland was facing much higher U.S. tariffs than most neighboring countries in Europe.
“The high tariffs have severely damaged the tech industry,” Swissmem President Martin Hirzel said on X, while acknowledging the dust is far from settled. “However, today’s ruling doesn’t win anything yet.”

Arab and Muslim states fume after Huckabee says Israel has biblical right to much of Mideast
Saudis, Jordan, PA, Arab League slam US envoy for saying it ‘would be fine’ if Israel took over lands promised in Bible during Carlson interview; he then clarified ‘hyperbolic’ statement
Arab and Muslim nations on Saturday sharply condemned comments by the US ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, who said in a recent interview that “it would be fine” if Israel took over a large swath of the Middle East.
Huckabee made the comments during his contentious interview with right-wing American commentator Tucker Carlson which aired Friday, after Carlson said that according to the Bible, the descendants of Abraham would receive land that today would include large parts of the Middle East, and asked Huckabee if Israel had a right to that land.
Huckabee responded: “It would be fine if they took it all.” However, he said that Israel was not looking to expand its territory and has a right to security in the land it legitimately holds.
His comments sparked immediate backlash from Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the Organization of Islamic Cooperation and the League of Arab States, which in separate statements called them extremist, provocative, and not in line with the US position.
Saudi Arabia’s foreign ministry described Huckabee’s comments as “extremist rhetoric” and “unacceptable,” and called for the State Department to clarify its position on them.
Egypt’s foreign ministry called his comments a “blatant violation” of international law, adding that “Israel has no sovereignty over the occupied Palestinian territory or other Arab lands.”
The Palestinian Authority said on X that Huckabee’s words “contradict US President Donald Trump’s rejection of [Israel] annexing the West Bank.”
Kuwait decried what it called a “flagrant violation of the principles of international law,” while Oman said the comments “threatened the prospects for peace” and stability in the region.
In its statement, the Arab League condemned Huckabee’s “extreme” comment, in which he “asserted Israel’s right to control the Middle East, citing religious texts from the Old Testament.”
The comments “violated all the basic principles and established norms of diplomacy, as well as defying logic and reason,” the group of 22 Arab nations said, adding that the US envoy’s words “contradict US policies and positions across the board, aimed at currying favor with the right-wing public in Israel.”
“Such extremist and baseless statements inflame religious and nationalistic sentiments at a time when Arab states are meeting under the auspices of the Board of Peace to discuss ways to implement the Gaza peace agreement and seize this opportunity to launch a serious peace process,” it added.

The Organization of Islamic Cooperation, which is made up of 57 mostly Muslim-majority nations, including the entire Arab League, issued a similar statement, saying it “condemns the dangerous and irresponsible” comments made by Huckabee.
The OIC said the US envoy’s comments were “an unacceptable call for the expansion of Israel” that were “based on a false and rejected historical and ideological narrative.”
Such remarks “fuel extremist ideological rhetoric, which would fuel extremism and encourage” Israel to “continue its illegal measures based on displacement, settlement, and attempts to impose annexation” on Palestinian territory, the group said.
There was no immediate response from Israel or the United States.
Huckabee, a devout Christian and outspoken Zionist, commented being pressed by Carlson on his assertion that a part of the Jewish people’s right to the land stemmed from God’s promise to Abraham, while noting that that promised land spanned a far larger territory than that of today’s Israel, encompassing much of present-day’s Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia and Iraq. He asked whether it did not follow then that Israel had a right to take land from neighboring Arab countries.
After initially avoiding the matter, Huckabee eventually said, “It would be fine if they took it all,” while swiftly adding that this was not on the table as “They’re not asking to take it over.”
Carlson then asked the US ambassador to confirm he was fine with Israel taking over “all of Syria, all of Lebanon.” Huckabee responded, “That’s really not exactly what I’m trying to say,” adding that “It was somewhat of a hyperbolic statement.”
In a subsequent back-and-forth, Carlson demanded to know whether Huckabee believes Israel “has a moral right to take over what are now other people’s countries,” as the envoy insisted he had not said that. Eventually, Huckabee said: “If they end up getting attacked by all these places and they win that war and they take that land, then, okay, that’s a whole other discussion.”

Zelensky commends special services for neutralizing Russian mercenaries
As reported by Ukrinform, the head of state said this in his evening address.
“I want to commend the efforts of the Security Service of Ukraine, the National Police, and the Office of the Prosecutor General – they neutralized Russian mercenaries preparing assassination attempts against our citizens. These were rather high-profile names, and preventing such crimes is a substantial result,” Zelensky said.
He noted that he had heard a report from Oleksandr Poklad, Deputy Head of the SSU.
“And this is yet another front in the ongoing protection of Ukraine’s security, the safety of Ukrainians, and the constant defense of the lives of our people – the way our Ukrainian special services, our law enforcement, and our intelligence neutralize Russian criminal activity against Ukrainians. They were preparing attacks against Ukrainian military personnel, Ukrainian intelligence officers, and Ukrainian media workers. It is important that all our Ukrainian special services and law enforcement continue to protect Ukrainian citizens in exactly this coordinated way,” the President emphasized.
As Ukrinform previously reported, the Security Service of Ukraine and the National Police exposed a criminal group that had been preparing contract killings on behalf of Russian special services, including plans to assassinate Andrii Yusov, a representative of the Defense Intelligence Directorate. Other targets included Ukrainian journalists and civic activists, the head of a strategic enterprise, and fighters of the DIU International Legion.

JPMorgan concedes it closed Trump’s accounts after Jan. 6 attack
JPMorgan Chase now confirms it closed Trump’s accounts after mob of his supporters stormed halls of Congress
- Bookmark
Banking giant JPMorgan Chase acknowledged for the first time that it closed the accounts of President Donald Trump and several of his businesses in the political and legal aftermath of the January 6, 2021 attacks on the U.S. Capitol.
The disclosure marks the latest development in a legal saga over Trump’s alleged “debanking” after the president sued America’s largest bank for $5 billion alleging his accounts were closed for political reasons.
The acknowledgment came in a court filing submitted this week in Trump's lawsuit against the bank and its CEO Jamie Dimon.
“In February 2021, JPMorgan informed Plaintiffs that certain accounts maintained with JPMorgan’s CB and PB would be closed,” JPMorgan's former chief administrative officer Dan Wilkening wrote in the court filing. The “PB” and “CB” stands for JPMorgan's private bank and commercial bank.
In a letter to Trump submitted to the court Friday, dated February 19, 2021, the bank said it was recommending that he “find a more suitable institution with which to conduct business.”
“With that in mind, this letter is to respectfully inform you that we will need to end our current relationship,” the letter to Trump said.
Until now, JPMorgan has never admitted it closed the president's accounts, and would only speak hypothetically about when the bank closes accounts and its reasons for doing so.
In a previous statement, the bank said it “does not close accounts for political or religious reasons” but does so when accounts “create legal or regulatory risk for the company.”
Trump initially sued JPMorgan in state court in Florida, where Trump has his primary residence at his Mar-a-Lago compound in Palm Beach. JPMorgan Chase is seeking to move the case to federal court in New York, which is where the bank accounts were located and where Trump kept much of his business operations until recently.
Trump accuses the bank of trade libel and accuses Dimon himself of violating Florida’s Unfair and Deceptive Trade Practices Act.
In the original lawsuit, Trump alleges he tried to raise the issue personally with Dimon after the bank started to close his accounts, and that Dimon assured Trump he would figure out what was happening. The lawsuit alleges Dimon failed to follow up with Trump.
Further, Trump’s lawyers allege that JPMorgan placed the president and his companies on a reputational “blacklist” that both JPMorgan and other banks use to keep clients from opening accounts with them in the future.
JPMorgan previously said it believes the suit has no merit.
“Debanking” occurs when a bank closes the accounts of a customer or refuses to do business with a customer in the form of loans or other services. Once a relatively obscure issue in finance, debanking has become a politically charged issue in recent years, with right-wing figures arguing that banks have discriminated against them and their affiliated interests.
“In a devastating concession that proves President Trump’s entire claim, JPMorgan Chase admitted to unlawfully and intentionally de-banking President Trump, his family, and his businesses, causing overwhelming financial harm,” the president’s lawyers said in a statement.
Trump is “standing up for all those wrongly debanked by JPMorgan Chase and its cohorts, and will see this case to a just and proper conclusion,” they added.
Debanking first became a national issue when right-wing figures accused Barack Obama’s administration of pressuring banks to stop extending services to gun stores and payday lenders under “Operation Choke Point.”
Trump and his allies have alleged that banks cut them off from their accounts under the umbrella term of “reputational risk” after January 6, when a mob of his supports stormed the halls of Congress in a failured effort to derail the results of the 2020 presidential election, which Trump lost.
After Trump returned to the White House last year, the president’s banking regulators have moved to stop any banks from using “reputational risk” as a reason for denying service to customers.
This is not the first lawsuit Trump has filed against a big bank alleging that he was debanked.
The Trump Organization sued credit card giant Capital One in March 2025 for similar reasons and allegations. That case is ongoing.

Iran designates naval and air forces of EU states ‘terrorist entities’ in tit for tat move
Tehran took reciprocal measures in response to what it called 'illegal and unjustified' decision by EU member states to designate Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as 'terrorist organization,' says Foreign Ministry
TEHRAN, Iran
Iran has designated the armed forces of European Union member states as “terrorist entities” in a tit-for-tat move.
In a statement on Saturday, Iran’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that the country took reciprocal measures in response to what it called the “illegal and unjustified” decision by EU member states to designate the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) as a “terrorist organization.”
The statement noted that Iran has decided to designate all naval and air forces of European Union member states as “terrorist organizations.”
It added that the European governments designated the IRGC “in violation of the fundamental principles and rules of the United Nations Charter and international law,” describing it as “one of the official components of the armed forces of the Islamic Republic of Iran.”
"The Islamic Republic of Iran will act based on the principle of ‘reciprocity,’” it stated.
The Council of the European Union said in a statement on Thursday that it had formally decided to add the IRGC to the EU terrorist list, weeks after a political agreement was reached among member states.
“Following its listing, the IRGC will also be subject to restrictive measures under the EU counterterrorism sanctions regime,” the statement read, referring to the “freezing of its funds and other financial assets or economic resources” in EU member states, as well as the “prohibition for EU operators to make funds and economic resources available to the group.”
A total of 13 individuals, 23 groups, and entities are now subject to restrictive measures under the EU terrorist list, it added.
Tensions have dramatically escalated between Iran and some European countries following recent protests inside Iran, with European leaders condemning what they described as a crackdown on protesters.
Earlier this month, the Iranian parliament announced that Iran now considers EU armies to be terrorist organizations, after the country’s top security body approved the measure.
The parliamentary announcement was followed by the summoning of the ambassadors of EU member states to the Foreign Ministry.
At the time, the ministry described the EU move as “unjustified and irresponsible,” emphasizing that it “violates fundamental principles of the United Nations Charter and international law.”
Meanwhile, tensions continue to escalate in the region amid an unprecedented US military buildup and IRGC military drills in the Persian Gulf.

Report: IRGC running Hezbollah, preparing it for war with Israel if US strikes Iran

Report: IRGC running Hezbollah, preparing it for war with Israel if US strikes Iran
Israel said to see Hezbollah preparing rocket-fire capabilities, recent IDF strikes said aimed at degrading them; anti-Hezbollah outlet quotes ‘political sources’ saying Beirut must declare neutrality
Officers from Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps have effectively taken charge of Hezbollah in anticipation of a war with the US and Israel, Saudi outlet Al-Arabiya reported Saturday, as Lebanese officials were said to assail the possibility of their country getting dragged into battle.
The IRGC officers, some of whom recently arrived in Lebanon from Iran, are tasked with rebuilding Hezbollah’s military capabilities, which were significantly degraded in the 14-month fighting with Israel that ended with a November 2024 truce, Al-Arabiya said, citing sources close to Hezbollah.
The Iranian officers have also been personally briefing Hezbollah operatives across Lebanon, said the unnamed sources cited by Al-Arabiya. They added that IRGC officers were meeting with members of Hezbollah’s missile unit at a site in Lebanon’s Beqaa Valley that was bombed by Israel overnight, amid a wave of airstrikes that wounded at least 50 people and killed 12, including a senior Hezbollah officer. The IDF said the strikes targeted Hamas and Hezbollah command centers.
According to the Hezbollah-aligned sources, a wider Israeli military offensive against Lebanon is only a matter of time.
The report came as US President Donald Trump has amassed military forces in the region and repeatedly threatened to use them against Iran, first over the Islamic Republic’s brutal crackdown on anti-regime protesters last month and more recently over its nuclear program.
Israel is readying to fight alongside the US and expects to be targeted by Iran if the US strikes there, according to Hebrew media.
The Kan public broadcaster reported Saturday evening that Israel has identified preparations by Hezbollah — particularly by its rocket forces — to strike if Iran is attacked, with the Lebanese terror group expected to target Israel together with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, Iranian-backed Shiite militias in Iraq and Yemen’s Houthi rebels.
Haaretz reported, quoting unnamed Israeli military sources, that recent Israeli airstrikes targeting Hezbollah were intended to degrade its capabilities amid the possibility of conflict. At least 10 people were reported killed and 50 wounded in Israeli strikes in eastern Lebanon on Friday, after the Israel Defense Forces said it had targeted Hezbollah command centers.
Channel 12 news reported Saturday that Trump was leaning toward attacking Iran, but had agreed to a request from his envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner to give Iran another day or two to submit a proposal in the indirect US-Iran nuclear negotiations that commenced earlier this month.
An unnamed US official was quoted by the network saying that the 10- to 15-day deadline Trump gave Iran on Thursday was “not scientific.”
Trump has demanded Iran give up entirely on its nuclear enrichment program, but is reportedly open to letting the Islamic Republic preserve some “token” enrichment capabilities.
Speaking to pro-Iran demonstrators in Lebanon last month, Hezbollah chief Naim Qassem said the terrorist group would not be neutral if the US struck Iran, but stopped short of explicitly threatening Israel.
Meanwhile, the Ynet news site said in an unsourced report this week that Iran was pressuring Hezbollah to fight alongside it in the event of a war with Israel. The report also said the IDF had prepared a plan to “significantly strike” Hezbollah and had conveyed to it “that if it decides to intervene, this time the blow will be very painful.”
On Saturday, anti-Hezbollah Lebanese outlet Nidaa al-Watan cited “prominent political sources” in the country as saying Beirut must declare its neutrality in case of a US-Iran war, and refuse to let Hezbollah drag Lebanon into war with Israel.
“Hezbollah thought it could confuse Israel and the US by saying it would not be neutral if Iran were struck, so Israel responded by saying that as soon as it’s informed by Washington of the zero hour, it will preemptively strike Hezbollah. Israel won’t let Hezbollah have the initiative,” Nidaa al-Watan quoted its sources as saying. “Hezbollah will drag Lebanon into this war.”
Hezbollah, previously a formidable force in Lebanon’s government, has been politically sidelined with the accession in January 2025 of Lebanon’s US- and Saudi-backed President Joseph Aoun, a former army chief who has vowed to uphold a state monopoly on arms — a thinly veiled threat against Hezbollah’s extensive arsenal.

'Chronicles From the Siege’: Filmmaker dedicates Berlinale win to Palestinian liberation struggle

Syrian-Palestinian filmmaker Abdallah Al-Khatib used his acceptance speech at the Berlinale film awards ceremony to make a solidarity statement in support of the Palestinian liberation struggle.
“We will remember everyone who stood with us, and we will remember everyone who stood against us, against our right to live with dignity, or those who chose to be silent. Free Palestine from now until the end of the world,” he told the audience in Berlin on Saturday after his film “Chronicles From the Siege", which tells the story of people trying to survive occupation, was named Best First Feature.
He accused the German government of being “a partner in the genocide in Gaza by Israel.”
Al-Khatib, who brought a Palestinian flag onto the stage, said that one day there would be “a great film festival in Gaza” dedicated to all oppressed people in the world.
Earlier, Lebanese filmmaker Marie-Rose Osta, who won the Golden Bear for best short film, had also criticised Israel's genocide on stage.
“In reality, children in Gaza, in all of Palestine, and in Lebanon do not have superpowers to protect them from Israeli bombs. No child should need superpowers to survive a genocide empowered by veto powers and the collapse of international law," she said in her acceptance speech.
“The ceasefire continues to be violated by Israel both in Gaza and Lebanon,” Osta added.
She stressed that the lives of children in Gaza and Lebanon are "not negotiable.”
On Wednesday, dozens of actors and directors, including Javier Bardem and Tilda Swinton, accused the Berlin International Film Festival of "anti-Palestinian racism" and urged organisers to state their opposition to Israel’s genocide in Gaza clearly.
In an open letter published in Variety, 81 film workers criticised what they called the Berlinale’s “involvement in censoring artists who oppose Israel’s ongoing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza.”
The signatories also took issue with comments by this year’s jury president, Wim Wenders, who said at a recent press briefing in Berlin, when asked about Gaza, “We should stay out of politics.”
Last week, award-winning Indian writer Arundhati Roy withdrew from the Berlin Film Festival over jury president Wim Wenders's comments that cinema should "stay out of politics" when asked about Gaza.
Roy said that she was "shocked and disgusted" by responses from Wenders and other jury members to a question about the Palestinian territory.

OIC slams US ambassador's remarks on Israeli Mideast expansion as threat to regional stability

OIC slams US ambassador's remarks on Israeli Mideast expansion as threat to regional stability
Organization of Islamic Cooperation warns US Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee's comments fuel extremism and undermine international law
ISTANBUL
The Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) and the Arab League on Saturday condemned remarks by US Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee, warning that his comments about Israeli expansion in the Middle East threaten regional security and stability as well as inflame religious and national sentiments.
Huckabee argued that Israel has a biblical right to the land stretching from the Nile to the Euphrates rivers, saying on a podcast released Friday: "It would be fine if they (Israel) took it all.”
Huckabee made the remarks in an interview with US journalist Tucker Carlson, during which he defended Israel’s actions in the Gaza Strip and voiced support for the idea of “divine providence” giving control of the region to Israel.
After Huckabee claimed Israel had a divine right to vast portions of the Middle East, Carlson asked him: “What land are you talking about?” Interpretations of the biblical phrase “river of Egypt” vary, with some scholars identifying it as a riverbed in the Sinai Peninsula and others as the Nile.
“It would be fine if they took it all,” Huckabee replied, referring to Israel’s biblical right to the territory stretching from the Nile River to the Euphrates.
The OIC described Huckabee’s remarks in a statement as “dangerous and irresponsible,” calling them an unacceptable call for the expansion of Israel, the occupying power, and the seizure of additional Palestinian and Arab lands.
The comments were based on “a false and rejected historical and ideological narrative and claims" that violate state sovereignty, diplomatic norms, principles of international law, UN resolutions, and the UN Charter, the group added.
The organization warned that such extremist rhetoric would fuel further extremism and embolden Israeli policies centered on displacement, settlement expansion, and attempts to impose annexation on occupied Palestinian territory.
It said these measures "threaten security and stability in the entire region.”
The bloc reaffirmed its unwavering support for what it described as the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people, foremost among them the right to self-determination and the establishment of an independent, sovereign state on the June 4, 1967 borders with East Jerusalem as its capital.
Separately, Ahmed Aboul Gheit, secretary-general of the Arab League, condemned Huckabee’s claims, calling them contrary to the most basic principles and norms of diplomacy.
In a statement on US social media company X, Aboul Gheit said the remarks contradict official US policies and positions and appear aimed at appealing to right-wing audiences in Israel.
He warned that such extremist statements, which lack any legal or political basis, “inflame religious and national sentiments” at a time when countries are convening under a Board of Peace framework to explore ways to implement a Gaza peace agreement and seize the opportunity to launch a serious political process.
Huckabee, named US ambassador to Israel in April 2025, is an evangelical Christian who has previously spoken of expansionist claims based on what he described as a “divine right” for Israel in the West Bank.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told news channel i24 last August that he feels “very attached” to the vision of a Greater Israel. He said he considers himself “on a historic and spiritual mission," including “generations of Jews that dreamt of coming here and generations of Jews who will come after us.”
Greater Israel is a term used in Israeli politics to refer to the expansion of Israel’s territory to include the West Bank, Gaza, and Syria’s Golan Heights, with some interpretations also including Egypt’s Sinai Peninsula and parts of Jordan.

NASA chief rules out March launch of Moon mission over technical issues

WASHINGTON - NASA chief Jared Isaacman on Feb 21 ruled out a March launch for Artemis 2, the first crewed flyby mission to the Moon in more than 50 years, citing technical issues.
Workers detected a problem with helium flow to the massive SLS rocket that will “take the March launch window out of consideration,” Mr Issacman said in a post on X.
“I understand people are disappointed by this development. That disappointment is felt most by the team at NASA, who have been working tirelessly to prepare for this great endeavor,” Mr Isaacman said.
“During the 1960s, when NASA achieved what most thought was impossible, and what has never been repeated since, there were many setbacks.”
The towering SLS rocket and Orion spacecraft will be rolled back into the Vehicle Assembly Building at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida to investigate the technical issues and make any necessary repairs, Mr Isaacman said.
A complete briefing will follow in the coming days, he added.
The highly anticipated Artemis 2 mission, lasting about 10 days, will see three Americans and one Canadian fly around Earth’s satellite.
It would be a huge step towards Americans once again setting foot on the lunar surface, a goal announced by President Donald Trump in his first term.
On Feb 20, NASA had set March 6 as the earliest possible launch date
The US space agency hopes to put humans back on the Moon as China forges ahead with a rival effort that is targeting 2030 at the latest for its first crewed mission.
China’s uncrewed Chang’e 7 mission is expected to be launched in 2026
NASA surprised many late in 2025 when it said Artemis 2 could happen as soon as February – an acceleration explained by the Trump administration’s wish to beat China to the punch.
But the programme has been plagued by delays.
The uncrewed Artemis 1 mission took place in November 2022 after multiple postponements and two failed launch attempts.
Then technical problems in early February – which included a liquid hydrogen leak – cut short a so-called wet dress rehearsal for the Artemis 2 launch. That was finally completed earlier this week.
The wet dress rehearsal was conducted under real conditions – with full rocket tanks and technical checks – at Cape Canaveral in Florida, with engineers practicing the maneuvers needed to carry out an actual launch.
NASA is hoping that the Moon could be used to help prepare future missions to Mars. AFP

Berlinale winner dedicates speech to Palestinian liberation struggle
Syrian-Palestinian filmmaker Abdallah Al-Khatib accuses German government of being ‘a partner in the genocide in Gaza by Israel’
BERLIN
Syrian-Palestinian filmmaker Abdallah Al-Khatib on Saturday used his acceptance speech at the Berlinale film awards ceremony to make a political statement in support of the Palestinian liberation struggle.
“We will remember everyone who stood with us, and we will remember everyone who stood against us. Against our right to live with dignity, or those who choose to be silent. Free Palestine from now until the end of the world,” he told the audience in Berlin after his film “Chronicles From the Siege,” which tells the story of people trying to survive occupation, was named Best First Feature.

He accused the German government of being “a partner in the genocide in Gaza by Israel.”
Al-Khatib, who brought a Palestinian flag onto the stage, said that one day there would be “a great film festival in Gaza” dedicated to all oppressed people in the world.
Earlier, Lebanese filmmaker Marie-Rose Osta, who won the Golden Bear for best short film, had also criticized Israel's conduct of the war on stage.
“In reality, children in Gaza, in all of Palestine, and in my Lebanon do not have superpowers to protect them from Israeli bombs (...) No child should need superpowers to survive a genocide empowered by veto powers and the collapse of international law," she said in her acceptance speech.
“The ceasefire continues to be violated by Israel both in Gaza and Lebanon,” Osta added.
She stressed that the lives of children in Gaza and Lebanon are "not negotiable.”
On Wednesday, dozens of actors and directors, including Javier Bardem and Tilda Swinton, accused the Berlin International Film Festival of "anti-Palestinian racism" and urged organizers to clearly state their opposition to Israel’s genocide in Gaza.
In an open letter published in Variety, 81 film workers criticized what they called the Berlinale’s “involvement in censoring artists who oppose Israel’s ongoing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza.”
The signatories also took issue with comments by this year’s jury president, Wim Wenders, who said at a recent press briefing in Berlin, when asked about Gaza, “We should stay out of politics.”

Marshal of Polish Sejm names key topics of Ukraine Recovery Conference in Gdańsk
This was stated in an interview with Ukrinform by Włodzimierz Czarzasty, Marshal of the Sejm of the Republic of Poland.
“The recovery of Ukraine is an investment in the security of all of Europe. We want to focus on three areas: investments, transport and logistics links, as well as trade and exports. The conference in Gdańsk will become a platform for real projects, not just declarations,” Czarzasty said, stressing that it will have “political and symbolic significance.”
As reported by Ukrinform, Kyiv and Warsaw have begun practical preparations for the Ukraine Recovery Conference (URC-2026) and agreed to deepen trade and economic cooperation.
At the end of January, representatives of the authorities of Poland’s Subcarpathian, Lublin, and Podlaskie voivodeships met to coordinate efforts with the Ukrainian side to support Ukraine amid the energy crisis.

Chatter dials up on Apple’s folding iPhone as 2026 launch tipped

Chatter dials up on Apple’s folding iPhone as 2026 launch tipped
When Apple unveils its iPhone 18 models this September, it may also introduce an entirely new form factor for its smartphones, with rumours intensifying that a folding iPhone is finally ready for release.
Samsung has been releasing folding phones for more than six years, and although they got off to a rocky start, they’ve become a steadily growing product category. Could a folding iPhone tip the format into mainstream acceptance? Or will the majority stick with the standard models, leaving folding phones a niche concern?
Rumours and speculation about Apple’s folding iPhone have been ongoing for years, so at this point, it seems likely the company has tested multiple designs.
In 2024, a report in The Information cited people directly involved in the project as saying Apple would release a flip-style phone, sized like a regular iPhone but with a horizontal crease in the middle to fold into a small square, similar to Samsung’s Z Flip. But more recent reports point to something larger, with multiple analysts describing a passport-shaped device that opens up to become a small tablet.
This shape would differ from most book-style foldable devices on the market, including Samsung’s Z Fold and Google’s Pixel Pro Fold. While those models more or less resemble normal phones while folded, and become a square-ish tablet, Apple’s supposed device would be square-ish in both modes; a 2:3 ratio when folded and around a 4:3 ratio when opened. The advantage would be that both of those screen shapes are in use by iPads, so apps wouldn’t need to be adapted.
Longtime Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo described this format in a note last year, also saying that Apple had developed a hinge which eliminated the perceptible gap in the middle of the inner screen. Kuo said the company was prioritising thinness and sleek design even if it made for a notably expensive device, and that it would include a fingerprint sensor instead of Face ID. These details were backed up in a newsletter from Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, who said the phone would cost more than $US2000 ($2840).
As for the size of the device, multiple rumours indicate an outer screen size of 5.5 inches which, given the 2:3 ratio, would make for a device approximately 8cm x 12cm when closed. Quite a different shape to the latest Z Fold, which is 7cm x 16cm. It would also be the shortest iPhone since 2010’s iPhone 4.
Last year, 3D design files appeared on the internet that had supposedly (but unverifiably) leaked from Apple’s production line. They matched the above measurements, and designers used them to create digital models and 3D-printed dummies, giving glimpses of a phone that resembles a small notepad. When opened, the tablet would have a screen size of 7.8 inches, making for a device smaller than the iPad Mini by just a few centimetres on either edge.
Analyst Jeff Pu has suggested there will be multiple size options for the device, but only the one size has appeared in most rumours.
Demand for iPhones has remained consistent despite each generation of device lasting longer than the last, and despite investor hand-wringing about Apple’s perceived lack of AI features. But the overwhelming bulk of that demand is for the standard iPhone, or the Pro model, with comparatively few users going for the outlier Mini, Plus or Air models.
In fact, some reports have indicated that last year’s Air underdelivered spectacularly, with Apple cutting production to just 10 per cent of its original estimates. The ultra-thin phone is very expensive, lacks features the standard iPhone has including multiple rear cameras, and is an unproven form factor despite Apple’s claims of extraordinary durability.
Bloomberg’s Gurman claims that the design of the folding iPhone will be similar to two Air models joined together, albeit in a different shape. Apple will need to hope there is enough pent-up demand for a non-Android folding phone to counter durability concerns, especially if it claims to have also developed a brand new hinge system that eliminates the foldable screen gap.
Of course, Apple has form with introducing its own takes on devices that other manufacturers have had for years. The iPad, Apple Watch and AirPods were all late to their respective categories, and while they may not have taken off immediately, they did eventually become the overall leading models.
If Apple introduces a $3000 folding iPhone this year, it may not be met with enough immediate demand for it to overtake the standard iPhone or even Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold. But it could win users over time, especially if Apple markets to its base of creatives who would otherwise have a phone and an iPad Mini separately.
Gurman has reported that Apple is so confident in the folding iPhone that it is already planning a follow-up that would give users the choice between the notepad style and a smaller Z Flip style device.

Burnt-out Toyota may be linked to missing 85-year-old Chris Baghsarian

Burnt-out Toyota may be linked to missing 85-year-old Chris Baghsarian
Nearly 10 days after the kidnapping of 85-year-old Chris Baghsarian, NSW Police are appealing to the public for information relating to suspicious car fires last Tuesday in Westmead that could be linked to his kidnappers.
Baghsarian has been held hostage since February 13, when up to three men abducted him from his North Ryde home at about 5am in what police believe is a suspected case of mistaken identity.
Two vehicles were partially destroyed in suspicious fires on Good Street, Westmead, at about 11.30pm on Tuesday, February 17.
NSW Police said detectives were able to establish that the targeted vehicle was a 2022 Toyota Corolla bearing Victorian registration “1UZ2BU”, reported stolen from a Victorian address on January 13.
Investigators from Strike Force Chobat believe the decimated Toyota in the images are related to a crime scene established at a Dural property in north-west Sydney where, police believe, Baghsarian’s kidnappers may have held him hostage for some time over the past 10 days.
After reports that two vehicles were alight, Cumberland Police Area Command attended the location, not far from Parramatta Aquatic Centre, along with Fire and Rescue NSW, who extinguished the blaze.
This masthead reported last week that the Dural property was a “stronghold” used by kidnappers to hold an elderly man hostage. It matched images circulated throughout Sydney’s underworld showing the 85-year-old being tortured, as police admit hope of finding him alive is fading.
Police have issued several direct pleas to the kidnappers to return Baghsarian, who requires daily medical treatment and medication.
Baghsarian’s family said in a statement this week that he was deeply loved and a devoted father, brother, uncle and grandfather.
“The kindest person we know – someone who would never hurt a fly,” the family said in a statement released by NSW Police last Tuesday.
“Chris’ kidnapping feels surreal, and we are struggling to make sense of the fact that he has been taken, and that our family has been caught up in something that has nothing to do with us.
“We are living through a nightmare we never thought possible.”
Anyone who may have seen or heard anything, or has CCTV, dashcam and or mobile footage relating to the kidnapping, or witnessed any sort of suspicious activity in the Westmead area since last Friday is urged to contact detectives.
Anyone with information about this incident is urged to contact Crime Stoppers: 1800 333 000 or crimestoppers.com.au. Information is managed on a confidential basis. The public is reminded not to report information via NSW Police social media pages.

Now Donald Trump and the royal family know ‘the rule of law’ is no empty phrase

The shock of seeing a member of the royal family, Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, in the back of a car after he was released from police custody will reverberate in British history for generations to come. The photograph by Phil Noble of Reuters that featured on our front page this week will send a powerful and welcome message, one that has been reinforced in a statement by the King: “The law must take its course.”
There will be those who question that course. Some will argue that the allegations of the sexual abuse of women and girls facilitated by Jeffrey Epstein, the American financier and convicted sex offender, are more serious than the vague charge of misconduct in public office in relation to the former Prince Andrew’s trade envoy role that prompted the police to act.
Others will say, and indeed have said, that the use of the power of arrest was not necessary in this case, as Mr Mountbatten-Windsor would not have refused to attend an interview voluntarily.
These, however, are second-order issues that can be addressed in due course. What is of paramount importance is the principle that no one in Britain is above the law. The last vestige of royal prerogative was swept away when Queen Elizabeth II started to pay income tax in 1993, and Britain accepted that the rule of law applies to everyone in the country, irrespective of their social or economic status.
The same principle applies, thank goodness, in the United States – the nation to which we are most prone to compare ourselves. This week’s ruling by the Supreme Court, overturning President Donald Trump’s tariffs, was a vindication of that principle – strengthened rather than diminished by Mr Trump’s graceless tirade against the six justices in the majority, calling them “a disgrace to the nation”, “fools” and “lapdogs” for the “radical left Democrats”.
Against the ravings of a bad loser, it is worth quoting the noble sentiments expressed by Justice Neil Gorsuch, who was nominated to the court by Mr Trump. His concurrence appeared almost personally addressed to the president: “Yes, legislating can be hard and take time. And, yes, it can be tempting to bypass Congress when some pressing problem arises. But the deliberative nature of the legislative process was the whole point of its design. Through that process, the nation can tap the combined wisdom of the people’s elected representatives, not just that of one faction or one man.”
Justice Gorsuch concluded: “If history is any guide, the tables will turn and the day will come when those disappointed by today’s result will appreciate the legislative process for the bulwark of liberty it is.”
Mr Trump has, naturally, cocked a snook at the court by announcing a new 15 per cent tariff on all imports – a measure that will probably be struck down and more quickly than this week’s ruling.
The US also faces a more serious “rule of law” problem than Mr Trump’s unconstitutional attempts to levy tariffs without the consent of Congress. Agents of ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) appear to have been deployed by the president in something resembling a reign of terror, and the arc of justice is taking its time to bend towards ending it.
Yet this week’s Supreme Court ruling offers hope that the rule of law will eventually prevail on both fronts. It should also remind us in Britain how priceless our reputation for fair dealing truly is.
On Friday we reported that YTL, the Malaysian-based multinational company, will invest £4bn in Britain, including in the Aviva Arena, a new events venue in Bristol. “We love the UK and are pleased to be its largest Malaysian investor,” Francis Yeoh, its executive chair, said. He has previously praised Britain as a place “where the rule of law is the order of the day”.
The rule of law is no abstract principle. It is the guarantee of the rights of every member of society and the foundation of our prosperity.

'Awesome' Cherry-Evans lauded on debut by star Roosters teammate

Daly Cherry-Evans and Sam Walker show promising signs as Eels down Roosters in NRL trial
In short:
Daly Cherry-Evans has shown promising signs of a strong combination with Sam Walker in his first match in Roosters colours.
Walker, who scored a try and set up two others, said his veteran teammate had "been awesome".
New Eels pairing Mitch Moses and Jonah Pezet also combined well as the Eels sealed a comeback 28-22 win.
Daly Cherry-Evans has played his first game in Sydney Roosters colours, but it was halves partner Sam Walker who stole the show before Parramatta came back to win their pre-season clash 28-22.
With all eyes on Cherry-Evans after 15 years in Manly colours, halves partner Walker scored a try and set up two others in the Roosters' final pre-season hit out.
New Parramatta pairing Mitch Moses and Jonah Pezet also had glimpses of promise in their first outing together, playing through the opening 40 minutes together.
The Roosters led 22-12 when Cherry-Evans and James Tedesco left the field, before the Eels came back to win the game and wrap up the NRL's pre-season challenge title.
Cherry-Evans is set to be one of the most scrutinised men in the league this year, with his arrival at the Roosters making them one of the early-season favourites.
Having played all of his 352 NRL games at halfback for Manly, much will also be made of how he and Walker gel together in the Roosters' attack this year.
The 37-year-old wore number six on Saturday night with Walker at number seven, but the veteran was still the most vocal man in the Roosters' attack and spent most of the night directing traffic.
Playing on his normal right side, Cherry-Evans was also the Roosters' primary in-play kicker while the halves split their touches.
Clearly though, Cherry-Evans's presence helped free up Walker.
The halfback scored one try when he dummied to his senior halves partner and stepped through the Eels' defence to go over.
Walker then put Angus Crichton over for a try moments later with a perfect short ball on the left edge.
The halfback had also helped lay on the Roosters' first points when Isaiah Iongi spilled one of his bombs and Lindsay Collins dived on the loose ball.
And while a lightning storm after that try forced the game to be delayed for 45 minutes, it quickly became obvious Walker and Cherry-Evans had the potential to gel well.
"It was a little bit touch and go for the first 20," Walker said on Fox League at half-time.
"But I feel now we've got our flow going and are very comfortable with each other. He's been awesome."
Roosters coach Trent Robinson also confirmed Benaiah Ioelu would start the season at hooker, replacing injured recruit Reece Robson.
With Robson set to miss a month with a broken thumb, Ioelu had a role in one try on Saturday night when he ran out of dummy-half, kicked a bomb and Tommy Talau scored.
For Parramatta, Moses and Pezet linked up a few times, including in the lead-up to a disallowed try for winger Bailey Simonsson.
The slickest piece of play came with a beautiful Dylan Walker short ball for Moses, who burst through a gap and sent Matt Doorey over.
Moses handed over goalkicking duties to Pezet after that try and ran laps of the field at half-time, before not returning after the break.
But Parramatta officials have insisted that was already part of a plan for the star halfback and there was no injury concern.

Ghislaine Maxwell fights release of more Epstein documents, calling disclosure law unconstitutional

Ghislaine Maxwell fights release of more Epstein documents, calling disclosure law unconstitutional
NEW YORK (AP) — Lawyers for imprisoned British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell are fighting the requested release of 90,000 pages related to disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein and Maxwell, saying a law used to force the public release of millions of documents is unconstitutional.
The lawyers filed papers late Friday in Manhattan federal court to try to block the release of documents from a since-settled civil defamation lawsuit brought a decade ago by the late Epstein victim Virginia Giuffre against Maxwell. The Justice Department recently asked a judge to lift secrecy requirements on the files.
Maxwell’s attorneys said the Justice Department obtained the documents — otherwise subject to secrecy orders — improperly during its criminal probe of Maxwell. They said the documents include transcripts of over 30 depositions and private information regarding financial and sexual matters related to Maxwell and others.
Some records from the year-long exchange of evidence in the lawsuit battle were already released publicly in response to a federal appeals court order.
Maxwell’s lawyers say a law Congress passed in December to force the release of millions of Epstein-related documents violates the Constitution’s separation of powers doctrine.
“Congress cannot, by statute, strip this Court of the power or relieve it of the responsibility to protect its files from misuse. To do so violates the separation of powers,” wrote the lawyers, Laura Menninger and Jeffrey Pagliuca about the Epstein Files Transparency Act.
“Under the Constitution’s separation of powers, neither Congress nor the Executive Branch may intrude on the judicial power. That power includes the power to definitively and finally resolve cases and disputes,” the lawyers added.
The release of Epstein-related documents from criminal probes that began weeks ago has resulted in new revelations about Epstein’s decades-long sexual abuse of women and teenage girls. Some victims have complained that their names and personal information were revealed in documents while the names of their abusers were blacked out.
Members of Congress have complained that only about half of existing documents, many with redactions, have been made public even as Justice Department officials have said everything has been released, except for some files that can’t be made public until a judge gives the go-ahead.
Giuffre said Epstein had trafficked her to other men, including the former Prince Andrew, now known as Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor. She sued Mountbatten-Windsor in 2021, claiming that they had sex when she was 17.
He denied her claims and the two settled the lawsuit in 2022. Days ago, he was arrested and held in custody for nearly 11 hours on suspicion of misconduct in having shared confidential trade information with Epstein.
In a memoir published after she killed herself last year, Giuffre wrote that prosecutors told her they didn’t include her in the sex trafficking prosecution of Maxwell because they didn’t want her allegations to distract the jury.
Maxwell, 64, was convicted in December 2021 and sentenced to 20 years in prison. Epstein took his own life in a federal lockup in August 2019 as he awaited trial on sex trafficking charges. Maxwell was moved from a federal prison in Florida to a low-security prison camp in Texas last summer after she participated in two days of interviews with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche.
Two weeks ago, she declined to answer questions from House Oversight Committee lawmakers in a deposition conducted in a a video call to her federal prison camp, though she indicated through a statement from her lawyer that she was “prepared to speak fully and honestly” if granted clemency.
The Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Saturday.

Trump says he’ll raise tariffs to 15 percent after Supreme Court ruling

Trump says he’ll raise tariffs to 15 percent after Supreme Court ruling
Trump says he’ll raise tariffs to 15 percent after Supreme Court ruling
WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump said Saturday that he wants a global tariff of 15%, up from 10% he had announced a day earlier after the U.S. Supreme Court struck down many of the far-reaching taxes on imports that he had imposed over the last year.
Trump’s announcement on social media was the latest sign that despite the court’s check on his powers, the Republican president still intends to ratchet up tariffs in an unpredictable way. Tariffs have been his favorite tool for rewriting the rules of global commerce and applying international pressure.
The court’s decision on Friday struck down tariffs that Trump had imposed on nearly every country using an emergency powers law. Trump now said he will use a different, albeit more limited, legal authority.
He’s already signed an executive order enabling him to bypass Congress and impose a 10% tax on imports from around the world, starting on Tuesday, the same day as his State of the Union speech. However, those tariffs are limited to 150 days unless they are extended legislatively.
The White House did not immediately respond to a message inquiring when the president would sign an updated order to peg the tariffs at 15%.
He wrote on social media that he was making the announcement “based on a thorough, detailed, and complete review of the ridiculous, poorly written, and extraordinarily anti-American decision on Tariffs issued yesterday.”
By a 6-3 vote, the justices ruled that it was unconstitutional for Trump to unilaterally set and change tariffs because the power to tax lies with Congress.
In addition to the temporary tariffs that Trump wants to set at 15%, the president said Friday that he was also pursuing tariffs through other sections of federal law which require an investigation by the Commerce Department.
He wrote on Saturday that “during the next short number of months, the Trump Administration will determine and issue the new and legally permissible Tariffs, which will continue our extraordinarily successful process of Making America Great Again.”
After the Supreme Court decision, Trump made an unusually personal attack on the justices who ruled against him in a 6-3 vote, including two of those he appointed during his first term, Justices Neil Gorsuch and Amy Coney Barrett. Trump, at a news conference on Friday, said that the situation is “an embarrassment to their families.”
He was still seething Friday night, posting on social media complaining about Gorsuch, Coney Barrett and Chief Justice John Roberts, who ruled with the majority and wrote the majority opinion. On Saturday morning, Trump issued another post declaring that his “new hero” was Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who wrote a 63-page dissent. He also praised Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, who were in the minority, and said of the three dissenting justices: “There is no doubt in anyone’s mind that they want to, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!”
Tariffs have been central to Trump’s economic policies, which he has said address a host of ills, from reviving trade imbalances and reviving U.S. manufacturing to forcing other nations to action, whether it be stepping up efforts to combat drug trafficking or ceasing hostilities with each other.
He also regularly claimed despite evidence to the contrary that foreign governments would pay the tariffs—not American consumers and businesses.
Federal data shows the Treasury had collected more than $133 billion from the import taxes the president has imposed under the emergency powers law as of December, and Trump has made many promises about what that money might go toward, such as paying down the national debt and sending dividend checks to taxpayers. The Supreme Court decision did not address what happens to the funds that have already been collected from tariffs.
Democrats spoke out quickly on Trump’s new tariff threat. Democrats on the House Ways and Means Committee accused Trump of “pickpocketing the American people” with his newly announced higher tariff.
“A little over 24 hours after his tariffs were ruled illegal, he’s doing anything he can to make sure he can still jack up your costs,” they wrote on social media.
California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Trump nemesis, added that “he does not care about you.”

Blizzard warnings issued for New York City, New Jersey, Connecticut as storm threatens East Coast

Blizzard warnings issued from Delaware to Massachusetts as storm threatens East Coast
Blizzard warnings issued from Delaware to Massachusetts as storm threatens East Coast
NEW YORK (AP) — A rapidly intensifying storm triggered blizzard warnings Saturday for New York City, New Jersey and Boston as communities along the East Coast prepared for the Sunday arrival of heavy snow and damaging winds.
The National Weather Service increased its assessment of the potential severity of a storm that was projected to be much milder only days earlier.
The weather service said 1 to 2 feet (about 30 to 61 centimeters) of snow was possible in many areas as it issued blizzard warnings for New York City and Long Island, Boston and coastal communities in New Jersey, Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Rhode Island and Massachusetts. Flooding was also possible in parts of New York and New Jersey, it said.
“While we do get plenty of these nor’easters that produce heavy snow and strong impacts, it’s been several years since we saw one of this magnitude across this large of a region in this very populated part of the country,” said Cody Snell, a meteorologist at the service’s Weather Prediction Center.
Snell said the storm would arrive Sunday morning in areas around Washington before stretching toward Philadelphia and New York City and reaching Boston in the evening.
The weather service said the storm could begin as rainfall in some places before worsening, with the heaviest snowfall expected at night and as much as 2 inches (5 centimeters) of snow per hour at times in some areas, before tapering off by Monday afternoon.
The weather service warned that the storm, with steady winds of 25 to 35 mph (40 to 56 kph) would “make travel dangerous, if not impossible. Scattered downed tree limbs and power outages possible due to snow load and strong winds.”
Officials scrambled to prepare for a storm that forecasters days ago believed would have a much more limited impact.
New York Mayor Zohran Mamdani said the city would expand on efforts it used to deal with a major snowfall weeks ago. But officials held off on deciding whether to open schools Monday for the time being.
“We saw on Friday there was expectation that the likelihood was that we were going to face maybe 3 to 4 inches of snow. Quickly that then changed,” Mamdani said. “So we want to make sure that we make a decision based on up-to-date and accurate information.”
New York brought in additional snow clearing equipment from outside the city and planned to increase use of geocoding to keep track of bus stops and crosswalks that need clearing, he said.
With the storm zeroing in, John Berlingieri scrapped plans for a family trip to Puerto Rico to prepare his company, Berrington Snow Removal, for what could well be a mammoth task: Clearing snow from millions of square feet of asphalt surrounding shopping malls and industrial parks across Long Island.
Employees spent the last few days recharging batteries on the company’s 40 front-end loaders and replacing windshield wipers on snow removal vehicles, before resting up Saturday.
“I’m anticipating at least one week of work around the clock,” Berlingieri said. “We’re going to work 24 to 36 hours straight, sleep for a few hours and then go back.”
The storm approached just as the icy remains of a snowstorm that struck the region weeks earlier were finally melting away.
Officials in Atlantic City, New Jersey, urged residents and casino visitors to stay off the streets, especially in low-lying neighborhoods prone to flooding.
“I could go on and on probably with a good two dozen streets where we know we will get water and there will be snow on top of that,” said Scott Evans, the city’s fire chief and emergency management coordinator. “So you won’t be able to see it until it’s too late, so therefore please stay at home.”
Many churches canceled Sunday services and other activities. To compensate, St. Veronica Parish in Howell, New Jersey, added an extra Mass on Saturday evening.
“Please stay safe, avoid unnecessary travel, and keep one another in prayer during the storm,” the Rev. Peter James Alindogan posted online.

MFA transfers over 200 DJI Matrice reconnaissance drones to Ukraine’s Defense Forces
This was reported by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, as cited by Ukrinform.
According to Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha, the units receiving the drones include Azov, Liut, the 21st Separate Mechanized Brigade, as well as the STRIX UAV unit.
He explained that diplomacy during wartime is not limited to “negotiating tables, international summits, or complex sanctions decisions,” but also includes “concrete support for our soldiers on the front line.”
“These drones were purchased with charitable donations collected in the Czech Republic. This is the result of joint work by diplomats, partners, and caring individuals who understand that supporting Ukraine is not about words, but about action,” the minister emphasized.
Sybiha stressed that the reconnaissance drones will help save the lives of Ukrainian service members, improve decision-making accuracy, and provide an advantage on the battlefield.
“When these drones were being loaded, everyone got involved – from attachés to the deputy minister. No ranks or offices. Just a team that knows exactly why it is doing this. This is not a one-time initiative for us. It is systematic work. The diplomatic front operates as continuously as all the others, and everyone is doing what is necessary for victory in their own place,” the foreign minister said.
As reported by Ukrinform, in September last yea,r the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Modern Ukraine Foundation transferred 20 fiber-optic FPV drones to the 21st Separate Mechanized Brigade, as well as three 35 kW generators for regional clinical hospitals in Zaporizhzhia, Dnipro, and Kharkiv.

US wins its record 11th gold medal at the Winter Olympics
The U.S. team won its record-breaking 11th gold medal of the Winter Olympics when the trio of Kaila Kuhn, Connor Curran and Chris Lillis took the title in mixed aerials
- Bookmark
The U.S. Olympic team won its record-breaking 11th gold medal of the Winter Games on Saturday, with at least one more good possibility when its men's hockey team wraps up the action on closing day with the title game against Canada.
The trio of Kaila Kuhn, Connor Curran and Chris Lillis gave the U.S. the record by capturing the American team's second straight title in mixed aerials.
The 11th gold breaks the country's mark set at the last Olympics on U.S. soil — in Salt Lake City in 2002, which has long stood out as a turning point for a winter sports program that had struggled over previous decades.
This could end up being another turning point, not so much for the sheer number of medals but the variety of places from which they came: Twelve of the 17 sports disciplines represented in the Winter Games produced medals for the U.S.
“Our focus and our strategy has always been about breadth,” said Sarah Hirshland, the CEO of the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee. “We want to win in everything. We want to make every sport better. Some could argue there are countries that go a mile deep in certain sports and really dominate. Our goal has been to improve Winter sport across the board.”
The aerials medal, then a bronze in speedskating from Mia Manganello later in the day, lifted the U.S. to 31 overall for the Olympics with one day left.
That's second to Norway, which had a record 18 gold medals and 40 overall through Saturday evening. Seventy-two percent of the golds came in the endurance sports of cross country, biathlon and Nordic combined. The biggest gold-medal hauls for the U.S. came in four disciplines — two each (18%) in Alpine skiing, freestyle skiing, figure skating and speedskating.
There are 38 more medal events on the program this year than there were in 2002. A lot of the new events have come at the snowpark — halfpipe, slopestyle and big air — which used to be America's domain but has now been taken over by Japan, which, for instance, won nine medals in snowboarding, compared to two for the U.S.
“We stated we wanted to be a podium nation,” Fin Kirwan, the USOPC's chief of Olympic sport, said of the U.S. goal of being top-three on the medals table. “We said it will likely take 30 medals and we got after it. The athletes delivered on their potential and, by turn, we hit the record on gold-medal performance, which shows that our very best were able to execute.”
Here are some looks and links to the rest of the 11 U.S. gold medal winners:
Alex Ferreira, freeskiing
Halfpipe skier rounds out his Olympic collection — gold, silver, bronze. Back home, he’ll keep going with streamer “Hotdog Hans” where he dressed up like an 80-something ski sensation.
Breezy Johnson, Alpine skiing
Her long journey included a knee injury four years ago on the same mountain where she won the gold.
Elizabeth Lemley, moguls
Nicknamed “Lizard,” she joins a long line of great U.S. moguls skiers, including 2010 champion Hannah Kearney and her teammate, Jaelin Kauf, who now has three silver medals.
Alysa Liu, figure skating
The 20-year-old stepped away after the 2022 Beijing Games, rediscovered her love for figure skating and happily claimed the title.
Elena Myers Taylor, bobsled
At her sixth Olympics, she finally broke through, becoming the oldest Winter Olympian to win gold at age 41.
Mikaela Shiffrin, Alpine skiing
The most winning skier of all time cashes in at the Olympics with slalom gold after a tear-stained shutout four years ago.
Jordan Stolz, speedskating (2)
Joined Eric Heiden at Lake Placid in 1980 as only the second man to capture the 500 and 1,000.
US figure skating team
Liu, Amber Glenn and Ilia Malinin are among the members of a team that brings home second straight gold; the last one took two years to capture after a Russian doping saga.
US women's hockey team
A tense thriller, highlighted by Hilary Knight's equalizer with 2:04 left, then Megan Keller's winner in overtime.

Houthi mobilize troops in Yemen with unclear target, as possible strike on Iran looms in - report
Unknown

05:17:17 KST

The Houthis may be mobilizing forces for an offensive, a report at Al-Ain media in the UAE said on February 21. The Houthis' objectives are unclear. However, the report of mobilization is important because it comes amid heightened tensions with Iran.
It also comes after the UAE and Saudi Arabia almost clashed over differing policies in Yemen. The Saudis have supported the government of Yemen, while the UAE has supported a group in southern Yemen called the Southern Transitional Council.
What does the Al-Ain report say? According to the report, the Houthis have mobilized on various fronts within Yemen. It may be an attempt to “ignite a new round of war.” What sources told Al-Ain is that “the Houthi militias have sent military reinforcements to Marib Governorate, where oil fields are located, and to the Hodeidah fronts on the Red Sea, in addition to reinforcements to the northern border fronts.”
Move against Saudi-backed forces?
This could indicate a Houthi move against the Riyadh-backed government forces in Yemen. It could also be part of a Houthi plan to take advantage of Saudi-UAE tensions or to pounce as US-Iran tensions grow. It’s also possible that Al-Ain is being fed misinformation designed to create tensions. Because there are so many possibilities, it is worth being skeptical about the reports.
The report goes on to say that the “sources explained that large Houthi military groups moved on Saturday from the city of Amran, located 50 kilometers north of Sana'a, led by the Houthi leader Mohammed Zaid Yahya Al-Makhdhi, nicknamed Abu Ali, to the northern border fronts of the country.”
In addition, “the sources indicated that the military force that the militias deployed to the Saada and Al-Jawf fronts on the northern borders of the country comes as part of the group’s military mobilization to all fronts,” while adding that the Houthis have also sent commanders to the Hodeidah governorate. This is an area near a port that shares the same name. This port was targeted numerous times by Israel last year when the Houthis were targeting Israel with ballistic missiles.
The report goes on to say that "the Houthis force had received intensive training at a Houthis ' training camp in Sana’a, before being deployed through Naqil Manakhah to Hodeidah. On February 18, the Houthi militias sent unprecedented reinforcements from Sana'a to the fronts of Marib Governorate, under the leadership of commander Khaled Mohammed Al-Nadhari, nicknamed Abu Ayman.”
Lastly, the report argues that Houthi fighters arrived at the Marib front. This area has been an active frontline in the past. Over the last three years, the clashes between the Houthis and the Saudi-backed Yemen government have been reduced. This is part of a wider shift in the region in which Riyadh also settled some of its problems with Iran. Riyadh has also grown closer to Turkey and Qatar over the past year, as it has distanced itself from the UAE’s policies in the region. This mostly led to a reduction in tensions with the Houthis.
Al-Ain concludes that “the unprecedented Houthi mobilization and ground attacks on the battlefronts threaten to collapse the fragile UN-brokered truce in place since 2022 and return the situation to square one, according to observers.” It is unclear if this is part of a wider attempt by Iranian-backed groups to create tensions in the region. Reports on February 21 said that Hezbollah is also considering escalation with Israel. Iranian-backed militias in Iraq have also threatened the US and Israel in the past.

Syria might close Roj Camp, last site holding ISIS-linked families, soon, officials say
Unknown

20:17:09 UTC
05:17:09 KST

The Roj camp in Syria may be closed in the coming days or weeks, according to an official in eastern Syria. Rudaw Kurdish media reported on February 21 that “Roj camp, which houses families of Islamic State (ISIS) fighters, will be fully closed in the near future, a northeast Syria (Rojava) official said on Saturday.”
The report comes after other reports have claimed that some 15,000 people left another large camp called Al-Hol. These are some of the 50,000 families of ISIS fighters who surrendered back in 2019. This large group of people mostly consisted of children. The women and children came from some 60 countries. There were also around 7,000 men.
When the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces began to clash with the Syrian government in January, there were concerns about what might happen with the estimated 25,000 people in Syria who were in around 30 prisons and camps run by the SDF. These facilities held ISIS male prisoners, as well as around 18,000 women and children. The women and children were mostly at two large camps called Al-Hol and Roj.
Over the last seven years, since ISIS was largely defeated in Syria in 2019, the ISIS families have slowly been repatriated by some countries. Many countries, particularly in Europe, did not take back their citizens. However, Iraq eventually took back thousands of its citizens. The ISIS families were left in limbo for a few reasons.
One reason was that although the anti-ISIS coalition had around 90 countries as members, none of them wanted to deal directly with the SDF because they didn’t view it as a government. On the other hand, they didn’t want the ISIS-linked women and children handed over to the Assad regime or freed. Thus, the people languished in prisons and camps.
The Syrian government joined the anti-ISIS coalition in November 2025. This meant it could not decide what to do with the ISIS detention facilities. US Central Command decided in January 2026, amid clashes between the SDF and Damascus, to move 7,000 ISIS male detainees to Iraq. This is because Iraq has experience investigating ISIS crimes. Many ISIS crimes, such as the mass murder of Yazidis, occurred in Iraq. The chaos in Syria also led some to be concerned that the ISIS men would escape.
Syria plans to let women, children go home
The women and children, judged to be less of a threat, were left behind at Al-Hol and Roj camps. Al-Hol fell into the hands of the Syrian government in January. Many of the women and children left the camp at this time, leaving a few thousand behind. Syrian officials have secured the camp and visited it. They appear to believe the people should have a right to leave. These women and children were never charged with crimes, and they have been denied any due process for seven years. Syria appears to prefer to let them go home, either to Syria, where some are from, or to their roughly 60 home countries.
Meanwhile, at Roj camp, the SDF is still in charge. It is in the spotlight because some 34 Australians there want to go back to Australia. Australia doesn’t seem keen on helping them. This is the usual policy of countries, leaving their citizens in Syria rather than dealing with them.
Rudaw reports that “Sheikhmous Ahmed, who supervises refugee and IDP camps in Rojava, told Rudaw that a joint decision has been made with the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) to empty the camp.” The report quotes him as saying, “For this purpose, coordination has taken place with the High Commissioner for Refugees regarding their transfer.”
Syrian families are already leaving and going home, apparently. It is not clear why the SDF continued to keep them in Roj camp or Al-Hol once the new Syrian government had emerged. “Roj camp remains under the control of the Autonomous Administration and is guarded by Asayish [SDF-linked] security forces. Ahmed stressed that the area around the camp is stable and free of ISIS cells, and that aid organizations continue to provide services on a daily basis,” Rudaw notes. There are some 730 foreign families from 42 countries in the camp. In addition, there are a handful of Iraqis and Syrians in the camp. “Approximately 2,225 people live in the camp, according to the Kurdish official.”
Now the SDF is moving to deal with the Roj camp and has the people go home and be repatriated. Once again, it is unclear why this process didn’t happen a year ago. “Previously, contacts were conducted through the [US-led] global coalition and the SDF’s foreign relations office,” Ahmed said. “Now, any country wishing to repatriate its citizens must directly contact the Autonomous Administration, and we are ready to provide all necessary facilitation.”

Trump's options on Iran: Trump weighs 'token' Iran enrichment in narrow nuclear compromise - report
Unknown

The Trump administration is considering an Iranian proposal that would allow so‑called “token” uranium enrichment, according to senior US officials cited by Axios.
The potential concession would test the limits of longstanding US demands that Iran’s nuclear program not leave any possible path to a bomb.
Under the scenario outlined, Washington would evaluate a written Iranian offer in which Tehran retains minimal enrichment capacity but with strict safeguards to prevent any route to weaponization.
The report suggests this represents a narrow diplomatic opening between the red lines of the two sides, even as pressure mounts on the possibility of wider conflict.
At the same time, US President Donald Trump has been presented with military options that involve directly targeting the supreme leader, and US naval and air forces continue to arrive in the Middle East.
Potential US-Iran bargain on enrichment
Publicly, US officials have maintained that zero enrichment remains the standard for any deal with Tehran.
But US sources told Axios that the administration is open to a limited compromise, as long as it can be verified that any uranium enrichment is purely civilian and cannot be used as a stepping‑stone toward nuclear weapons development.
Tehran’s own position on enrichment appears to have evolved in recent talks. While Tehran has maintained a rigid stance on the issue, vowing that no external pressure will impact negotiations, Iranian officials have signaled willingness to reduce the level and perhaps the purity of uranium already enriched to 60 percent, a level far above what is needed for civil nuclear power but below weapons‑grade. This approach would hinge on monitoring by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
On Monday, Iran's foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, met the UN nuclear watchdog chief, Rafael Grossi, ahead of US-Iran nuclear talks to tackle their dispute over Tehran's nuclear program.
Days later, in an interview with MS NOW’s Joe Scarborough, Araghchi claimed that Iran was willing to implement “confidence-building measures” to “ensure that Iran's program cannot even be diverted to non-peaceful purposes” such as the possible construction of nuclear weapons.
Iran is said to be preparing a written counterproposal to send to Washington after approval in Tehran, Axios reported. The timing and details are unclear, but diplomats have indicated that the offer could outline limits on the number of centrifuges and the level of enrichment, framed to demonstrate compliance with peaceful use only.
Military options still on the table
Despite these diplomatic maneuvers, the US military buildup in the region continues to fuel uncertainty in Tehran and allied capitals. US officials have presented Trump with a series of operational options intended to either compel Iran to accept US terms or, if diplomacy fails, degrade Iran’s nuclear and military infrastructure.
On Thursday, US Senator Lindsey Graham said that planning was underway for a possible joint US-Israel attack on Iran. Trump later added that the US was considering an initial, limited strike on Iran to force Tehran to agree to his demands regarding a deal.
“President Trump will be ready to accept a deal that would be substantive and that he can sell politically at home,” one senior official said, warning that if Tehran “plays games, there won’t be a lot of patience.”

Italy's RAI apologizes after latest gaffe targets Israeli bobsleigh team

Italy's state broadcaster RAI was forced to apologize to the Jewish community on Saturday after an off‑air remark advising its producers to "avoid" the Israeli crew was broadcast before coverage of the Four-Man bobsleigh event at the Winter Olympics.
The head of RAI's sports division had already resigned earlier in the week after his error-ridden commentary at the Milano Cortina 2026 opening ceremony two weeks ago triggered a revolt among its journalists.
On Saturday, viewers heard "Let's avoid crew number 21, which is the Israeli one," and then "no, because ..." before the sound was cut off.
"I firmly condemn the statements made today by a RAI journalist regarding the Israeli bobsleigh delegation at the Milan-Cortina 2026 Winter Olympics," said Jonathan Peled, Israel's ambassador, on social media.
"There should be no room in sport for incitement to hatred, discrimination based on national, cultural, or religious beliefs, and any offensive rhetoric.
Italian broadcasters apologize after hateful comments about Israeli Olympic athletes
"We are confident that the RAI management will take all necessary measures to ensure that similar incidents are not repeated," he said.
RAI CEO Giampaolo Rossi said the incident represented a "serious" breach of the principles of impartiality, respect, and inclusion that should guide the public broadcaster.
He added that RAI had opened an internal inquiry to swiftly determine any responsibility and any potential disciplinary procedures.
In a separate statement, RAI's board of directors condemned the remark as "unacceptable." The board apologized to the Jewish community, the athletes involved, and all viewers who felt offended.
RAI is the country's largest media organization and operates national television, radio, and digital news services.
The union representing RAI journalists, Usigrai, had said Paolo Petrecca's opening ceremony commentary had dealt "a serious blow" to the company's credibility.
His missteps included misidentifying venues and public figures, and making comments about national teams that were widely criticized.

Ellyse Perry's 350th international match has been soured as India claimed a 17-run win in a series-deciding T20 in Adelaide.
Indian opener Smriti Mandhana top-scored with 82 off just 55 deliveries and featured in a 120-run stand with World Cup hero Jemimah Rodrigues.
India's 6-176 was the highest ever women's T20 international score at the Adelaide Oval.
Australia's women cricketers have slipped to a 17-run loss to India in their series-deciding Twenty20 fixture.
India claimed a 2-1 series triumph after posting 5-176 on Saturday night at Adelaide Oval, the highest women's T20 international score at the venue.
Australia mustered 9-159 in reply, losing traction after their initial three wickets fell in a 13-ball span.
The match was Ellyse Perry's 350th international match.
"It was a bit of a bugger, we couldn't get the result for her tonight," Australia captain Sophie Molineux said of Perry.
"She's a special person, a special cricketer, she has done so much for the game and continues to."
Australian openers Georgia Voll and Beth Mooney cracked 18 runs from the first over, delivered by Renuka Singh Thakur.
But Voll (10) and Mooney (six) were dismissed in a space of six balls.

Australian great Perry scored only one. She advanced to spinner Shreyanka Patil and attempted a big drive but missed and was bowled.
Perry's dismissal left the hosts reeling at 3-32 in the fourth over and Phoebe Litchfield and Ash Gardner steadied with a 31-run stand.
But Litchfield (26 from 17 balls) was caught in the deep from consecutive switch-hits. She smacked a four from the first one to leave the hosts 4-63 in the ninth over.
The Australians were 4-78 at the midpoint and Gardner gave her side a sniff, making 57 from 45 balls before she too was caught in the deep.

Gardner's departure started another Australian slump of 4-15.
"We actually thought we kept them to a good score. It was a pretty good wicket," Molineux said.
"We just lost some pretty important wickets at the wrong point in time."
Earlier, Indian opener Smriti Mandhana top-scored with a superb 82 from 55 balls and featured in a 120-run partnership with No.3 Jemimah Rodrigues (59 from 46).
Australia struck early when quick Kim Garth (1-25) dismissed Shafali Verma (seven) in the third over.
Mandhana and Rodrigues then produced their fine stand, powering the tourists to 1-86 at the midpoint of their innings.
The 29-year-old Mandhana registered her half-century from only 38 balls by smacking Darcie Brown over the midwicket fence for six.
The partnership was finally broken in the 17th over when Mandhana lofted Annabel Sutherland (2-34) into the legside only for Gardner to make swift ground from deep midwicket and take a catch on the run.
The nations meet again on Tuesday in Brisbane for the first of three 50-over fixtures, ahead of a Test match starting March 6 at the WACA Ground in Perth.
Those matches will be the last for ex-Australian skipper Alyssa Healy before she retires.
"[Healy] is going to bring an injection of some real excitement," Molineux said.
"It's going to be her last four games for Australia and we're going to do everything possible to send her off on the right note."
The trophy at the end of the multi-format series is decided on a points system, with two points for a T20 and 50-over victory and four points on offer for a Test triumph.

Brazil and India agree to boost cooperation on rare earths
Brazil and India have signed a new deal to cooperate on rare earths and other critical minerals
- Bookmark
Brazil and India sealed a deal Saturday on critical minerals and rare earths, enhancing cooperation on crucial resources between two major countries of the global south as they seek to diversify their trading relationships.
The non-binding memorandum of understanding on rare earths establishes a framework for cooperation between the two countries, focusing on reciprocal investment, exploration, mining and artificial intelligence applications, among other issues.
Brazil has the world’s second-largest reserves of rare earth minerals, used in a wide range of products, including smartphones, electric vehicles, solar panels and jet engines.
“Increasing investments and cooperation in matters of renewable energy and critical minerals is at the core of a pioneering agreement that we have signed today,” Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva told journalists.
The two countries also agreed legal frameworks on a range of topics including entrepreneurship, health, scientific research and education.
Lula arrived in India for a state visit on Wednesday that will last through to Sunday, seeking to deepen ties with India which, like Brazil, is a founding member of the BRICS+ bloc of developing nations. He participated in a summit on artificial intelligence.
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited Brazil in July last year, while the trip to India was Lula’s second state visit.
Lula was accompanied by 11 ministers, including those of foreign affairs, finance, health and agriculture, as well as a large delegation of business leaders. The Brazilian leader on Saturday said it may be the biggest delegation of his trips abroad so far, which he called a sign of his commitment to India.
The deal on rare earths is part of a broader strategy from both India and Brazil to become more strategically autonomous from China and the U.S. through diversification, said Oliver Stuenkel, an international relations professor at the Getulio Vargas Foundation, a think tank and university.
Brazil has been pursuing that strategy for years, said Stuenkel, which is why Lula was able to stand up to President Donald Trump last year when the U.S. leader imposed a 50% tariff on Brazilian exports to the country over the trial of his ally, former President Jair Bolsonaro.
“The reading is that, given how turbulent and unpredictable things have become, the more partners, the better,” Stuenkel said.
The U.S. later removed most tariffs on Brazil and the sanctions imposed on the judge who was overseeing the case.
Roberto Goulart Menezes, an international relations professor at the University of Brasilia, said that last year’s confrontation with the U.S. is when Brazil germinated the idea of putting rare earths and critical minerals on the bargaining table.
“Brazil began to reposition its understanding of the importance of these elements beyond their commercial dimension, recognizing their geopolitical relevance,” said Goulart.
Lula is expected to visit his counterpart in Washington D.C. in the coming months. “For Brazil, this agreement represents a kind of pilot before negotiating with a country with which Brazil has an asymmetrical relationship,” Goulart said.

Two Israeli businessmen held for 18 days in Zambia on terror suspicion after hotel explosion

Two Israeli businessmen in their mid-30s were detained for 18 days in Zambia on suspicion of involvement in terrorism after an explosion in their hotel room in the capital, Lusaka, authorities and their attorney said.
The incident dates back to September, when the two men, who work for an agricultural company in Malawi bordering Zambia, were staying at the InterContinental hotel in Lusaka.
According to their account, they placed a bottle of fertilizer in the room’s refrigerator, intending to take it back with them to Malawi. For reasons that remain unclear, the substance exploded inside the refrigerator, completely burning the room and causing damage to adjacent rooms.
The two men left Zambia shortly afterward and returned to Malawi.
Four months later, they re-entered Zambia and were arrested at a border crossing after authorities determined they were wanted in connection with the explosion. They were taken for questioning by Zambia’s counterterrorism unit on suspicion of links to terrorism, based on the blast in a room registered in their names.
The two men said they had received the bottle of fertilizer from another employee of their agricultural company and were instructed to keep it refrigerated. They told investigators they were unaware the substance could ignite or explode.
The counterterrorism unit rejected their explanation and also suspected they had intended to smuggle a drone, according to their attorney.
The men were held in difficult conditions in two separate detention facilities to prevent them from coordinating their accounts. Each was held in a small cell with 14 other detainees.
Israel’s ambassador to Zambia, Ofra Farhi, and the embassy’s security officer visited the detainees, and at their request conditions of detention were improved. The ambassador and security officer also met with investigators and officials from Zambia’s Interior Ministry.
After more than two weeks of questioning, the counterterrorism unit ruled out terrorism suspicions. On Friday, the two businessmen were deported from Zambia and barred from returning.
Attorney Mordechai Tzivin, who specializes in representing Israelis facing legal trouble abroad, said: “I am pleased with the release and thank the law enforcement authorities in Zambia for reaching the conclusion that these are legitimate businessmen — that no wrongdoing was found in their actions and that the suspicion of involvement in terrorism was proven unfounded — as well as representatives of the Foreign Ministry and the embassy in Zambia for their intensive efforts and meetings with senior Zambian officials and the Zambian ambassador to Israel.”

Julien Macdonald proves the ‘king of glamour’ is back at London Fashion Week
Ella Eyre and Montana Brown were among those sitting front row.

Julien Macdonald made a high-shine return to London Fashion Week, staging his autumn/winter 2026 comeback on the interior rooftop of The Shard with a collection that reaffirmed his reputation as fashion’s self-styled “king of glamour”.
Perched high above the capital, guests nursed martinis as the Welsh designer sent out a procession of sequinned, sculpted silhouettes against the glittering night skyline.
Singer Ella Eyre was among those seated front row, watching as Macdonald delivered a show steeped in his signature high-octane energy.
It marked Macdonald’s first London Fashion Week runway since restructuring his business in 2023, and the message was unmistakable: unapologetic, maximalist glamour is back.
Macdonald, 54, who launched his label in 1997 and has previously held high-profile roles at Chanel and Givenchy, has long been synonymous with red-carpet showstoppers. His return leaned fully into that legacy, delivering a collection of high-impact eveningwear designed for drama rather than understatement.
The show opened with fluid, body-skimming gowns in metallic tones, including a liquid gold halter-neck dress that plunged dramatically at the front and twisted into a draped, thigh-split skirt.
The silhouette elongated the body, the fabric catching the light with every step, evoking the kind of paparazzi-ready moment Macdonald’s celebrity clientele – from Beyonce to Jennifer Lopez – have made their own.
Sequins were deployed liberally across the collection. A sharply cut, long-sleeved column dress in burnished bronze shimmered under the spotlights, its structured shoulders lending to Macdonald’s siganture statuesque quality.
Elsewhere, micro silhouettes dominated: a black, crystal-embellished two-piece with sheer shorts and cut-out detailing left little to the imagination, styled with pared-back heels to keep the focus on the body.
Feathers, which have been trending on the runway, gave a theatrical flourish to the collection.
A mint-green, crystal-studded bodysuit was paired with a matching feathered robe that trailed behind the model, its texture softening the overt sensuality of the barely-there base layer.
In another look, a sheer black gown with feathered hem detailing glided down the runway, balancing transparency with movement.
There was little concession to winter in the traditional sense. Despite the autumn/winter billing, Macdonald’s world remains resolutely summer – or at least permanently party-bound.
Backless gowns, plunging necklines and high-cut bodysuits dominated, with sheer panels and strategic cut-outs forming a recurring motif. One pale green, sequin-drenched gown featured a deep V neckline gathered at the waist and a front slit that revealed just enough leg, merging red-carpet polish with beach-club ease.
The setting at The Shard amplified the excitement for this comeback show. With London’s skyline twinkling beyond the glass, the show felt less like a seasonal presentation and more like a celebration – a statement of resilience and return.
If much of this season’s schedule has leaned into restraint then Macdonald offered a fun alternative of high-octane, unapologetic, old-school glamour.
The designer has signalled a shift towards a more accessible luxury ready-to-wear model, focusing on versatile embellished pieces. While the collection remained firmly in the eveningwear sphere, several looks – streamlined sequinned dresses and sharply cut cocktail numbers – suggested a commercial sensibility beneath the glitz.
Macdonald was named British Fashion Designer of the Year in 2001 and appointed chief designer at Givenchy the same year, succeeding Alexander McQueen. More than two decades later, his formula of sequins, skin and skimpy silhouettes remains largely unchanged.
Julien Macdonald’s return delivered something of a jolt of joy above the London skyline.

Hezbollah is stepping up military and security meetings as it braces for a possible war against Israel, according to a report by the Saudi-owned Al Arabiya network.
Sources close to the Lebanese terrorist organization told the network that Hezbollah is now effectively being run by officers from Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps rather than by Lebanese officials.
The officers, the sources said, are not only overseeing efforts to rebuild the terrorist organization after months of fighting but are also directly supervising operational plans and holding meetings with Hezbollah commanders in more than one area to issue instructions and guidance.
According to the report, some of the Iranian officers have been in Lebanon for some time, while others arrived recently amid the possibility of a US attack on the Islamic Republic of Iran.
The sources also disclosed that Iranian officers recently met with Hezbollah's missile unit in the Beqaa Valley, which was targeted in an Israeli strike on Friday. They assessed that a broader Israeli attack against Hezbollah is "inevitable" and that it is "only a matter of time" before a conflict erupts.

Ukraine’s MFA responds to blackmail by Hungary and Slovakia: Ultimatums should be sent to Kremlin, not to Kyiv
This is stated in a statement issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine, according to Ukrinform.
“Such actions, in the context of massive and targeted Russian strikes on Ukraine's energy infrastructure and Moscow's attempts to deprive Ukrainians of electricity, heating, and gas during extreme cold weather, are provocative, irresponsible, and threaten the energy security of the entire region,” the Foreign Ministry said.
The statement stresses that by acting in this way, the governments of Hungary and Slovakia are not only playing into the hands of the aggressor but are also harming their own energy companies that operate on a commercial basis.
The Foreign Ministry noted that Ukraine remains in constant contact with representatives of the European Commission regarding damage to energy infrastructure caused by daily Russian strikes.
Ukraine has also conveyed information to the governments of Hungary and Slovakia about the consequences of these attacks for the Druzhba oil pipeline infrastructure. It is emphasized that, under the constant threat of new missile attacks, security and stabilization repair work is ongoing. Ukraine has also proposed alternative solutions for supplying these countries with non-Russian oil.
“Ukraine has always been, is, and will remain a reliable energy partner of the EU and a transit country for energy resources. At the same time, in light of the unfounded and irresponsible threats coming from Budapest and Bratislava in recent days, Ukraine is considering the possibility of activating the Early Warning Mechanism provided for in the Association Agreement between Ukraine and the European Union,” the ministry said.
In this context, the Foreign Ministry calls on the governments of Hungary and the Slovak Republic to engage constructively and behave responsibly, stressing:
“Ultimatums should be sent to the Kremlin, and certainly not to Kyiv.”
As previously reported by Ukrinform, on February 20, Hungarian Foreign Minister Péter Szijjártó wrote on social media that his country would block the EU’s allocation of funds to Ukraine under a €90 billion loan until the transit of Russian oil through the Druzhba pipeline was restored.
Meanwhile, Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico stated on Saturday that if Ukraine did not resume oil transit to Slovakia, he would initiate a halt to electricity supplies to Ukraine on Monday.

Salsa legend Willie Colón dies at age 75, family says

Feb 21 - American salsa legend Willie Colon, the pioneering trombonist, vocalist and composer, died on Saturday at age 75, his family said in a statement.
"While we grieve his absence, we also rejoice in the timeless gift of his music and the cherished memories he created that will live on forever," the family said on Colon's Facebook page.
The cause of death was not disclosed.
Born in the Bronx to Puerto Rican parents, Colón recorded dozens of albums including La Gran Fuga (The Big Break) in 1970 and El Juicio in 1972, according to Fania Records, a label that promoted salsa music.
He signed with Fania at age 15 and two years later, in 1967, released his first album El Malo, which has sold more than 300,000 copies, according to his biography on the LA Philharmonic website.
Colón's music combined elements of jazz, rock and salsa, incorporating the rhythms of traditional music from Cuba, Puerto Rico, Brazil, and Africa, the biography said.
"A significant overarching theme in Colón’s music—which draws from many cultures and several different styles—is an exploration of the competing associations that Puerto Ricans have with their home and with the United States," it said.
"He uses his songs to depict and investigate the problems of living in the U.S. as a Puerto Rican and also to imply the cultural contributions that Puerto Ricans have to offer."
In 2004, he received a lifetime achievement award from the Latin Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences.
A longtime social activist, Colón was a member of the Latino Commission on AIDS and the United Nations Immigrant Foundation and was a board member at the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute, according to the biography. REUTERS

Willie Colón, trombone and salsa legend, dies at 75

Willie Colón, a legendary trombonist and pioneer of salsa music, has died. He was 75.
His death on Saturday was confirmed in a Facebook post by his longtime manager, Pietro Carlos.
News of the singer’s condition circulated on the web in recent days. Yonkers Voice News reported Colón was admitted to NewYork-Presbyterian Westchester hospital in Bronxville, N.Y., on Tuesday with respiratory problems and he appeared fragile.
Born William Anthony Colón Román on April 28, 1950, to Puerto Rican parents in New York City, Colón first picked up the trumpet in school. It seemed like a natural choice for the former bugle-playing Boy Scout, who attended the youth program at the suggestion of his grandmother.
“So I could learn how to be a good boy,” said Colón in a 1988 interview with Associated Press.
By age 13, Colón had started a band and played at some weddings and in the bustling nightclubs of New York City. At one point, he forged a cabaret card, a mandated ID for musicians and entertainers between 1940 and 1967 who worked in establishments serving alcohol, which required individuals to be 18 years and older.
The thrilling 1960s Latin music scene in New York consumed Colón, who was deeply inspired by Latin jazz pioneer and bandleader Eddie Palmieri, once part of a main act at the Palladium Ballroom who went on to form La Perfecta, a Cuban conjunto that revolutionized the New York Latin music scene with its inclusion of two trombones, played by Barry Rogers and Jose Rodriguez, instead of the costly four-set trumpets.
But Colón’s instrumental preference changed once he heard the bodied timbre of Mon Rivera’s all-trombone brass lineup marching to a bomba beat. “It would knock my socks off,” said Colón in a 1988 interview with Associated Press, leading the singer to teach himself how to play the instrument.
By age 15, Colón was signed to Fania Records. Two years later at age 17, he went on to release his debut album, “El Malo,” a record that defined the fierce sounds of New York’s salsa scene, which Colón later described as the Latin equivalent of rap.
According to his former label, the name of “El Malo” was bestowed upon Colón by older musicians who sought to mock his trombone range at the time, though the young bandleader would find a way to use the label to his advantage.
On the LP, Colón’s sound moved away from the polished mambo sounds of orchestral bands decades prior, in large part due to Puerto Rican singer Héctor Lavoe, whose vocals can be heard in tracks like the gritty “El Malo” that vows to knock out any wanna-be street phony.
The pair would go on to record a total of 14 albums through 1973, with Lavoe’s talents for improvisation complementing Colón’s raw, aggressive trombone.
“Salsa came from the same kind of situation that rap does,” Colon said in a 1992 interview with The Times. “It was kind of a hybrid of a bunch of different elements. Hector had just come from Puerto Rico and didn’t speak English. I didn’t speak much Spanish, I was a little New York kid. We got together and just started with the same kind of irreverent, rebellious attitude, writing songs about the baddest guy on the block, drugs and sex. Before that, the lyrics and whole attitude of Latin music was, ‘Look at me dance, listen to those drums, I’m cutting sugar cane.’ It was a rural, folkloric emphasis; we changed it to an inner-city kind of culture.”
Colón’s impact went beyond live music. The album cover of “El Malo,” which showed two serious profiles of Colón, depicted the singer as a sly bad boy, and ultimately gave rise to his gangster persona, which would be a throughline in future projects, including his sophomore 1968 album, “The Hustler” which featured the band with fitted suits, smoking cigars and placing bets in a pool hall. His 1970 album “Cosa Nuestra” featured Colón smoking a cigar while overlooking a dead body in broad daylight in Manhattan’s East River Bikeway. Most famously, his 1971 album, “La Gran Fuga,” depicted the singer on a fake FBI “Most Wanted” poster.
These mob-like depictions occurred long before cult-favorite films like Francis Ford Coppola’s 1972 “The Godfather” and Brian De Palma 1983’s “Scarface” became the prominent gangster storylines various male acts venerate in their music.
By 1973, Colón and Lavoe split — allegedly due to Lavoe’s drug addiction leading to many missed concert performances — although the two would remain frequent collaborators until the latter’s death in 1993 due to complications of AIDS.
The Nuyorican musician would introduce Blades as the new singer of his orchestra, whom he had met years prior while visiting Panama during carnivals. They collaborated briefly on Colón’s 1975 LP “The Good, the Bad, the Ugly,” cementing their partnership in the 1977 album “Metiendo Mano,” which delved into socio-political themes, notably in their track “Pablo Pueblo,” which shares the story of a working class man with broken dreams halted by toils of daily life. Other tracks like “Plantación Adentro,” detailed the story of Camilo Manrique, a fictionalized enslaved character who died at the hands of a Spanish colonizer in 1745.
Many considered this album Colón’s first foray into intellectual salsa — in large part because of Blades, who had a knack for storytelling and political interests (he unsuccessfully ran for president of Panama in 1994) — that addressed colonialism and class disparities. Together they released three albums, including their 1978 “Siembra,” one of the bestselling salsa albums at that time; from the start, their track “Plastico” fused the popular disco music of the moment while addressing superficial beauty standards and colorism in Latin America.
According to 1996 reporting by The Times, “Siembra” delivered pulsating salsa rhythms that “carried messages of freedom at a time when most of Latin America was oppressed by military dictatorships.”
By 1982, Blades and Colón parted ways, but they collaborated again on projects like their 2005 LP “Tras La Tormenta” — which led the bandleader to sing for the first time in his career, “I had to start from zero, and it took me many years to feel comfortable,” Colón said.
This newfound independence gave rise to some of Colón’s most famous songs, including his 1995 track “Talento de Televisión,” an upbeat song with his signature trombone wailing in the backdrop as he sang about an attractive woman with a lack of talent.
Many across Latin America might be familiar with his 1989 song “El Gran Varon” — which narrated the story of a trans woman who is rejected by her father and presumably dies of AIDS — a landmark salsa song that brought awareness to LGBTQ+ themes during the AIDS crisis. Colón would later serve as a member of the Latino Commission on AIDS. “El Gran Varon” is an anthem to this day.
Colón released more than 40 albums in all.
He also acted, taking roles in films including 1982’s “Vigilante,” the 1983 sports drama “The Last Fight,” as well as one-episode stints in TV shows like “Miami Vice” and “The Cosby Show.” He was even featured in Bad Bunny’s “Nuevayol” music video, cutting a slice of cake; the 31-year-old superstar pays homage to the singer in its lyrics: “Willie Colón, me dicen el malo, ey. Porque pasan los años y sigo dando palo”/ “Willie Colón, they say I’m bad, because the years come and I’m still hitting.”
In his later years, he became more involved in politics. In 1994, he unsuccessfully went up against U.S. Rep. Eliot Engel of the Bronx in the Democratic primary. He also ran as a Democrat for Public Advocate in 2001, focusing on community issues, education and AIDS awareness, but failed to gain the popular vote. In 2008, he endorsed Hillary Rodham Clinton over Barack Obama in the primary election.
On May 26, 2014, after graduating from Westchester County Police Academy, Colón was sworn in as a deputy sheriff for the Department of Public Safety, later becoming deputy lieutenant.
As President Trump took office in his first term, Colón’s politics shifted in support of the right-wing candidate, and he said he would be open to performing at his inauguration in 2017.
Billboard magazine named him one of the most influential Latino artists of all time in 2018.
Colón is survived by his wife, Julia Colón, and his four sons and grandsons.

Far-right anti-Islam march sparks counterprotests in Manchester
Hundreds of Britain First protesters faced larger antifascist crowds in a tense Manchester city centre standoff.
Manchester, United Kingdom – Chants of “send them back” echoed through a damp underpass as hundreds of far-right anti-Islam protesters prepared to march through the streets.
Union Jacks fluttered in the wind as protesters – some visibly under the influence of alcohol – chanted a series of anti-immigration slogans and derisive comments about British Prime Minister Keir Starmer.

In response to the demonstration organised by Britain First, a far-right political party that calls for mass deportation and the removal of migrants and Muslims from the UK, a counterprotest was also planned for midday on Saturday.
It formed a much larger crowd made up of antifascist protesters who gathered a few streets away, carrying antiracist banners and waving an array of flags, including the Palestinian flag.
Ruby, 20, a student from South London, took a five-hour coach ride to show her support for the counterprotest and told Al Jazeera that attending was a “no-brainer”. She asked that her surname not be published, fearing repercussions.
‘A master race’
Ruby said her grandparents, originally from Montserrat, were part of the Windrush generation – immigrants invited to the UK between 1948 and 1971 from Caribbean countries – and, despite having given so much to their adopted country, are now feeling increasingly unwelcome.
She said her grandparents had told her they were witnessing a return to the levels of racism they experienced when they came to the country in the 1950s.
It was a sentiment echoed by Llowelyn, 16, a counter-protester from Wales who said her father, who is British Guyanese, has received more verbal abuse based on his race in the past few years than at any other point.
The tension was palpable before the two marches were due to begin, with far-right agitators livestreaming to their followers as they entered the area assigned to the counterprotest.
John – a stocky, tenacious counter-protester from Wales – confronted them with arms outstretched as police officers looked on.
“They come here to cause a ruckus and make money of it online, but I come here to protect the left. These guys [far-right agitators] try and intimidate … minorities because they think they are a master race”, he told Al Jazeera.
As the Britain First march began, flanked by police and led by Paul Golding, a portly, combative far-right activist who has previously been imprisoned for religiously aggravated harassment, the celebratory mood quickly turned aggressive as they came across counter-protesters in the city centre.
“Leftie scum,” screamed one member of the Britain First crowd as they harassed three young people who staged a sit-down, forcing riot police to encircle and pull them to safety.
‘Divisive, racist positions’
The two marches finally met in an expletive-ridden crushendo as police struggled to hold ranks.
Britain First protesters prodded counter-protesters with flag poles, and some slipped through the porous police lines as they shouted anti immigration and anti-Palestine slogans.
A number of counterprotesters and bystanders expressed frustration that the police allowed the march to go ahead.
“We, as Jews and internationalists, are having to confront Britain First, the fascists who are organising on the streets, who have been permitted to market their divisive, racist, dictatorial positions on our streets,” Pia Feig, of Jewish Action for Palestine, told Al Jazeera.
Audrey, a teacher and counterprotester who was pushed away by police after being shoved by a Britain First protester, said the police always “protected” the far-right groups.
A police officer told Al Jazeera that the day required extensive planning and was a particularly difficult operation, as the two groups kept changing their planned route.
He said on condition of anonymity that handling the two conflicting protests, a rally in support of Ukraine, and managing crowds at large football fixtures held this weekend had stretched the local police force thin.

UK royals face worst crisis in generations as Epstein fallout leads to ex-prince’s arrest
Expert says family has ‘no clear route forward’ after Andrew becomes first senior royal to be arrested since the 1640s
LONDON (AP) — King Charles III’ s brother was under arrest. Police were searching two royal properties, and news commentators were endlessly discussing the details of a sex scandal with tentacles that stretched to the gates of Buckingham Palace.
So how did Britain’s royal family spend Thursday afternoon? The king sat in the front row on the first day of London Fashion Week. Queen Camilla attended a lunchtime concert, and Princess Anne visited a prison.
The decision to continue normal royal duties was more than just an example of British stoicism in the face of the monarchy’s biggest crisis in almost a century.
It was the opening act of the House of Windsor’s fight for survival as the arrest of the former prince Andrew threatens to undermine public backing for the monarchy.
After pledging to support the police investigation into his brother’s friendship with the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, the king stressed his intentions.
“My family and I will continue in our duty and service to you all,” he said in a statement signed “Charles R.,” using the abbreviation for Rex, the Latin word for king.
Biggest crisis since 1936 abdication
The simple fact that Charles made the statement showed the scale of the problem created by the arrest of the king’s 66-year-old sibling, now known as Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, who was held for 11 hours and then released under investigation, meaning he was neither charged nor exonerated.
The event was so unprecedented that commentators had to reach back to the 1640s and the arrest and execution of King Charles I during the English Civil War to find a parallel.
Mountbatten-Windsor’s arrest on suspicion of misconduct in public office is shaping up to be the monarchy’s biggest crisis since Edward VIII abdicated in 1936 to marry an American divorcee, Wallis Simpson.
That scandal weakened public support for the monarchy, which did not fully recover for 15 years. The turnaround came only after Edward’s successor, King George VI, refused to flee Britain during World War II, demonstrating his solidarity with a nation ravaged by Nazi bombs.
Even before she ascended the throne, Queen Elizabeth II followed her father’s lead and publicly pledged her life in service to Britain.
But while the impact of Edward’s abdication lingered for years, the crisis reached a crescendo in a few days. And the solution in that case was relatively simple: Edward stepped aside, and his oldest brother took his place.
By contrast, the drama surrounding Mountbatten-Windsor is ongoing, with no end in sight.
No ‘clear route forward’
The current crisis stems from revelations about the relationship between the former prince and Epstein that were uncovered when the US Justice Department released millions of pages of documents last month from its investigation into Epstein.
Police have previously cited reports that Mountbatten-Windsor sent trade information to Epstein, a wealthy investor, in 2010, when the former prince was Britain’s special envoy for international trade.
At least eight UK police forces have said they are looking into issues raised by the documents.
Compared with previous royal scandals, “this time there doesn’t seem to be any clear route forward,’’ said Ed Owens, author of “After Elizabeth: Can the Monarchy Save Itself?” “There’s no blueprint to follow” in terms of how the monarchy and associated organizations deal with the allegations.
The last time the monarchy had to manage these kinds of questions was after the death of Princess Diana, Charles’ ex-wife. Elizabeth and Charles were criticized for failing to respond to the outpouring of public grief as tens of thousands of people swarmed to Kensington Gardens to lay flowers outside the late princess’ home. Some even called for Charles to step aside as heir to the throne in favor of his son William.
The queen later commissioned focus groups to better understand the public mood and determine why people felt so strongly about a person they never met. The crisis forced the royals to recognize that Diana’s common touch had connected with people in ways that had not yet occurred to the House of Windsor.
Those lessons have since inspired other royals, including Diana’s sons, Princes William and Harry, to be more informal and approachable.
But this moment is different, in part because it is taking place in a rapidly changing media environment at a time when people are demanding transparency from their leaders.
Family could face uncomfortable questions
Moving forward also means facing uncomfortable questions about what the institution — and the family members themselves — may have known about Mountbatten-Windsor’s activities. The palace has sought to draw a bold line separating the former prince and the rest of the monarchy by stripping him of his titles, including the right to be called a prince.
In another blow for the former prince, the British government is considering formally removing him from the line of succession to the crown. Despite losing his status and his honors, Andrew remains eighth in line to the throne. That can only be changed with legislation.
Charles is the first monarch “that has to meet our expectations of figures in public life, which is to be accountable and to explain yourself,” said Craig Prescott, a royal expert at Royal Holloway, University of London. “And you always have to work to earn the support of the public. And that is a particular challenge when you’re facing a controversy such as Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor.”
Critics argue that the monarchy was slow to respond to the pressure, given that Mountbatten-Windsor’s links to Epstein have been discussed for more than a decade.
The best outcome for the monarchy is for the police investigation to focus solely on the information in the Epstein files and how that relates to Mountbatten-Windsor, said Peter Hunt, a former BBC royal correspondent. The worst outcome would be if police expand their inquiries to what the broader institution might have known and when.
“Were questions raised about his behavior as a trade envoy over those 10 years? Were they answered? What did people do about them?’’ Hunt said on the BBC.
And perhaps there’s more to learn.
“Will there be files?’’ he asked.
If so, we have a request.

What is the rules-based order and is Trump really threatening it?
Unknown
Unknown Publisher
2026-02-21
19:36:46 UTC
04:36:46 KST

When German Chancellor Friedrich Merz declared that the rules-based international order "no longer exists", he joined a growing chorus of global leaders issuing similar warnings.
In his opening speech at the Munich Security Conference last weekend, Merz told other world leaders that "our freedom is not guaranteed" and the world had returned to an era of "big power politics".
His remarks echoed those of Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, who weeks earlier told the World Economic Forum in Davos that the world was in the "midst of a rupture, not a transition".
Carney warned that middle powers, such as Australia and Canada, needed to work more closely together because "if we’re not at the table, we’re on the menu".
"Stop invoking rules-based international order as though it still functions as advertised. Call it what it is — a system of intensifying great power rivalry, where the most powerful pursue their interests, using economic integration as coercion," Carney said.
While neither leader mentioned US President Donald Trump by name, both speeches came amid a widening rift between the United States and its Western allies.
Trump’s aggressive rhetoric about annexing Greenland — a territory of Denmark — along with his use of tariffs and criticism of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization alliance have shaken confidence in the post-World War Two global order.
As Trump issued a new threat to Iran this week, that a deal on nuclear must be reached within 10 days, he raised the risk he will act in disregard of the wishes of the UN Security Council, on which the US is a permanent member.
SBS News spoke with two geopolitical experts who had differing opinions on whether Merz and Carney accurately described the decline of the rules-based order or overstated the crisis.
What is the rules-based order and is it being challenged?
The rules-based order refers to the international system in which countries interact according to agreed rules, norms and multilateral institutions rather than through force or coercion.
Established after World War Two and led by the United States, the system promotes free trade, security cooperation and sovereignty of states.
Tom Chodor, a senior lecturer in politics and international relations at Monash University, told SBS News the US has historically underpinned the system through what he described as a "hegemonic approach".
"Hegemony is a basis for a rules-based order, because you need one state that's more powerful than everyone else but willing to compromise and to offer concessions," he said.
While authoritarian states have long challenged the system, most notably by the Eastern Bloc during the Cold War, Chodor argues it is now the US that is upending the order.
"It's imposing its will on other countries and not offering them much in return if they agree to do what the US wants them to do," he said.
Trump has pulled out of dozens of international organisations and agreements, questioned the purpose of the United Nations and set up a US-led Board of Peace to implement a peace plan for Gaza.
The US has also expanded its military presence near the Middle East in recent weeks, raising the prospect of new strikes on Iran, following last year's attack on Iranian nuclear facilities — an action some experts argued breached international law.
Australian National University professor Donald Rothwell said Trump was not authorised by the UN to attack Iran last year, therefore violating its charter, and also acting in violation of the clause on the right to self-defence.
Russia's invasion of Ukraine has also challenged the core principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity of the rules-based order.
Meanwhile, the rise of China and its expanding global influence have disrupted the post–Cold War era in which the US stood as the sole superpower.
Although middle powers could attempt to uphold the rules-based order without the US, Chodor said that it becomes far more difficult when major powers actively undermine those efforts.
He cited a proposed International Maritime Organization plan that would have required shipping companies to pay a levy on carbon dioxide emissions.
While most countries backed the regulation, a final vote scheduled last October was postponed for a year amid US pressure, including threats of tariffs, sanctions and visa restrictions against countries that supported the measures.
"You can negotiate nice rules amongst yourselves, but if the most powerful country attacks those rules ... that system you negotiate can’t function," Chodor said.
Chodor said Australia was particularly exposed to a "shakedown" from the US through security arrangements such as AUKUS, which will see Australia acquire nuclear-powered attack submarines through the trilateral partnership with the US and United Kingdom.
"If the US suddenly decides that they want us to pay $15 billion into the shipping industry ... we really don't have an option but to say yes, because without that, our capacity to project force collapses," he said.
He said the alliance also meant Australia was less likely to speak out against the US when it undermined the rules-based order, damaging Australia's credibility with other countries.
'More robust, more enduring'
Not everyone agrees that the system is in terminal decline.
Dr John Blaxland, professor of international security and intelligence studies and director of the Australian National University’s North America Liaison Office, told SBS News the rules-based order was more robust than it was credited for.
He said countries continued to follow rules governing trade resolution, international transactions and maritime regulation.
"These are things you can mock, you can say 'it's all over'," he said.
"They're still functioning .... we all have a vested interest in that continuing, even the United States.
"The rules-based order is, in fact, more robust, more enduring, more profound than people are prepared to give acknowledgement to."
Unless there was a global conflict, Blaxland believed it was unlikely that a fully fractured multi-polar world would emerge, noting that countries are more interconnected than ever before.
He noted China's rise, a counter-weight to US dominance, had occurred during the era of globalisation and was underpinned by the rules-based order.
"It has been a huge beneficiary of that order, and has shown no signs of wanting to destroy it," he said.
A day after Merz’s speech, Blaxland noted US secretary of state Marco Rubio's address to the Munich conference struck a far more conciliatory tone towards Europe than Trump’s earlier rhetoric.
Rubio said Europe and the US "belong together", reassuring allies it was "neither our goal nor our wish" to end the transatlantic partnership.
"We do not need to abandon the system of international cooperation we authored, and we don't need to dismantle the global institutions of the old order that together we built. But these must be reformed. These must be rebuilt," Rubio said.
Blaxland described the speech as a "circuit breaker" and could signal the repairing of US and European relations.

Merz says will travel to US with EU’s agreed position to discuss tariffs

BERLIN, February 21. /TASS/. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has announced his plans to travel to Washington to discuss with US President Donald Trump the situation around US tariffs.
"This is an interesting decision that many had been expecting: the Supreme Court in Washington has pointed out the limits of the administration's powers in matters of customs policy," Merz said in an interview with ARD television after the Christian Democratic Union convention in Stuttgart. He clarified that the verdict does not concern sectoral duties, but rather the general tariff rate.
According to Merz, his talks with the US president will be preceded by consultations with the European Union to elaborate "an absolutely clear European position." "Customs policy is the European Union’s competence, not of its individual member states. I will travel to Washington with an agreed European position," he stated.
"First and foremost, these (tariffs - TASS) harm the country that imposes them," he emphasized. Germany, in his words, is also feeling the strain, as it is supplying fewer goods. "But in the end, it is consumers in the US who will have to pay more," Merz explained, calling the US court's verdict positive news. "The separation of powers in the US still seems to be functioning, and that is good news."
According to the Bild newspaper, the German chancellor will visit the United States in early March. His meeting with President Donald Trump is scheduled for March 3.
he US Supreme Court on Friday ruled that the US president had exceeded his authority by imposing tariffs on other countries under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). However, the highest court did not clarify whether the US should refund the money previously paid as tariffs. Following the court verdict, Trump signed an executive order imposing 10% tariffs on imports from all countries. The tariffs will take effect on February 24 and remain in force for 150 days.

Far Left protest planned against Buchenwald Memorial on Liberation Day

A planned far-left protest against the Buchenwald concentration camp memorial on the anniversary of its liberation has sparked outrage across Germany, with officials denouncing the move as an affront to the memory of Holocaust victims.
According to a report in the German Bild, citing Switzerland's Neue Zürcher Zeitung, radical organizations are calling for demonstrations on April 11, the day the camp was liberated in 1945. The groups accuse the memorial's management of "spreading Israeli propaganda" and of not being "hostile enough toward Israel."
The protest is being organized under the slogan "Keffiyehs in Buchenwald." Among those involved are the student wing of Germany's Left Party (Die Linke), the anti-Israel group Jewish Voice for a Just Peace in the Middle East and the German Communist Party (DKP).
In statements published by the organizers, the Buchenwald memorial site is accused of promoting "historical revisionism and genocide denial" and of serving as a vehicle for advancing an alleged "Israeli narrative."
The controversy follows an incident last year in which a woman seeking to stage a protest at the site while wearing a keffiyeh, a scarf widely associated with Palestinian nationalism, was denied entry. A German court later upheld the decision. The protest organizers claim the memorial's management is effectively criminalizing pro-Palestinian activists.
According to the report, one of the leading activists behind the campaign belongs to a communist organization that previously expressed public support for the October 7 massacre carried out by Hamas. In a statement issued after the attack, the group described it as a "legitimate uprising by all means necessary."
The remarks triggered widespread public anger in Germany, particularly given Buchenwald's central place in the country's culture of remembrance. Tens of thousands of Jews were murdered at the camp during the Holocaust, making it one of the most significant symbols of Nazi atrocities.
Felix Klein, the German government's commissioner for combating antisemitism, sharply condemned the initiative, calling it "a new low in the reversal of roles between victim and perpetrator." He described the planned demonstration as "a frontal assault on the dignity of commemoration and on the memory of the victims of the Holocaust."
The Buchenwald Memorial Foundation also voiced concern over what it called an attempt "to exploit the memory of the camp for contemporary political purposes," stressing that the site is committed to preserving historical memory and opposing all forms of antisemitism or incitement.

Trump to hike global tariffs to 15% from 10%, 'effective immediately'

President Donald Trump on Saturday said he would increase global tariffs to 15% from 10%, one day after the Supreme Court struck down a broad swath of the president's trade agenda.
In a Truth Social post, Trump said the new tariffs will be "effective immediately." He also warned that additional levies would follow.
"I, as President of the United States of America, will be, effective immediately, raising the 10% Worldwide Tariff on Countries, many of which have been "ripping" the U.S. off for decades, without retribution (until I came along!), to the fully allowed, and legally tested, 15% level," he wrote.
"During the next short number of months, the Trump Administration will determine and issue the new and legally permissible Tariffs," he added.
Trump's announcement claimed that the new tariffs will take effect without delay, but it is unclear if any official documents have been signed detailing the timing. A White House fact sheet issued Friday said the original 10% tariffs would go into effect on Tuesday, Feb. 24, at 12:01 a.m. ET.
The White House did not immediately respond to a CNBC request for clarification.
Trump, who is scheduled to deliver his State of the Union address to Congress on Tuesday, was dealt a blow Friday when the Supreme Court decided in a 6-3 tariff ruling that the president wrongfully invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to implement his levies.
On Friday, Trump responded hours after the ruling with a 10% global tariff that he invoked under Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974. The statute allows the president to impose temporary levies for 150 days. Any extension requires congressional approval.
The president was scathing in his remarks against the Supreme Court decision, calling the ruling "ridiculous, poorly written, and extraordinarily anti-American" in a social media post.
He also attacked Justices Neil Gorsuch and Amy Coney Barrett after they voted with the majority in the ruling.
Congressional Democrats rejoiced following the decision, with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., saying in a statement that the tariffs were "chaotic and illegal." Tariffs and the broader economy are expected to be key issues for the Democrats on the campaign trail for this year's midterm elections in November.
Republicans were more divided on the issue. Some slammed the Supreme Court for its decision, while others argued that Congress has the constitutional authority to implement levies.
On Friday, stocks rallied initially following the Supreme Court decision, before pulling back and then recovering again. Investors expect the ruling could allay tensions between the U.S. and its trading partners, and possibly refund affected companies and reduce inflation.
How the U.S. government will proceed with refunds remains a question. By one estimate, the U.S. government could owe more than $175 billion in refunds to importers following the Supreme Court decision.

FIFA chief’s Board of Peace appearance doesn’t breach political neutrality rules — IOC
Gianni Infantino, who has repeatedly met with Trump, is working on soccer-based ‘sport recovery investment program in Gaza’ that keeps with Olympic mission, says Games’ global body
MILAN, Italy (Reuters) — FIFA president Gianni Infantino’s presence at the inaugural meeting of The Board of Peace this week alongside United States President Donald Trump and other heads of state does not violate any Olympic Charter rules on political neutrality, the International Olympic Committee said on Saturday.
The boss of global soccer’s governing body, who is also an IOC member, took part in Thursday’s meeting of the Board of Peace, which is focusing on reconstruction work in Gaza and aims to rebuild the territory once Hamas disarms.
“The IOC has been in contact with FIFA,” an IOC spokesperson said. “We understand that FIFA is supporting, through football, a comprehensive sport recovery investment program in Gaza, Palestine, by providing sporting infrastructure, education and elite development proposals.”
“This is entirely in keeping with the role of an international sport federation. The IOC, through Olympic Solidarity, which is our development vehicle, has been and continues to support sport development in the region,” the spokesperson said.
The Olympic Charter states that members must always act independently of commercial and political interests. They also cannot accept “from governments, organizations, or other parties, any mandate or instructions liable to interfere with the freedom of their action and vote,” the Charter says.
Trump’s Board of Peace has been controversial. It includes Israel but not Palestinian representatives, and Trump’s suggestion that the Board could eventually address challenges beyond Gaza has stirred anxiety that it could undermine the UN’s role as the main platform for global diplomacy and conflict resolution.
Infantino appeared on stage with several heads of state, sported a red hat with “USA” on the front and the numbers 45-47, for the two non-consecutive presidencies of Trump.
Infantino also displayed the FIFA collaboration agreement with the Board of Peace, which includes building 50 mini-pitches near schools and residential areas in Gaza, five full-size pitches across multiple districts, a state-of-the-art FIFA academy and a new 20,000-seat national stadium.
Trump has met Infantino several times, with the United States set to co-host this summer’s soccer World Cup along with Mexico and Canada.
The US President was also awarded FIFA’s inaugural peace prize in December for his efforts to promote dialogue and de-escalation in some of the world’s biggest hotspots, the soccer body said at the time.
IOC President Kirsty Coventry, elected in 2025, has not yet met Trump. The 2028 Summer Olympics are due to be held in Los Angeles.

Italian broadcaster apologizes after commentator calls to ‘avoid’ Israeli bobsleigh team
RAI Sport’s interim director says on-air remark during Winter Olympics coverage was ‘unacceptable’ and that an internal review has already been launched
Amy Spiro is a reporter and writer with The Times of Israel
Israel’s Olympic bobsleigh team has once again found itself in the center of controversy, following remarks made by an Italian commentator on the RAI public broadcaster during competition on Saturday.
The comments were followed by an immediate apology from RAI’s executives and a promise to fully investigate the incident, less than a week after a similar incident with Swiss commentators garnered intensive media coverage.
In the off-camera comment ahead of Saturday’s four-man bobsleigh event in Cortina, an Italian commentator said: “Let’s avoid crew 21, which is Israeli.” It is not clear if the remark was a “hot mic” comment not meant to air, or if the commentator intended to say it during the live broadcast.
Shortly after the comments aired, Marco Lollobrigida, the interim director of RAI Sport, issued a statement apologizing and promising to investigate the incident.
“The off-air remark that was broadcast before the four-man bobsleigh race at the Milano Cortina 2026 Winter Olympics on RAI 2 contained an unacceptable expression that in no way represents the values of public service broadcasting or of RAI Sport,” said Lollobrigida. “On behalf of the directorate, I extend sincere apologies to the Israeli athletes, the delegation, and all viewers. Immediate internal reviews have been launched to determine responsibility. Sport must unite, not divide.”
Lollobrigida only just took over the role, after the previous RAI Sport director, Paolo Petrecca, resigned on Thursday following his gaffe-ridden commentary of the Olympic opening ceremony, in which he misidentified a number of public figures and made racially insensitive comments about several athletes.
Giampaolo Rossi, the managing director of RAI, also issued an apology on Saturday, saying that the incident during the bobsleigh commentary runs “contrary to the principles of impartiality, respect and inclusion that must characterize public service broadcasting,” adding that a probe will be “aimed at initiating disciplinary proceedings.”
Last week, during the Israel team’s run in the two-man bobsleigh event, a Swiss commentator came under fire after he used the entirety of the team’s run to berate captain AJ Edelman’s support of Zionism and Israel, and question if he should have been allowed to compete at the Olympics at all.
Swiss broadcaster RTS later pulled the clip from its digital platforms, saying that while the commentary was “factual,” its “length” was not appropriate for a sporting event.
On Wednesday, the Olympic Committee of Israel demanded RTS issue an apology and consider removing the commentator, Stefan Renna, from future broadcasts.
In response to a request for comment from The Times of Israel, a spokesperson for RTS said that “in the interest of journalistic rigor, we will clarify with our editorial teams the appropriate format for sports commentary. We regret that this episode may have caused offense.”
Ahead of Saturday’s runs, Edelman wrote on X: “In case there are any Swiss commentators waiting for their opportunity today — anything you quote me as saying about Zionism or how just Israel is, I’m proud I said. Thank you for spreading the message.”
The Winter Olympics will wrap up on Sunday with only a few events left to be contested, including the decisive heats in the four-man bobsleigh event.
Following Saturday’s first two heats, Israel is in 24th place out of the 27 teams, after three of them crashed mid-course and did not finish the race. Only the top 20 teams will advance to the fourth heat.
Israeli skier Barnabas Szollos will represent Israel as its flag-bearer during Sunday night’s closing ceremony, accompanied by the bobsleigh team’s athletes.

Berlin Film Festival closes after being beset by ‘stormy seas’ of Gaza war
Weeks-long Berlinale marred with angry open letters from film figures, cancellations over festival jury’s president Wim Wenders’ comments that event ‘cannot’ wade into politics
BERLIN — The 76th Berlin Film Festival drew to a close Saturday night, after 10 days of what its director called “stormy seas” unleashed by a controversy over the war in Gaza, which often overshadowed discussion of the 22 films in competition.
The row erupted at the beginning of the festival when jury president Wim Wenders answered a question about the German government’s support for Israel by saying: “We cannot really enter the field of politics.”
At the same press conference, he had said that films had the power to “change the world” but in a different way from politics. But his comments in response to the question on Israel prompted a storm of outrage.
Award-winning Indian novelist Arundhati Roy, who had been due to present a restored version of a 1989 film she wrote, pulled out of the event, branding Wenders’ words “unconscionable” and “jaw-dropping.”
On Tuesday, an open letter signed by dozens of film industry figures, including actors Javier Bardem and Tilda Swinton and director Adam McKay, condemned the Berlin festival’s “silence” on the “genocide of Palestinians,” and accused it of being involved in “censoring” artists who oppose Israel’s actions.
Israel bitterly denies allegations of genocide. It has said it seeks to minimize civilian fatalities and stresses that Hamas uses Gaza’s civilians as human shields, fighting from civilian areas, including homes, hospitals, schools, and mosques.
Director Tricia Tuttle, in her second year at the helm of the Berlinale, has firmly rejected the accusations, describing some of the claims in the letter as “misinformation” and “inaccurate.”
Speaking on Saturday at the awards ceremony for prizes from the festival’s Independent Juries, Tuttle described the past 10 days as “stormy seas.”
Mexican director Fernando Eimbcke, whose film “Moscas” (Flies) is in official competition, used the occasion to protest civilian deaths in Gaza as well as US President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown.
“More than 17,000 kids have been killed in Gaza in the last two years,” he said, citing Hamas health ministry data, which is unable to be verified and does not differentiate between combatants and civilians.
“I should raise my voice and I ask all the governments and organizations to raise their voices too,” he said.
He also referenced the arrest of a five-year-old Ecuadorian boy by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), which sparked widespread outrage.
“ICE should stop persecuting and terrifying kids like Liam Conejo Ramos — ICE out!” Eimbcke said.
Later on Saturday, prizes will be awarded by the main International Jury, including the coveted Golden Bear for best film.
Among the standout entries in the official competition was “We Are All Strangers” by Anthony Chen.
Set in Chen’s native Singapore, the film is a moving family drama which playfully satirizes the yawning social disparities to be found in the city-state’s glittering skyscrapers.
German actress Sandra Hueller, who gained international acclaim for her roles in “The Zone of Interest” and “Anatomy of a Fall”, received audience plaudits for her turn as the title character in “Rose” by Austrian director Markus Schleinzer.
The black-and-white drama tells the story of a woman passing herself off as a man in rural 17th-century Germany to escape the constraints of patriarchy.
Repression in Iran
Juliette Binoche, playing a woman caring for her mother with dementia, also moved cinema-goers in “Queen at Sea” by American director Lance Hammer, who had not made a feature film since 2008.
The film sensitively portrays the devastation Alzheimer’s disease inflicts on a patient’s loved ones.
The first major event of the film calendar also provided a platform for Iranian filmmakers to address the deadly crackdown on anti-government protests in their home country.
Director Mahnaz Mohammadi, who has spent time in Tehran’s notorious Evin prison, presented “Roya,” a searing portrayal of conditions in the jail and the traces they leave on prisoners’ psyches.
Dissident director Jafar Panahi, who won the Cannes Palme d’Or for “It Was Just An Accident,” also spoke at the Berlinale to denounce the Iranian government’s repression of protestors, which international organizations say has left thousands, or tens of thousands, dead.
“An unbelievable crime has happened. Mass murder has happened. People are not even allowed to mourn their loved ones,” Panahi told a talk organized as part of the festival.
“People do not want violence. They avoid violence. It is the regime that forces violence upon them,” Panahi said.
In December, he was sentenced to one year in prison and a travel ban in Iran, but has expressed his intention to return nevertheless.

Airlines waive change fees ahead of another monster winter storm

U.S. airlines began canceling Sunday flights and waiving cancellation and change fees for airports from Virginia to Maine ahead of another massive winter storm on the East Coast, set to once again put carriers to the test at the tail-end of winter break.
Delta Air Lines, American Airlines, JetBlue Airways, United Airlines and Spirit Airlines waived fees and fare differences for passengers if they can travel as late as Feb. 26. Southwest Airlines said customers are eligible for a change without paying a difference in fare if they can rebook to fly or fly standby within two weeks.
The storm could bring between 13 and 18 inches of snow to parts of southern Connecticut and southeast New York, as well as winds of up to 55 miles per hour, according to the National Weather Service. The blizzard warning is set to begin at 6 a.m. ET Sunday.
As of 4:30 pm ET Saturday, close to 400 U.S. flights were canceled, according to FlightAware. Delta had the most, with 174 cancellations or 5% of its mainline schedule. New York airports, which make up a major Delta hub, were the most affected by Sunday's disruptions.
The National Weather Service raised its initial assessment of the potential severity of a storm. The weather service now says 1 to 2 feet (about 30 to 61 centimeters) of snow is possible in many areas. Blizzard warnings were also issued for New York City, Long Island, southern Connecticut and coastal communities in New Jersey, Delaware, Rhode Island and Massachusetts.
The weather service warned that the storm's steady winds of 25 to 35 mph (40 to 56 kph) would "make travel dangerous, if not impossible."
Winter Storm Fern in January, followed by bitter cold, caused mass travel disruptions across a large swath of the U.S.
American Airlines had struggled to recover, drawing harsh criticism from flight crews, some of whom were stranded and had to sleep at airports, heightening tension between frontline employees and the company's CEO, Robert Isom.
The storm cost American between $150 million and $200 million in revenue, the carrier said last month on an earnings call.

Iran university students hold anti-regime rallies at campuses in Tehran, Mashhad
Head of top Tehran engineering school calls for criminals to be ‘dealt with’ after Basij officers reportedly clash with students, who greet them with calls of ‘death’ to Khamenei
Iranian students chanted anti-government slogans at rallies for people killed in the regime’s bloody crackdown on protesters last month, local and diaspora media reported Saturday, as groups opposed to the clerical leadership faced off with its supporters and security forces.
Videos geolocated by AFP to Tehran’s top engineering university showed fights breaking out in a crowd as people shouted “bi sharaf,” or “disgraceful” in Farsi.
Footage posted by the Persian-language dissident TV channel Iran International, which is based outside the country, also showed a large crowd chanting anti-government slogans at Sharif University of Technology.
According to Iran International, protesters clashed with members of the regime’s Basij paramilitary force, chanting “death” to Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and “long live the king,” referring to the monarchy toppled in Iran’s 1979 Islamic Revolution.
Local news outlet Fars said that what was supposed to be a “silent and peaceful sit-in” of students killed last month was disrupted by people chanting anti-regime slogans. A video posted by Fars showed a group chanting and waving Iranian flags facing off with a crowd wearing masks and being held back by men in suits. Both groups were holding what appeared to be memorial photographs.
Iran International quoted Sharif University President Masoud Tajrishi calling for perpetrators of “illegal acts” to be “dealt with.”

“The enemy wants the university to become virtual, but we will not allow it,” Tajrishi was quoted as saying. “We want to show that we can manage the university. Anyone who carries out illegal acts at the university must be dealt with.”
Meanwhile, students at Tehran’s Beheshti University held a sit-in in solidarity with the people slain or imprisoned during the regime’s protest crackdown, according to a statement by the student union cited by Iran International.
And in the city’s Amirkabir University of Technology, demonstrators yelled “long live the king,” according to footage published by the outlet, which cited the student union later saying that security forces blocked the school’s exit and detained students.

— ايران اينترنشنال (@IranIntl) February 21, 2026
Other footage published by Iran International showed students at Mashhad University of Medical Sciences chanting “freedom.”
Iranians reprised their protest slogans this week to mark 40 days — the traditional Shiite mourning period — since the killing of thousands of protesters in a crackdown that peaked on January 8 and 9.
The unrest first broke out in December over prolonged financial strain, but exploded into mass anti-government demonstrations.

The death toll from the protests cannot be verified.
The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) has recorded more than 7,000 killings in the crackdown, the vast majority protesters, though the toll may be far higher.
Iran International itself has put the death toll at over 36,000.
Iranian authorities, who have undercounted deaths in previous rounds of unrest suppressed by the regime, acknowledge more than 3,000 deaths, but say the violence was caused by “terrorist acts” fueled by Iran’s enemies.
The demonstrations came as Iran’s authorities are under pressure to make a deal on the country’s nuclear program with the United States, which has amassed forces within striking distance.
US President Donald Trump has repeatedly threatened military action against Iran, first over its protest crackdown last month and more recently over its failure to rein in its nuclear program.
“World powers are lining up to force us to bow our heads… but we will not bow our heads despite all the problems that they are creating for us,” Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian declared Saturday in a speech carried live by state TV.

Five key takeaways from the Supreme Court's landmark decision against Trump's tariffs
Unknown

23:44:42 KST

The Supreme Court's decision Friday to throw out a large number of tariffs that President Donald Trump imposed on imports was widely expected. What's far less certain is the longer-run impacts as the economy and markets again adjust to a changed landscape.
Trump and other White House officials have promised to employ other authorities to implement the tariffs, with the president already announcing a 10% levy under a section of the Trade Act of 1974.
However, other questions remain: What will be the impact on prices? Will companies that paid the tariffs covered in the high court's decision seek refunds? How will the Federal Reserve react?
Here are five takeaways from the ruling and the associated fallout.
1. The economic impact
In a word, the macro reverberations are expected to be limited, especially pending Trump's next moves and what happens with the refunds issue.
RSM chief economist Joseph Brusuelas characterized the likely economic fallout as "narrow," though there are "enormous potential winners from this ruling," particularly in the tariff-sensitive retail and manufacturing sectors.
Growth slowed substantially in the fourth quarter, with GDP accelerating at just a 1.4% annualized rate. But that was largely due to the government shutdown, with faster growth likely in the first quarter of 2026.
"Fiscal conditions already point to a sizable positive impulse in 2026, driven by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act and an easing monetary policy backdrop," said Jason Pride, chief of investment strategy and research at Glenmede. "The tariff ruling may incrementally enhance this stimulus, reinforcing expectations for above-trend economic growth."
Pride warned that there could be a temporary drag on exports if companies rush to import products ahead of Trump's next tariff moves, as they did in early 2025.
2. Some help for inflation
The court decision came the same day that the Commerce Department reported core inflation ran at a 3% annual rate in December, according to the Fed's primary forecasting gauge. Central bank officials have estimated that tariffs are worth about half a percentage point to inflation, an impact that will be only temporary at least as it figures into the way inflation is calculated.
So losing the tariffs reduces, for now, a potential economic headwind that could figure into the Fed's decisions on interest rates this year.
Interestingly, markets on Friday rolled back their bets on rate cuts a bit, now placing a higher likelihood of the next reduction coming in July rather than June, as previously indicated, according to CME Group data. Traders still largely expect two cuts this year, with about 40% odds of a third — little changed from before the decision.
"We think that the Supreme Court's decision to strike down IEEPA tariffs will not have major macro implications for the U.S. economy or the Fed," Evercore ISI analysts said in a note.
3. Relief for the market
For much of the past year, Trump's more severe tariff declarations have periodically sent financial markets reeling — then spinning back higher after he ultimately backed off many of the most aggressive measures.
True to form, stocks rallied Friday, glossing over worries about the pace of growth and inflation, and raising hopes for corporate earnings. Treasury yields drifted higher but the move was contained as investors debated the merits of growth versus inflation.
"More broadly, the decision underscores a shift toward slower, more procedurally constrained trade policy, reducing headline volatility, but increasing the importance of fiscal mechanics and supply considerations for fixed‑income markets," said Dan Siluk, head of global short duration and liquidity and portfolio manager at Janus Henderson.
4. What about those refunds?
Wall Street reaction was mixed on the prospect for tariff refunds.
Morgan Stanley estimated that the U.S. probably would pay back about $85 billion to affected parties. RSM's Brusuelas pegged the number at between $100 billion and $130 billion, while analyst Ed Mills at Raymond James put the outlay still higher, at about $175 billion, in line with a University of Pennsylvania model.
One question is process. The Supreme Court's decision did not address the issue specifically, likely leaving it to lower jurisdictions. Justice Brett Kavanaugh noted the likelihood of a "mess" sorting out the issue. Brian Gardner, chief Washington policy strategist at Stifel, speculated that refunds won't happen retroactively at all after the issue makes its way through lower courts.
"We remain skeptical that the government will refund/pay a large sum, but, again, this issue remains unresolved," Gardner said in a note.
5. What now?
The path from here will be complicated, but Trump in a news conference Friday indicated no willingness to back down in the effort to impose tariffs, which he has repeatedly called "the most beautiful word" in the dictionary.
One important point is that it's not as if tariffs are going away.
Trump used the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to cover about 60% of the tariffs he has implemented, so the rest stand. From there, the administration can cite a number of provisions in the trade law to levy the duties.
However, he will need to go to Congress for approval on many of them, and there are also time limits attached to some of those measures.
"Given Trump's public ire against previous court rulings and tariff criticisms, we would not be surprised to see a meaningful tariff escalation/response from the White House sooner rather than later," wrote Chris Krueger, managing director at TD Cowen Washington Research Group. Krueger expects the 2026 tariff effort to be "all gas, some [temporary[ brakes ... stay tuned."

US court okays Louisiana law requiring Ten Commandments to appear in classrooms
US state’s Republican governor hails ‘comeback’ of ‘common sense’ after appeals court lifts earlier block on bill, rejecting plaintiffs’ concerns about government-endorsed religion
AP — A US appeals court has cleared the way for a Louisiana law requiring poster-sized displays of the Ten Commandments in public school classrooms to take effect.
The 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals voted 12-6 to lift a block that a lower court first placed on the law in 2024. In the opinion released Friday, the court said it was too early to make a judgment call on the constitutionality of the law.
That’s partly because it’s not yet clear how prominently schools may display the religious text, if teachers will refer to the Ten Commandments during classes or if other texts like the Mayflower Compact or the Declaration of Independence will also be displayed, the majority opinion said.
Without those sorts of details, the panel decided it did not have enough information to weigh any First Amendment issues that might arise from the law. In other words, there aren’t enough facts available to “permit judicial judgment rather than speculation,” the majority wrote in the opinion.
In a concurring opinion, Circuit Judge James Ho, an appointee of Republican US President Donald Trump, wrote that the law “is not just constitutional — it affirms our nation’s highest and most noble traditions.”
The six judges who voted against the decision wrote a series of dissents, with some arguing that the law exposes children to government-endorsed religion in a place where they are required to be, presenting a clear constitutional burden.
Circuit Judge James L. Dennis, an appointee of Democratic US president Bill Clinton, wrote that the law “is precisely the kind of establishment the Framers anticipated and sought to prevent.”
The ruling is the result of the court’s choice to rehear the case with all judges present after three of them ruled in June that the Louisiana law was unconstitutional.
The reversal comes from one of the nation’s most conservative appeals courts, and one that’s known for propelling Republican policies to a similarly conservative US Supreme Court.
Republican Governor Jeff Landry celebrated the ruling Friday, declaring, “Common sense is making a comeback!”
The ACLU of Louisiana, one of several groups representing plaintiffs, pledged to explore all legal pathways to continue fighting the law.
Arkansas has a similar law that has been challenged in federal court. And a Texas law took effect on September 1, marking the widest-reaching attempt in the nation to hang the Ten Commandments in public schools.
Some Texas school districts were barred from posting them after federal judges issued injunctions in two cases challenging the law, but they have already gone up in many classrooms across the state as districts paid to have the posters printed themselves or accepted donations.
The laws are among pushes by Republicans, including Trump, to incorporate religion into public school classrooms. Critics say it violates the separation of church and state, while backers say the Ten Commandments are historical and part of the foundation of US law.
Joseph Davis, an attorney representing Louisiana in the case, applauded the court for upholding America’s “time-honored tradition of recognizing faith in the public square.”
Families from a variety of religious backgrounds, including Christianity, Judaism and Hinduism, have challenged the laws, as have clergy members and nonreligious families.
The Freedom From Religion Foundation, another group involved in the challenge, called the ruling “extremely disappointing” and said the law will force families “into a game of constitutional whack-a-mole” where they will have to separately challenge each school district’s displays.
Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill said after the ruling that she had sent schools several correct examples of the required poster.
In 1980, the Supreme Court ruled that a similar Kentucky law violated the Establishment Clause of the US Constitution, which says Congress can “make no law respecting an establishment of religion.” The court found that the law had no secular purpose but served a plainly religious purpose.
And in 2005, the Supreme Court held that such displays in a pair of Kentucky courthouses violated the Constitution. At the same time, the court upheld a Ten Commandments marker on the grounds of the Texas state Capitol in Austin.

Few people left at Syrian detention camp that held ISIS families after thousands flee

Few people left at Syrian detention camp that held ISIS families after thousands flee
Wall Street Journal says US believes some 15,000-20,000 people departed Al-Hol amid chaotic government takeover from US-backed Kurdish forces
Fewer than 1,000 families remain at a camp where relatives of suspected Islamic State militants had been held in Syria’s northeast, the camp’s former director said this week, with thousands having fled last month as government forces seized control of the area from Kurdish-led fighters.
The Wall Street Journal reported Friday that American intelligence believes upwards of 20,000 prisoners — including individuals with ties to the Islamic State terror group — were now at large in the country.
Al-Hol, near the Iraqi border, was one of the main detention camps for relatives of suspected Islamic State fighters who were detained during the US-backed campaign against the jihadist group in Syria.
Control of the camp changed hands last month when government forces under President Ahmed al-Sharaa seized swaths of the northeast from the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, including several jails holding Islamic State fighters.
Jihan Hanna, the former director who still coordinates with international agencies and the Syrian government, told Reuters the remaining families were Syrian nationals and were being transferred to a camp in Aleppo. Most of the camp’s foreign nationals had fled, she said.
The Syrian government did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
According to the latest camp data obtained by Reuters, dated January 19 — a day before the government took control of the camp — its population was 6,639 families comprising 23,407 people, mostly Syrians and Iraqis, as well as 6,280 foreigners from more than 40 nationalities.
The Syrian government accused the SDF of withdrawing from Al–Hol on January 20 without any coordination. The SDF, in a statement that day, said its forces had been “compelled to withdraw from Al–Hol camp and redeploy to areas surrounding cities in northern Syria that are facing increasing risks and threats.”
According to a US assessment, the Syrian government’s negligence — specifically around the camp’s periphery — is largely to blame for the large number of escapes.
A Syrian government security source said most people in the camp fled that day during a five-hour period when it was unguarded, and that some had left with men who came to take their relatives to unknown destinations.
The security source and a source from a non-governmental organization working there said a section of the camp that housed its most dangerous residents, known as the annex, was empty.
The security source said the escapees had spread throughout Syria and that security authorities, working in cooperation with international partners, had established a unit to “follow up on the matter and pursue those who are wanted.”
Some have left Syria.
In Lebanon, the army has questioned more than a dozen Lebanese who crossed illegally from Syria after leaving Al–Hol, a Lebanese security source said.
The Syrian government’s Directorate of International Cooperation said on Tuesday that hundreds of people, mostly women and children, had been transferred from al–Hol to a newly prepared camp near the town of Akhtarin in northern Aleppo.
Al-Hol facility, located in Syria’s eastern desert near the Iraqi border, was established by the SDF after it took control of large parts of northeast Syria. The camp once held more than 70,000 people, including suspected Islamic State fighters’ family members.
By the end of 2025, only roughly 23,000 people remained, according to a report by the Pentagon’s Inspector General. A diplomat told The Journal earlier this week that there were now some 300 to 400 families still there.
Security analysts have long warned that the camp risked further radicalization of detainees. A report to the US Congress found that those who fled the camp are at risk of recruitment into ISIS, as they’re more vulnerable due to a lack of economic prospects upon returning home.
Intelligence from the Pentagon found that there has been a willingness within Sharaa’s government to help the US combat terror groups, The Journal reported. However, a report published on Thursday by the Department of Defense Inspector General found Damascus’s efforts were “limited by a lack of trained, qualified personnel, and the nascent state of security institutions.”
Washington has drawn close to Syria’s new authorities since the fall of Bashar al-Assad in late 2024. Yet, as fears that extremists could escape mounted, the US military relocated roughly 5,700 adult male Islamic State fighters from the Syrian network of prisons and camps to Iraq in an operation that ended last week.
A defense official told The Journal that the majority of the extremists it feared could break out have been secured.
US media reports on Wednesday claimed the US is planning to withdraw all of its 1,000 remaining troops from Syria over the next two months, ending its presence in the country.
A US official told the Journal the withdrawal will be “conditions-based,” meaning that if ISIS rebounds, troops may wind up staying in Syria.
US forces recently withdrew from some bases in Syria, including Al-Tanf and Al-Shadadi, which were used in the US-led international coalition’s fight against ISIS.

Israeli officials believe US, Iran at unbridgeable impasse as they near open conflict
Report says US might allow Tehran ‘token’ nuclear enrichment, but gaps between sides widely seen as irreconcilable; one military scenario ‘takes out the ayatollah and his son’; Congress may vote on curtailing Trump
Iran and the United States continued to slide rapidly toward military conflict at the weekend, as hopes faded for a diplomatic solution to their standoff over Tehran’s nuclear program and regional actions, officials on both sides and diplomats across the Gulf and Europe said.
Israel and Iran’s Gulf neighbors now consider a conflict to be more likely than a settlement, the sources said, with Washington building up one of its biggest military deployments in the region since the invasion of Iraq in 2003.
Israel’s government believes Tehran and Washington are at an impasse and is making preparations for possible joint military action with the United States, though no decision has been made yet on whether to carry out such an operation, said a source familiar with the planning.
It would be the second time the US and Israel have attacked Iran in less than a year, following US and Israeli airstrikes against military and nuclear facilities last June.
Regional officials say oil-producing Gulf countries are preparing for a possible military confrontation that they fear could spin out of control and destabilize the Middle East.
Two Israeli officials told Reuters they believe the gaps between Washington and Tehran are unbridgeable and that the chances of a near‑term military escalation are high.
Some regional officials said Tehran was dangerously miscalculating by holding out for concessions, with US President Donald Trump boxed in by his own military buildup — unable to scale it back without losing face if there is no firm commitment from Iran to abandon its nuclear weapons ambitions.
“Both sides are sticking to their guns,” said Alan Eyre, a former US diplomat and Iran specialist, adding that nothing meaningful can emerge “unless the US and Iran walk back from their red lines — which I don’t think they will.
“What Trump can’t do is assemble all this military, and then come back with a ‘so‑so’ deal and pull out the military. I think he thinks he’ll lose face,” he said. “If he attacks, it’s going to get ugly quickly.”
Two rounds of Iran-US talks have stalled on core issues, from uranium enrichment to missiles and sanctions relief.
When Omani mediators delivered an envelope from the US side containing missile‑related proposals, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi refused even to open it and returned it, a source familiar with the talks said.
After talks in Geneva on Tuesday, Araghchi said the sides had agreed on “guiding principles,” but the White House said there was still distance between them.
Iran is expected to submit a written proposal in the coming days, a US official said, and Araghchi said on Friday he expected to have a draft counterproposal ready within days.
But Trump, who has sent aircraft carriers, warships and jets to the Middle East, warned Iran on Thursday it must make a deal over its nuclear program or “really bad things” will happen.
He appeared to set a deadline of 10 to 15 days, drawing a threat from Tehran to retaliate against US bases in the region if attacked. The rising tensions have pushed up oil prices.
US officials say Trump has yet to make up his mind about using military force, although he acknowledged on Friday that he could order a limited strike to try to force Iran into a deal.
“I guess I can say I am considering that,” he told reporters.
The possible timing of an attack is unclear. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio is due to meet Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on February 28 to discuss Iran. A senior US official said it would be mid-March before all US forces were in place.
Two US officials told Reuters that US military planning on Iran had reached an advanced stage, with options including targeting individuals as part of an attack and even pursuing leadership change in Tehran, if ordered by Trump.
“Thirty-two thousand killed”
After the US and Israel bombed Iran’s nuclear facilities and some military sites last June, Trump again began threatening strikes in January as Tehran crushed widespread protests with deadly force.
Referring to the crackdown on Friday, Trump said there was a difference between the people of Iran and the country’s leadership. He asserted that “32,000 people were killed over a relatively short period of time,” figures that could not immediately be verified.
Time Magazine and opposition outlet Iran International have reported such numbers, citing information from officials in the Islamic Republic. The US-based group HRANA, which monitors the human rights situation in Iran, has so far recorded 7,114 verified deaths and says it has another 11,700 under review.
“It’s a very, very, very sad situation,” Trump said, adding that his threats to strike Iran had led the leadership to abandon plans for mass hangings weeks ago.
“They were going to hang 837 people. And I gave them the word, if you hang one person, even one person, that you’re going to be hit right then and there,” he said.
Hours after Trump’s statements on the death toll, Araghchi said that the Iranian government has already published a “comprehensive list” of all 3,117 killed in the unrest.
“If anyone doubts the accuracy of our data, please speak with evidence,” he posted on X.
Token enrichment
On Friday, a senior US official was quoted by Axios as saying the Trump administration was open to considering a proposal that would allow Iran to retain a “token” nuclear enrichment capability if Tehran’s route to an atomic bomb is fully sealed off.
The news site said that while there could be a small opening for a deal, US officials say the proposal that Iran is expected to submit in the coming days must clear a very high bar to win over skeptics in the administration and the Middle East.
“President Trump will be ready to accept a deal that would be substantive and that he can sell politically at home. If the Iranians want to prevent an attack, they should give us an offer we can’t refuse. The Iranians keep missing the window. If they play games, there won’t be a lot of patience,” the senior US official says.
Another senior Trump adviser quoted in the report stressed that the US president “hasn’t decided to strike yet. I know that because we haven’t struck. He might never do it. He might wake up tomorrow and say, ‘That’s it.'”
According to the adviser, Trump has been presented with a range of military options for Iran.
“They have something for every scenario. One scenario takes out the ayatollah and his son and the mullahs,” the adviser elaborated, referring to Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei and his son Mojtaba. “What the president chooses no one knows. I don’t think he knows.”
Another adviser said, “Trump is keeping his options open. He could decide on an attack at any moment.”
A senior US official flatly denied an unsourced report in Iran International claiming that Iran had presented a proposal during the latest round of nuclear talks in which it agreed to halt nuclear enrichment for three years and commit to not using its ballistic missiles to attack Israel.
Asked to confirm the report, the senior US official called it “completely false.”
Congressional involvement
The US Congress could vote as soon as next week on whether to block Trump’s ability to strike Iran without lawmakers’ approval.
Members of Congress, including a few of Trump’s fellow Republicans as well as Democrats, have tried — and failed — repeatedly to pass resolutions that would bar Trump from military action against foreign governments without lawmakers’ approval.
The US Constitution grants Congress, not the president, the power to send US troops to war, except for limited strikes for national security reasons. Reuters reported last week that the military is preparing for the possibility of sustained, weeks-long operations if Trump orders an attack.
Trump’s Republicans hold slim majorities in both the Senate and House and have blocked the resolutions, arguing that Congress should not restrict Trump’s national security powers.
Democratic Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia and Republican Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky filed a Senate resolution late last month to block hostilities against Iran unless explicitly authorized by a congressional declaration of war.
“If some of my colleagues support war, then they should have the guts to vote for the war, and to be held accountable by their constituents, rather than hiding under their desks,” Kaine said in a statement.
An aide to Kaine said there was no timetable yet as to when the Senate might take up the resolution.
In the House of Representatives, Republican Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Democrat Ro Khanna of California said they planned to force a vote on a similar resolution next week.
“Trump officials say there’s a 90% chance of strikes on Iran. He can’t without Congress,” Khanna said in a post on X.
The New York Times reported that hundreds of US troops had been evacuated from Al Udeid base in Qatar, citing unnamed Pentagon officials.
Troops have also been evacuated from bases in Bahrain that house the Navy’s 5th Fleet, The Times said, adding that there were no longer any American troops at bases in Iraq, Syria, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Jordan and the United Arab Emirates.
Shortly after the story was published, however, Fox News said it was false, citing an unnamed, well-placed US official. News Nation also said CENTCOM flatly denied the report.
The move would be seen as a precautionary step ahead of a potential US strike on Iran, as Tehran is likely to retaliate to such an attack by targeting US personnel in the region.
The endgame
Araghchi gave no specific timing as to when Iranians would get their counterproposal to the US, but said he believed a diplomatic deal was within reach and could be achieved “in a very short period of time.”
“What we are now talking about is how to make sure that Iran’s nuclear program, including enrichment, is peaceful and would remain peaceful forever,” he said.
He added that technical and political “confidence-building measures” would be enacted to ensure the program would remain peaceful in exchange for action on sanctions, but he gave no further details.
“The president has been clear that Iran cannot have nuclear weapons or the capacity to build them, and that they cannot enrich uranium,” the White House said when asked about Araghchi’s comments.
European and regional officials believe the scale of the US deployment to the region would enable Washington to launch strikes on Iran while simultaneously defending its military bases, allies and Israel.
The core US demand remains unchanged: no uranium enrichment on Iranian soil. Iran, for its part, says it must keep its nuclear capability and refuses to discuss its ballistic missiles. It denies planning to build a nuclear weapons arsenal.
If talks fail, defense analyst David Des Roches said, US activity in the Gulf already signals how any strike would begin: blind Iran’s air defence and then hit the Revolutionary Guards Navy, the force behind years of tanker attacks and threats to close the Strait of Hormuz, the route for a fifth of global oil.
But some Arab and European officials say they are unsure what Trump’s endgame is, and European governments want the US to spell out what strikes would be meant to achieve — to degrade Iran’s nuclear and missile capabilities, deter escalation, or pursue something more ambitious such as “regime change.”
Some regional and European officials question whether military action can alter the trajectory of Iran’s ruling establishment, led by Khamenei and protected by the powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps.
Some say that, with no obvious alternative political force in Iran and the leadership’s resilience largely intact, it is perilous to assume strikes could trigger regime change.
Military action may be easier to start than to control, and much harder to translate into a strategic outcome, they say.
