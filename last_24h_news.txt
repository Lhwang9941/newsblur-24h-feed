Breakthrough injection treatment is giving people their voices back
The new treatment uses platelet-rich plasma from the patient’s blood to rejuvenate the damaged vocal cords

A father who has struggled to speak, sing or shout since he was a small boy has received a new treatment which means he can now read a bedtime story to his son.
David Metherell, a 45-year-old critical care nurse, caught a rare strain of the human papillomavirus (HPV) when he was just nine months old that damaged his vocal cords.
He had 21 operations by the time he turned six, but these left his vocal cords scarred, leaving him with a permanent croaky voice. He explained how sometimes his voice would just suddenly stop.
"I've never been able to sing, I've never been able to shout - I've just been limited in so many ways,” he told the BBC.
But a new surgery which involves injecting platelet-rich plasma (PRP) from the patient’s blood into the vocal cords has been “liberating” and transformed his life, he said.
The new trial treatment at the ear, nose and throat (ENT) clinic at Guy's Hospital is already used by NHS clinics for patients with injured knees or tendons to stimulate the healing process, but it has never been used in this way before.
Mr Metherell’s consultant, Shiying Hey, and her team have treated 10 patients so far, and they have all reported an improvement in their voice. She explained that it is cheaper than other treatments as they can use the patient’s own blood.
After three injections, the treatment has given Mr Metherall the ability to speak in busy social or work situations.
Previous studies have shown PRP injections to work within two years. One 2025 study published in the Journal of Voice gave 109 injections to 48 participants with damaged vocal cords between 2021 and 2023.
One month after the last PRP injection, more than 70 per cent of participants reported a “moderate or significant vocal improvement”. When researchers observed their vocal cords, they found an improvement in more than two-thirds of participants.
Other experimental technology to aid speech uses AI. The University of Cambridge created Revoice, a technology which could cut out the need for invasive brain implants and enables patients to communicate naturally.
Revoice combines sensors and artificial intelligence to decode speech signals and emotional cues in patients to deliver words and complete sentences.
The device is worn as a soft and flexible choker around the neck, picking up the patient’s heart rate and tiny vibrations from throat muscles. These signals are then turned into words.
In a small trial with five patients with dysarthria, which is difficulty speaking that can happen after a stroke, the device was correct in all examples except 4.2 per cent of words and 2.9 per cent of sentences.
Current technology to aid speech can be more time-consuming, requiring the patient to input letters one by one or relying on eye tracking or brain implants.

The best stylist-approved supermarket fashion, from George to F&F

The best stylist-approved supermarket fashion, from George to F&F
From Asda to Sainsburys and Tesco, these in-house brands are rivalling Mango and Zara
- Bookmark
Allow me to let you in on a stylist's secret: the best affordable fashion out there right now hails from the same place you buy your eggs and bread. Supermarkets are going from strength to strength with their in-house clothing lines, offering trend-led pieces that cost the same as a nice bottle of wine.
The F&F clothing line at Tesco and George at Asda are among the UK’s top 10 clothing retailers – and are even more popular than Zara and Asos. Then there’s Tu at Sainsbury’s, which has garnered nearly 22 million views on TikTok and often appears in fashion segments on This Morning.
Whether it’s a Ganni-inspired leopard print coat, faux suede loafers that look just like Kate Middleton’s pair or a trench coat that look four times their price, supermarkets are dipping into trends and tempting customers away from the dairy aisle. With jeans and cardigans for just £20, skirts for £14, coats for £40 and shoes for £18, think of supermarket fashion as the grown-up sister to Primark.
“The main difference between now and a few years ago is that a lot of the pieces online at F&F, TU and George are on par with what’s on offer on the high street,” Harriet Davey, fashion editor, writer and freelance stylist on ITV’s This Morning, says. “If you were to show me the technical jackets at F&F, the barrel-leg jeans at Tu or rugby shirts at George and tell me they were Zara or Mango, it would be tricky to tell the difference.”
It’s safe to say I had my own reservations about supermarket clothing – particularly the quality. But a quick peruse around my local Tu section in Sainsbury’s proved me wrong. Not only did its fashion share most of the same materials as high street names – think Zara, Bershka and H&M – but its styles were more inclusive in age and size (most go up to XXL and 22 waist).
“The quality is a lot better than it used to be – the linen-blends feel premium but I still avoid the faux leather and suede as these items tend not to be as expensive-looking as other pieces” Davey advises. “When it comes to trends, the collections are being aimed at a younger age group, so people are no longer slightly ashamed to say they shop at supermarkets.” The sheer number of videos on TikTok and Instagram with fashion lovers shouting about their supermarket discoveries speaks for itself.
To help you dress for the new season ahead, I’ve rounded up the best supermarket fashion brands to shop both online and in-store, from George at Asda and Tu at Sainsbury’s. Better yet, nothing will cost you more than £50.

TU at Sainsburys
TU at Sainsburys regularly goes viral for its considered and chic clothing. Rivalling the likes of Asos and H&M for affordable everyday staples, its vast collection includes trend-leg pieces like barrel jeans and polka dot dresses, as well as timeless knitwear, basic T-shirts and vests for as little as £5 and hero outerwear for less than £40 (think trench coats and bomber jackets).
Using a blend of cotton, polyester and elastane in its clothing, TU offers the same accessible quality as much of the high street – and even has a cashmere line starting from £50.

George at Asda
“Brits will happily shout about the bargain they found on their weekly food shop and send the link to friends and followers,” Davey says. “And you only need to look at the demand for cult items like that George at Asda leopard print sell-out puffer jacket to see how true this is.” The sell-out Ganni-inspired coat put the supermarket’s in-house clothing brand firmly on the fashion map.
More recently, the brand’s “suedette” bomber jackt and cami lace top have gone viral for rivalling Zara’s sell-out styles, while its pyjama and loungewear line has amassed thousands of views on TikTok. Known for its elevated everyday staples, George’s cotton, polyester and viscose pieces help you curate a capsule wardrobe for less.

F&F at Tesco
F&F at Tesco is fast becoming a fashion editor favourite. From Toteme-inspired scarf coats and trending bubble hem jackets, to sharp tailoring for work and an essential denim range, the affordable supermarket brand is at the top of its game. Its quick to interpret runway trends into wearable, affordable clothing and the quality can be excellent.
The heavier knits and structured blazers punch above their price tag, while the linen and cotton pieces in the summer are just as good as Zara or Cos. If your preference is for neutrals, minimalist silhouettes and quiet luxury looks, F&F delivers on all fronts. Its activewear is equally worth shouting about, combining stretchy and fast-drying materials with flatteing, sculpting designs.

Metals retreat on reports Trump may soften aluminium tariffs
2026-02-13 12:14:27 GMT
http://www.euronews.com/business/2026/02/13/metals-retreat-on-reports-trump-may-soften-aluminium-tariffs

The metal fell in morning trade alongside zinc, nickel, and lead as investors digested reports the White House could ease duties ahead of November’s midterms.
Aluminium prices edged lower on Friday as a broader pullback in metals gathered pace after reports that US president Donald Trump may roll back some tariffs on metal goods.
On the London Metal Exchange, the benchmark three-month aluminium contract slipped more than 2.5% to $2,965.75 a tonne by around midday, while the most-active contract on the Shanghai Futures Exchange fell 1.76% to 23,195 yuan (€2,832) a tonne.
Several core industrial metals have also moved lower on the day. Zinc was quoted at $3,316.50 a tonne, down $51.95 (-1.54%), nickel at $16,993.38, down $257 (-1.49%) and lead at $1,972.38 or down $10.30 (-0.52%).
The decline reflects growing expectations that Washington could loosen some of the restrictions that have tightened global supply chains and driven up costs for manufacturers.
According to a report from the FT, the White House is reviewing the extensive list of goods caught by tariffs on steel and aluminium and may exempt certain products, stop further tariff expansions, and rely instead on more targeted duties.
The shift comes as the administration grapples with voter dissatisfaction over the cost of living ahead of November’s midterm elections.
Trump imposed duties of up to 50% on imported metals last summer, later extending them to a wide range of everyday items.
The policy pushed US tariffs to their highest levels since before the Second World War, but economists say the levies have fed through to consumer prices, undermining claims that foreign producers would bear the burden.
Trump has since scaled back tariffs on popular food products in a bid to tame grocery price inflation for ordinary Americans and called a truce in its trade war with China after Beijing retaliated with its own tariffs.
Aluminium, in particular, sits at the heart of packaging, transport, and appliances, so even modest daily moves can quickly feed into expectations for input costs, especially if investors start to believe US tariff settings are becoming less restrictive than feared.

France detains nine in probe over alleged $15m Louvre ticket fraud

France detains nine in probe over alleged $15m Louvre ticket fraud
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
PARIS - French police arrested nine people in an investigation into a Louvre ticket fraud that may have cost the world’s most visited museum €10 million (S$15 million) in revenues, the Paris prosecutor’s office said on Feb 13.
Those in custody include two Louvre officials, several guides and one person described as the organiser of the ring, it said in a statement. Police also seized almost €1 million in cash and almost €500,000 parked in bank accounts.
The dismantling of a potential wide-scale fraud scheme adds to a spate of setbacks at the museum – including a spectacular jewel heist, a water leak that damaged ancient books, and strikes – that have put its management under intense scrutiny.
The investigation began as the Louvre flagged in December 2024 the presence of two Chinese guides who were suspected of getting groups of Chinese tourists into the museum by re-using single-entry tickets for different people.
After more than a year of checks,
The ring is suspected of having invested the proceeds in real estate in France and Dubai.
The prosecutor’s office said the ring had perpetrated the same kind of ticket fraud at the Palace of Versailles, though it did not elaborate.
“The Louvre Museum is facing a resurgence and diversification of ticket fraud,” a spokesperson told Reuters. In response, the museum’s management has drawn up a plan to prevent cheating and punish fraudsters, she said.
A Palace of Versailles spokesperson declined to comment.
In January, the Louvre raised ticket prices by 45 per cent for most non-European Union tourists to help finance renovations. REUTERS

Missing French tourist in Chad found dead ‘after a fall’

Missing French tourist in Chad found dead ‘after a fall’
The 70-year-old man had set off with a friend, also French, ‘without a guide’ to ‘explore the area’
The 70-year-old man – from the city of Dijon, according to a French newspaper report – had been missing since Wednesday.
He was part of a group visiting Chad for the International Festival of Saharan Cultures in the city of Amdjarass, about 100km (60 miles) from the Sudan border.
“We found the body in the Bachekele mountains and are waiting for the prosecutor to record the findings before any evacuation to N’Djamena,” said Abakar Rozi Teguil, who is also minister for culture, without giving further details.
The man set off with a friend, also French, “without a guide” to “explore the area” of Guelta de Bachikele, a Saharan oasis, said local government representative Mahamat Togou Tchohimi.
The two men left the group early on Wednesday “without prior authorisation” and “outside the established supervision arrangements”, Chad’s tourism ministry said in a statement on Thursday.

Why a top Goldman Sachs lawyer has been forced to resign over her Epstein emails

Why a top Goldman Sachs lawyer has been forced to resign over her Epstein emails
- Kathy Ruemmler, a top lawyer at Goldman Sachs and former White House counsel to Barack Obama, announced her resignation after emails between her and the late billionaire pedophile Jeffrey Epstein were published.
- The emails revealed a close relationship, with Ruemmler referring to Epstein as an 'older brother' and 'Uncle Jeffrey', and appearing to downplay his sex crimes.
- Ruemmler, who previously resisted resigning, confirmed she would step down as Chief Legal Officer and General Counsel of Goldman Sachs as of June 30, 2026, and has since stated she 'regrets ever knowing' Epstein.
- The files also showed Ruemmler received expensive gifts from Epstein, including luxury handbags and a fur coat, after his 2008 conviction for sex crimes.
- Her resignation follows the release of Department of Justice files on Epstein, which have also implicated other prominent figures and led to calls for further transparency from survivors.

Orban scales up 'war or peace' campaign as Hungary heads to pivotal vote

Orban scales up 'war or peace' campaign as Hungary heads to pivotal vote
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
GYONGYOS, Hungary, Feb 13 - Facing the possibility of losing power after 16 years, Prime Minister Viktor Orban has cast Hungary's election on April 12 as a stark choice between "war or peace", saying his opponents would drag the country into the war raging next door in Ukraine.
"We will decide our fate in April. What's at stake is: war or peace," Orban, leader of the nationalist Fidesz party, said on Facebook this week. "For peace, Fidesz is the safe choice."
Hungarian voters have been bombarded with letters from Orban urging them to fill out a "national petition" rejecting European Union financial aid to Ukraine, a message constantly reinforced on state television, which is firmly under government control.
Fidesz has also put up billboards nationwide that depict an obedient-looking opposition leader Peter Magyar saying "yes" as European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen demands "Money for Ukraine!" and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy asks for weapons.
Orban has long been at loggerheads with the EU over Ukraine, among many other issues. Defying Brussels, he has maintained cordial ties with Moscow, refuses to send weapons to Ukraine, and says Kyiv can never join the EU.
Magyar's centre-right Tisza party, which leads most opinion polls, says it wants Hungary to rejoin the European mainstream after years of strained relations under Orban that has seen crucial EU funds blocked.
Magyar has dismissed Orban's campaign as laughable "propaganda", but Tisza has trodden cautiously on Ukraine, saying it opposes any fast-track EU accession for Kyiv and that it would put the issue to a binding referendum if it wins power.
Ukraine needs the backing of all 27 EU nations to join.
HUNGARY'S ECONOMY IN DOLDRUMS
Political analysts link Orban's focus on the war to the state of Hungary's economy, which remains mired in stagnation after an inflationary surge triggered by Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Inflation has since subsided.
"Lacking a strong performance of the economy, Orban tries to present himself as the guarantor of stability and security, saying that if he goes, there will be chaos," said Robert Laszlo from the Budapest think-tank Political Capital.
"This has worked when it comes to strengthening Fidesz' voter base, but it is not yet clear whether he will manage to address undecided voters or lure back voters who drifted to Tisza," Laszlo added.
In the town of Gyongyos, a Fidesz stronghold some 230 km (143 miles) from the Ukraine border, some people said the war was a key concern for them.
"We should not swap stability for the uncertain choice, and especially, no one wants the war," said Szabolcs Dauka, 39.
For others, economic concerns loom larger.
"This (anti-Ukraine) campaign does not interest me, I don't agree with it... It just divides people," said Orsolya Bakos, 56, who has two children. "What matters is the future of our children... Hospitals and education are all in a shambles."
TOUGH STANCE
Orban hopes his anti-Ukraine rhetoric will resonate with voters just as his tough stance on migration has done since 2015, when he built a border fence to keep out migrants.
"Taking part in the war is very similar to migration: no jumping in and out. Once you're in, you're in," he told voters during a campaign tour.
He also repeated accusations that Kyiv and Brussels are interfering in Hungary's election, a charge both reject.
Ukraine's Foreign Ministry summoned Hungary's ambassador to Kyiv on January 28 to protest about the meddling allegations.
Asked about Orban's campaign rhetoric, the European Commission told Reuters the best way of ending the war and ensuring a lasting peace was to maintain economic pressure on Russia and admit Ukraine to the EU, once it meets the criteria.
However, public sentiment in Hungary towards Kyiv has cooled as the war drags on.
A survey published in December by Policy Solutions and Zavecz Research showed that opposition to EU aid for Ukraine had risen to 63% in 2025 from 41% in 2023, while 64% of Hungarians opposed Kyiv's EU membership.
Andras Biro-Nagy, director of Policy Solutions, a political research institute in Budapest, said Orban's comments on Ukraine might strike a chord beyond his Fidesz base.
"It puts an issue on the table on which opinions may vary even among Tisza supporters and which could also be useful for addressing undecided voters," he said.
Tisza, which is campaigning on promises to tackle corruption and revive the economy, currently has an 8-12 percentage-point lead over Fidesz among decided voters. However, pro-government pollsters show a Fidesz lead, and many voters remain undecided.
Magyar said this week voters wanted to hear about "real issues, pensions, the cost of living, people emigrating from here, pushing down inflation". REUTERS

Beware of ‘political swindlers’, China’s cadres warned ahead of leadership change
Communist Party’s anti-corruption agencies say there is still a danger of graft in the promotion process

Alcott Weiin Beijing
China’s anti-corruption watchdogs have again put cadres on notice, ordering tighter discipline and greater scrutiny of Communist Party officials in the countdown to next year’s leadership reshuffle.
Among the fresh warnings on Thursday was a caution against associating with “political swindlers”, people who fraudulently claim to have links to senior officials so they can peddle promotions for cash.
The orders were issued jointly by the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI), the National Supervisory Commission (NSC), and the party’s Organisation Department, according to state news agency Xinhua.

“Corruption and malpractice in the promotion and appointment of officials have not been eradicated, some problems pose a risk of resurgence, and some potential harm to the leadership transition has not been completely eliminated,” the notice said.
The Central Committee, the party’s highest political executive body, is expected to end its five-year term when its roughly 370 full and alternate members meet at their national congress in autumn 2027.

CNN anchor praises rare moment of solidarity from Karoline Leavitt
CNN reporter Kaitlan Collins recalled the moment Karoline Leavitt defended her during Donald Trump’s visit to Saudi Arabia.
Speaking to the Absolutely Not podcast, the broadcaster recounted a 2025 trip to Saudi Arabia where the Saudi Royal Guard "freaked out" after she shouted a question at the president and tried to stop her from entering the next press event.
She recalled how the White House press secretary, “to her credit said no, Kaitlan's coming in with the rest of the US press.”
It comes after Trump’s repeated attacks on Ms Collins. The Republican told her, “I don’t think I’ve ever seen you smile,” when she questioned him on the Epstein files.

Italian PM Meloni visits Ethiopia and confirms her ambitions in Africa
2026-02-13 12:08:15 GMT
https://www.lemonde.fr/en/le-monde-africa/article/2026/02/13/italian-pm-meloni-visits-ethiopia-and-confirms-her-ambitions-in-africa_6750461_124.html

Two years after the first Italy-Africa summit, which was held in Rome in early 2024, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's government has continued to assert its major ambitions for the African continent. Another diplomatic meeting is set to be held in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, on Friday, February 13, followed, the next day, by a speech from the Italian leader, who will be the guest of honor at the 39th Ordinary Session of the African Union.
This latest Italy-Africa summit was announced less than a month in advance, and the Italian government has presented it as a key step in implementing its proactive strategy of cooperation with African states. Neverthless, it is expected to be relatively brief, with the proceedings beginning at 6 pm, and the number of national leaders present is as yet undetermined.
When she took office in October 2022, Meloni set out the broad strokes of her new approach, which was initially designed, as the phrase that was popular at the time put it, to "address the root causes" of migratory flows running from sub-Saharan Africa to Europe. Meloni was elected after pledging to stop migrants from arriving to Italy's shores by sea, in particular on the island of Lampedusa. Her ambition came with the promise of "peer-to-peer" and "non-predatory" relations.

‘Police dismissed my sexual assault because I was drunk – I’ve spent 15 years fighting for justice’
Nina Cresswell says she is taking a stand against ‘traumatisation after traumatisation survivors face just to try and get basic justice’ – as just 2 per cent of sexual offence reports result in convictions. She spoke to Tara Cobham about why she is not giving up the fight

Terrified, shocked and traumatised, Nina Cresswell had just managed to flee the grip of the man who she says violently sexually assaulted her when she called the police to report what happened to her.
Shaken after her ordeal, officers arrived at her home, where she expected to be listened to, for evidence to be checked for and taken, and to be assured that the force would do what it could to find her attacker.
Instead, she said her account was dismissed because she was drunk and officers failed to interview her when she was sober. Within hours, police decided not to record the attack as a crime.
That marked the start of more than 15 years of unnecessary “hell”, the 35-year-old said, as she battled through the “traumatisation after traumatisation women face just to try and get basic justice”.
Now, she is suing Northumbria Police to ensure no other survivors have to endure the same ordeal. She claims the force breached her human rights by failing to conduct a proper investigation, which meant there was “at least a substantial chance” that the outcome would have been different and that the alleged perpetrator could have faced punishment.
Ms Creswell told The Independent: “It’s so infuriating, because I’ve had to do their [the police’s] job for them – this was 15 years ago, and I’m still talking about it. If they’d just done their jobs that night, properly investigated, got evidence, done the stuff they should’ve done, then I wouldn’t have been forced to do what I had to do.
“So many women around the country are in the position I was in, or who don’t make it out alive from the attack, or who lose their lives because of the psychological torment that comes from these assaults and silencings – it makes me feel really mad.
“Even though it nearly killed me, I would do it all again because I just couldn’t not.”
Despite the police reopening their investigation twice and finding that there was not enough evidence for a realistic prospect of securing a criminal conviction, a civil High Court judge ruled in 2023 that Ms Cresswell had been “violently sexually assaulted” by William Hay, known as Billy, in the early hours of 28 May 2010, after the pair met at a nightclub in Sunderland. In a criminal conviction, the burden of proof requires a person to be guilty “beyond reasonable doubt”, but in civil cases, it is decided on the “balance of probabilities”, which is a lower threshold.
The civil ruling was part of a defamation case that Hay brought against Ms Cresswell, after she named him as her attacker online in 2020, amid the Me Too movement, in an attempt to protect other women from him.
In that case, the police log detailed Ms Cresswell’s report to officers on 28 May 2010, where she said a man “pinned her down and tried to have sex with her” before “she had to run away from him”.
The judge described Ms Cresswell’s subsequent treatment by police as “deficient” and damned their investigation as “superficial”. Mrs Justice Heather Williams said: “She was interviewed whilst she was still affected by alcohol and had not slept. She was not given the chance to check any record that officers had made of what they believed she had said... [The officers] failed to undertake the fuller investigation that was warranted and prematurely assessed and rejected her credibility, deciding not to treat the defendant’s allegation as a crime within hours of her first report to police.”
Following the High Court judgment and a further complaint by Ms Cresswell in 2023, an internal investigation by Northumbria Police completed last year, found “the original 2010 investigation fell below the standards of investigation expected in today’s policing”. It said the service provided to her was “not acceptable”, and the force apologised.
Northumbria Police also reopened Ms Cresswell’s case in 2020 after she contacted them, and this time they treated it as a criminal matter. However, following an investigation deemed “acceptable” by the force’s internal report, no further action was taken by police.
The force reopened the case again in 2023 but closed it again last year “due to evidential reasons”. “Should any new information come forward, this will be reviewed,” a spokesperson for the force said.
Ms Cresswell described how the “exhausting” ordeal has taken a severe toll on her. “I lost everything,” she said, including her house and her business due to legal costs.
“The focus ended up being less on the perpetrator and more on me – I was the defendant. It chews so many women up inside, holding the perpetrator’s shame for so many years – and knowing they could do it again. Then you get the institutional betrayal from police who are supposed to be protecting you...
“[But] this time it feels like the shoe is on the other foot – I’m the claimant.”
The January deadline for the force to respond to her legal action has now passed. A spokesperson for the force said: “This is in the process of being considered, and it would be inappropriate to comment any further.”
Ms Cresswell said she wants the force to publicly acknowledge failures made over her report of sexual assault, as well as to push for broader systemic change within the police. “That will at least be something positive from all this hell I’ve been put through,” she said. “The more people who hold the police to account publicly, the more it’s in the public eye, the more scrutiny they get, and the more they’ll be forced to change.”
Catherine Knight, senior solicitor at non-profit Good Law Project, which is supporting Ms Cresswell’s legal claim and has set up a fundraiser for her case, said: “It’s time for police forces to protect women, instead of giving them the brush off.”
Harriet Dowse-Bland, a solicitor at charity Centre for Women’s Justice, said: “Sadly, we do regularly see under-resourced police investigations that are characterised by long delays, lack of access to support services, and investigating the victim more than the suspect. If we want a legal system that genuinely protects victims and brings perpetrators of sexual offences to justice, this needs to change.”
In the year ending March 2025, 209,556 sexual offences were reported to police in England and Wales, according to the latest government figures, with charity Rape Crisis estimating this is around only 15 per cent of actual offences that take place. Charges were brought in just 4.2 per cent of the recorded sexual offences during that same period, while Crown Prosecution Service data shows only around half of those cases result in convictions, so roughly 2 per cent.
A spokesperson for Northumbria Police said: “We have apologised for the way in which we responded to the report in 2010 and for any subsequent distress caused.
“We have further investigated a complaint linked to the report. This has now been completed and highlighted areas where the service we provided was unsatisfactory, for which we have further apologised. While no misconduct was identified, learning has been progressed.
“The outcome of the complaint also recognises that policing practices nationally have improved significantly over the past decade in relation to both the investigation of sexual offences and the support available to victims. As a force, in recent years, we have been part of the national Operation Soteria initiative, which aims to enhance outcomes for victims and bring about meaningful change in how investigations are carried out.
“We would encourage anyone who has been subjected to any sexual offence to reach out – we are here for you and we are committed to carrying out professional and diligent investigations to bring offenders to justice.”
A Home Office spokesperson said: “We expect the police to investigate and respond to all reports of sexual violence in a timely manner to ensure that victims and survivors are protected.
“We have declared violence against women and girls as a national emergency and are deploying the largest crackdown in British history to halve it within a decade.”

Beijing and Tokyo in new maritime stand-off after Japan seizes Chinese boat, holds captain
Beijing urges Tokyo to protect Chinese crew members’ rights after incident off southwestern Nagasaki prefecture
Japanese authorities said the incident occurred on Thursday inside Japan’s exclusive economic zone (EEZ) off its southwestern Nagasaki prefecture after the Chinese vessel allegedly tried to flee an inspection.
Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Lin Jian said on Friday that the Chinese government had consistently required the country’s fishermen to operate according to laws and regulations while firmly safeguarding their lawful rights and interests.
“It is hoped the Japanese side will strictly abide by the China-Japan fisheries agreement, enforce the law impartially and ensure the safety as well as the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese crew members,” Lin said.
Japan’s fisheries agency said in a statement earlier in the day that the Chinese vessel’s captain was ordered to stop for an inspection “but the vessel failed to comply and fled”. The 47-year-old captain, Zheng Nianli, was arrested on the same day.
The boat carried a further 10 crew members and was about 170km (106 miles) southwest of the island of Meshima, which is under the jurisdiction of Goto city.
“To prevent illegal fishing operations by foreign vessels, we will continue to take firm action and engage in enforcement activities,” Japanese chief government spokesman Minoru Kihara told reporters on Friday.

UN ‘extremely worried’ by Cuba crisis

UN ‘extremely worried’ by Cuba crisis
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
GENEVA - The United Nations said on Feb 13 it was deeply alarmed by the crisis unfolding in Cuba as the island nation struggles under what amounts to a US blockade of oil deliveries.
US President Donald Trump has vowed to starve Cuba of oil after the US military in January ousted Nicolas Maduro, the leader of Venezuela, which had been communist Cuba’s main oil supplier.
“We are extremely worried about Cuba’s deepening socio-economic crisis – amid a decades-long financial and trade embargo, extreme weather events, and the recent US measures restricting oil shipments,” UN human rights office spokeswoman Marta Hurtado told a media briefing in Geneva.
“This is having an increasingly severe impact on the human rights of people in Cuba.”
UN rights chief Volker Turk “reiterates his call on all states to lift unilateral sectoral measures, given their broad and indiscriminate impact on the population. Policy goals cannot justify actions that in themselves violate human rights,” the spokeswoman said.
Ms Hurtado said that given the dependence of health, food and water systems on imported fossil fuels, oil scarcity in Cuba had put the availability of essential services at risk.
“Intensive care units and emergency rooms are compromised, as are the production, delivery, and storage of vaccines, blood products and other temperature-sensitive medications,” she said.
More than 80 per cent of water pumping equipment in Cuba depends on electricity, she added, saying power cuts were undermining access to safe water, sanitation and hygiene.
Mr Trump and US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, the Miami-born son of Cuban immigrants, have made no secret of their desire to bring about regime change in Havana.
The island of 9.6 million inhabitants, under a US trade embargo since 1962, has for years been mired in a severe economic crisis marked by extended power cuts and shortages of fuel, medicine and food.
“The long-term, sustained impact of sectoral sanctions creates economic hardship and weakens the state’s capacity to fulfil its core responsibilities, including providing protection and assistance services. This increases the risk of fuelling social disruption in Cuba,” Ms Hurtado said.
Cuba needs to respond to the situation in line with international human rights law, she added, prioritising mediation, de-escalation, and the safeguarding of the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and expression. AFP

People — and robots — are getting ready to celebrate the Lunar New Year in China

People — and robots — are getting ready to celebrate the Lunar New Year in China
China is getting ready to celebrate the Lunar New Year, and the festivities will include robots
- Bookmark
It's not just people — in China, the robots are also getting ready to celebrate the Lunar New Year.
Friday was dress rehearsal day for four cute humanoid robots, each about 95 centimeters (3 feet) tall at a mall in western Beijing. Curious onlookers stopped to watch.
Each robot got a colorful lion costume and within minutes the moves started: Bend the knees, up, to the left, to the right, shake the mask, and do it all again!
Ahead of the Lunar New Year celebrated next week, and as part of different “fairs” and activities around Beijing, some venues have been busy setting up their stages and props.
For a second year in a row, one of the fairs will be devoted to technology and — yes, again — robots will take center stage.
People will see them dancing and also them stacking blocks on top of others to make a little tower, skewering hawthorn berries onto a stick — coated with a syrup, a popular sweet snack — or playing soccer.
“This year, the number of our robots has increased a lot," said Qiu Feng, a member of the organizing committee. “They will perform dance, martial arts, Peking Opera, poetry and soccer.”
"Some events were also available last year but the finness of the actions and the high-tech vibe are stronger” this time, Qui added.
China has been scaling up its efforts to develop better robots that can perform different activities, powered by artificial intelligence and with less human intervention.
But though they can now do things that were difficult to imagine a few years ago, humans are still needed to help them — for example, to dress them or move them when they stop in the middle of a mini-soccer field.
“Technology is developing faster and becoming more advanced every day," Qui also said. “As long as we keep up with this trend, our ... fair will continue to evolve and rise with the times.”
The robots performing at the mall were developed by some Chinese startups, like Booster Robotics. The company will display around 20 humanoid robots, which will also dance and play soccer.
“It is an AI environment, which means, once the whistle sounds, the remote control will all be put aside and all its decision-making and motion control are made by the robots themselves,” said Ren Zixin, director of marketing at Booster Robotics.

PARIS, Feb 13 - The Louvre museum's Denon gallery, where its most valuable paintings are displayed, was hit by a water leak on Thursday evening, though the area of the famous Da Vinci's Mona Lisa was unaffected, a union representative told Reuters on Friday.
"Due to a technical failure on the upper floor during the night, the area is closed to the public and a scaffolding has been set up," the representative said.
A spokesperson for the museum had no immediate comment on the incident.
The leak happened in the room 707, where paintings from 19th century French artist Charles Meynier and 16th century Italian artist Bernardino Luini are displayed. No evaluation of possible damage was available as of Friday at noon, the union representative said.
The water leak is the second in less than three months in a museum that has gone through a spate of recent setbacks - including a spectacular jewel heist, strikes and a massive ticket fraud investigation- that have put its management under intense scrutiny. REUTERS

US ramps up pressure on Ukraine to make concessions to Russia — newspaper
2026-02-13 12:00:58 GMT
https://tass.com/world/2086419

NEW YORK, February 13. /TASS/. The US administration is ramping up pressure on Kiev to make concessions on Donbass in talks with Moscow, the New York Times reports, citing Ukrainian officials.
According to the paper, Ukraine seeks to ensure Western security guarantees before making any territorial concessions. However, it’s unclear what form those security guarantees might take, "despite years of talks and a flurry of diplomatic action" by the White House in 2025, the New York Times notes.
Ukrainian parliament member Yaroslav Yurchishin told the newspaper that during the peace talks in the UAE earlier this month, the US urged Ukraine to hold elections by May 15. He added that the Trump administration had threatened to pull out of the negotiating process if Ukraine was not prepared to compromise, including by holding elections.
Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said earlier that an agreement had been reached to hold the next round of Russia-US-Ukraine talks next week. According to Politico the meeting could take place in Miami or Abu Dhabi.
The Emirati capital held the second round of trilateral talks on February 4-5. US Special Presidential Envoy Steve Witkoff announced after the meeting that Moscow and Kiev had agreed to exchange 314 prisoners of war. The first round of consultations was held in Abu Dhabi on January 23-24. Russia’s delegation was led by Igor Kostyukov, head of the Main Directorate of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces.

After a mad week, Labour is hopefully seeing sense: Starmer needs to stay | Simon Jenkins
2026-02-13 12:00:29 GMT
https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2026/feb/13/keir-starmer-labour-britain-stability-mandelson

They roared, they stamped and they cheered. On Monday, the parliamentary Labour party reacted as it should when its leader hit a spot of bother. It knew it could not sack him, so it backed him. The constitution did its job and parliament supported the elected government of the day.
The idea that what Britain most needs is a Downing Street conflict is madness. After a week of a truly almighty storm in a teacup, it was a relief that the Commons could recover and steady the ship of state. It should keep it that way into the immediate future.
The cliche of the week was that the country stared into the abyss and drew back. If that was true, then Keir Starmer deserves a gold medal for his performance on Monday night. While he quietened the party mob, cooler heads were also calming the cabinet. A better cliche is that a week is a long time in politics. The storm has subsided, leaving disappointed commentators muttering: “It’s still not if, but when.”
The reason for the prime minister’s troubles is by now well rehearsed. He appointed a man who he knew to have dodgy friends to the Washington embassy and had to get rid of him. This is only one among Labour’s many U-turns, which also include on benefits for disabled people, the winter fuel allowance for pensioners, inheritance tax, pubs and the rest. Mandelson has gone and further investigations are a matter for the police.
The reality was that this was exactly the sort of story Britain’s hot-house politics loves: a US president, a British royal, sexual abuse, misogyny and stupefying wealth. The papers could keep it bubbling with juicy facts day after day. The 24/7 media went crazy. It could forget boring government and its issues. Yes, of course the story at root involved a disgrace, but Westminster flicks a switch and turns disgrace into national scandal. All sense of proportion vanishes.
Britain’s prime minister has been in power for less than two years. He has struggled with his central mission, which is to get the nation’s public finances into shape. He has not yet succeeded – but nor has he failed. There have been numerous mistakes. Starmer appointed a politically inept chancellor and failed to censor her £40bn tax rise. He had to move his foreign secretary, his home secretary and his top Downing Street team inside a year. In the Commons he has suffered the well-known danger of a large majority, which is for it to become uncontrollable.
These errors were proportionally far worse for his party and the country than was the Mandelson affair. Clearly a large number of Labour MPs feel Starmer’s qualities are not suited to the post. But then they chose him – as he chose Mandelson. They must have known his limitations.
The primary public interest in the government just now is stability. The only conceivable virtue in a coup against Starmer is that it would bring in a regime stronger, more purposeful and more appealing to the electorate. None of the normally listed options passes that test. Wes Streeting has yet to prove himself a reformer of the NHS. Angela Rayner is hardly a unifier. Andy Burnham is not even in parliament.
Plenty of prime ministers have survived attempts to topple them. They are surrounded by rivals who went into politics hoping they might end up in Downing Street. Gordon Brown faced a leadership challenge from James Purnell. John Major had to resign as party leader mid-term and fight for re-election. Thatcher endured a long-running revolt from “wets” within her cabinet.
Britain has been through a decade of chaos at the apex of its politics. Its economy has needed a steady hand, not one under constant insecurity and challenge. Abroad, the past year has been dominated by turbulent events in Washington and elsewhere. Starmer has performed throughout with dignity. He has held Britain’s customary position as intermediary between Europe and the US. There is no public interest in undermining him.
Starmer’s next challenge will be the forthcoming Gorton and Denton byelection, followed by the May local elections and the ongoing march of the Greens and Reform UK. His job is to rise above these crises, not succumb to them. Many Labour MPs are new and understandably fear for their seats. But they must know that unseating Starmer is unlikely to make them safer.
The 2024 election was supposedly a relief after voters had lived through five prime ministers in a decade. Now to gamble on a sixth cannot make sense. The only winners would be the populist parties of the right and left, and the nationalist fringe. Is that really what the Labour party wants?

Potstickers and sea bass with ginger and spring onions: Amy Poon’s recipes for lunar new year
2026-02-13 12:00:27 GMT
https://www.theguardian.com/food/2026/feb/13/potstickers-and-sea-bass-with-ginger-and-spring-onions-amy-poons-recipes-lunar-new-year

Christmas is lovely, but my kids think Chinese new year is by far the best holiday. I might be biased, but, unusually, I am inclined to agree with them. As my eldest puts it, “New clothes, cash, booze and food – what’s not to love?” There’s the added bonus that cash is absolutely more than acceptable – in fact, it’s de rigueur, so there’s no shopping for mundane socks and smelly candles. Chinese new year is full of rituals and, just as at Christmas, every family has its own, but they are all variations on a theme. Symbolism looms large in Chinese culture, and at new year it centres around messages of prosperity, luck and family. Symbolism extends naturally to the food, too. The word for “fish’” in Chinese, Mandarin and Cantonese sounds a lot like the word for “surplus”, so to have fish is to have an abundance, to have more than one needs, while dumplings represent wealth on account of their shape. I hope you enjoy these abundantly wealth-wishing recipes. Kung hei fat choi!
Steamed sea bass with spring onion and ginger (pictured top)
This is one of the most popular dishes at our restaurant in Somerset House, central London. The ingredients list and method is simple, but timing is everything. Timing and freshness.
Prep 15 min
Cook 15 min
Serves 4
For the light stock
5-6 coriander stalks
1 spring onion
1-2 slices fresh ginger
1 pinch each salt and ground white pepper
¼ tsp sugar
For the fish
1 whole sea bass (at least 400g), cleaned, rinsed and dried
2-3 spring onions, trimmed and finely julienned
60g fresh ginger, peeled and finely julienned
Sea salt and white pepper
1 dash Shaoxing wine
30g coriander leaves
1 small ladle (about 60ml) hot neutral vegetable oil, to finish
Steamed jasmine rice, to serve
For the sauce
50ml light soy sauce
60ml light stock – see above and method
First, make the stock. Put all the ingredients in a small pan, add about 80ml water and bring to a simmer. Cook for eight to 10 minutes, until fragrant, then keep warm.
Take the fish out of the fridge at least 15 minutes before you want to cook it, and make an incision close to the dorsal fin, which will help it cook evenly. Stuff a small handful of the sliced spring onions and ginger in its belly, then season with sea salt, ground white pepper and a splash of Shaoxing wine.
Put the fish in a steamer, cover and leave to cook – as a rough guide, it’ll need about six minutes per 600g fish; it’s done when you can easily poke through the thickest part of the fish with a chopstick. Meanwhile, mix the light soy sauce into the hot fragrant stock.
Carefully lift the fish on to a platter and remove and discard the ginger and spring onion from its belly. Garnish generously with the remaining julienned spring onion and ginger and some coriander.
Dress the fish with the stock and light soy mixture, then pour a ladleful of sizzling-hot vegetable oil all over the spring onion and ginger topping, so the spring onion wilts. Serve immediately with steamed jasmine rice.
Chicken and Chinese mushroom potstickers
Gather your friends and family, and re-enact the dumpling-wrapping scene from Crazy Rich Asians. Depending on how big your wrappers are, and how generously you fill your potstickers, this amount of filling should easily make 40-50 potstickers. Hand-chopped chicken thighs are so much better than ready minced chicken, so if you have the time, I’d highly recommend it. Consider it a form of anger management.
Prep 15 min
Cook 45 min
Makes 40-50
500g boneless and skinless chicken thighs, or chicken mince
25g peeled fresh ginger, minced or very finely chopped
25ml light soy sauce
20g potato starch
20ml Shaoxing wine
1 tsp sugar
½ tsp salt
½ tsp ground white pepper
15ml sesame oil
200g rehydrated Chinese mushrooms (from about 30g dried), drained, squeezed dry and roughly chopped
50g spring onions, trimmed and finely chopped
Store-bought potsticker wrappers, from Chinese food stores and some large supermarkets (if you want to make your own, work with a ratio of 53% water to all-purpose flour)
Neutral oil, for frying
Chilli vinegar dressing, or chilli oil, to serve
Dice the chicken, then, using the back of the knife, hammer the meat until it’s broken down into a rough mince (or use the backs of two knives, one in each hand, and pretend you’re playing the drums).
Put the minced chicken in a stand mixer fitted with the paddle, then add the ginger, light soy sauce, potato starch, Shaoxing wine, sugar, salt and white pepper. Mix at a medium speed for about a minute, until everything is well combined, then pour in the sesame oil and mix at high speed for four to six minutes, until the mixture turns sticky and tacky. Add the chopped mushrooms and spring onions, then mix on a medium-low speed until they’re evenly incorporated into the meat mix. Scrape the filling on to a plate.
There are many ways to wrap a potsticker, but the most important thing is to seal the filling inside the wrapper so the juices stay inside when it’s cooking. Put about a teaspoon of the filling mixture in the centre of a wrapper, wet the edges of the wrapper with water, then fold over and seal (you’ll need less filling than you think, not least because overstuffed potstickers are hard to seal). Repeat with the remaining filling and wrappers.
Put a little oil in a large, hot frying pan for which you have a lid, then arrange the potstickers inside in a single layer, making sure they’re not touching; if need be, cook the dumplings in batches. Leave to fry gently on a medium-low heat until the bottoms start to take on some colour, then loosen the potstickers with a spatula and pour over just enough boiling water to come halfway up the sides of the potstickers. Immediately cover with a tight-fitting lid, then, still on a medium-low heat, cook for four to five minutes more. Uncover and cook until any residual liquid has evaporated and the bases of the potstickers are toasty brown and crisp.
Plate (or not: there’s something particularly satisfying about eating them straight from the pan, much like eating ice-cream out of the tub) and serve with chilli vinegar dressing or your favourite chilli oil for dipping.

China charges former AstraZeneca executive – what it means for global pharmaceutical firms

China charges former AstraZeneca executive – what it means for global pharmaceutical firms
Foreign drug makers face pressure in the Chinese market, from tighter regulatory oversight to growing local competition
AstraZeneca’s former China head has been formally charged with medical insurance fraud, illegal trading and unlawful collection of personal information, more than a year after he first came under investigation – casting a shadow over the Swedish-British drug maker’s expansion in its second-largest market.
The pharmaceutical giant confirmed to the Financial Times and Reuters that Leon Wang was one of two individuals indicted, as referenced in its latest earnings report published on Tuesday. The company did not name him in the report, stating only that a former executive vice-president and “senior employee” had been charged.
AstraZeneca also said it was not alleged to have received any illegal gains from Wang’s offences.
The company did not respond to a request for comment from the South China Morning Post.

Russia 'obviously' open to economic cooperation with US — Kremlin
2026-02-13 11:59:52 GMT
https://tass.com/politics/2086417

MOSCOW, February 13. /TASS/. Russia makes no secret of the fact that it is open to economic cooperation with the US, Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said at a briefing commenting on a Bloomberg report about an economic cooperation plan allegedly sent to Washington.
The agency calls it "Kirill Dmitriev's plan." Bloomberg mentions the possibility of establishing joint ventures with the US and dollar settlements, but accompanies these assumptions with evaluative comments, primarily of a political nature.
"This Bloomberg report states a fairly obvious point. Of course, we are offering cooperation. Of course, companies from both countries are potentially interested in this cooperation — here are joint ventures for you," he said.
The Kremlin official also commented on the possibility of settlements in dollars. He recalled that it wasn't Moscow that had refused to use the currency, but Washington that had imposed restrictions on its use by Russia. According to Peskov, settlements in the US dollar are possible, but if the restrictions are lifted, the dollar will face serious competition from national and alternative currencies.

BRUSSELS — Ukraine will need Western troops to enforce any ceasefire with Russia’s Vladimir Putin, but voters in Europe’s two most powerful economies are deeply reluctant to help.
People in France and Germany would rather put a peace deal at risk than commit their military personnel to safeguarding a truce, according to new results from The POLITICO Poll.
The findings, from independent pollster Public First’s survey of more than 10,000 people in the U.S., Canada, the U.K., France and Germany, are a political problem for French President Emmanuel Macron, who has already promised to deploy troops inside Ukraine once the war ends.

Obama hits back after Trump scraps climate change regulation: ‘The US is less safe’

Obama hits back after Trump scraps climate change regulation: ‘We will be less safe’
Climate experts say that reversing the 2009 Endangerment Finding is tantamount to denying the existence of global warming

Former President Barack Obama has hit out at the Trump administration for axing a landmark climate change regulation from his time in office.
The Democrat claims Trump is making Americans “less safe” by reversing the ruling, which stated that greenhouse gases were responsible for heating the Earth and endangering public welfare.
Trump announced plans to scrap the regulation, known as the 2009 Endangerment Finding, in the Oval Office Thursday, despite the legislation underpinning many laws designed to counter climate change.
“Today, the Trump administration repealed the endangerment finding: the ruling that served as the basis for limits on tailpipe emissions and power plant rules,” Obama wrote on X. “Without it, we’ll be less safe, less healthy and less able to fight climate change — all so the fossil fuel industry can make even more money.”
While announcing plans to repeal the 2009 ruling, Trump described it as a “disastrous Obama-era policy” and claimed that it had driven up prices and severely damaged the auto industry.
The Environmental Protection Agency has since claimed in a press release that the move will save consumers an estimate $1.3 trillion.
But fears have already been raised that relieving fossil fuel companies from needing to report their emissions and lifting emission standards for vehicles could futher destabilize an already turbulent climate.
Manish Bapna, the president and CEO of the Natural Resources Defense Council, warned reporters at a press conference last month that repealing the landmark legislation would be tantamount to denying the existence of climate change.
“More and more people are suffering from man-made disasters, from heartbreaking flooding in Texas and North Carolina, to the horrific fire around Los Angeles, to the record heat waves that now hit every summer,” Bapna said.
“Eliminating the endangerment finding is denying these events and the existence of climate change writ large.”
Climate change has long been suggested to worsen natural disasters, with the U.S. National Science Foundation warning that extreme rainfall events could become three times more likely by 2079, if greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise according.
The agency also suggested that climate change could make extreme rainfall 20 percent more severe.
Meanwhile, NASA has claimed that human-caused climate change has been a key factor in the rise of so-called “fire weather” in the American West. A reduction in rainfall in that part of the country has led to drier conditions, making it easier for wildfires to spread.
But, Trump has long been a critic of policies designed to combat the effects of climate change.
Reversing the landmark Endangerment Finding is just the latest in his attempts to turbocharge the United States' oil and gas industries.
During his campaign, Trump infamously promised to “drill, baby, drill” and regularly raged about the Green New Deal, a policy proposal suggesting a transition to 100 percent clean energy.
He has regularly described it as “the Green New Scam,” and has since slammed wind turbines as “stupid” and claimed that coal was both “beautiful” and “clean.”
While announcing his plan to overturn the Endangerment Ruling, Trump bragged about how far he was going.
He branded move as “the single largest deregulatory action in American history.”
“This is a big one if you’re into environment,” Trump continued. “This is about as big as it gets.”

Kremlin has no information about halt in oil transit via Druzhba pipeline
2026-02-13 11:58:43 GMT
https://tass.com/economy/2086413

MOSCOW, February 13. /TASS/. Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said he has no precise information about the halt in oil transit via the Druzhba pipeline.
"No, I can't say that. You need to contact our Energy Ministry or the company that handles oil transit. We don't have any precise information about it," he said, responding at a briefing to a question about whether the Kremlin was aware of the transit halt and whether representatives of Hungary and Slovakia had approached the Kremlin regarding resumption of oil exports.
Earlier, in response to Hungarian media reports of disruptions to oil transportation through a pipeline running through Ukrainian territory, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto stated that Ukraine had blocked oil supplies to Hungary from Russia via the Druzhba pipeline in order to create difficulties for the Hungarian government ahead of parliamentary elections.
According to Szijjarto, "[Vladimir] Zelenskyy made a political decision not to allow the resumption of oil supplies to Hungary via the Druzhba pipeline, even though the pipeline is technically fully prepared for resumption of supplies and no technical or technological reasons prevent the resumption of supplies."
Szijjarto noted that the Ukrainian authorities are hoping to support the Hungarian opposition Tisza party, which is being challenged by the ruling Fidesz-Hungarian Civic Union party. He called Kiev's actions gross interference in Hungary’s elections. Parliamentary elections in Hungary, which will determine the formation of a new government, are scheduled for April 12.

Ukrainian FM calls meeting on Beijing's role in ending the war with his Chinese counterpart in Munich productive
Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiha discussed peace efforts and China’s important role in helping end the war with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference on Friday.
“In Munich, I had a meaningful and productive meeting with China’s Foreign Minister Wang Yi. We focused on ways to develop mutually beneficial trade and bilateral ties based on reciprocal respect for territorial integrity,” the head of the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry wrote on the social network X following the negotiations.
According to Sybiha, he briefed his Chinese counterpart on the situation on the battlefield, Russian attacks on Ukraine’s energy system, and the losses suffered by Chinese companies as a result of Russian strikes.
Furthermore, the minister noted, the two sides focused on ways to develop mutually beneficial trade and bilateral ties based on mutual respect for territorial integrity.
The Ukrainian minister also thanked Beijing for its decision to provide Ukraine with an additional package of humanitarian energy aid.
“I reiterated Ukraine’s interest in contacts with China at the highest level,” Sybiha also informed.

ESA satellite finds 'inside-out' planetary system that challenges formation theories
2026-02-13 11:57:17 GMT
http://www.euronews.com/next/2026/02/13/esa-satellite-finds-inside-out-planetary-system-that-challenges-formation-theories

A newly discovered planet orbiting a distant star may change scientists’ understanding of how planetary systems form.
Astronomers say they have discovered a distant planetary system with planets arranged in a surprising order, challenging long-standing ideas about how planets form.
In our Solar System, the four planets closest to the Sun are small and rocky, while the four farther away are large gas giants. Scientists have long believed this pattern — rocky planets near the star and gaseous planets farther out — was common across the universe.
However, a star called LHS 1903 discovered in the Milky Way's thick disc suggests otherwise.
In a collaborative effort involving researchers across Europe, astronomers analysing data from several telescopes had already identified three planets orbiting the red dwarf star, which is cooler and dimmer than our Sun.
The closest planet to the star was rocky, followed by two gas giants. That is the order scientists expect.
But digging into observations made by the European Space Agency (ESA)'s exoplanet-probing Cheops space telescope revealed a fourth planet farther from the star. Surprisingly, this outermost planet also appears to be rocky.
"That makes this an inside-out system, with a planet order of rocky-gaseous-gaseous-and then rocky again," Thomas Wilson, the lead author of the study and a planetary astrophysicist from the University of Warwick in the United Kingdom, said in a statement with ESA.
"Rocky planets don't usually form so far away from their home star," Wilson added.
One planet after another
Inner planets are expected to be small and rocky because intense radiation from the nearby star blasts most of the gas away from their rocky core.
But farther out in the cold reaches of the system, a thick atmosphere can form around cores, creating gas giants.
Trying to explain the unusual LHS 1903 system, researchers tested several possibilities before proposing a new idea: the planets may have formed one after another rather than all at once.
According to the currently most widely accepted theory, planets form simultaneously in a massive ring of gas and dust called a protoplanetary disc.
This involves tiny dust grains clumping together, then snowballing into cores that eventually evolve into mighty planets.
But in this system, scientists believe LHS 1903 may have formed after most of the gas had already disappeared.
"Yet here is a small, rocky world, defying expectations," Wilson said.
"It seems that we have found the first evidence for a planet which formed in what we call a gas-depleted environment," he added.
Since the 1990s, astronomers have discovered more than 6,000 planets outside our Solar System, called exoplanets, mostly by spotting slight changes in brightness as they cross in front of their star.
"Historically, our planet formation theories are based on what we see and know about our Solar System," said Isabel Rebollido, a planetary disc researcher at ESA.
"As we are seeing more and more different exoplanet systems, we are starting to revisit these theories."

Russia brings back 'pseudo-historian' Medinsky to head peace talks, reversing shift toward 'constructive' diplomacy

Russia brings back 'pseudo-historian' Medinsky to head peace talks, reversing shift toward 'constructive' diplomacy
Russia will send presidential aide Vladimir Medinsky to lead its delegation at the next round of talks with Ukrainian and U.S. officials on Feb. 17–18 in Geneva, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on Feb. 13.
The return of Medinsky signals a potential hardening of Moscow's stance during the negotiations, given his history of uncompromising rhetoric in previous rounds of talks.
Medinsky previously led Russia's delegation during direct negotiations in 2025, after which Ukrainian officials described him as a "pseudo-historian" and accused him of taking a hard-line position.
During negotiations, Medinsky reportedly warned that Russia was prepared to continue fighting indefinitely and threatened further territorial advances if Kyiv refused Moscow's demands.
Bloomberg earlier reported that U.S. officials had also signaled to their Russian counterparts a preference to limit the involvement of hardliners like Medinsky in the peace process.
Medinsky also headed Russia's delegation during the March–April 2022 talks in Istanbul.
In the most recent round of negotiations, Russia's delegation was led by Admiral Igor Kostyukov, chief of military intelligence, alongside senior Defense Ministry officials.
Ukrainian representatives described that team as more "constructive" and said it reflected a "qualitative change" compared to Medinsky's previous role.
The venue shift also sparked confusion after President Volodymyr Zelensky said earlier this week that Washington had proposed hosting the meeting on U.S. soil, in Miami.
"The American side has proposed a meeting in America, in Miami, next week. And we immediately confirmed it," Zelensky said on Feb. 11.
Later on Feb. 13, Zelensky's adviser Dmytro Lytvyn confirmed the talks would take place in Geneva.
The upcoming talks come amid renewed Russian criticism of the broader peace process. While U.S., Ukrainian, and Russian officials met in trilateral formats in January and early February, the Kremlin has publicly questioned key elements of the proposed plan.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on Feb. 11 effectively dismissed a U.S.-Ukraine 20-point plan framework, which had been expected to form the basis for peace negotiations.
Lavrov said that ahead of the August summit in Alaska, U.S. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff handed Moscow a document outlining key issues "in line with realities on the ground."
The minister claimed that the sides had identified "real approaches based on the American initiative" that "opened a path to peace" and could have formed the basis for a final agreement.
"All subsequent versions are the result of an attempt by Zelensky and (Europe) to override the American initiative," Lavrov said. "Now they are waving around some kind of 'document' with 20 points, which no one has given us either officially or unofficially."
The 20-point framework Lavrov referenced was developed by U.S. and Ukrainian officials in late December 2025. An earlier 28-point draft, widely viewed in Kyiv as pressuring Ukraine toward capitulation, was revised into a shorter document.
The minister also said the talks remain far from finished, dismissing what he called "enthusiastic perception" around the peace process that should not be embraced.
The Geneva meeting is expected to test whether the sides can bridge their competing versions of the plan, with territorial issues likely to top the agenda.

Türkiye posts $25.2B current account deficit in 2025
Goods saw deficit of $69.7B last year, while services posted surplus of $63.5B, according to Turkish Central Bank data
ISTANBUL
Türkiye’s current account balance saw a deficit of $25.2 billion last year, the Turkish Central Bank announced on Friday.
Last year's deficit was higher than the $10.4 billion deficit in 2024, according to the data.
The balance saw a surplus in four of the 12 months last year.
In 2025, the goods deficit amounted to $69.7 billion, while services saw a net surplus of $63.5 billion.
Primary and secondary income realized a net deficit of $18.5 billion and $528 million, respectively.
In December 2025 alone, the account posted a deficit of $7.25 billion.
The current account excluding gold and energy indicated a net deficit of $691 million in December.
The goods posted a deficit of $7.44 billion, while services saw a surplus of $2.65 billion in December.
Commenting on the data, Turkish Finance Minister Mehmet Simsek said despite challenging global conditions, sustainable levels of current account balance are being maintained.
"The annual current account deficit as a percentage of national income, which reached 5% in mid-2023, decreased to 0.8% in 2024. We expect this ratio to be 1.6% in 2025," Simsek wrote on Turkish social media platform NSosyal.
He stated that excluding gold, which holds a significant place in savings preferences, the average deficit as a percentage of national income was 3% during the 2003-2023 period, while the country had a surplus of 0.2% in 2024, adding that once the GDP data is in hand, they foresee a limited deficit of around 0.3% in 2025.
"Confidence in our program has strengthened access to external financing while costs have decreased. The external debt rollover ratios of the real sector and banks reached 221% and 218% respectively in 2025," Simsek said.
Direct investment inflows, excluding real estate, which improved financing quality and increased production capacity, reached their highest level in the last 10 years at $10.7 billion, according to Simsek.
"We anticipate that the moderate trend in energy prices in 2026, the improving outlook in our main trading partners, and the supportive euro/dollar exchange rate will positively contribute to our sustainable current account balance target," he emphasized.
"We continue to implement structural steps that will make our gains in the current account balance permanent," Simsek added.

Ukraine’s foreign minister said Friday he met his counterpart from China -- a close partner of Moscow -- at the Munich Security Conference, where the pair discussed ending the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
China and Russia are close partners and while Beijing has said it takes a neutral stance on the war in Ukraine, it has never condemned the invasion.

“We discussed peace efforts and China’s important role in facilitating an end to the war,” Andriy Sybiga said of his meeting with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi.
“I reiterated Ukraine’s interest in contacts with China at the highest level,” Sybiga added, referring to a push for a meeting between President Volodymyr Zelensky and China’s leader Xi Jinping.
Western governments and Kyiv accuse Beijing of providing Russia with crucial economic support for its war effort, notably by supplying military components for its defence industry.
Sybiga said the conversation was “meaningful and productive” and that he had updated Wang on the status of fighting and on Russian attacks that had damaged facilities linked to Chinese companies.
He also said China would supply humanitarian energy assistance to Ukraine, in the wake of systematic Russian strikes on Ukraine’s energy grid.
The foreign ministers exchanged invitations to visit their respective countries, Sybiga added.

White House uses former foreign aid agency funds for Trump budget chief’s security, documents show

White House uses former foreign aid agency funds for Trump budget chief’s security, documents show
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
WASHINGTON - The White House budget office is using millions of dollars from the former US foreign aid agency to pay for the security detail of Mr Russell Vought, President Donald Trump’s budget chief and an architect of the government overhaul that has cut thousands of federal jobs, according to three documents seen by Reuters.
The White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB), which Vought leads, is allocating US$15 million of what remains of USAID operating expenses to cover the costs of his protection by the US Marshals Service through the end of 2026, the documents showed.
A person familiar with the matter said that Mr Vought’s security detail comprises more than one dozen US Marshals, which Reuters could not independently confirm. OMB did not make Mr Vought available for interview.
The Marshals Service did not comment on Mr Vought specifically, saying it does not identify people under protection but it “typically seeks reimbursement by the supported agency.”
Asked about the use of USAID funds, OMB spokesperson Rachel Cauley said in an email: “We are going to continue to use available funds at the three agencies overseen by the director to protect him.”
She apparently was referring to OMB, USAID and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, of which Mr Vought is the acting director.
Mr Vought served as acting USAID director for nearly 90 days last year before his deputy assumed the post in November.
He remains a senior adviser to the nearly defunct agency, according to one of the documents, which have not been previously reported.
Ms Cauley did not give further details about Mr Vought’s security costs but she did not dispute that USAID funds are being used to underwrite the costs of his US Marshals detail.
The Trump administration dismantled USAID and canceled most of its aid programs last year, transferring responsibility for foreign assistance to the State Department.
A skeleton crew of more than 100 staff and contractors is closing out USAID’s remaining contracts and is due to shut the 64-year-old agency’s doors for good by September.
One of the documents reviewed by Reuters said OMB signed an agreement with USAID on Sept 11, 2025 “to cover the costs associated with then Acting USAID Administrator Mr Vought’s security detail through November.”
That amount - US$1.6 million - came from what is left of USAID’s operating expenses, the document showed.
OMB budgeted another US$13.5 million in USAID funds to underwrite the costs of Mr Vought’s security detail through the end of this year “as they relate to his current role as Senior Advisor to USAID,” the document said.
The Marshals Service typically protects federal courthouses, judges and court personnel. Asked about Mr Vought, the Marshals Service said it “could offer protection to members of the executive branch who face threats or at the direction of the Attorney General.”
The person familiar with the matter said that Mr Vought has received serious threats, which the person said were apparently linked to his role as a leading author of Project 2025, the conservative blueprint that has formed the basis of many Trump administration policies.
Reuters was unable to independently confirm the threats or whether they related to Project 2025. Last week, police in northern Virginia announced the arrest of a 26-year-old man for attempted murder, with media reports identifying Mr Vought as the target. A spokeswoman for the Arlington County police declined to confirm Mr Vought was the suspect’s target.
In her statement to Reuters, OMB spokesperson Ms Cauley accused “The Left” - which she did not further identify - of pursuing a strategy that fuels an “assassination culture against public officials” and then expresses “shock about what it takes to keep them safe.”
Mr Vought’s use of bodyguards comes amid an extraordinary surge in intimidation and violence directed at US officials, judges and politicians and activists of both political parties since 2020. Mr Trump has been targeted by two assassination attempts. Under Mr Trump, the Marshals Service has occasionally provided security to top US officials, including Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
In July, Mr Vought sought funds from the CFPB to help meet the US$4.7 million cost of his security detail for the remainder of 2025, according to an email seen by Reuters and a person with knowledge of the matter. The email was first reported by GovExec.
Mr Trump ordered the closure of USAID on taking office in January, claiming without providing proof that it was rife with corruption.
Some 10,000 USAID personnel and thousands of contractors were fired and thousands of programs shuttered, throwing into turmoil US-funded global humanitarian aid operations on which millions of the world’s poorest people depended. USAID stopped distributing aid in July. REUTERS

10 years of Tunisia's state of emergency with no end in sight

More than a decade of Tunisia's state of emergency with no end in sight
For more than a decade, Tunisia has been living under what was meant to be a temporary measure.
In early 2026, Tunisian President Kais Saied extended the country's long-running state of emergency by 11 months, until 31 December, according to the official gazette published on 31 January. The extension follows the latest in a series of periodic renewals, the most recent of which covered just one month in January.
Under the emergency framework, the Interior Ministry holds broad powers to ban public gatherings, impose curfews, conduct searches of shops and homes, and monitor the press, radio broadcasts, cinema and theatre productions, all without prior judicial authorisation.
The measures were first introduced after a suicide bombing on 24 November 2015 that targeted a bus carrying members of the presidential guard through central Tunis. 12 security officers and the attacker were killed, and 16 others, both security personnel and civilians, were wounded in the attack, which the Islamic State group later claimed.
More than 10 years later, the emergency remains in force, and its repeated renewals have transformed it from a temporary measure into a permanent feature of governance.
Tunisia's state of emergency is not a legal formality. The decree governing it dates back to 26 January 1978, and allows the president to declare emergency rule for renewable periods of up to 30 days.
Rights organisations, both domestic and international, have warned for years that the framework falls short of safeguards required under international human rights law, particularly given its indefinite extension.
The UN Human Rights Committee has repeatedly raised concerns that Tunisia's state of emergency risks exceeding the standards that permit such measures in exceptional crises. And since Saied's consolidation of power beginning in July 2021, opposition forces fear the emergency is being used against those who reject his rule.
A decade of the emergency state
The 2015 bombing was one of the most severe security incidents Tunisia experienced after its 2011 revolution, and emergency rule was introduced in direct response. But even during the democratic transition following the revolution, the state of emergency never ended.
Political analyst Mahdi Elleuch described it as one of the most telling contradictions of Tunisia's post-revolution trajectory.
"It was constantly justified by security concerns, first through the fight against terrorism and, later, sometimes through anti-corruption campaigns," he told The New Arab.
Emna Ben Khelifa, Research and Documentation Officer at the Intersection Association for Rights and Freedoms, noted that the democratic period also exposed a deeper structural problem.
Tunisia, she said, never fully dismantled the security logic inherited from authoritarian rule. The emergency system allowed security institutions to operate with extended discretion, but during the democratic years, courts, civil society, and political debate still limited how far those powers could go.
The emergency framework also reshapes the relationship between security institutions and the rule of law.
"State of emergency procedures grant security forces special prerogatives that allow them to act outside ordinary judicial control," she said. "Measures such as house searches or movement restrictions can be carried out without the usual requirement of a judicial warrant."
International human rights law permits states to adopt emergency measures during exceptional crises. However, such measures must remain strictly time-limited, proportionate to the threat, and subject to independent oversight.
The reform that never came
During Tunisia's democratic decade, emergency measures did not go uncontested. Civil society groups openly challenged their use, and individuals subjected to administrative restrictions, including house arrests and travel bans, took their cases to administrative courts.
Several judicial rulings overturned emergency measures, and judges questioned the constitutional validity of the 1978 decree itself, according to Elleuch.
That legal and political pressure eventually led to attempts at reform. A draft emergency law introduced in 2018 sought to replace the decree with modern legislation that would define strict limits on executive power and introduce parliamentary oversight. The bill was reviewed and amended by the parliamentary Committee on Rights and Freedoms. Critics argued the revised version still fell short of guaranteeing effective protection of rights and freedoms. The legislation was never adopted.
Elleuch said the emergency existed during the democratic period, but it was confronted by democratic pressure. There were still institutional and social spaces where citizens could challenge those powers, he said.
That balance shifted after Saied's actions beginning in July 2021. Parliament and the Supreme Judicial Council were dissolved. Saied issued legislation by presidential decree, pushed through a new constitution via referendum, and held early legislative elections. He began a second five-year presidential term in October 2024.
Saied has described his actions as necessary and legal steps to save the state from total collapse. His supporters view the measures as a correction to the path of the 2011 revolution, which toppled President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali after more than two decades in power. Opposition forces consider the measures a consolidation of absolute one-person rule.
Within this changed political landscape, analysts say emergency powers now operate with far fewer constraints. Elleuch argued the shift is not only institutional but also conceptual.
"Today, the danger is not simply that emergency powers are used to restrict political activity, including preventing opposition groups from organising or closing their offices," he said. "The deeper problem is that the capacity to resist these measures has largely disappeared."
Ben Khelifa described the current situation as "a legal grey zone."
When authorities invoke emergency powers, procedural guarantees that would normally protect individuals can effectively vanish, she said. The system allows security decisions to bypass normal judicial review.
She added that emergency laws are designed to address exceptional threats, not to regulate everyday political life. When emergency measures become routine governance tools, she warned, they create a permanent imbalance between security authority and civil liberties.
Shrinking spaces
Concerns over the prolonged use of emergency powers have also extended to their broader impact on media freedom. In the 2025 World Press Freedom Index published by Reporters Without Borders (RSF), Tunisia ranked 129th globally, down from 118th in 2024 and 121st in 2023, after leading the Arab region in 2021.
Ziad Dabbar, head of the Tunisian Journalists' Syndicate, warned that the persistence of emergency governance risks entrenching a restrictive legal environment for journalists, particularly amid Tunisia's post-2021 political transformation.
"Since the adoption of the new constitution and the restructuring of political institutions, there is a real fear that Tunisia could move towards scenarios seen elsewhere in the region," Dabbar said, referring to Egypt's prolonged state of emergency, which remained in force for more than two decades and was used to restrict journalistic work, including freedom of movement and access to information.
Dabbar stressed, however, that emergency legislation is not always the primary legal instrument used against journalists in practice. Instead, he said, authorities increasingly rely on a combination of overlapping laws.
"The current authorities apply Decree-Law 54, the Telecommunications Code dating back to the Ben Ali era, anti-terrorism legislation, and provisions of the penal code against journalists, rather than the press law established under Decree 115," he said.
He added that the continued reliance on older legal frameworks reflects a broader pattern of legal continuity, warning that emergency powers, even when not directly invoked, remain available as a theoretical tool to restrict journalistic activity.
"Emergency laws are supposed to respond to extraordinary threats," Dabbar said. "When they remain in force for years, there is always a risk that what was designed as exceptional becomes the rule rather than the exception."
Elleuch framed Tunisia's current trajectory as a shift from what he called an "incomplete democracy", where authoritarian legacies persisted but could still be contested, to a political system where avenues for dissent have narrowed considerably.
"Tunisia's democratic period still carried the legacy of the police state," he said. "But there were real margins for protest, expression, and institutional influence. Today, many of those margins have been dismantled."

Zelensky, Pistorius visit German-Ukrainian drone production facility
This was reported by an Ukrinform correspondent.
During the visit, the delegation inspected the production line and observed a drone test flight.
Four cooperation agreements were signed as part of the event.
As previously reported by Ukrinform, the joint defense venture Quantum Frontline Industries was officially launched on December 15 2025 under the “Build with Ukraine” initiative. The partnership between Germany’s Quantum Systems and Ukraine’s Frontline Robotics paved the way for the first industrial-scale production of Ukrainian drones in Europe.
The first fully automated industrial drone production line in Europe for the Armed Forces of Ukraine combines proven Ukrainian unmanned aerial vehicle technology with German expertise in scaling and automation, setting a new standard for cross-border cooperation in the defense sector.
The two companies are scaling up production of the Linza bomber drone, which enhances the tactical reconnaissance capabilities of Ukraine’s Defense Forces and enables remote mining operations.

Australian Liberal Party’s first female leader vows to ‘step away completely from public life’ after being ousted
Angus Taylor takes on Liberal Party’s leadership as it grapples with the ‘worst’ poll numbers

Australian Liberal Party’s first female leader Sussan Ley has vowed to “step away completely and comprehensively from public life” after being ousted from her post.
Ms Ley was replaced with former shadow defence minister Angus Taylor as the conservatives seek to rebuild their image. She made history in May by becoming the first female leader to lead the Liberals after the opposition party suffered a resounding defeat in last year’s election.
She served only nine months in the job before she suffered a defeat in a ballot of Liberal members of parliament as the party grappled with poor poll numbers and infighting within the conservative alliance known as the Liberal-National Coalition.
Mr Taylor, a leading figure in the party’s conservative wing and the son of a fourth-generation sheep farmer, defeated Ms Ley 34 votes to 17.
In a social media post, Mr Taylor said: “It’s an immense honour to be elected as leader of the Liberal Party. I am looking forward to working with my deputy, Jane Hume to serve the Australian people.”
Mr Taylor assumes leadership of a diminished parliamentary party at a historic low in public support, facing a strained coalition alliance and mounting electoral threats from a resurgent One Nation and community-backed independents.
Recent opinion polls indicate the opposition coalition has lost a significant number of voters to far-right populist Senator Pauline Hanson and her anti-immigration party, One Nation.
Two separate polls in January showed One Nation’s primary vote had overtaken that of the coalition.
Speaking to reporters, Mr Taylor acknowledged the scale of the challenge ahead, saying the Liberals’ position was the worst ever and that the party might not survive if an election were held now.
Following the defeat, Ms Ley said she will quit politics altogether and resign as an MP, triggering a by-election in her rural New South Wales seat of Farrer, which she has represented since 2001. She said she would pursue her hobby in aviation.
She also criticised her former colleagues and critics for allegedly agitating against her leadership from day one.
“It is important that the new leader gets clear air, something that is not always afforded to leaders, but which in the present moment is more important than ever,” she said.
“I will be spending the next couple of weeks thanking the amazing people of Farrer, and expressing my gratitude to them for the honour of representing them for 25 years. Shortly thereafter, I will be tendering my resignation to the speaker.”
Her tenure lasted only 276 days. In his first press conference as the leader of the party, Mr Taylor said his two priorities would be to "restore our standard of living, opposing the Labor government's tax and spending policies that he said were increasing inflation and keeping interest rates high.
"The choice is simple for the Liberal Party: change or die, and I choose change," Mr Taylor said.

Portugal advances bill to restrict minors’ access to social media

Portugal advances bill to restrict minors’ access to social media
Bill would bar all children under 13 from social media, require parental consent for under-16s
OVIEDO, Spain
Portugal took a major step on Thursday toward restricting minors’ access to social media, as lawmakers approved a bill that would require parental authorization for users ages 13 to 16 and bar all children under 13 from signing up.
The center-right coalition government secured Socialist support to advance the measure in parliament’s initial general debate, sending the text to committee for detailed scrutiny and amendments before a final vote.
Backers framed the bill as a child-protection measure aimed at reducing harms linked to heavy and unsupervised platform use by minors, including bullying, anxiety, addictive behavior and other mental health risks.
The access limits would apply to social networks such as Instagram, Facebook and TikTok, but not messaging services like WhatsApp.
Tech platforms would also be required to guarantee effective age verification in line with EU rules and provide protections against harmful content, including exposure to violence, early sexual material, addictive games and manipulated videos or images where users ages 13 to 16 could be present after receiving parental consent.
Socialists have pushed to expand the full ban to those under 16. The current law in Portugal sets the age of digital consent at 13.
Rebuked by the far right
The proposal drew sharp opposition from the far-right Chega party, which voted against it alongside the smaller right-wing Liberal Initiative.
Chega leader Andre Ventura denounced the bill as “digital Stalinism” and accused the mainstream parties of trying to reassert control over the public debate online.
“This is not about freedom, it’s about controlling minds and the future,” Ventura said, criticizing a provision that would allow a public administrative body to suspend access to a platform’s service nationwide.
Chega lawmakers also attacked language that would place greater responsibility on platforms to remove false content, arguing it opens the door to censorship. “But who decides what is false?” asked Chega lawmaker Rita Matias, one of the party’s most prominent figures on social media.
Socialist lawmaker Sofia Pereira pushed back, calling Chega “the party that promotes hate and fake news.”
The Liberal Initiative argued the proposal undermines privacy and would create broad surveillance.
The move follows similar initiatives abroad. Australia last year introduced a ban on social media for under-16s, while several European countries, including France, Spain, Denmark and Italy, are considering or implementing similar measures.

All questions on New START should be addressed to US — Russian deputy foreign minister
2026-02-13 11:53:34 GMT
https://tass.com/politics/2086411

MOSCOW, February 13. /TASS/. All questions regarding the future of the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START) should be addressed to the United States, as Russia's position is known. This was stated in an interview with TASS by Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov.
"They [the US] also know our position, it has been repeatedly stated at all levels. So anyone who wants to can lay out this solitaire or assemble this puzzle, and all questions will disappear. There can be no questions to us on this matter: all questions are for the US," the deputy minister noted.
About New START
The Russian-American Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START), the last international legal limitation on nuclear weapons deployment, expired on February 5 and was not extended due to the US’s fault. Washington stated that it hoped to conclude a better document, involving China as well. On September 22, 2025, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced at a meeting with the Russian Security Council that Moscow was prepared to adhere to the stated restrictions for another year after New START expires in February 2026. He emphasized that this measure was viable only if Washington followed suit. A few days later, the US administration praised the Russian leader’s initiative, but no official response to Moscow’s proposal was received from Washington.

China extends support to Dhaka after Bangladesh Nationalist Party election win
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi says New Delhi will continue support to ‘democratic, progressive and inclusive’ Bangladesh
ISTANBUL / NEW DELHI / ISLAMABAD
China on Friday extended support to Dhaka after the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) secured a two-thirds majority in general elections.
Hailing the “steady and smooth” elections held a day earlier, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said Beijing supports Dhaka “in advancing its domestic political agenda.”
China stands ready to “work with Bangladesh to take bilateral comprehensive strategic cooperative partnership forward,” Lin told reporters in Beijing.
According to Bangladesh Election Commission senior secretary Akhtar Ahmed, the BNP won 209 seats, while its main competitor, a Jamaat-e-Islami party-led bloc, secured 77 seats in the 300-seat parliament.
Bangladesh held general elections on Thursday, the first since the 2024 popular uprising that ousted the government of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.
India, Malaysia, Pakistan, and the Maldives congratulated Tarique Rahman, the BNP leader.
Extending warm regards to the BNP, Maldives President Mohamed Muizzu expressed readiness to “work closely together to further advance and deepen the longstanding friendship and cooperation between the Maldives and Bangladesh.”
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said New Delhi will continue to support a “democratic, progressive and inclusive” Bangladesh in a post on US social media company X.
Modi also held a phone call with Rahman after the declaration of victory.
“I conveyed my best wishes and support in his endeavour to fulfil the aspirations of the people of Bangladesh,” Modi said. “As two close neighbours with deep-rooted historical and cultural ties, I reaffirmed India’s continued commitment to the peace, progress and prosperity of both our peoples.”
Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif congratulated Rahman on his “resounding victory” and the people of Bangladesh on the successful conduct of the elections.
“I look forward to working closely with the new Bangladesh leadership to further strengthen our historic, brotherly multifaceted bilateral relations and advance our shared goals of peace, stability and development in South Asia and beyond,” Sharif said.
Pakistan and Bangladesh have seen ties warming in recent months.
Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim called the BNP victory “a triumph of democracy,” offering congratulations to Rahman and the party on their “emphatic election victory.”

Alleged rape victim of Norway princess’ son says she took sleeping pills

Alleged rape victim of Norway princess’ son says she took sleeping pills
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
OSLO - A third woman allegedly raped by the son of Norway’s crown princess told an Oslo court on Feb 13 she was drunk and on sleeping pills when he had non-consensual sex.
Marius Borg Hoiby – Crown Princess Mette-Marit’s son and heir apparent Crown Prince Haakon’s stepson – is on trial facing 38 charges, including raping four women while they were asleep or unconscious.
Whether the women were in a condition to object to having sex is central to the case.
Hoiby denies the rapes and other serious charges
On Feb 13, the third alleged victim to testify fought back tears as she recalled the early hours of March 24, 2024, when she invited Hoiby to her place in Oslo after a party.
After having consensual sex, Hoiby is accused of touching the young woman’s genitals while she was unable to object and filming her without her knowledge – a separate charge.
“I wanted to sleep. I was very tired, incredibly exhausted, very drunk. It was hard to keep my eyes open,” she told the court.
As she was prone to insomnia, she had taken sleeping pills that night, she said.
Hoiby, who was sketching in a notebook during the proceedings on Feb 13, was to provide his version of events later in the day.
The court was shown five videos seized from Hoiby’s residence. According to the prosecution, the first showed consensual sexual relations between the pair, and the four others the rape of which he is accused.
“If I had seen that he was filming me, I would have stopped him. I would never have accepted that,” the alleged victim said.
Hoiby was arrested on Aug 4, 2024, suspected of assaulting his girlfriend the night before, in what would trigger the most serious scandal in the history of the Norwegian monarchy.
The investigation into that incident uncovered a slew of other suspected offences, including video footage on his phone and laptop, leading police to charge him with four rapes of women who were not in a condition to object.
The three victims who have testified so far only realised that they had been raped, according to the prosecution, when police showed them the footage and informed them the actions could be considered criminal.
Hoiby has repeatedly said during the trial that he is “not in the habit of having sex with women who are sleeping”. AFP

8,000-year-old pottery shards reveal ancient Mesopotamians understood maths before numbers invented

8,000-year-old pottery shards reveal ancient Mesopotamians understood maths before numbers invented
‘The decoration of pottery and seals in the Halafian culture reflects a high level of mathematical awareness,’ researcher says

- CommentsGo to comments
An 8,000-year-old pottery vessel has revealed that Mesopotamians were using mathematics years before numbers and writing were invented, according to a recent study.
Up until now, the first records of written numbers emerged in what is now Iraq around 3400 BC by the Sumerians.
But researchers have found that that people in the same region had a sophisticated level of mathematical cognition much earlier.
The study dives into the paintings of plant images by the Halafian culture, which lived in northern Mesopotamia between about 6200 and 5500 BCE. They were some of the world’s earliest farming communities.
Analysis of the community’s ancient pottery showed petals and patterns served as the fundamental numerics of symmetry and repetition.
Many bowls featured flowers which had four, eight, 16, 32 or 64 petals, which form a “geometric sequence”, thus implying mathematical reasoning.
The researchers argued that the development of mathematical thinking created a “a cognitive awareness of the symmetry evident in the vegetal world” which is why flowers, shrubs, branches and trees were depicted on the pottery.
Yosef Garfinkel, professor of Prehistoric Archaeology at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem- and the study’s author - wrote: “The decoration of pottery and seals in the Halafian culture reflects a high level of mathematical awareness.
“This should not surprise us, as by the late 6th and early 5th millennia BC early village communities had existed in the Near East for some 4000 years and had reached a high level of economic complexity.”
The researchers examined thousands of pottery fragments collected from 29 archaeological sites, in order to track exactly when plants first became a regular subject in human art. They also wanted to observe whether these images followed any consistent rules.
“These developments are reflected in the large number of domesticated plants and animals, widespread pyrotechnology of pottery manufacture, and large architectural units of courtyard houses,” Mr Garfinkel said.
The study is published in the Journal of World Prehistory.

Russia will not make concessions in case of New START-related agreements — MFA
2026-02-13 11:51:14 GMT
https://tass.com/politics/2086409

MOSCOW, February 13. /TASS/. Russia will not make unilateral concessions in the event of any new agreements on the expired Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START), Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov said in an interview with TASS.
"If our colleagues are expecting to agree with us on something else on a different basis, they are gravely mistaken. Especially now: any unilateral concessions on our part are simply out of the question," he noted, commenting on the prospects for dialogue with the United States on strategic stability.
Ryabkov emphasized that Russia essentially doesn't know "what the Trump administration's mindset is regarding their own approaches to future negotiations in this area."
"We only know what the esteemed US President wrote on TruthSocial, what the esteemed US Secretary of State [Marco Rubio] said publicly, and what his esteemed Deputy Secretary for Arms Control and International Security said at the Conference on Disarmament," Ryabkov concluded.

Bangladesh Nationalist Party says will form government by Sunday
Party secures two-thirds majority by winning 209 seats in Thursday’s vote
DHAKA, Bangladesh
The Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) said it would form a new government by Sunday, after winning the first elections since July 2024 uprising that ousted the government of longtime rival Awami League.
"It will be the BNP’s government. The government will be formed by Feb. 15. The BNP will go to parliament with all parties," the party’s Secretary General Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir told reporters on Friday while visiting his constituency in the north-western Thakurgaon district.
“The issues that BNP signed in the July Charter on reforms will be implemented step by step,” he added.
BNP Chairman Tarique Rahman is likely the party's prime ministerial candidate. He became the party head after the death of his mother and Bangladesh’s first female prime minister, Khaleda Zia, in December.
According to the Constitution, a party needs 151 seats in the 300-seat parliament to form a government. The BNP alone secured 209 seats in Thursday's vote. Its main competitor, the bloc led by Jamaat-e-Islami, won 77 seats.

7 Palestinian families forced out of Jordan Valley amid illegal settler attacks in occupied West Bank

7 Palestinian families forced out of Jordan Valley amid illegal settler attacks in occupied West Bank
Escalating settler violence and Israeli raids deepen displacement and unrest across the West Bank
RAMALLAH/Palestine
Seven Palestinian families on Friday dismantled their homes in the Al-Maita area of the northern Jordan Valley in the West Bank amid escalating attacks by illegal settlers and Israeli forces, according to a local official.
Moataz Bisharat, who monitors settlement activity in Tubas, told Anadolu that the families removed their tin and tent structures after illegal settlers set fire to uninhabited tents overnight and carried out repeated assaults, including beatings, livestock theft, destruction of crops and restrictions on grazing.
With the departure of the seven families, the area will be left without any Palestinian residents, he said.
Earlier Friday, four Palestinians were injured and 24 others detained in Israeli military raids and attacks by illegal settlers across the occupied West Bank.
The Palestinian Red Crescent said Israeli forces shot a young man in the thigh in the town of Al-Ram, north of Jerusalem.
In the northern city of Nablus, three Palestinians were injured during an attack by illegal settlers on the village of Talfit. One sustained gunshot wounds and was hospitalized, while two others were beaten and treated at the scene, according to the Red Crescent.
Separately, Israeli forces carried out a series of raids across the West Bank, detaining 24 Palestinians.
According to Palestinian official data, more than 9,300 Palestinians are currently held in Israeli prisons, including 66 women and 350 children.
Israel has intensified operations in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, since launching its military campaign in Gaza on Oct. 8, 2023. Palestinians view the escalation, including killings, arrests, displacement and settlement expansion, as a step toward formal annexation of the territory.
At least 1,112 Palestinians have been killed and about 11,500 injured in the West Bank during that period, and more than 21,000 people have been arrested.
In a landmark opinion in July 2024, the International Court of Justice declared Israel’s occupation of Palestinian territory illegal and called for the evacuation of all settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem.

BRATISLAVA, February 13. /TASS/. Russian oil supplies to Slovakia over the Druzhba oil pipeline have been suspended, Bloomberg reports, citing the Economy Ministry of the country.
Slovakia has strategic reserves of oil and petroleum products for about ninety days, the ministry says. The ministry expects oil supplies will resume.
Oil is not coming to the country since early February, the news agency said. Deliveries contracted significantly as early as in January, it noted.

Ukraine’s population declines by one million people every year, demographer says
2026-02-13 11:48:30 GMT
https://tass.com/society/2086403

MOSCOW, February 13. /TASS/. The demographic situation in Ukraine keeps getting worse as the country’s population declines by one million people every year due to a high mortality rate, a low birth rate and large-scale emigration, Alexander Gladun, deputy director for research at the Ukrainian Institute of Demography and Quality of Life Problems, told the TSN news agency.
"On average, the annual number of births in the country stood at about 185,000 in the past four years, while the number of deaths was 505,000. That said, the natural decline in population was 320,000 per year," the expert specified. "If we look at average data on the crossings of Ukraine’s western border, the annual decline is 830,000," he added.
In short, according to Gladun, "Ukraine’s population shrinks by about 1.15 million every year due to the difference between births and deaths and emigration." "In addition, we don’t know if the data on those who left the country through the western border is accurate because people started to face issues with crossing the border in 2022 as some did not have passports. It’s unclear how many left illegally," the expert noted.
According to him, mortality rates largely exceeded birth rates in Ukraine in 2025 as there were three deaths per one birth. Data from the Ukrainian Justice Ministry shows that the birth rate dropped by 4.5% last year. Gladun emphasized that "this trend is here to stay, so the decline will continue." When asked what Ukraine’s demographic situation would be like in the coming years, he pointed out that no fresh forecasts were available: "We are currently trying to count the population on the [Kiev-] controlled territory, and the work is not over yet."

International astronauts launch to ISS after NASA's first medical evacuation
2026-02-13 11:48:11 GMT
http://www.euronews.com/next/2026/02/13/international-astronauts-launch-to-iss-after-nasas-first-medical-evacuation

“It turns out Friday the 13th is a very lucky day,” SpaceX Launch Control radioed once the astronauts reached orbit.
A fresh team of astronauts launched toward the International Space Station on Friday aboard a SpaceX rocket, set to take over for crew members who had been brought back to Earth in what marked NASA's first medical evacuation from orbit.
NASA requested the expedited launch to quickly fill the positions left vacant by the evacuated astronauts.
The incoming crew—comprising astronauts from the United States, France, and Russia—is scheduled for an eight- to nine-month stay that will extend through until autumn. They arrive on Saturday and will restore the space station to its complete crew complement.
Once the spacecraft reached orbit, SpaceX Launch Control jokingly noted, "It turns out Friday the 13th is a very lucky day." Mission commander Jessica Meir responded with enthusiasm: "That was quite a ride."
During the month-long crew shortage, NASA suspended spacewalks and postponed various tasks while awaiting the replacements. Americans Meir and Jack Hathaway, alongside France's Sophie Adenot and Russia's Andrei Fedyaev, will now join the skeleton crew of three astronauts—one American and two Russians—who maintained station operations in the interim.
NASA said it saw no need for additional pre-launch medical screenings or specialised diagnostic equipment, expressing confidence in existing protocols aboard the station. However, an onboard ultrasound machine, typically used for research purposes, was pressed into urgent service on January 7 to examine the unwell crew member.
NASA has declined to identify the astronaut or disclose details about their condition. All four returning crew members were hospitalised immediately upon their Pacific Ocean splashdown near San Diego.
It marked the first instance in 65 years of human spaceflight that NASA terminated a mission early due to medical concerns.
Satisfied with medical procedures already in place, NASA ordered no extra checkups for the crew ahead of liftoff, and no new diagnostic equipment was packed.
An ultrasound machine already up there for research went into overdrive on Jan. 7 when used on the ailing crew member. NASA has not revealed the ill astronaut’s identity or health issue. All four returning astronauts went straight to the hospital after splashing down in the Pacific near San Diego.
With missions becoming longer, NASA is constantly looking at upgrades to the space station’s medical gear, said deputy programme manager Dina Contella.
“But there are a lot of things that are just not practical, and so that’s when you need to bring astronauts home from space,” she said earlier this week.
In preparation for moon and Mars trips, where health care will be even more challenging, the new arrivals will test a filter designed to turn drinking water into emergency IV fluid, try out an ultrasound system that relies on artificial intelligence and augmented reality instead of experts on the ground, and perform ultrasound scans on their jugular veins in a blood clot study.
They will also demonstrate their Moon-landing skills in a simulated test.
Adenot is only the second French woman to launch to space. She was 14 when Claudie Haignere flew to Russia’s space station Mir in 1996, inspiring her to become an astronaut. Haignere travelled to Cape Canaveral to cheer her on.
“I thought it would have been a quiet joy with pride for Sophie, but it was so hugely emotional to see her with a successful launch," Haignere said.
Hathaway, like Adenot, is new to space, while Meir and Fedyaev are making their second station trip. Just before liftoff, Fedyaev led the crew in a cry of “Poyekhali" — Russian for “Let's Go” — the word uttered at liftoff by the world's first person in space, the Soviet Union's Yuri Gagarin, in 1961.
On her first mission in 2019, Meir took part in the first all-female spacewalk. The other half of that spacewalk, Christina Koch, is among the four Artemis II astronauts waiting to fly around the moon as early as March. A ship-to-ship radio linkup is planned between the two crews.

Bank of Russia cuts key rate by to 15.5% per annum: regulator’s statements, expert views
2026-02-13 11:46:37 GMT
https://tass.com/economy/2086397

MOSCOW, February 13. /TASS/. The Bank of Russia decided to cut the key rate by 0.5 percentage points to 15.5% per annum at the first meeting of its Board of Directors in 2026, with the underlying measures of current price growth having not changed considerably, the regulator reported.
TASS has collected the main facts about the decision.
Statement by Central Bank
- The Bank of Russia lowered the key rate by 0.5 percentage points to 15.5% per annum at its first meeting in 2026.
- The regulator will assess the need for a further key rate cut at its upcoming meetings depending on the sustainability of the inflation slowdown and the dynamics of inflation expectations.
Influence of factors on key rate decision
- Unemployment in Russia remains at historical lows, and wage growth is still outpacing the growth in labor productivity, the regulator said.
- The labor market tightness is gradually decreasing, the Central Bank noted.
- The upward deviation of the Russian economy from a balanced growth path is decreasing, the Bank of Russia stated.
- Growth in domestic demand will moderate in the coming months, the Central Bank projected.
Regulator’s outlook for 2026
- Russia’s Central Bank maintained its 2026 forecasts at 0.5-1.5% for GDP growth, at 5-10% for growth in consumer lending, and at 7-12% for growth in corporate lending.
- The regulator narrowed the forecast corridor for the average key rate until the end of 2026 to 13.5-14.5%.
- Underlying inflation in Russia will be close to 4% in the second half of 2026, the regulator said.
- Annual inflation in Russia stood at 6.3% as of February 9.
- The Bank of Russia projects that annual inflation in the country will decrease to 4.5-5.5% in 2026.
- The Central Bank also downgraded its forecast for the price of a barrel of oil for tax purposes in 2026 from $55 to $45.
Experts’ expectations
- The Bank of Russia will proceed cautiously in easing its monetary policy in 2026, according to Yuri Kravchenko, head of the banking and monetary market analysis department at Veles Capital.
- Most analysts expected the Central Bank to keep the key rate at 16%.
- Head of the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs (RSPP) Alexander Shokhin noted in an interview with TASS that the likelihood that the Bank of Russia would lower the key rate, although not high, still existed.
- The regulator’s Deputy Governor Alexey Zabotkin said in early February that Russian households' inflation expectations for the year ahead in December and January at 13.7% were likely the peak.

Foodora is leaving Finland

https://yle.fi/a/74-20210163?origin=rss

Food and retail goods delivery firm Foodora is leaving the Finnish market at the end of February, according to a company press release.
The app-based courier service said it will continue operations normally until 27 February. After that, it will no longer offer its services in the country.
The company announced the news following the completion of redundancy talks with employee representatives that began on 12 January.
At the start of those talks, the company said it was considering withdrawing from the Finnish market.
The decision to leave Finland affects around 80 local employees and thousands of independent couriers. According to market analysis website PitchBook, Foodora's staff in Finland includes more than 2,800 people.
In May of last year, Finland's Supreme Administrative Court ruled that food couriers are employees, not self-employed entrepreneurs. The case on appeal before the court concerned couriers operating on the platform of the food delivery company Wolt, Foodora's main competitor.
On Friday, Foodora said that it has separately informed other parties affected by the decision, including its restaurant and retail partners as well as the couriers that make the deliveries.
According to the company, the decision to leave Finland was based on a strategy focused on investing in markets with opportunities to become the clear market leader, and to build a strong, long-term brand in Europe.
Foodora began its operations in Finland in 2015, and currently has operations in more than 100 cities and municipalities across the country.
Founded in Munich, Foodora's headquarters moved to Berlin, Germany in 2015 and was subsequently acquired by Delivery Hero. Apart from Finland, the company has operations in Sweden, Norway, Austria, Czech Republic, and Hungary.

Majority of Bangladeshis vote in referendum to revise constitution

NEW DELHI, February 13. /TASS/. The majority of Bangladeshi citizens who participated in the national referendum have voted in favor of reforms and changes to the constitution, the country’s election commission announced while presenting the results of the vote count.
According to the data, a total of 48,074,429 votes were cast "for" and 22,565,627 votes "against" across the country. Voter turnout stood at 60.2%.
Earlier, Bangladesh’s interim government and 25 political parties signed a charter outlining recommendations for governing the country after the elections. The document provides for limiting a person’s tenure as prime minister to 10 years, establishing a bicameral legislature, appointing a deputy speaker from among opposition representatives, and expanding the list of fundamental rights and freedoms. Other proposals include a mandatory referendum to amend provisions concerning the interim government and the constitution.
Reforms are envisaged for constitutional bodies, including the Election Commission, the creation of an upper house of parliament with 100 members based on a proportional representation system, the obligation of the next government to implement the agreed-upon reforms, and the continuation of other transformations in line with the parties’ commitments.
The parliament elected in the polls held simultaneously with the referendum will function as a Constitutional Reform Council, tasked with completing the amendments within a set timeframe and initiating the creation of the upper house.
The 13th parliamentary elections in Bangladesh took place on February 12, 18 months after the resignation in August 2024 of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s government and her Awami League party amid mass protests. For a year and a half, the country was led by an interim government headed by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus.

Elections in Ukraine would be nothing but mockery of democracy, voters — governor

https://tass.com/politics/2086399

GENICHESK, February 13. /TASS/. If held, presidential elections and a referendum on peace agreements with Russia in Ukraine would be nothing more than a mockery of democracy and the opinion of local residents, Governor of the Kherson Region Vladimir Saldo stated to journalists on Friday.
Previously, the Financial Times newspaper, citing sources, reported that Ukraine, under pressure from the US administration, had begun planning to hold presidential elections and a referendum on peace agreements with Russia, with both votes scheduled to take place before May 15. According to the newspaper, Vladimir Zelensky could announce them as early as February 24.
"That farce that they (the Kiev regime - TASS note) are talking about now is not an election. It's simply another mockery of voters. We see how the electoral processes are being conducted right now in Russia, and I can say with confidence: that is real democracy. What is happening there, in the remaining part of Ukraine, is a mockery of democracy," Saldo said.

Pheu Thai party extends support to poll winner Conservatives, paving way for new government in Thailand
With support of 74 Pheu Thai lawmakers, caretaker Prime Minister Anutin's Bhumjaithai Party secures support of more than 251 seats needed to form government
ISTANBUL
The Pheu Thai Party announced on Friday that it will support caretaker Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul’s conservative Bhumjaithai Party in forming a new government, according to local media reports.
The announcement was made by Pheu Thai Secretary-General Prasert Jantararuangtong alongside Anutin following a meeting at Bhumjaithai’s headquarters, local media The Nation reported.
The talks were attended by senior figures from both sides, including Yossanan Wongsa-sawat, Pheu Thai’s prime ministerial candidate.
Prasert said that their presence today was to congratulate the Bhumjaithai Party on its success and to officially announce their support. He added that a detailed discussion will be held later.
On his part, Anutin said both sides agreed to leave the past misunderstandings behind, focusing on moving forward with the public interest as their primary goal.
Bhumjaithai secured 193 seats in Sunday’s election, making it the largest party in the 500-seat lower house, but still short of the 251 seats required to form a government independently.
The People’s Party won 118 seats, while Pheu Thai, backed by former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, secured 74 seats. The Democrat Party won 22 seats.
Thailand’s previous general election was held in 2023, when the Move Forward Party emerged as the largest party with 151 seats, followed by Pheu Thai with 141 and Bhumjaithai with 71.
Despite repeated elections and shifting alliances, the country has seen three different governments in just three years.

Spain detects first swine fever cases outside initial Barcelona outbreak zone
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
BARCELONA - Two African swine fever cases have been detected in Spain among wild boar for the first time outside an original outbreak area near Barcelona, prompting additional restrictions on the movement of people and livestock, regional authorities in Catalonia said on Feb 13.
The new cases were found near the western towns of El Papiol and Molins de Rei in Barcelona’s metropolitan area, where there are no pork farms, officials said.
African swine fever is not harmful to humans but spreads rapidly among pigs and wild boar. Outbreaks often prompt countries to restrict their pork imports from countries or regions with active cases.
Spain is the European Union’s leading pork producer, accounting for a quarter of the bloc’s output and with annual exports worth about 3.5 billion euros (S$5.2 billion).
The initial outbreak, Spain’s first since 1994, took place in the Collserola hills to the north of Barcelona, with no cases reported on farms.
“It was an expected outcome that at some point one of the boar would move to the south,” the head of the Catalan agriculture department, Oscar Ordeig, told reporters at a media briefing.
He added that it being a secondary outbreak meant the new measures - including disinfection, collection and management of boar carcasses, drone-based searches and an estimation of wild boar population densities in the infected area - would only affect the two towns.
In total, 155 infected pigs have been found in the Barcelona area, with 13 new cases detected in recent days, he said. REUTERS

Climate expert says Maldives, Kiribati to vanish off global map due to rising sea levels
2026-02-13 11:38:53 GMT
https://tass.com/world/2086389

MOSCOW, February 13. /TASS/. The island nations of Kiribati and the Maldives will eventually be wiped off the global map amid rising sea levels due to climate change, climate expert Alexey Kokorin from the Nature and People foundation told TASS.
The Earth’s climate is moving ever closer to a so-called "point of no return," after which uncontrolled global warming can no longer be stopped, the Guardian reported earlier citing scientists from the US-based Terrestrial Ecosystems Research Associates (TERA) and the Potsdam Institute.
"When you hear people talk about a point of no return, that’s up for interpretation. For Kiribati, the point of no return has already passed. The country will inevitably be consumed by water. Its location, the place where it is situated, the way the World Ocean level is rising - it's inevitable. Even a rise of one and a half meters, plus more frequent storms and storm surges, would mean its disappearance. The Maldives will probably face the same fate," the expert said.
According to him, the international community is currently focusing its efforts on stabilizing global warming and, consequently, the frequency and intensity of the dangerous phenomena it triggers. The main threat is not the rise in average temperatures but the speed with which they increase. Therefore, it’s of the utmost importance to reign in climate change before it affects more and more countries.
"In essence, we are talking about roughly 2.5 degrees Celsius compared with the 19th century. There is no goal of returning to the climate of the 19th or even the 20th century. Therefore, speaking about a point of no return for the Earth as a whole is probably somewhat incorrect, since no one intends to go back. It is too complicated, it is practically impossible," the climatologist concluded.

Activist group Palestine Action wins legal challenge against UK ban
2026-02-13 11:38:33 GMT
https://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/activist-group-palestine-action-wins-legal-challenge-against-uk-ban-218922

Protestors react after hearing the verdict outside The Royal Courts of Justice, Britain's High Court, in London.
England's high court on Feb. 13 upheld a challenge to a U.K. government ban on activist group Palestine Action, saying it had interfered with the right to freedom of speech.
"Overall the court considered that the proscription of Palestine Action was disproportionate. A very small number of Palestine Action's activities amounted to acts of terrorism," the judges ruled.
The proscription resulted in a "very significant interference with the right to freedom of speech and free assembly,” the judges ruled.
The government reacted swiftly, with Interior Minister Shabana Mahmood saying she would appeal.
"I am disappointed by the court's decision and disagree with the notion that banning this terrorist organisation is disproportionate," she said.
"Home secretaries must ... retain the ability to take action to protect our national security and keep the public safe. I intend to fight this judgement in the Court of Appeal."
Cheers erupted outside the court when the judgement was read out on Feb. 13.
But judges ruled the ban brought in July under the U.K.'s 2000 Terrorism Act would remain in place pending an appeal.
In June2025, the government announced ban under the Terrorism Act 2000 after activists spray-painted planes at a Royal Air Force base, an act being investigated under counter-terrorism laws.
It classified Palestine Action alongside ISIL and al-Qaida, meaning that belonging to or backing the group is now a criminal offense punishable by up to 14 years in prison. Even displaying its name on a T-shirt or placard could lead to a six-month jail term.
Nearly 3,000 people, some aged in their 80s, have been arrested and hundreds charged for showing support for Palestine Action at demonstrations since July.
Most were detained for holding up posters in support of the group, according to protest organizers Defend Our Juries.

Europe needs cyber weapons, says EU tech chief

MUNICH — Europe must be able to strike back in cyberspace, as the strategy to deter adversaries is no longer enough, the EU executive's tech and security chief told POLITICO.
“It’s not enough that we are just defending ... We also have to have offensive capacity,” the European Commission's Executive Vice President Henna Virkkunen said in an interview on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference on Friday.
For years, European capitals have held back from stating publicly that they support offensive cyber operations — known as "hacking back" — because of fears that such operations could trigger retaliation and escalation from countries like Russia, China and others.

West seeks to train saboteurs, agents of influence for Russian elections — lawmaker
2026-02-13 11:32:11 GMT
https://tass.com/politics/2086391

MOSCOW, February 13. /TASS/. Western countries are training instigators to carry out acts of sabotage during Russia’s upcoming parliamentary elections and also plan to place their agents of influence into the country’s representative bodies, said Vasily Piskaryov, chairman of the Russian State Duma (lower house of parliament) commission investigating foreign interference in Moscow’s internal affairs.
"Our analysis shows that active work is underway to train instigators for the elections. The West will also try to introduce its agents of influence into representative bodies," he wrote on Telegram.
Piskaryov pointed out that online training courses for such agents were offered in the West, particularly in the three Baltic nations and Germany. "A number of ‘departments’ are operating, including a department for the training of self-nominated ‘candidates,’ that is, those who will be promoted in election campaigns to government agencies. There is also a department of ‘voters’ and ‘observers.’ They are being taught the skills and methods of staging acts of provocation at polling stations, as well as the tactics for securing desired voting results, and other such things," the lawmaker specified.
Piskaryov noted that "thousands of people underwent training in Latvia alone" in the past several years, "most of whom live in Russia," while some lecturers at those courses were designated as foreign agents in Russia. "We are working closely with law enforcement agencies in this regard. We are confident that no matter how hard our opponents try, another attempt to interfere in our country’s electoral affairs will be foiled, as has happened before," the senior lawmaker stressed.

2026-02-13 11:23:23 GMT
https://tass.com/politics/2086377

MOSCOW, February 13. /TASS/.

MOSCOW, February 13. /TASS/. A new round of negotiations between Russia, the United States, and Ukraine will take place in Geneva, with the Russian delegation to be led by Russian Presidential Aide Vladimir Medinsky, Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov announced.

US patience running low as Zelensky tries to gain time — Russian senator
2026-02-13 11:17:01 GMT
https://tass.com/politics/2086371

GENICHESK, February 13. /TASS/. Kiev is trying to gain time or money as it alternates between refusing to cede land and agreeing to such a scenario, but the United States is running out of patience, senator Igor Kastyukevich from the Kherson Region told TASS.
"[Ukraine's Vladimir] Zelensky is playing the shell game with [US President Donald] Trump in a silly assumption that he will manage to buy time or money. But the Kiev regime will be given neither of the two options," he opined. "Territorial issues have been discussed from the very beginning. And the American negotiators' patience dwindles every time Zelensky says 'We will not cede Donbass and Novorossiya'. And it will be the last straw one day when the situation for the Kiev regime and personally for Zelensky gets much worse. A no-return point will be behind them. Being aware of that, Zelensky is balancing between the 'we will cede land' and 'we refuse to cede land' rhetoric," the senator continued.
The authorities in Kiev repeatedly floated the idea of holding a referendum or a presidential election before they backtracked on those plans, citing a lack of sufficient funds to hold them, Kastyukevich maintained. "One thing is clear: Zelensky has already realized that his infamous rule is coming to an end. Therefore, he is simply buying time, saying whatever they want to hear," he added.
Meanwhile, people in Donbass and Novorossiya have already made their choice, the senior Russian lawmaker noted. "A choice the legitimacy of which has been recognized, including by international observers. And the American side is well aware of that," he specified.
Earlier, Zelensky's aides told The Atlantic in an interview that Kiev may agree to withdraw its forces from Donbass. Ukraine may be ready to "accept the hardest concession of all," they said. To legitimize a troop withdrawal from Donbass, they are weighing holding a referendum this spring.

Palestinians race to rescue Gaza’s history after Israel’s offensive
2026-02-13 09:02:55 GMT
https://www.dailysabah.com/world/asia-pacific/palestinians-race-to-rescue-gazas-history-after-israels-offensive

Muneer Elbaz still remembers walking hand in hand with his family through Gaza’s old markets, the call to prayer rising from the Great Omari Mosque as it has for centuries.
“These were the best days,” he said, recalling evenings when the mosque’s courtyard filled with worshippers and the surrounding alleys buzzed with traders. “This place transports us from one era to another.”
Today, the mosque lies scarred and partially collapsed, its prayer hall roof caved in, its minaret damaged, its stones scattered. For Elbaz, a Palestinian heritage consultant now involved in recovery efforts, the destruction feels like “a tree uprooted from the land.”
The devastation is part of a wider toll.
Israel’s military campaign in Gaza, launched following Hamas' Oct. 7 incursion into southern Israel that killed about 1,200 people and took 251 hostages, has killed more than 72,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry.
Entire families have been wiped out. Neighborhoods flattened.
Along with lives and homes, pieces of Gaza’s long and layered history have been shattered.
The Omari Mosque stands on ground that mirrors Gaza’s past. A Byzantine church once occupied the site. In the seventh century, a mosque was built there and named for Islam’s second caliph.
During the Crusades, it was converted into a cathedral, then restored as a mosque after the Crusaders were expelled. It was shelled by British forces during World War I and rebuilt again.
Stephennie Mulder, an associate professor of Islamic art at the University of Texas at Austin, said the building embodied Gaza’s role as a crossroads of trade routes, armies and religions.
“For many Gazans, the Omari mosque stood as a beloved symbol of multiplicity, resilience and persistence,” she said.
That symbolism has taken a direct hit.
The Israeli military said it struck a Hamas “terror tunnel” at the mosque. It provided no public evidence.
An independent commission established by the U.N. Human Rights Council said it was not aware of evidence of a tunnel shaft there and added that even the presence of a legitimate military target would not have justified the scale of the resulting damage.
Gaza’s endowments ministry denied the allegation.
Under international law, cultural property should not be targeted or used for military purposes. Israel says it takes the sensitivity of such sites into account and adheres to international law.
The Omari Mosque is not alone.
UNESCO, using satellite imagery, has verified damage to at least 150 heritage sites since the war began. They include religious buildings, historic houses, monuments and archaeological locations.
Among the hardest hit is the Pasha Palace, where urgent rescue work is underway. The palace once housed centuries-old artifacts. According to heritage officials, items now missing include an Ottoman-era Quranic manuscript, medieval Mamluk jewelry and fragments of a Roman sarcophagus.
The Israeli military said it struck a Hamas compound and an anti-tank missile array at the site. It did not release evidence.
The centuries-old Saint Porphyrius Church complex, which had been sheltering displaced families, was also hit early in the war. The military said it targeted a nearby Hamas command center. UNESCO assessed the church as moderately damaged.
Some landmarks appear to have escaped major harm. UNESCO reported no evidence of damage at the Saint Hilarion Monastery, which dates to the fourth century.
Issam Juha, co-director of the Centre for Cultural Heritage Preservation in the West Bank, said the destruction strikes at more than stone and mortar.
“These sites solidify the presence of the Palestinian people on this land,” he said. “They represent the continuity of their cultural identity.”
A U.S.-brokered cease-fire in October halted most large-scale fighting. It set no timeline for reconstruction. Gaza’s broader recovery remains uncertain, especially if Israel maintains the blockade imposed after Hamas seized power in 2007.
At the Omari Mosque, workers now fill wheelbarrows with debris beneath the shadow of a fractured minaret. Engineers say the prayer hall can be rebuilt if construction materials are allowed in. For now, teams sift through rubble, cataloging and storing salvaged stones to prevent further loss.
The coming Ramadan will underscore the absence. In previous years, thousands packed the mosque for evening prayers in a festive atmosphere. This year, a large tent has been erected nearby.
For 62-year-old Mohammad Shareef, the mosque was a second home. He studied for exams there as a boy, prayed beside his father and later brought his own children.
“We were raised in it and around it,” he said, his voice breaking. “For the people of Gaza, this is their history.”
Before the cease-fire, Elbaz said survival left little room for mourning.
“What would you begin to cry over?” he asked. “The mosques, your home, your children’s schools, the streets?”
Now, in quieter moments away from his children, he allows himself to grieve.
“Gaza is our mother,” he said. “We have memories everywhere. In this tree, this flower, this garden and this mosque. Yes, we cry over every part of Gaza.”
